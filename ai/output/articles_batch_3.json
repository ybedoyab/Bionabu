    "abstract": "Abstract Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Long-duration space travel has been associated with a number of human health risk factors, such as space radiation, microgravity, isolation, and hypoxia [1,2,3,4]. It is now thought that the two main factors driving the majority of the health risks are space radiation and microgravity, with space radiation being the main component for health risk for space missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) [5,6,7,8,9,10]. The different organs and related health issues potentially induced by these two aspects of the space environment are continuously studied and updated. Space radiation observed on the International Space Station (ISS) is quite different from ionizing radiation found on Earth and is composed primarily of protons (both high and low energy) and HZE ions (high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) ions). Protons are characterized by low linear energy transfer (LET) and HZE by high LET, as opposed to the low LET radiation (x-, β-, or γ-rays) to which humans are commonly exposed to on Earth [1,3,10,11,12,13]. HZE ions are positively charged and are the highly ionizing components of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) which originate outside of the solar system. The strong carcinogenic potential of HZE [14] has been a concern for many decades and has been considered the biggest risk factor for human health in missions beyond LEO [13,15]. In contrast, in LEO, where the ISS is located, the radiation dose from HZE is reduced due to the protection provided by the Earth’s magnetosphere, and is roughly equal to the dose from low-energy protons trapped in the inner radiation belt [13,16]. Most of the ISS orbit lies inside the radiation belts; the majority of the dose is from passages through the South Atlantic Anomaly, where the inner belt drops down to ISS altitudes. An additional risk for missions beyond LEO is from acute doses of high-energy protons from periodic solar particle events (SPEs) [14]. Data on the biological effects of space radiation has been obtained sporadically in true space conditions from samples flown in LEO (ISS, Space Shuttle, Mir Space Station, satellites carrying biology payloads). The majority of our data has been generated by simulating space radiation on Earth using specific HZE ions or protons at facilities such as the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Simulated space radiation ground experiments have typically focused a lot more on HZE, reflecting the space radiation environment encountered in a long-duration beyond LEO mission [17]. To this day, a variety of results indicates that space radiation can increased cancer risk as well as contribute to diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), muscle degeneration, bone loss, and cardiovascular disease [10,15]. Radiation-induced late cardiovascular disease in astronauts is one increasingly prominent concern [7,18,19,20]. Although many experiments using low-LET radiation have been conducted to show damage to the microvasculature, HZE particle data are limited, and the implications for disease risk need more study. There have been even fewer ground-based studies of the synergistic effects of space radiation and microgravity, which more closely mimic the environment in space. Data from atomic bomb survivors, albeit with different types of radiation, on increased incidence of cardiovascular disease have shown long-lasting effects decades after radiation exposure impacting increased ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and stroke with doses as low as 2 Gy [21,22,23]. Animal and cell culture models have been used to simulate HZE particle and proton radiation and have shown that low doses of high-LET radiation can drastically affect the cardiovascular system [7,20,24,25,26,27,28]. Specifically, one experiment showed that mice exposed to 0.1 Gy of 150 MeV protons or 0.5 Gy of 600 MeV/n iron ions (56Fe) experienced large changes in cardiac DNA methylation with potential impacts including heart failure and cardiomyopathy [29]. 56Fe is the most predominant HZE particle in the GCRs, and is a commonly used surrogate for GCR HZE. Other experiments have shown that cells and animal models exposed to proton and HZE radiation increase DNA oxidation, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular damage [24,27,28,30]. Although these experiments and data have contributed to the overall knowledge of cardiovascular disease risk from space travel, there are many potential confounding factors besides space radiation (e.g., stress, hypoxia, microgravity). Therefore, our overall understanding of the contribution of space radiation in cardiovascular disease risk and their mechanisms remain an open question. To further pursue the cardiovascular impact due to space radiation we utilized publicly available transcriptomic data that is available on NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov) [17] related to cardiovascular disease and the space environment. NASA’s GeneLab platform is a resource available to the public that has provided the first comprehensive omics database related to space. Due to the limited omics data available related to space radiation and cardiovascular disease, we analyzed two datasets from ground experiments designed to characterize the long-term impact following space irradiation (protons and 56Fe) on cardiomyocytes for five different time-points up to 28 days after irradiation and one spaceflight experiment studying the impact of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultivated in the space environment on the ISS for seven days. Two components that make up the cardiac tissue are cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and both cell types are heavily involved with cardiac remodeling and regeneration [31]. Although there are more components to the cardiac tissue, from the datasets available from the GeneLab related to the cardiovascular system, we will only focus on these components. Using these datasets, we hypothesized that there are common long-term molecules and pathways modulating the cardiovascular system due to radiation effects during spaceflight. Using a systems biology approach, we were able to suggest a novel mechanism through the FYN pathway [32,33,34,35] that the cardiovascular system uses to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels when exposed to space radiation. Briefly, FYN is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases that has been previously shown to be heavily involved with the cardiovascular system through cardiomyocyte remodeling [36,37] and also leads to activation due to ROS [32,33,38,39]. In addition to FYN’s involvement with the cardiovascular system, it has also been reported to be a tumor suppressor [40,41], a key player in controlling immune receptor signaling status and inflammation [42], and has been shown to affect myelination of the central nervous system through crosstalk with Erk1/2 signaling [43]. For our findings, although the ROS levels are reduced through Fyn signaling, we show the potential of other pathways that will still contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in the space environment such as increased inflammation. In addition, we are able to suggest that HUVEC cells grown on the ISS in LEO show a molecular response that is in agreement with responses observed on Earth with simulated protons but with less commonality with heavier HZE ions, as one would expect from the predominance of protons found in LEO space radiation. This finding is critical as it highlights the relevance of simulated space radiation experiments conducted on Earth, as they are shown here as able to recapitulate what is observed in space. This work illustrates the power of unbiased omics analysis and how the GeneLab database has become an essential tool to better characterize the response of a life to space environment. More generally, these novel findings have potential to contribute to current cardiovascular risk models for spaceflight.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Datasets Utilized from the GeneLab Platform All data used for this manuscript were obtained from GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov). The following datasets were used: GLDS-52, -109, and -117. Spaceflight mission and ground radiation experimental details for each dataset such as, the handling of the cells, RNA extraction, and raw data pertaining to the microarray can be found in the GeneLab database. Briefly, we used two ground studies utilizing cardiomyocytes isolated from 8 to 9 months old male C57BL/6NT mice that have been whole-body irradiated with either one acute dose of 900 mGy protons at 1 GeV (GLDS-117) or 150 mGy of iron ions (56Fe) at 1 GeV/n (GLDS-109) and 5 time-points up to 28 days were collected after irradiation [45]. For protons, the following time-points were used for transcriptomic analysis: 1 day (n = 2), 3 days (n = 3), 5 days (n = 2), 12 days (n = 2), and 26 days (n = 2). For 56Fe, the following time-points were used for transcriptomic analysis: 1 day (n = 3), 3 days (n = 3), 7 days (n = 2), 14 days (n = 2), and 28 days (n = 2). For both experiments cardiomyocytes were also isolated from 0 Gy sham at the following time-points and data was pooled between all time-points for the controls: 1 day (n = 2) and 3 days (n = 1). All cardiomyocytes were isolated by microdissection from tissue dissections in order to remove other cell types. One spaceflight study was used that flew HUVECs to the ISS and the cells were exposed to space environment in vitro under standard conditions for 7 days before the cells were preserved in RNAlater [44]. The ground controls used for this study are 1 × g controls that were grown on Earth with identical conditions compared to the cells on the ISS. 4.2. Transcriptomic Analysis The available transcriptomic data for tissues from GLDS-52, -109, and -117 datasets were previously performed on different versions of Affymetrix platforms. Due to the incompatibility and batch issues of processed data from these different platforms, all datasets were analyzed independently and the processed data was compared across all tissues. Datasets were background adjusted and quantile normalized using RMAExpress [79]. The probes from the pre-processed data were median collapsed using GenePattern [80]. All the data for each tissue/dataset was imported into MultiExperiment Viewer [81] and statistically significant genes was determined by ANOVA analysis between all conditions for GLDS-109 and -117, and a p-value ≤ 0.05 and t-test with a p-value for GLDS-52. The number of significant genes was used for the rest the analysis for the higher-order analysis. Pathway analysis and subsequent predictions in each tissue were done using the statistically significant genes with a fold-change ≥1.2 (or ≤−1.2) comparing flight conditions versus ground controls or irradiated samples vs. unirradiated samples for ground experiments. Using a 1.2-fold-change cutoff allowed us to determine the impact of how major pathways were being regulated that would not be apparent with larger fold-change cutoffs. It was shown in the literature that larger fold-change values used for Omics data will significantly reduce useful biological data that becomes apparent when using lower fold-change cutoffs [82,83]. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems) was used to predict statistically significant activation or inhibition of upstream regulators, canonical pathways, biofunctions, and toxic functions using activation Z-score statistics (≥2, activated or ≤−2, inhibited) [84]. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was done using the C2, C5, and Hallmarks gene sets with a FDR ≤ 0.05 from the entire list of genes and additional leading edge analysis was performed as described by Subramanian et al. [46]. All heat maps and principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated using packages available through R (pheatmap for heat maps and scatterplot3d for PCA plots). 4.3. Determination of Key Genes/Drivers We used a previously established unbiased systems biology method to determine key genes/drivers [54,56,57,59,60] for each tissue. Briefly, the standard method we have developed in the past to determine key genes was done by determining the overlapping genes involved in the predictions made through IPA’s upstream regulators, canonical pathways, biofunctions, and GSEA gene sets (C2, C5, and Hallmarks gene sets). The common genes identified through these statistically significant predictions can be thought of as the central drivers for the experiment being studied, since the absence of the genes will make these predictions null. In some cases, these overlaps result in either no key genes or a very low number of genes. If this occurs, we adjust the pathway predictions involved with the gene overlaps. For the key genes determined here, we were forced to show the overlapping genes that were only involved with the GSEA Hallmarks Gene Set analysis with the IPA predictions. To determine the key gene, which has the highest number of connections and can be thought of as the central hub for the set of key genes, we utilized IPA to define the total number of connections between all the key genes. Next, we plotted the genes using the radial plot tool which places the most connected gene in the center of the plot. Previous work involving similar statistically identified key genes provided experimental validation for this methodology using Western blots, qPCR, and other functional assays [56,60]. 4.4. MicroRNA (miRNA) Predictions Through the use of a Cytoscape [70] plug-in called ClueGo [71], we were able to predict miRNAs based on the key genes determined. This involved entering all key genes determined in ClueGo and allowing the software to determine the top 30 miRNAs that were significantly regulated and connected to the key genes. No directionality of the key genes was required for the results.",

Global Analysis of Simulated Space Radiation Ground Experiments Compared to Spaceflight Samples To study the impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system we utilized three GeneLab datasets (GLDS-52, -117, and -109). As described in detail in the methods, two datasets were focused on simulated space radiation studies performed on the ground. More specifically, male C57BL/6 mice received either an acute whole-body irradiation of 900 mGy proton at 1 GeV (GLDS-117) or 150 mGy 56Fe at 1 GeV/n (GLDS-109). Subsequently, cardiomyocytes were isolated and fixed from mice sacrificed at five different time-points post-irradiation. Unfortunately, 0 Gy control for the original study was acquired only at the first time-point (i.e., day 1). Although this is not the most optimal setup for these types of experiments, we will show that former datasets from GeneLab without the desired experimental setup can still produce meaningful results to guide space biology research. To test if simulated space radiation studies relate to the space environment, we also analyzed a spaceflight study (GLDS-52) which cultivated HUVECs on the ISS for 7 days before the cells were fixed. The HUVEC controls for the GLDS-52 datasets were cultured for the same length and methodology as the samples flown on the ISS, but were done on Earth [44]. Although all datasets utilized for this analysis were from microarray platforms, due to the incompatibility and batch effects that arise between different experiments, we had to analyze each dataset separately. We used either one-way ANOVA analysis for the simulated space radiation studies (all time-points were used to determine the significant genes) or t-test analysis with a p-value ≤ 0.05 for the spaceflight study. We produced the following statistically significant genes for each condition: for the proton study (GLDS-117) there were 2540 significantly regulated genes, for the 56Fe study (GLDS-109) there were 5554 significantly regulated genes, and for the spaceflight study (GLDS-52) there were 823 significantly regulated genes. We also checked the number of genes that would be produced with more stringent statistics using the adjusted Bonferroni method for a false discovery rate (FDR) of both ≤0.05 and 0.10. This approach produced the following number of genes for each condition: for the proton study (GLDS-117) there were 2 or 6 significantly regulated genes with either FDR ≤ 0.05 or 0.10, for the 56Fe study (GLDS-109) there were 7 or 12 significantly regulated genes with either FDR ≤ 0.05 or 0.10, and for the spaceflight study (GLDS-52) there were no significantly regulated genes with either FDR cutoff. Note that our results do not agree with the original analysis published on the ground studies data [45]. Coleman et al. reported 5220 significant genes for 56Fe and 1651 significant genes for proton datasets using a p-value cutoff of 0.05 using one-way ANOVA analysis. Similarly, they reported 1538 significant genes using FDR < 0.10 with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. We were unable to reproduce the reported number of genes following the same procedure. Such discrepancy illustrates the importance of standard processing pipeline for analysis, as the protocol reported in Coleman et al. was not sufficient to allow reproducibility. One must note here that microarray analysis is highly sensitive in the way one normalizes data, with many available methods. For this reason, the Genelab team has established standardized processing workflows for all raw omics data (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects). These pipelines were obtained as a consensus between more than 100 scientists who have joined the GeneLab Analysis Working Group (AWG) and covered transcriptomics (RNAseq and microarray), as well as metagenomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The GeneLab team is in the process of documenting all these pipelines and making them available progressively online via the GeneLab toolshed (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/glxy-sso-login/). For the two ground studies presented in this manuscript, the low number of replicates were incompatible with the stringent statistical method we recommend for GeneLab microarray data. Therefore, we could not utilize it here as it would not produce enough significant genes for a meta-analysis of this kind. We used instead a statistically acceptable but less stringent method (see Materials and Methods). We recommend the readers to go to the GeneLab toolshed for the latest recommended approach. The global differences between all the time-points and conditions were assessed for each dataset (Figure 1). Using principal component analysis (PCA), we were able to distinguish global differences between the controls and the experimental groups (Figure 1A–C). Overall for both proton and 56Fe ion irradiation, the 0 Gy control samples were clustered separately from the rest of the irradiated samples (Figure 1A,B). It is interesting to note that the samples that produced the greatest separation were the cardiomyocytes isolated at the longest time-points (either 26 or 28 days) after irradiation. This is apparent in the principle component 2 (PC2) axis for protons (Figure 1A) and for 56Fe ions these points are clustering further apart in the negative PC1 axis from all other samples. This could be interpreted as space radiation (i.e., protons and 56Fe) producing long-lasting impact on the biology with a progressive response overtime. However, we cannot say for certain as there was no 0 Gy control done for the 26 day time-point. In contrast, when comparing spaceflight to ground controls for the HUVECs cultivated on the ISS (Figure 1C), we observed a much cleaner separation between the groups on the PCA plot. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Global transcriptome analysis comparing experimental conditions to the controls for ground space radiation experiments and spaceflight experiment. The datasets analyzed were GeneLab Dataset (GLDS)-117 for cardiomyocytes isolated from C57BL/6 irradiated with whole body 900 mGy of proton at 1 GeV, GLDS-109 for cardiomyocytes isolated from C57BL/6 irradiated with whole body 150 mGy of 56Fe at 1 GeV/n, and GLDS-52 for Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) incubated on the International Space Station (ISS) for 7 days (estimated dose 1.5 mGy, see Section 2.2). (A–C) Principal component analysis (PCA) of all conditions for each dataset for genes. The percentage variance is shown for each principal component (PC) in parenthesis next to the PC axis. (D–F) Heat maps representing hierarchical clustering of significantly regulated genes by complete linkage and Euclidean distance calculation for datasets and conditions.When considering only the significantly regulated genes we see more refined separation between the different experimental groups (Figure 1D–F). For the significantly regulated genes, the 0 Gy controls in general were clustered independently from the rest of the irradiated samples with what appears to be a time dependence with the gene signature changing for each timepoint after the acute dose. There also was a distinct group of genes that were oppositely regulated for HUVECs flown in space compared to the ground controls. This data indicates that there is a distinct gene signature associated with space radiation and the impact of one acute dose can potentially have long-lasting effects on the cardiovascular system. 2.2. Dose Received by HUVECs Flown in Space The data are from the European Space Agency-Integrated Experiment (ESA-SPHINX) experiment (10/31/10–11/6/10) [44]. The cells were launched to the ISS on a Russian Progress supply vehicle, cultured for 7 days in the KUBIK incubator on the European Space Agency (ESA) Columbus module, and then fixed. To be able to compare the dose received on the ISS to the simulated radiation ground studies, we obtained dose data from a detector located on the Columbus. (Data provided kindly by T. Berger from the German Aerospace Center (DLR)). The measured dose rate was almost constant throughout the experiment with an average of 220.43 µGy/day (in water) with a standard deviation of 1.90 µGy/day (in water) measured over the period of the experiment (Data provided kindly by T. Berger from the DLR and additional details can be found in the original publication [44]). The total dose was 1.544 mGy (in water) with the dose equivalent to 3.7 mSv, of which 58% was from high-energy protons and other GCR ions, and 42% from low-energy protons in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The actual dose to the samples was probably somewhat lower, as they were shielded by the incubator. Here it is important to make the distinction between particle energy and LET, which is essentially energy loss per unit path length and is proportional to the square of the charge. Linear energy transfer (LET) is a measure of how ionizing a particle is; because they are singly charged, both high- and low-energy protons are relatively low LET. 2.3. Common Pathways between Simulated Space Radiation and Spaceflight Samples To fully understand the specific and long-lasting effects of space radiation on biology, we have to understand the general pathways that are being regulated. We first utilized gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [46] to determine significant pathways being regulated for each condition with an FDR ≤ 0.05. Using the Hallmarks (a more generalized pathway database, see Figure 2) and Reactome (Figure 3) gene sets for GSEA, we were able to identify key pathways that are commonly being regulated for all ground controls compared to the spaceflight samples or irradiated samples. We first observed that the majority of pathways for most time-points after radiation for the cardiomyocytes that were commonly regulated with the HUVEC spaceflight samples were downregulated (with the exception of one time-point at 1 day for samples irradiated with protons for some nodes) (Figure 2A). The time-points and samples were associated with each wedge in the node as displayed in the figure legend for Figure 2. Specifically, ROS pathways were surprisingly downregulated (indicating a decrease in ROS production) for the majority of the conditions, which suggests an immediate and persistent impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, which is also observed on flight samples as well. The other pathways that were downregulated have been shown from the literature to be connected to the ROS pathway. For example, fatty acid metabolism, which is one of the primary sources of energy for cardiac muscle, has a direct link to ROS formation and regulation through the mitochondria (Figure 2) [47]. It is interesting to note that it has been reported that the ROS production from the mitochondria is an important mechanism of how ROS impacts cardiac tissue [48]. Knocking out MYC has been shown to cause low levels of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 2 and Figure 3) [49]. It is known that oxidative phosphorylation will produce ROS [50] and with the downregulation of MYC, this can potentially reduce oxidative phosphorylation levels which in turn will reduce ROS. Reactive oxygen species have also been shown to promote adipogenesis [51] and will be involved with heme metabolism (Figure 2) [52]. We also observed an overall downregulation of cell cycle pathways (Figure 3). We believe that this might be potentially due to the downregulation of ROS signaling, since it has been previously shown that ROS can heavily influence the cell cycle [53]. The downregulation of ROS seems to also lead to overall downregulation of cell cycle pathways (Figure 3). In general, ROS have been shown to be critically involved with the development of cardiovascular disease [52]. Through all these related downregulated pathways, we show that ROS potentially have long-lasting (Figure 2) effects directly linked to the space environment on the cardiovascular systems. On the other hand, surprisingly DNA repair hallmarks were downregulated for all irradiated samples at any time-point, whereas it was upregulated in space (Figure 2, top right panel). This result is unexpected as DNA repair is definitely expected early after exposure and suggests the cardiac response is quite different. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) emphasizing the hallmark gene sets commonly enriched in cardiomyocytes of irradiated animals or HUVECs flown in space. (A) Common Hallmark gene sets enriched in spaceflight samples and irradiated samples. The majority of these datasets are downregulated. (B) Hallmark gene sets that are oppositely regulated between all irradiated samples and the spaceflight samples. (C) Hallmark gene sets commonly enriched in cardiomyocytes of animals irradiated with 1 GeV/n proton or HUVECs flown in space. Note, most of them are upregulated. (D) Hallmark gene sets commonly enriched in cardiomyocytes of animals irradiated with 1 GeV/n 56Fe or HUVECs flown in space. Note, most of them are downregulated for 56Fe and spaceflight samples. Note: all samples were comparing experimental conditions with the respective controls. For figures (C,D), the common wedges are highlighted in yellow outline. The significant gene sets were determined with false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05. The legend in the middle of the figure displays what each component/wedge of the nodes represent. Each node contains 11 wedges for each condition and the color of each wedge indicates if the gene set is downregulated (blue) or upregulated (red). The shade of the color indicates the degree of regulation. Each node represents one gene set and the size of the node indicates the number of genes involved with the predictions. Pathways with more than one node are grouped together in the black boxes under each major category.Figure 3. Open in a new tab Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with the Reactome gene sets comparing different time-points after irradiation with either protons or 56Fe with the HUVECs flown in the space. All samples were comparing experimental conditions with the respective controls. The significant gene sets were determined with FDR ≤ 0.05. Each node represents one gene set and the size of the node indicates the number of genes involved with the predictions. Each node contains 11 wedges for each condition and the color of each wedge indicates if the gene set is downregulated (blue) or upregulated (red). The shade of the color indicates degree of regulation. 2.4. The Biological Pathways Elicited by Protons Have Stronger Overlap with Spaceflight Samples Than Those Elicited by 56Fe Ions To test if one type of space radiation has a predominant effect on a spaceflight sample, one can compare the predicted pathways from one radiation condition alone with spaceflight samples. Figure 2C shows that the majority of pathways specifically in common with protons and spaceflight were upregulated, while Figure 2D shows the 56Fe component in common with spaceflight was downregulated. TGFβ signaling has been shown in the past to be a key player with regulating the overall system with proton irradiation (Figure 2) [11,54,55]. In order to further validate these results, we use another functional prediction tool, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), to predict the involvement of specific upstream regulators, biofunctions, and canonical pathways in the various datasets (Figure 4A–C). In general, the overall pathways and functions overlap with the GSEA findings. For example, we observed in the upstream regulator predictions that MYC is downregulated for the majority for the pathways. We also observed that the following upstream regulators were predicted to activate or inhibit in the same directions as the GSEA predictions: p53, HIF1A, IL2, and IL6. The mTOR signaling canonical pathway also overlaps with the GSEA predictions. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Predicted functions and upstream regulators affected by space radiation for HUVECs exposed to the space environment and cardiomyocytes from mice exposed to protons and 56Fe ion irradiation with multiple time-points after irradiation. The predicted statistically significant biofunctions (A), upstream regulators (B), and canonical pathways (C), determined through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) from data for each individual dataset using activation Z-score statistics. Heat map representation of the activation Z-score values (red = positive activation Z-score for activation and blue = negative activation Z-score for inhibition) with hierarchical clustering by complete linkage and Euclidean distance calculation for datasets and conditions were used to display the data. The prevalence of change (or % of dataset) on the left side of the heat maps represents how common that factor is throughout all datasets/tissues with the darkest color representing factors with the highest degree in common. Time after irradiation, cell type, and experiment is color coded on the top of the heat maps. For all heat maps we are only showing the prevalence of change for the functions associated with the top 4 (i.e., a prevalence of change score ≥ 7). Global clustering of the biofunctions (D), upstream regulators (E), and canonical pathways (F) for all samples are shown by principal component analysis (PCA). For the PCA plots we used all functions for each datapoint regardless of the prevalence of change score.We were interested in determining how these overall functions from the ground experiments will group with the spaceflight samples. Using the activation Z-scores from the IPA results we were able to provide direct comparisons between all the samples, which we were not able to perform with the expression values due to the incompatibility of the microarray outputs. Using principal component analysis on Z-scores, we show that all cardiomyocyte samples irradiated with protons have biofunctions, upstream regulators and canonical pathways which cluster closely to the spaceflight samples (Figure 4D–F). In contrast, IPA functional predictions for cardiomyocytes from mice irradiated with 56Fe are nicely grouped together for three of the time-points (1 day, 3 days, and 14 days), while 7 days and 28 days seem to behave as outliers when compared to the other datasets. Overall, all time-points for 56Fe were clearly separated from the spaceflight and proton irradiated samples in the PC1 axis. Since the appropriate controls were not used for these datasets by the original investigators, we felt it appropriate to provide the potential that these two time-points may be outliers and a person may consider to remove these points from additional analysis. It is important to demonstrate how less than ideal GeneLab datasets can still have potential to provide meaningful results. This result is also evident on Figure 4A–C, where most predicted IPA functions have negative Z-scores for 3 out of 5 56Fe time-points, whereas all proton time-points and flight samples show positive Z-scores (red). These results indicate that the overall functional impact on samples caused by space radiation on the ISS are due to protons rather than HZE ions. In the past it has been difficult to determine which component of the ions in space will impact samples on the ISS. Previous models have predicted that due to SPEs and the protection of the magnetosphere around the Earth from HZE ions, astronauts should be mainly exposed to protons at LEO [2,10,13,15,16]. To our knowledge this is the first time suggesting from data utilized from the GeneLab that at LEO, protons will be the majority of ions that samples are exposed to. This data can provide a contribution to relating the biology being observed on the ISS to the correct type of irradiation that samples are exposed to. 2.5. Key Driving Genes Provide Direct Connection to ROS for Space Radiation Impact on the Cardiovascular System To determine the key driving genes in an unbiased methodology we used an established systems biology approach that identifies the key genes involved in explaining the predicted biological functions changed by a specific treatment [54,55,56,57,58,59,60]. Our data has shown potential long-lasting impact of cardiomyocytes when comparing to the basal 1 day controls. Due to the original study design we did not have the optimal controls to compare to every time-point, but since there are relevant biological changes occurring when compared to the basal (1 day) ground controls, we hypothesis that there will be consistent long-lasting impact on cardiomyocytes isolated from mice irradiated with protons and 56Fe ion irradiation. In addition, this will also show how to creatively utilize less than ideal GeneLab datasets to generate meaningful biology to guide future research. For the key gene analysis, we pooled all irradiated time-points together to determine the common key driving genes for each type of radiation. Since we also observed that the 7 day and 28 day time-points for 56Fe vs. the control were acting as outliers (Figure 4D–F), we performed an additional key genes analysis excluding those time-points. This will only affect the key genes associated with 56Fe. This is an essential strategy to better identify the key genes specific to space radiation, which are able to relate back to the spaceflight data. Utilizing the unbiased methodology described in the methods and further explained previously [54,55,56,57], we found utilizing all time-points nine persistent key genes for cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that received 150 mGy 56Fe and seven persistent key genes for cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that received 900 mGy protons. From the HUVECs flown on the ISS for seven days, we found nine key genes (Figure 5A). When excluding the outlier time-points for 56Fe (7 and 28 days), we obtain 85 key genes for cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that received 150 mGy 56Fe (Figure 5B). We were able to determine the connectivity of these key genes between the experiments through network analysis. This allowed us to find potential relationships with how the ground studies relate to the spaceflight experiments, and the central hubs or the most connected key genes that might be responsible for space radiation effects on the cardiovascular system. We found that the key/driving genes that are the central hubs are: FYN, LCK, AKT1 being upregulated and LYN and FOS being downregulated with FYN being the overall central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation (Figure 5A). It is worth noting the activation of FYN is a key event which prevents cardiac cell death and ROS production [35,36]. Interestingly it is known that LCK, LYN, and FYN are part of the SRC-family kinases (SFKs) [37,61,62,63] and have been associated with various aspects of cardiovascular disease [62,64,65,66,67]. In addition, FYN and AKT1 are shown to be pivotal with angiogenic functions and the relation to cardiovascular disease [68,69]. Lastly, utilizing Z-scores through IPA we were able to show that these key genes provide a predicted inhibition of cell death of cardiomyocytes, congenital heart disease, and cardiac fibrillation (Figure 5). There also is a predicted inflammation of the organs which can cause negative health risk. Through an unbiased methodology we were able to show a link of key driving genes between ground and spaceflight studies that potential will have direct impact on the cardiovascular system. Figure 5. Open in a new tab The key driving genes associated with space radiation and the predicted functions that these genes will affect. A circular network created with IPA is utilized connecting all the key genes from each experimental condition (i.e., common key genes for all time-points for both cardiomyocytes from mice irradiated with either 150 mGy 56Fe or 900 mGy protons compared to 0 Gy controls and HUVECs flown in on the ISS for 7 days compared to the ground control). The color of the gene represents whether the gene is upregulated (red) or downregulated (green) with the shade signifying the degree of regulation. (A) The network of key genes done with analysis using all time-points and samples. (B) The network of key genes for analysis done with all time-points except for 7 and 28 days for 56Fe vs Ctrl. For this analysis there were three key genes that overlapped between the cardiomyocytes irradiated with protons and 56Fe (CD4, CD3G, and LCK). These were oppositely regulated between the two irradiation conditions and the colors in the top half indicate the gene expression for protons and the bottom indicates the gene expression for 56Fe. The different line colors represent the predicted effect of each gene on each other. Predicted functional impact of the key genes were determined using IPA which allowed us to predict whether cardiac related functions were either inhibited (blue) or activated (orange). The identification of the symbols for each gene is shown on the bottom of the figure.For the key genes analysis excluding the two outlier points (Figure 5B), since there were more key genes for 56Fe, additional predictions can be made for the functions related to cardiovascular system. For those key genes we show that in addition the functional impact described above, we also observe a predicted activation for damage to the heart. This can be attributed to potential damage caused by the key genes associated with 56Fe to promote damage to the heart tissue. In addition, we also observe three genes that overlap between the cardiomyocytes irradiation with protons and 56Fe: CD4, CD3G, and LCK. These genes are shown to be oppositely regulated between the irradiation conditions that can indicate potential different functional impact that can occur with the different ions. Since we are indicating that the majority of the ions that are affecting samples at LEO are protons (Figure 4D–F), for our interpretation of the overall data we will consider the upregulation of these three genes associated with proton irradiation to be the impact it will have on the samples. 2.6. Predicted Circulating miRNA Signature Associated with Space Radiation Cardiovascular Risk We recently predicted a microRNA (miRNA) signature that was associated with microgravity and potential the space environment [54]. Utilizing a Cytoscape [70] plugin referred to as ClueGo [71], we were able to predict the top 30 miRNAs associated with the key genes (Figure 6). We believe that these miRNAs are associated with cardiovascular risk associated with space radiation. Interestingly, from an unbiased determination of the miRNAs, many of the predicted miRNAs have previously been associated with cardiovascular disease. For example 17 out of the 30 miRNAs predicted (miR-15a-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-29b-3p, miR-101-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-153, miR-185-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-302a, miR-520d-5p let-7a, let-7b, let-7d, and let-7f-1) have previously been reported to be either up- or downregulated in human heart disease and experimental models of heart failure [72]. Further, the let-7 family and miR-125b have been specifically shown to be involved with regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis [73]. Lastly, three of the miRNAs have overlap with our recently predicted miRNAs associated with the space environment which are: miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and let-7a [54]. This can indicate from the original 13 miRNAs that comprised the systemic miRNA signature associated with spaceflight, that these three miRNAs are the components related to the cardiovascular system and space radiation.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion For long-term space travel, cardiovascular risk is a major concern to astronauts and is thought to arise from both microgravity effects and exposure to space radiation. Here we focused on how NASA’s GeneLab platform and datasets can be utilized to suggest the potential impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. Through an unbiased systems biology approach, we utilized three datasets (GLDS-52, -109, and -117) from NASA’s GeneLab platform that were related to space radiation and the cardiovascular system. Two of the datasets were from ground studies focused on cardiomyocytes that were isolated from mice after an acute whole-body dose of either 900 mGy of protons or 150 mGy of 56Fe [45]. The other study observed HUVECs for 7 days on the ISS [44]. As noted previously, the HUVECs received a total dose of 1.544 mGy, mostly from low LET protons. Through our unbiased analysis we were able to suggest: 1) that, consistent with the dose data, the majority of the radiation experienced on the ISS is potentially from protons (Figure 4D–F and Figure 2), a novel response mechanism of the cardiovascular system to prevent damage caused by space radiation through the activation of FYN. By identifying the key genes in all three datasets, we proposed that FYN is the most connected gene and is therefore the central hub for this common biological response. This leads us to hypothesize that there is a feedback loop triggered by the oxidative stress induced by space radiation that upregulates FYN which in turn reduces ROS levels, and thus ROS pathways. Interestingly, this feedback loop is accompanied with a downregulation of the DNA repair pathway in the animals but not in the HUVECs flown in space, suggesting a response that is more targeted to the cardiovascular system in a full organism (Figure 2). By reducing ROS formation, cardiomyocyte and endothelial cells are less likely to die, leading to an overall protection of the cardiovascular system (Figure 7). More specifically, FYN was found to be upregulated within each group of the key genes associated with each dataset providing an overall predicted inhibition of ROS and cell death, while causing an activation of inflammation due to space radiation. This effect was suggested to be long-term since the key factors were from common genes being regulated the same direction up to 28 days after irradiation for the ground studies. Figure 7. Open in a new tab A schematic of the mechanism involved with the space radiation impact on the cardiovascular system. We determined that through the upregulation of FYN (the determined key/central driver involved with space radiation), ROS is downregulated to protect against the upregulation due to space radiation. Although FYN is predicted to be the central player, the other key genes involved from each dataset (Figure 5) will contribute to the reduction in ROS and cell death. In addition, we also observe potential increased cardiovascular health risk due to increased predictions of inflammation. FYN, which is part of the SRC family kinases (which includes nine non-receptor tyrosine kinases discussed in the results), has been shown to be heavily involved with the cardiovascular system by decreasing ROS production and apoptosis [36]. Our analysis also agrees with what has been observed with the cardiovascular literature. It has been shown that knocking out FYN increases cardiac cell death and induces ROS production through NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4) signaling [36]. Others have shown FYN kinase inhibitors also inhibits nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) activity (which is an essential molecule for cardiac adaptive responses and protection) and enhances myocardial necrosis and death rate [39]. NRF2 is also known to be essential in sensing ROS and regulating protection against damaging changes to the redox balance [74,75]. This mechanism has been discovered to be heavily regulated by FYN activation phosphorylating NRF2 which in turn triggers a defense response to ROS [75]. Space radiation has previously been shown to induce ROS in tissue and negatively impact the host [76,77]. What is novel about our finding is that the universal ROS impact that has classically been thought to impact all tissue does not seem to fit with cells involved with the cardiovascular system. Although ROS should be initially activated in cardiovascular tissue after exposure to space radiation, this mechanism through FYN attempts to protect the cardiovascular system. As discussed above, in a normal response with other types of external damage causing oxidative stress on the cardiovascular system, it has been shown that FYN will be activated and act as a negative feedback regulator to protect the cardiac tissue [36]. This mechanism has not been previously considered as an internal protective countermeasure to the effects of space radiation on cardiac tissue. Here we propose that there is a protective negative feedback loop that allows FYN to inhibit the ROS activation that is triggered by space radiation (Figure 7). Although this seems to provide protection against a key player in space radiation damage to the cardiac tissue, other factors still seem to have a negative impact on the cardiovascular system that can increase risk of cardiovascular disease. To that end, we also observed a predicted activation of inflammation due to the key genes (Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 7). It is well known that inflammation in cardiac tissue has been associated with cardiovascular disease [78]. It has also been shown that reduction of ROS through antioxidants can potentially elevate chronic inflammation in cardiac tissue [78]. Our data suggests that although FYN might be acting as a natural antioxidant to reduce ROS effects, this mechanism might not be enough to reduce the inflammation caused by space radiation which has the potential to increase risk of cardiovascular disease. From our previous studies, we have observed that miRNAs can be a key driver in response to the damage caused by the space environment [54]. We were able to predict the top 30 miRNAs that have potential to respond to space radiation in the cardiovascular system (Figure 6). Surprisingly, 17 out 30 miRNAs predicted have been shown to be associated with heart failure and play a role in cardiovascular disease [73]. Three out of 30 miRNAs also overlap with our previously identified universal miRNA signature that we have shown to systemically impact an organism due to a space environment. This preliminary result indicates that we have potential candidates for the specific component related to the cardiac tissue and space radiation. Currently, there is a lack of information for the role miRNAs in space radiation’s effect on the cardiovascular system. Our findings warrant further investigations to determine the extent to which miRNAs impact FYN and ROS due to space radiation. We believe that the novel mechanism presented here for space radiation induced cardiovascular risk will impact the further development of space radiation risk models. We were able to directly link radiation ground studies to spaceflight and provide a rationale of how the cardiovascular system can help reduce ROS. We have shown through the power of NASA’s GeneLab platform that novel findings can be produced from existing data from former studies. By creatively combing several datasets we have potential indication of the specific space radiation component that astronauts are being exposed to at LEO on the ISS. It has been previously thought that protons comprise the majority of ions that astronauts are exposed to in LEO [16], but biological data have been lacking. Of course, further experiments have to be performed to determine whether these findings are true which can involve doing radiation ground experiments with HUVECs at 1.5 mGy (a comparable dose to the ISS for 7 days) and then once again comparing the gene expression changes to the dataset used here. The power of this type of analysis with GeneLab datasets allows for future guidance for space biology related experiments. In addition, we were able to uncover a novel mechanism underlying space radiation’s impact on the cardiovascular system. Although this study was done purely based on omics data, we believe that we have shown the power of using purely in silico methods to provide novel data. In addition, this manuscript demonstrates that GeneLab data can be utilized to give important hints to plan expensive space and accelerator experiments very carefully and not to be parsimonious when including the relevant controls and baselines. Further studies should be implemented to validate the findings reported here and potentially develop countermeasures for cardiovascular risk due spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 6387434 PMID: 30717456 Abstract Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space. Keywords: space radiation, GeneLab, cardiovascular, HUVECs, FYN, ROS, reactive oxygen species, cardiomyocytes, protons, iron, HZE irradiation1. Introduction Long-duration space travel has been associated with a number of human health risk factors, such as space radiation, microgravity, isolation, and hypoxia [1,2,3,4]. It is now thought that the two main factors driving the majority of the health risks are space radiation and microgravity, with space radiation being the main component for health risk for space missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) [5,6,7,8,9,10]. The different organs and related health issues potentially induced by these two aspects of the space environment are continuously studied and updated. Space radiation observed on the International Space Station (ISS) is quite different from ionizing radiation found on Earth and is composed primarily of protons (both high and low energy) and HZE ions (high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) ions). Protons are characterized by low linear energy transfer (LET) and HZE by high LET, as opposed to the low LET radiation (x-, β-, or γ-rays) to which humans are commonly exposed to on Earth [1,3,10,11,12,13]. HZE ions are positively charged and are the highly ionizing components of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) which originate outside of the solar system. The strong carcinogenic potential of HZE [14] has been a concern for many decades and has been considered the biggest risk factor for human health in missions beyond LEO [13,15]. In contrast, in LEO, where the ISS is located, the radiation dose from HZE is reduced due to the protection provided by the Earth’s magnetosphere, and is roughly equal to the dose from low-energy protons trapped in the inner radiation belt [13,16]. Most of the ISS orbit lies inside the radiation belts; the majority of the dose is from passages through the South Atlantic Anomaly, where the inner belt drops down to ISS altitudes. An additional risk for missions beyond LEO is from acute doses of high-energy protons from periodic solar particle events (SPEs) [14]. Data on the biological effects of space radiation has been obtained sporadically in true space conditions from samples flown in LEO (ISS, Space Shuttle, Mir Space Station, satellites carrying biology payloads). The majority of our data has been generated by simulating space radiation on Earth using specific HZE ions or protons at facilities such as the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Simulated space radiation ground experiments have typically focused a lot more on HZE, reflecting the space radiation environment encountered in a long-duration beyond LEO mission [17]. To this day, a variety of results indicates that space radiation can increased cancer risk as well as contribute to diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), muscle degeneration, bone loss, and cardiovascular disease [10,15]. Radiation-induced late cardiovascular disease in astronauts is one increasingly prominent concern [7,18,19,20]. Although many experiments using low-LET radiation have been conducted to show damage to the microvasculature, HZE particle data are limited, and the implications for disease risk need more study. There have been even fewer ground-based studies of the synergistic effects of space radiation and microgravity, which more closely mimic the environment in space. Data from atomic bomb survivors, albeit with different types of radiation, on increased incidence of cardiovascular disease have shown long-lasting effects decades after radiation exposure impacting increased ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and stroke with doses as low as 2 Gy [21,22,23]. Animal and cell culture models have been used to simulate HZE particle and proton radiation and have shown that low doses of high-LET radiation can drastically affect the cardiovascular system [7,20,24,25,26,27,28]. Specifically, one experiment showed that mice exposed to 0.1 Gy of 150 MeV protons or 0.5 Gy of 600 MeV/n iron ions (56Fe) experienced large changes in cardiac DNA methylation with potential impacts including heart failure and cardiomyopathy [29]. 56Fe is the most predominant HZE particle in the GCRs, and is a commonly used surrogate for GCR HZE. Other experiments have shown that cells and animal models exposed to proton and HZE radiation increase DNA oxidation, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular damage [24,27,28,30]. Although these experiments and data have contributed to the overall knowledge of cardiovascular disease risk from space travel, there are many potential confounding factors besides space radiation (e.g., stress, hypoxia, microgravity). Therefore, our overall understanding of the contribution of space radiation in cardiovascular disease risk and their mechanisms remain an open question. To further pursue the cardiovascular impact due to space radiation we utilized publicly available transcriptomic data that is available on NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov) [17] related to cardiovascular disease and the space environment. NASA’s GeneLab platform is a resource available to the public that has provided the first comprehensive omics database related to space. Due to the limited omics data available related to space radiation and cardiovascular disease, we analyzed two datasets from ground experiments designed to characterize the long-term impact following space irradiation (protons and 56Fe) on cardiomyocytes for five different time-points up to 28 days after irradiation and one spaceflight experiment studying the impact of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultivated in the space environment on the ISS for seven days. Two components that make up the cardiac tissue are cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and both cell types are heavily involved with cardiac remodeling and regeneration [31]. Although there are more components to the cardiac tissue, from the datasets available from the GeneLab related to the cardiovascular system, we will only focus on these components. Using these datasets, we hypothesized that there are common long-term molecules and pathways modulating the cardiovascular system due to radiation effects during spaceflight. Using a systems biology approach, we were able to suggest a novel mechanism through the FYN pathway [32,33,34,35] that the cardiovascular system uses to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels when exposed to space radiation. Briefly, FYN is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases that has been previously shown to be heavily involved with the cardiovascular system through cardiomyocyte remodeling [36,37] and also leads to activation due to ROS [32,33,38,39]. In addition to FYN’s involvement with the cardiovascular system, it has also been reported to be a tumor suppressor [40,41], a key player in controlling immune receptor signaling status and inflammation [42], and has been shown to affect myelination of the central nervous system through crosstalk with Erk1/2 signaling [43]. For our findings, although the ROS levels are reduced through Fyn signaling, we show the potential of other pathways that will still contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in the space environment such as increased inflammation. In addition, we are able to suggest that HUVEC cells grown on the ISS in LEO show a molecular response that is in agreement with responses observed on Earth with simulated protons but with less commonality with heavier HZE ions, as one would expect from the predominance of protons found in LEO space radiation. This finding is critical as it highlights the relevance of simulated space radiation experiments conducted on Earth, as they are shown here as able to recapitulate what is observed in space. This work illustrates the power of unbiased omics analysis and how the GeneLab database has become an essential tool to better characterize the response of a life to space environment. More generally, these novel findings have potential to contribute to current cardiovascular risk models for spaceflight.2. Results 2.1. Global Analysis of Simulated Space Radiation Ground Experiments Compared to Spaceflight Samples To study the impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system we utilized three GeneLab datasets (GLDS-52, -117, and -109). As described in detail in the methods, two datasets were focused on simulated space radiation studies performed on the ground. More specifically, male C57BL/6 mice received either an acute whole-body irradiation of 900 mGy proton at 1 GeV (GLDS-117) or 150 mGy 56Fe at 1 GeV/n (GLDS-109). Subsequently, cardiomyocytes were isolated and fixed from mice sacrificed at five different time-points post-irradiation. Unfortunately, 0 Gy control for the original study was acquired only at the first time-point (i.e., day 1). Although this is not the most optimal setup for these types of experiments, we will show that former datasets from GeneLab without the desired experimental setup can still produce meaningful results to guide space biology research. To test if simulated space radiation studies relate to the space environment, we also analyzed a spaceflight study (GLDS-52) which cultivated HUVECs on the ISS for 7 days before the cells were fixed. The HUVEC controls for the GLDS-52 datasets were cultured for the same length and methodology as the samples flown on the ISS, but were done on Earth [44]. Although all datasets utilized for this analysis were from microarray platforms, due to the incompatibility and batch effects that arise between different experiments, we had to analyze each dataset separately. We used either one-way ANOVA analysis for the simulated space radiation studies (all time-points were used to determine the significant genes) or t-test analysis with a p-value ≤ 0.05 for the spaceflight study. We produced the following statistically significant genes for each condition: for the proton study (GLDS-117) there were 2540 significantly regulated genes, for the 56Fe study (GLDS-109) there were 5554 significantly regulated genes, and for the spaceflight study (GLDS-52) there were 823 significantly regulated genes. We also checked the number of genes that would be produced with more stringent statistics using the adjusted Bonferroni method for a false discovery rate (FDR) of both ≤0.05 and 0.10. This approach produced the following number of genes for each condition: for the proton study (GLDS-117) there were 2 or 6 significantly regulated genes with either FDR ≤ 0.05 or 0.10, for the 56Fe study (GLDS-109) there were 7 or 12 significantly regulated genes with either FDR ≤ 0.05 or 0.10, and for the spaceflight study (GLDS-52) there were no significantly regulated genes with either FDR cutoff. Note that our results do not agree with the original analysis published on the ground studies data [45]. Coleman et al. reported 5220 significant genes for 56Fe and 1651 significant genes for proton datasets using a p-value cutoff of 0.05 using one-way ANOVA analysis. Similarly, they reported 1538 significant genes using FDR < 0.10 with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. We were unable to reproduce the reported number of genes following the same procedure. Such discrepancy illustrates the importance of standard processing pipeline for analysis, as the protocol reported in Coleman et al. was not sufficient to allow reproducibility. One must note here that microarray analysis is highly sensitive in the way one normalizes data, with many available methods. For this reason, the Genelab team has established standardized processing workflows for all raw omics data (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects). These pipelines were obtained as a consensus between more than 100 scientists who have joined the GeneLab Analysis Working Group (AWG) and covered transcriptomics (RNAseq and microarray), as well as metagenomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The GeneLab team is in the process of documenting all these pipelines and making them available progressively online via the GeneLab toolshed (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/glxy-sso-login/). For the two ground studies presented in this manuscript, the low number of replicates were incompatible with the stringent statistical method we recommend for GeneLab microarray data. Therefore, we could not utilize it here as it would not produce enough significant genes for a meta-analysis of this kind. We used instead a statistically acceptable but less stringent method (see Materials and Methods). We recommend the readers to go to the GeneLab toolshed for the latest recommended approach. The global differences between all the time-points and conditions were assessed for each dataset (Figure 1). Using principal component analysis (PCA), we were able to distinguish global differences between the controls and the experimental groups (Figure 1A–C). Overall for both proton and 56Fe ion irradiation, the 0 Gy control samples were clustered separately from the rest of the irradiated samples (Figure 1A,B). It is interesting to note that the samples that produced the greatest separation were the cardiomyocytes isolated at the longest time-points (either 26 or 28 days) after irradiation. This is apparent in the principle component 2 (PC2) axis for protons (Figure 1A) and for 56Fe ions these points are clustering further apart in the negative PC1 axis from all other samples. This could be interpreted as space radiation (i.e., protons and 56Fe) producing long-lasting impact on the biology with a progressive response overtime. However, we cannot say for certain as there was no 0 Gy control done for the 26 day time-point. In contrast, when comparing spaceflight to ground controls for the HUVECs cultivated on the ISS (Figure 1C), we observed a much cleaner separation between the groups on the PCA plot. Figure 1.

The datasets analyzed were GeneLab Dataset (GLDS)-117 for cardiomyocytes isolated from C57BL/6 irradiated with whole body 900 mGy of proton at 1 GeV, GLDS-109 for cardiomyocytes isolated from C57BL/6 irradiated with whole body 150 mGy of 56Fe at 1 GeV/n, and GLDS-52 for Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) incubated on the International Space Station (ISS) for 7 days (estimated dose 1.5 mGy, see Section 2.2).

(D–F) Heat maps representing hierarchical clustering of significantly regulated genes by complete linkage and Euclidean distance calculation for datasets and conditions.When considering only the significantly regulated genes we see more refined separation between the different experimental groups (Figure 1D–F). For the significantly regulated genes, the 0 Gy controls in general were clustered independently from the rest of the irradiated samples with what appears to be a time dependence with the gene signature changing for each timepoint after the acute dose. There also was a distinct group of genes that were oppositely regulated for HUVECs flown in space compared to the ground controls. This data indicates that there is a distinct gene signature associated with space radiation and the impact of one acute dose can potentially have long-lasting effects on the cardiovascular system.2.2. Dose Received by HUVECs Flown in Space The data are from the European Space Agency-Integrated Experiment (ESA-SPHINX) experiment (10/31/10–11/6/10) [44]. The cells were launched to the ISS on a Russian Progress supply vehicle, cultured for 7 days in the KUBIK incubator on the European Space Agency (ESA) Columbus module, and then fixed. To be able to compare the dose received on the ISS to the simulated radiation ground studies, we obtained dose data from a detector located on the Columbus. (Data provided kindly by T. Berger from the German Aerospace Center (DLR)). The measured dose rate was almost constant throughout the experiment with an average of 220.43 µGy/day (in water) with a standard deviation of 1.90 µGy/day (in water) measured over the period of the experiment (Data provided kindly by T. Berger from the DLR and additional details can be found in the original publication [44]). The total dose was 1.544 mGy (in water) with the dose equivalent to 3.7 mSv, of which 58% was from high-energy protons and other GCR ions, and 42% from low-energy protons in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The actual dose to the samples was probably somewhat lower, as they were shielded by the incubator. Here it is important to make the distinction between particle energy and LET, which is essentially energy loss per unit path length and is proportional to the square of the charge. Linear energy transfer (LET) is a measure of how ionizing a particle is; because they are singly charged, both high- and low-energy protons are relatively low LET.2.3. Common Pathways between Simulated Space Radiation and Spaceflight Samples To fully understand the specific and long-lasting effects of space radiation on biology, we have to understand the general pathways that are being regulated. We first utilized gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [46] to determine significant pathways being regulated for each condition with an FDR ≤ 0.05. Using the Hallmarks (a more generalized pathway database, see Figure 2) and Reactome (Figure 3) gene sets for GSEA, we were able to identify key pathways that are commonly being regulated for all ground controls compared to the spaceflight samples or irradiated samples. We first observed that the majority of pathways for most time-points after radiation for the cardiomyocytes that were commonly regulated with the HUVEC spaceflight samples were downregulated (with the exception of one time-point at 1 day for samples irradiated with protons for some nodes) (Figure 2A). The time-points and samples were associated with each wedge in the node as displayed in the figure legend for Figure 2. Specifically, ROS pathways were surprisingly downregulated (indicating a decrease in ROS production) for the majority of the conditions, which suggests an immediate and persistent impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, which is also observed on flight samples as well. The other pathways that were downregulated have been shown from the literature to be connected to the ROS pathway. For example, fatty acid metabolism, which is one of the primary sources of energy for cardiac muscle, has a direct link to ROS formation and regulation through the mitochondria (Figure 2) [47]. It is interesting to note that it has been reported that the ROS production from the mitochondria is an important mechanism of how ROS impacts cardiac tissue [48]. Knocking out MYC has been shown to cause low levels of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 2 and Figure 3) [49]. It is known that oxidative phosphorylation will produce ROS [50] and with the downregulation of MYC, this can potentially reduce oxidative phosphorylation levels which in turn will reduce ROS. Reactive oxygen species have also been shown to promote adipogenesis [51] and will be involved with heme metabolism (Figure 2) [52]. We also observed an overall downregulation of cell cycle pathways (Figure 3). We believe that this might be potentially due to the downregulation of ROS signaling, since it has been previously shown that ROS can heavily influence the cell cycle [53]. The downregulation of ROS seems to also lead to overall downregulation of cell cycle pathways (Figure 3). In general, ROS have been shown to be critically involved with the development of cardiovascular disease [52]. Through all these related downregulated pathways, we show that ROS potentially have long-lasting (Figure 2) effects directly linked to the space environment on the cardiovascular systems. On the other hand, surprisingly DNA repair hallmarks were downregulated for all irradiated samples at any time-point, whereas it was upregulated in space (Figure 2, top right panel). This result is unexpected as DNA repair is definitely expected early after exposure and suggests the cardiac response is quite different. Figure 2.

Note: all samples were comparing experimental conditions with the respective controls. For figures (C,D), the common wedges are highlighted in yellow outline. The significant gene sets were determined with false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05. The legend in the middle of the figure displays what each component/wedge of the nodes represent. Each node contains 11 wedges for each condition and the color of each wedge indicates if the gene set is downregulated (blue) or upregulated (red). The shade of the color indicates the degree of regulation. Each node represents one gene set and the size of the node indicates the number of genes involved with the predictions. Pathways with more than one node are grouped together in the black boxes under each major category.Figure 3.

Each node represents one gene set and the size of the node indicates the number of genes involved with the predictions. Each node contains 11 wedges for each condition and the color of each wedge indicates if the gene set is downregulated (blue) or upregulated (red). The shade of the color indicates degree of regulation.2.4. The Biological Pathways Elicited by Protons Have Stronger Overlap with Spaceflight Samples Than Those Elicited by 56Fe Ions To test if one type of space radiation has a predominant effect on a spaceflight sample, one can compare the predicted pathways from one radiation condition alone with spaceflight samples. Figure 2C shows that the majority of pathways specifically in common with protons and spaceflight were upregulated, while Figure 2D shows the 56Fe component in common with spaceflight was downregulated. TGFβ signaling has been shown in the past to be a key player with regulating the overall system with proton irradiation (Figure 2) [11,54,55]. In order to further validate these results, we use another functional prediction tool, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), to predict the involvement of specific upstream regulators, biofunctions, and canonical pathways in the various datasets (Figure 4A–C). In general, the overall pathways and functions overlap with the GSEA findings. For example, we observed in the upstream regulator predictions that MYC is downregulated for the majority for the pathways. We also observed that the following upstream regulators were predicted to activate or inhibit in the same directions as the GSEA predictions: p53, HIF1A, IL2, and IL6. The mTOR signaling canonical pathway also overlaps with the GSEA predictions. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Predicted functions and upstream regulators affected by space radiation for HUVECs exposed to the space environment and cardiomyocytes from mice exposed to protons and 56Fe ion irradiation with multiple time-points after irradiation. The predicted statistically significant biofunctions (A), upstream regulators (B), and canonical pathways (C), determined through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) from data for each individual dataset using activation Z-score statistics. Heat map representation of the activation Z-score values (red = positive activation Z-score for activation and blue = negative activation Z-score for inhibition) with hierarchical clustering by complete linkage and Euclidean distance calculation for datasets and conditions were used to display the data. The prevalence of change (or % of dataset) on the left side of the heat maps represents how common that factor is throughout all datasets/tissues with the darkest color representing factors with the highest degree in common. Time after irradiation, cell type, and experiment is color coded on the top of the heat maps. For all heat maps we are only showing the prevalence of change for the functions associated with the top 4 (i.e., a prevalence of change score ≥ 7). Global clustering of the biofunctions (D), upstream regulators (E), and canonical pathways (F) for all samples are shown by principal component analysis (PCA). For the PCA plots we used all functions for each datapoint regardless of the prevalence of change score.We were interested in determining how these overall functions from the ground experiments will group with the spaceflight samples. Using the activation Z-scores from the IPA results we were able to provide direct comparisons between all the samples, which we were not able to perform with the expression values due to the incompatibility of the microarray outputs. Using principal component analysis on Z-scores, we show that all cardiomyocyte samples irradiated with protons have biofunctions, upstream regulators and canonical pathways which cluster closely to the spaceflight samples (Figure 4D–F). In contrast, IPA functional predictions for cardiomyocytes from mice irradiated with 56Fe are nicely grouped together for three of the time-points (1 day, 3 days, and 14 days), while 7 days and 28 days seem to behave as outliers when compared to the other datasets. Overall, all time-points for 56Fe were clearly separated from the spaceflight and proton irradiated samples in the PC1 axis. Since the appropriate controls were not used for these datasets by the original investigators, we felt it appropriate to provide the potential that these two time-points may be outliers and a person may consider to remove these points from additional analysis. It is important to demonstrate how less than ideal GeneLab datasets can still have potential to provide meaningful results. This result is also evident on Figure 4A–C, where most predicted IPA functions have negative Z-scores for 3 out of 5 56Fe time-points, whereas all proton time-points and flight samples show positive Z-scores (red). These results indicate that the overall functional impact on samples caused by space radiation on the ISS are due to protons rather than HZE ions. In the past it has been difficult to determine which component of the ions in space will impact samples on the ISS. Previous models have predicted that due to SPEs and the protection of the magnetosphere around the Earth from HZE ions, astronauts should be mainly exposed to protons at LEO [2,10,13,15,16]. To our knowledge this is the first time suggesting from data utilized from the GeneLab that at LEO, protons will be the majority of ions that samples are exposed to. This data can provide a contribution to relating the biology being observed on the ISS to the correct type of irradiation that samples are exposed to.2.5. Key Driving Genes Provide Direct Connection to ROS for Space Radiation Impact on the Cardiovascular System To determine the key driving genes in an unbiased methodology we used an established systems biology approach that identifies the key genes involved in explaining the predicted biological functions changed by a specific treatment [54,55,56,57,58,59,60]. Our data has shown potential long-lasting impact of cardiomyocytes when comparing to the basal 1 day controls. Due to the original study design we did not have the optimal controls to compare to every time-point, but since there are relevant biological changes occurring when compared to the basal (1 day) ground controls, we hypothesis that there will be consistent long-lasting impact on cardiomyocytes isolated from mice irradiated with protons and 56Fe ion irradiation. In addition, this will also show how to creatively utilize less than ideal GeneLab datasets to generate meaningful biology to guide future research. For the key gene analysis, we pooled all irradiated time-points together to determine the common key driving genes for each type of radiation. Since we also observed that the 7 day and 28 day time-points for 56Fe vs. the control were acting as outliers (Figure 4D–F), we performed an additional key genes analysis excluding those time-points. This will only affect the key genes associated with 56Fe. This is an essential strategy to better identify the key genes specific to space radiation, which are able to relate back to the spaceflight data. Utilizing the unbiased methodology described in the methods and further explained previously [54,55,56,57], we found utilizing all time-points nine persistent key genes for cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that received 150 mGy 56Fe and seven persistent key genes for cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that received 900 mGy protons. From the HUVECs flown on the ISS for seven days, we found nine key genes (Figure 5A). When excluding the outlier time-points for 56Fe (7 and 28 days), we obtain 85 key genes for cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that received 150 mGy 56Fe (Figure 5B). We were able to determine the connectivity of these key genes between the experiments through network analysis. This allowed us to find potential relationships with how the ground studies relate to the spaceflight experiments, and the central hubs or the most connected key genes that might be responsible for space radiation effects on the cardiovascular system. We found that the key/driving genes that are the central hubs are: FYN, LCK, AKT1 being upregulated and LYN and FOS being downregulated with FYN being the overall central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation (Figure 5A). It is worth noting the activation of FYN is a key event which prevents cardiac cell death and ROS production [35,36]. Interestingly it is known that LCK, LYN, and FYN are part of the SRC-family kinases (SFKs) [37,61,62,63] and have been associated with various aspects of cardiovascular disease [62,64,65,66,67]. In addition, FYN and AKT1 are shown to be pivotal with angiogenic functions and the relation to cardiovascular disease [68,69]. Lastly, utilizing Z-scores through IPA we were able to show that these key genes provide a predicted inhibition of cell death of cardiomyocytes, congenital heart disease, and cardiac fibrillation (Figure 5). There also is a predicted inflammation of the organs which can cause negative health risk. Through an unbiased methodology we were able to show a link of key driving genes between ground and spaceflight studies that potential will have direct impact on the cardiovascular system. Figure 5. Open in a new tab The key driving genes associated with space radiation and the predicted functions that these genes will affect. A circular network created with IPA is utilized connecting all the key genes from each experimental condition (i.e., common key genes for all time-points for both cardiomyocytes from mice irradiated with either 150 mGy 56Fe or 900 mGy protons compared to 0 Gy controls and HUVECs flown in on the ISS for 7 days compared to the ground control). The color of the gene represents whether the gene is upregulated (red) or downregulated (green) with the shade signifying the degree of regulation. (A) The network of key genes done with analysis using all time-points and samples. (B) The network of key genes for analysis done with all time-points except for 7 and 28 days for 56Fe vs Ctrl. For this analysis there were three key genes that overlapped between the cardiomyocytes irradiated with protons and 56Fe (CD4, CD3G, and LCK). These were oppositely regulated between the two irradiation conditions and the colors in the top half indicate the gene expression for protons and the bottom indicates the gene expression for 56Fe. The different line colors represent the predicted effect of each gene on each other. Predicted functional impact of the key genes were determined using IPA which allowed us to predict whether cardiac related functions were either inhibited (blue) or activated (orange). The identification of the symbols for each gene is shown on the bottom of the figure.For the key genes analysis excluding the two outlier points (Figure 5B), since there were more key genes for 56Fe, additional predictions can be made for the functions related to cardiovascular system. For those key genes we show that in addition the functional impact described above, we also observe a predicted activation for damage to the heart. This can be attributed to potential damage caused by the key genes associated with 56Fe to promote damage to the heart tissue. In addition, we also observe three genes that overlap between the cardiomyocytes irradiation with protons and 56Fe: CD4, CD3G, and LCK. These genes are shown to be oppositely regulated between the irradiation conditions that can indicate potential different functional impact that can occur with the different ions. Since we are indicating that the majority of the ions that are affecting samples at LEO are protons (Figure 4D–F), for our interpretation of the overall data we will consider the upregulation of these three genes associated with proton irradiation to be the impact it will have on the samples.2.6. Predicted Circulating miRNA Signature Associated with Space Radiation Cardiovascular Risk We recently predicted a microRNA (miRNA) signature that was associated with microgravity and potential the space environment [54]. Utilizing a Cytoscape [70] plugin referred to as ClueGo [71], we were able to predict the top 30 miRNAs associated with the key genes (Figure 6). We believe that these miRNAs are associated with cardiovascular risk associated with space radiation. Interestingly, from an unbiased determination of the miRNAs, many of the predicted miRNAs have previously been associated with cardiovascular disease. For example 17 out of the 30 miRNAs predicted (miR-15a-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-29b-3p, miR-101-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-153, miR-185-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-302a, miR-520d-5p let-7a, let-7b, let-7d, and let-7f-1) have previously been reported to be either up- or downregulated in human heart disease and experimental models of heart failure [72]. Further, the let-7 family and miR-125b have been specifically shown to be involved with regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis [73]. Lastly, three of the miRNAs have overlap with our recently predicted miRNAs associated with the space environment which are: miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and let-7a [54]. This can indicate from the original 13 miRNAs that comprised the systemic miRNA signature associated with spaceflight, that these three miRNAs are the components related to the cardiovascular system and space radiation. Figure 6. Open in a new tab The top 30 miRNAs associated with all the key genes determined by Cytoscape [70] plugin referred to as ClueGo [71].3. Discussion For long-term space travel, cardiovascular risk is a major concern to astronauts and is thought to arise from both microgravity effects and exposure to space radiation. Here we focused on how NASA’s GeneLab platform and datasets can be utilized to suggest the potential impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. Through an unbiased systems biology approach, we utilized three datasets (GLDS-52, -109, and -117) from NASA’s GeneLab platform that were related to space radiation and the cardiovascular system. Two of the datasets were from ground studies focused on cardiomyocytes that were isolated from mice after an acute whole-body dose of either 900 mGy of protons or 150 mGy of 56Fe [45]. The other study observed HUVECs for 7 days on the ISS [44]. As noted previously, the HUVECs received a total dose of 1.544 mGy, mostly from low LET protons. Through our unbiased analysis we were able to suggest: 1) that, consistent with the dose data, the majority of the radiation experienced on the ISS is potentially from protons (Figure 4D–F and Figure 2), a novel response mechanism of the cardiovascular system to prevent damage caused by space radiation through the activation of FYN. By identifying the key genes in all three datasets, we proposed that FYN is the most connected gene and is therefore the central hub for this common biological response. This leads us to hypothesize that there is a feedback loop triggered by the oxidative stress induced by space radiation that upregulates FYN which in turn reduces ROS levels, and thus ROS pathways. Interestingly, this feedback loop is accompanied with a downregulation of the DNA repair pathway in the animals but not in the HUVECs flown in space, suggesting a response that is more targeted to the cardiovascular system in a full organism (Figure 2). By reducing ROS formation, cardiomyocyte and endothelial cells are less likely to die, leading to an overall protection of the cardiovascular system (Figure 7). More specifically, FYN was found to be upregulated within each group of the key genes associated with each dataset providing an overall predicted inhibition of ROS and cell death, while causing an activation of inflammation due to space radiation. This effect was suggested to be long-term since the key factors were from common genes being regulated the same direction up to 28 days after irradiation for the ground studies. Figure 7. Open in a new tab A schematic of the mechanism involved with the space radiation impact on the cardiovascular system. We determined that through the upregulation of FYN (the determined key/central driver involved with space radiation), ROS is downregulated to protect against the upregulation due to space radiation. Although FYN is predicted to be the central player, the other key genes involved from each dataset (Figure 5) will contribute to the reduction in ROS and cell death. In addition, we also observe potential increased cardiovascular health risk due to increased predictions of inflammation.FYN, which is part of the SRC family kinases (which includes nine non-receptor tyrosine kinases discussed in the results), has been shown to be heavily involved with the cardiovascular system by decreasing ROS production and apoptosis [36]. Our analysis also agrees with what has been observed with the cardiovascular literature. It has been shown that knocking out FYN increases cardiac cell death and induces ROS production through NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4) signaling [36]. Others have shown FYN kinase inhibitors also inhibits nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) activity (which is an essential molecule for cardiac adaptive responses and protection) and enhances myocardial necrosis and death rate [39]. NRF2 is also known to be essential in sensing ROS and regulating protection against damaging changes to the redox balance [74,75]. This mechanism has been discovered to be heavily regulated by FYN activation phosphorylating NRF2 which in turn triggers a defense response to ROS [75]. Space radiation has previously been shown to induce ROS in tissue and negatively impact the host [76,77]. What is novel about our finding is that the universal ROS impact that has classically been thought to impact all tissue does not seem to fit with cells involved with the cardiovascular system. Although ROS should be initially activated in cardiovascular tissue after exposure to space radiation, this mechanism through FYN attempts to protect the cardiovascular system. As discussed above, in a normal response with other types of external damage causing oxidative stress on the cardiovascular system, it has been shown that FYN will be activated and act as a negative feedback regulator to protect the cardiac tissue [36]. This mechanism has not been previously considered as an internal protective countermeasure to the effects of space radiation on cardiac tissue. Here we propose that there is a protective negative feedback loop that allows FYN to inhibit the ROS activation that is triggered by space radiation (Figure 7). Although this seems to provide protection against a key player in space radiation damage to the cardiac tissue, other factors still seem to have a negative impact on the cardiovascular system that can increase risk of cardiovascular disease. To that end, we also observed a predicted activation of inflammation due to the key genes (Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 7). It is well known that inflammation in cardiac tissue has been associated with cardiovascular disease [78]. It has also been shown that reduction of ROS through antioxidants can potentially elevate chronic inflammation in cardiac tissue [78]. Our data suggests that although FYN might be acting as a natural antioxidant to reduce ROS effects, this mechanism might not be enough to reduce the inflammation caused by space radiation which has the potential to increase risk of cardiovascular disease. From our previous studies, we have observed that miRNAs can be a key driver in response to the damage caused by the space environment [54]. We were able to predict the top 30 miRNAs that have potential to respond to space radiation in the cardiovascular system (Figure 6). Surprisingly, 17 out 30 miRNAs predicted have been shown to be associated with heart failure and play a role in cardiovascular disease [73]. Three out of 30 miRNAs also overlap with our previously identified universal miRNA signature that we have shown to systemically impact an organism due to a space environment. This preliminary result indicates that we have potential candidates for the specific component related to the cardiac tissue and space radiation. Currently, there is a lack of information for the role miRNAs in space radiation’s effect on the cardiovascular system. Our findings warrant further investigations to determine the extent to which miRNAs impact FYN and ROS due to space radiation. We believe that the novel mechanism presented here for space radiation induced cardiovascular risk will impact the further development of space radiation risk models. We were able to directly link radiation ground studies to spaceflight and provide a rationale of how the cardiovascular system can help reduce ROS. We have shown through the power of NASA’s GeneLab platform that novel findings can be produced from existing data from former studies. By creatively combing several datasets we have potential indication of the specific space radiation component that astronauts are being exposed to at LEO on the ISS. It has been previously thought that protons comprise the majority of ions that astronauts are exposed to in LEO [16], but biological data have been lacking. Of course, further experiments have to be performed to determine whether these findings are true which can involve doing radiation ground experiments with HUVECs at 1.5 mGy (a comparable dose to the ISS for 7 days) and then once again comparing the gene expression changes to the dataset used here. The power of this type of analysis with GeneLab datasets allows for future guidance for space biology related experiments. In addition, we were able to uncover a novel mechanism underlying space radiation’s impact on the cardiovascular system. Although this study was done purely based on omics data, we believe that we have shown the power of using purely in silico methods to provide novel data. In addition, this manuscript demonstrates that GeneLab data can be utilized to give important hints to plan expensive space and accelerator experiments very carefully and not to be parsimonious when including the relevant controls and baselines. Further studies should be implemented to validate the findings reported here and potentially develop countermeasures for cardiovascular risk due spaceflight.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Datasets Utilized from the GeneLab Platform All data used for this manuscript were obtained from GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov). The following datasets were used: GLDS-52, -109, and -117. Spaceflight mission and ground radiation experimental details for each dataset such as, the handling of the cells, RNA extraction, and raw data pertaining to the microarray can be found in the GeneLab database. Briefly, we used two ground studies utilizing cardiomyocytes isolated from 8 to 9 months old male C57BL/6NT mice that have been whole-body irradiated with either one acute dose of 900 mGy protons at 1 GeV (GLDS-117) or 150 mGy of iron ions (56Fe) at 1 GeV/n (GLDS-109) and 5 time-points up to 28 days were collected after irradiation [45]. For protons, the following time-points were used for transcriptomic analysis: 1 day (n = 2), 3 days (n = 3), 5 days (n = 2), 12 days (n = 2), and 26 days (n = 2). For 56Fe, the following time-points were used for transcriptomic analysis: 1 day (n = 3), 3 days (n = 3), 7 days (n = 2), 14 days (n = 2), and 28 days (n = 2). For both experiments cardiomyocytes were also isolated from 0 Gy sham at the following time-points and data was pooled between all time-points for the controls: 1 day (n = 2) and 3 days (n = 1). All cardiomyocytes were isolated by microdissection from tissue dissections in order to remove other cell types. One spaceflight study was used that flew HUVECs to the ISS and the cells were exposed to space environment in vitro under standard conditions for 7 days before the cells were preserved in RNAlater [44]. The ground controls used for this study are 1 × g controls that were grown on Earth with identical conditions compared to the cells on the ISS.4.2. Transcriptomic Analysis The available transcriptomic data for tissues from GLDS-52, -109, and -117 datasets were previously performed on different versions of Affymetrix platforms. Due to the incompatibility and batch issues of processed data from these different platforms, all datasets were analyzed independently and the processed data was compared across all tissues. Datasets were background adjusted and quantile normalized using RMAExpress [79]. The probes from the pre-processed data were median collapsed using GenePattern [80]. All the data for each tissue/dataset was imported into MultiExperiment Viewer [81] and statistically significant genes was determined by ANOVA analysis between all conditions for GLDS-109 and -117, and a p-value ≤ 0.05 and t-test with a p-value for GLDS-52. The number of significant genes was used for the rest the analysis for the higher-order analysis. Pathway analysis and subsequent predictions in each tissue were done using the statistically significant genes with a fold-change ≥1.2 (or ≤−1.2) comparing flight conditions versus ground controls or irradiated samples vs. unirradiated samples for ground experiments. Using a 1.2-fold-change cutoff allowed us to determine the impact of how major pathways were being regulated that would not be apparent with larger fold-change cutoffs. It was shown in the literature that larger fold-change values used for Omics data will significantly reduce useful biological data that becomes apparent when using lower fold-change cutoffs [82,83]. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems) was used to predict statistically significant activation or inhibition of upstream regulators, canonical pathways, biofunctions, and toxic functions using activation Z-score statistics (≥2, activated or ≤−2, inhibited) [84]. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was done using the C2, C5, and Hallmarks gene sets with a FDR ≤ 0.05 from the entire list of genes and additional leading edge analysis was performed as described by Subramanian et al. [46]. All heat maps and principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated using packages available through R (pheatmap for heat maps and scatterplot3d for PCA plots).4.3. Determination of Key Genes/Drivers We used a previously established unbiased systems biology method to determine key genes/drivers [54,56,57,59,60] for each tissue. Briefly, the standard method we have developed in the past to determine key genes was done by determining the overlapping genes involved in the predictions made through IPA’s upstream regulators, canonical pathways, biofunctions, and GSEA gene sets (C2, C5, and Hallmarks gene sets). The common genes identified through these statistically significant predictions can be thought of as the central drivers for the experiment being studied, since the absence of the genes will make these predictions null. In some cases, these overlaps result in either no key genes or a very low number of genes. If this occurs, we adjust the pathway predictions involved with the gene overlaps. For the key genes determined here, we were forced to show the overlapping genes that were only involved with the GSEA Hallmarks Gene Set analysis with the IPA predictions. To determine the key gene, which has the highest number of connections and can be thought of as the central hub for the set of key genes, we utilized IPA to define the total number of connections between all the key genes. Next, we plotted the genes using the radial plot tool which places the most connected gene in the center of the plot. Previous work involving similar statistically identified key genes provided experimental validation for this methodology using Western blots, qPCR, and other functional assays [56,60].4.4. MicroRNA (miRNA) Predictions Through the use of a Cytoscape [70] plug-in called ClueGo [71], we were able to predict miRNAs based on the key genes determined. This involved entering all key genes determined in ClueGo and allowing the software to determine the top 30 miRNAs that were significantly regulated and connected to the key genes.

    "introduction": "Introduction Over the last decade the vast increase in outputs from “omics” (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) assays, together with decreasing assay and data storage costs, have resulted in an exponentially increasing volume of these “big” data. The high feature-number aspect of these big data has highlighted the importance of data sharing (or reuse) functions of these systems, as data sets often have relevance for investigating a very large number of hypotheses. Thus, developers of big data systems increasingly are focusing on the needs of users to discover, annotate, share, and analyze data. Omics data sharing is especially crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen a huge rise in collaborative analysis systems1-3, databases4-14, and knowledge bases15-17 for omics and other systems biology data. The FAIR18 principles are a set of guiding principles that are being advocated as foundational in the broad areas of data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. However, the challenges involved in using current technologies and real-world infrastructures within organizational guidelines to develop data repositories and/or data analytical systems that are “FAIR” are substantial. The FAIR principles deal with aspects of data handling such as identification, representation, and attribution. Metrics to evaluate the “FAIRness” of a data system or its design are also currently being developed19. System developers should consider familiarizing themselves with these metrics, as many of the FAIR principles can have significant implications in terms of feasible design options and operations resource planning. We assessed the “FAIRness” of NASA’s GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS), along with four systems in the research omics data domain chosen for their similarity to the GLDS, using 14 FAIRness metrics. We relate these assessments in the context of discussion of the FAIRness concepts for the design of Big Data omics systems in particular, relating some of the challenges we faced developing the GLDS as a FAIR data system. In addition to designing a data system to be FAIR, developers of Big Data systems in particular should consider how system design can maximize data usability for its users. We propose two new design principles for FAIR systems that handle Big Data like omics data from our experiences developing the GLDS. By complying with these usability principles and the FAIR principles together, systems that manage Big Data can maximize both the usability and reusability of data.",
    "methods": "Methods NASA GeneLab GeneLab (http://genelab. nasa. gov) is a NASA initiative designed to accelerate “open science” biomedical research in support of the human exploration of space and the improvement of life on earth.20 GeneLab data have been used to research impacts of space on mice, humans, and plants. Phase I of GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) project implemented an “omics” (genomics, transcriptomics proteomics, and metabolomics) data repository for biomedical research data conducted in or relevant to space environments (Figure 1). This initial phase developed processes and systems for data submission, curation, indexing, search, and retrieval. In Phase II GeneLab implemented federated search and retrieval capabilities for data hosted by GeneLab and three other open-access, omics data systems, in order to facilitate data integration and biological meta-investigation (Figure 1a).21 (Note that these targets for search federation were selected independently and using different criteria than the data systems evaluated in this paper). Such meta-investigations are key to corroborating findings from different studies and/or kinds of bioassay data, and translating them into systems biology knowledge and, eventually, therapeutics22. In Phase III, GeneLab has begun to deploy an omics data analysis platform as part of the GLDS. Using this platform, investigators can design, execute and share in silico experimentation of omics data sets (Figures 1b and 1c). At the end of Phase III, users with results of these kinds of experiments will be able to store them directly into the GLDS repository, linked to originating data and to the analysis workflows that generated them. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS). (a) The GeneLab Data Repository. The federated search interface shown includes not only search of GLDS repository data, but of the extramural data sources Gene Expression Omnibus (“GEO”4), PRoteomics IDEntifications repository (“EBI PRIDE”5), and the Metagenomics Analysis server (“ANL MG-RAST”6). (b) The GLDS Workspace. (c) GLDS Tools for omics data analysis (part of a Galaxy server1).Even though the inception of the GLDS predated publication of the FAIR principles, many of the concepts behind the principles were discussed extensively prior to its design. These discussions included substantial input from the National Academies of Sciences and a steering committee of outside experts in omics biological data, and had significant impacts on selection of technological approaches and system architectures, required resources for development and operations, and policies developed for operating the GLDS. In the absence of best practices from the community in certain areas of design and policy (Figure 2), we wondered how we might assess the impact on FAIRness of the design and policy choices we faced, and how the GLDS would compare in FAIRness to other open-access, Big Data systems. Figure 2. Open in a new tab The FAIR principles18, and areas of design and operations of FAIR data systems (white boxes) for which best practices have yet to be defined. FAIRness of Omics Data The FAIR principles were designed to guide the management of data so that it is maximally findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. They are not precise prescriptions for FAIR system design specifications; rather they are aspirational guidelines with some references to exemplar standards and technologies. Among the findability principles are requirements that data be assigned a persistent, global unique identifier (GUID), be described by rich metadata, and be indexed by a system for retrieving the data. Accessibility requires the use of standardized, open (available for implementation to all) communications protocols for retrieval of data by GUID. Interoperability is supported through the use of machine-actionable metadata and data. Reusability requires systems to be compliant in the management of their data objects with the first three principles, specifically so that data and metadata can be linked and integrated across FAIR systems. Each of the authors assessed compliance of four open-access, omics data systems and the GLDS for FAIRness using the current working draft of the FAIRness metrics developed by the GO FAIR Metrics group23 (Table 1). The four systems selected were the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), the Metagenomics Analysis Server (MG-RAST), and Metabolights. We chose the systems for their similarity to the GLDS; all are open-access, government-operated or government-funded, research lab-developed omics data systems. As the FAIR principles themselves are only aspirational, the assessment of the systems can only be at most semi-quantitative, and they would likely be affected by further clarifications or details in the principles and/or metrics which are almost certain to come. We rated systems with Pass when we had no evidence of any failure of a test by the metric. Systems were rated as Partial Pass, if the metric had multiple steps or components, and the system passed some, but not all; or if we had evidence that some data inputs for the metric yielded a pass, while others did not. We chose Fail only if we could find no evidence the system was compliant with any part of the metric, for any inputs we tried. Individually-assessed ratings were then combined into the consensus ratings shown in Table 1 through dialogue among the raters. Finally, we developed an overall FAIRness Score by assigning a score to each rating of 1 for each Pass, 0.5 for each Partial Pass, and 0 for each Fail and totaling these score for each system. Table 1. The FAIR principles, corresponding draft FAIRness metrics, and semi-quantitative FAIRness ratings for select omics data systems. Metrics were those developed by the GO FAIR Metrics23 group. Open in a new tab Summary of FAIRness Assessments There is quite some variability in FAIRness among the omics data systems we assessed using the 14 metrics. The range of Pass ratings was 29-79% of metrics, Partial Pass 0-21%, and Fail 7-50%. The range of overall FAIRness scores was 6-12, with average of 10.1 and standard deviation, 2.4. All the systems were rated best in the areas of data accessibility and reusability, slightly worse in data findability, and far worse in data interoperability. Findability The first findability principle, F1 (Table 1), states that systems should identify data using globally unique and persistent identifiers; the FM-F1A metric focuses on identifier uniqueness, and FM-F1B on identifier persistence. The objective is to make data findable, but the implementation of F1 also supports data accessibility (FAIR principle A1). The qualifier “global” should be interpreted as global within the domain of conceivable use of the data. Thus, it is not sufficient to use locally (system-specific) controlled processes to manage data identifiers24, as this approach can never absolutely guarantee against overlap with other systems’ local identifier schemes. In addition, F1 specifies the persistence of issued identifiers; identification systems that employ Uniform Resource Locators (which rely on alterable domain name resolution) cannot guarantee persistence of identifiers. Among the schemes for providing data identifiers, the most reliable over time are likely to be those that use third-party resolution (versus those that rely on in-house redirection). Third-party resolution identifiers include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and those provided by identifers.org, among others25. All but one of the systems we assessed passed the metric for F1 metric by employing persistent, globally unique identifiers with third party resolution. (MG-RAST only offers such identifiers as an option during data submission, and so was assessed as Partial Pass.) In the biomedical research and clinical practice realms, publishers have now widely selected the DOI scheme for identification and citation of literature; more than 80% of 2015 articles indexed by PubMed have assigned DOIs26. As a consequence, the biomedical community is already (and continues to become more and more) familiar with using these identifiers to retrieve and cite literature. Yet to date only a few omics data repositories have similarly implemented DOIs for data publications. Consequently, actual findability and accessibility of data in these repositories is less than optimal, even though they are technically in compliance with F1, and will continue to be so, unless and until the biomedical community is trained on how to use other identifying schemes for citing data. Furthermore, metadata from these repositories are not currently indexed in DOI meta-indexes (such as the one produced by DataCite27). In order to be compliant with F1 and A1, the GLDS is implementing methods to issue DOIs for all data publications. Additionally, curated metadata records of the publications are transmitted to DataCite27 for meta-indexing, increasing the chances for reuse of GLDS-hosted data. FAIR data also need to be described “with rich metadata” in order to be findable. The draft metric to assess F2 compliance merely requires a metadata description document that specifies a format for machine-readable metadata. The definition of the term “machine-readable” varies somewhat, but it is generally agreed that it cannot be natural language. (Although F2 refers to reusability principles requiring data “have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes” (R1), the metric for F2 does not attempt to assess compliance with principle R1 [perhaps it should]). All the systems we assessed passed this metric. Furthermore, all systems passed F3, requiring association of metadata with data it describes. It should be noted that FM-F3 refers only to IRIs and not broadly to any other kinds of acceptable data identifiers; we assume that ultimately FM-F3 will be broadened to allow other kinds of F1-compliant data identifiers. Also, it is difficult to determine if any of the systems truly support IRIs, given that none of them currently appear to use non-ASCII character encodings in their data identifying schemes. The FAIRness metric FM-F4 is rather ill-defined currently. It requires submission of an identifier of FAIR data and its metadata to search engines (which precisely, it does not yet specify, but some common search engines are mentioned as examples in the comments for the metric). A Pass should be given if the returned search results include links to the published data (again, it does not yet specify where in the returned results, although among both the top 10 and top 40 are mentioned in metric comments). Some of the systems we assessed failed this metric, and it seems their data records are likely not indexed by at least some search engines. For example, search of the MG-RAST data record identified by “http://metagenomics.anl.gov/linkin.cgi?metagenome=mgm4447971.3” or any of its tabular metadata yielded no search results referring to the repository using Google. More of the systems would fail this metric if it required data to be submitted specifically to DOI-based search systems (such as DataCite). Accessibility All of the systems for which we assessed compliance with FAIR principle A1.1 passed; all use open source communication protocols to access data, which are retrieved by their identifiers. FAIR Principle A1.2 stipulates that any protocol used to retrieve data “allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.” All the systems we assessed describe which functions of the system require credentials, and how to obtain the credentials. It should be noted that A1.2 can be applied to the design of all types of systems, from those with highly restricted access controls, to the kinds of “open access” systems we assessed, that typically require minimal authentication and grant the widest possible access to all users. Furthermore, the data in question could be any kind of data, including raw instrument output, shared data analysis workflows or data products, or scientifically-relevant user comments and opinions. Even for open access systems, some systems functions such as user-workspace file management, user commenting and messaging, and user attribution of data always require authentication, because these functions must necessarily leverage user-specific information. A specific challenge that GeneLab faced when implementing A1.2 for the GLDS was a diversity of credentialing services available to the system’s target users, with no single service common to all users. Furthermore, the goal of GeneLab is to maximize access to GLDS data across all kinds of users, but within the bounds of authentication and credentialing policies of NASA - another challenge. Aside from policy restrictions, the development of any new credentialing and authentication functions or services can require considerable resources. A solution for organizations that are seeking to develop open-access systems is to consider investing in development of an organization-wide integrated credentialing and authentication architecture (ICAA, Figure 3), and policies for allowing users to leverage extramural credentials, with appropriate access limitations. ICAAs and attendant policies can provide flexibility to develop and/or deploy data systems with available resources that can meet policy requirements of the organization that support extramural user access. It should be noted that using an ICAA to leverage credentialing systems developed independently from the system requires 1) technical compatibility between the authentication services of credentialing providers and the ICAA; and 2) compatibility of the credentialing policies of credentialing organizations and those of the organization developing the data system. Technical compatibility is facilitated through the use of authentication protocols and standards. Organizational credentialing policy incompatibility is more problematic to resolve. For example, it may be that the organization deploying the data system requires credentials be updated at an interval that is different from that required by one or more extramural credential provider. If these differences cannot be resolved, the only option may be to limit access for some extramural users data system functions requiring authentication. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Use of an Integrated Credentialing and Authentication Architecture (ICAA) to comply with FAIR principle A1.2. The ICAA provides services and policies that use information from intra- and extramural credentialing services to authenticate users of a data system.NASA is developing an ICAA and adopting policies that permit certain intramural data systems to leverage it for user credentials and authentication. These policies stipulates that users within the organization must use the organization’s own credentialing services, while extramural users may authenticate using one from a defined set of externally-managed credentialing systems (currently including authentication by selected “social media” systems, such as Google.com credentials). At NASA (and at most U.S. federal agencies), intramural credentialing is quite a long process involving corroboration of much identifying information. The use of the ICAA, users without NASA credentials can specify a minimum of information (e.g., only a verifiable email address), which they can provide easily through a web browser, and gain almost immediate access to the GLDS. Through use of the ICAA, the GLDS is able to recognize a lower level of confidence when authenticating extramural users, and implement appropriate access controls to some functions for these users (e.g., they may not join system administrator groups). It seems reasonable to suggest that an additional principle be considered when designing FAIR data systems that have at least some functions requiring authentication or authorization (A1.2.1 in Table 2). This principle, would stipulate that an integrated credentialing architecture, like that shown in Figure 3 be leveraged, in order to offer access to data to the widest number of users possible, when and where data policies permit such access. Table 2. Additional principles for optimizing data accessibility Open in a new tabMost of the systems we assessed for FAIR compliance to A2 have some policy to retain at least some metadata when data are removed from the system. It is frequently unclear, however, which metadata were to be retained when data records are removed from the system. Data systems should ensure that policies for retaining metadata are clearly stated, including which metadata and for what period of time. Another factor that specifically affects accessibility to Big Data is data transport. Data to be used as inputs in Big Data systems, but which are not located in the same environment as executable code of the system, commonly must first be transported (duplicated or moved) to the environment first. This environment typically is a user-specific workspace. The transport process for Big Data can require minutes, hours or even days in some Big Data systems, and represents a significant barrier to efficient access. Designers of Big Data would benefit from a principle that stipulates the collocation within Big Data systems of data and executable code (A3 in Table 2). Interoperability I1 stipulates the “use a formal, accessible, etc. language for knowledge representation. The draft metric for this principle requires that the language for data or metadata be available by URL, and have a BNF representation. The comments on the metric suggest additional required language qualities, including that the language must have semantics (“[‘vanilla’] xml and json ..should fail”). While current knowledge representation languages such as RDF and OWL28 are available to generate metadata specifications with inherent semantics, tools that leverage such languages require some sophistication in their use. All the repositories we assessed have metadata specifications that do not have inherent semantics, and thus would not yield a Pass for this metric. Metabolights and the GLDS both use the ISATab metadata specification, which can be converted to RDF, and so were rated with Partial Pass. The metric for principle I2 has a related requirement: that data systems use open, community-developed vocabularies for data and metadata, and that such vocabularies be more than simple keywords (i.e., include semantics in some form). As the ISATab specification supported ontological lookup from such vocabularies, we again only rated Metabolights and the GLDS with Partial Pass, and the rest of the systems as FAIL. In addition to lack of experience with knowledge representation technologies like RDF and OWL, another likely reason for lack of compliance of the systems with I1 and I2 is a general lack of available semantic resources developed by the community to generate metadata specifications and vocabularies, particularly in more recent domains like genomics, proteomics and metabolomics. We have ourselves sought such resources for use in the GLDS development, where we are seeking to provide users with omics data analysis capabilities, an omics “workbench” consisting of user-specific workspaces and data access controls, together with access to a suite of omics analysis tools (see Figure 1b and Figure 1c). Users of these tools will create data processing (analysis) workflows to transform input data into “higher-order” data products, which they will likely want to share with others and/or associate with the workflows and data inputs. One of the challenges we have observed for making these kinds of processed information FAIR include a lack of semantic resources for creating metadata specifications for such processed data and the processing workflows that generate them. While schemas like the Common Workflow Language29 (CWL) specification provide a method to represent and reproduce the mechanics of data processing, they lack domain-specific semantics regarding the nature of these data transformations (e.g., what are the goals of the transformation from a biological perspective? What are the biological data concepts produced in output files? how do these relate to input data elements? etc.). Without these descriptors, systems may not adequately index these processed data and workflows for discovery and retrieval. While sophisticated users (e.g., trained bioinformaticians) who do encounter processed data and workflows may be able to understand and reuse them, others without domain-specific experience and knowledge of omics data processing may not. A challenge for the GLDS will be to help spur the creation of community resources so that it can implement rich metadata for processed omics data and workflows in a timely fashion. The objective of the metric for principle I3 is to measure how much data in one system are linked semantically to data in other systems. It is not surprising that none of the data sources link data “out” to data in external systems in semantically qualified ways; this is a challenging objective for any data system. (We ignored links to records that were merely duplicated between systems) Manual linking of data requires subject matter expertise and can be time-consuming for systems with many data records. Automated linking requires that source and linked data both be characterized semantically so that links may be inferred. As mentioned above, semantic resources for characterizing omics data are by and large still forthcoming. Reusability R1 is referred to by the findability FAIR principle F2 (see above); at this time there is no metric specifically for R1. R1.1 requires data systems to provide licenses for data usage (and is curiously intended to facilitate “legal interoperability” rather than reusability30. All the data repositories we assessed are governmental entities, and as such, licensing is traditionally prohibited. R1.2 and R1.3 require that data are published together with provenance metadata, and that data and metadata conform to community-derived standards, respectively. Such standards include taxonomies, ontologies and other vocabularies for metadata, and data and file formats. The metric for R1.2 involves the demonstration that a system can provide FAIR-compliant citational and contextual provenance metadata. While all the repositories provide such metadata, some do not use FAIR-compliant schemes for these metadata. Similarly, most of the repositories assess and validate submitted data files (but few validate metadata, as discussed above) against FAIR-schemes and formats.",
    "results": "",
    "discussion": "Discussion The systems we assessed for FAIRness clearly have shortcomings, particularly in the area of supporting data interoperability. None of the systems currently use a metadata representation language with sufficient semantics. In addition, none fully leverage FAIR vocabularies for metadata. There are perhaps several causes at work for these observations. There are often myriad vocabularies (ontologies) for metadata (each of which is a de facto community standard) even within a given biological sub-domain, and often much overlap in semantic content between them, creating the need for systems to be able to “normalize” input metadata across them somehow. For example, the concept of zero or very low-gravity experimental conditions appears in at least 5 different, widely-used biomedical vocabularies: SNOMED CT, MeSH, Read Codes Clinical Terms, Psychology Ontology, PLOS Thesaurus, and FAST Topical Facet, with varying language for the concept (“weightlessness” vs. “zero gravity”). True semantic interoperability and data reusability that would permit a user to find all data tagged with this concept require either that all these concept instances be individually associated with the data, or use of a system that reliably maps all the concepts from these ever-changing, ever-expanding set of ontologies. Even if such metadata normalizing mechanisms are developed, their performance and value in generating “rich” metadata is dependent on the quality of input concepts supplied either by original data submitters or biodata curators (typically employed by the system). The expertise that submitters have is critical to shaping metadata that have value for many different kinds of audiences, and that allow associated data to be found and reused. In the biomedical field, submitters to shared data repositories have relatively low motivation to go to any great lengths to provide “rich metadata” (or assist biocurators in generating them). This is likely due, at least in part, to the fact that only a small fraction of shared data appears to be cited in publication references when they are reused.31 Without their input, niche repositories and data systems, like the GLDS, with limited resources for acquiring (and maintaining) rich metadata that meet all the criteria above must constantly trade the use of resources to acquire or generate rich metadata with those that could be used for other worthy goals. The findability and interoperability principles, when implemented in data systems, support data integration functions like multi-source data querying and retrieval. Principles F2, I1, I2, and R1.3 require the use of community-developed metadata standards, formal languages for metadata representation, FAIR vocabularies, and qualified references to other data. These principles are unfortunately not yet widely or fully implemented across biomedical data systems, making it difficult for systems to develop functions that integrate data semantically. To illustrate this, we examine our own experience developing the GLDS to provide federated search and retrieval of omics data from several data sources. We sought to import metadata records from three open-access data systems into our own metadata warehouse: GEO, MG-RAST, and the PRoteomics IDEntifications repository (PRIDE)5. Each of these systems defines metadata for omics data sets differently, but none of them make these schemas available in a formal semantic language format (such as RDF or OWL). Furthermore, there are no existing maps of any of the metadata schemas to each other. As such, we resorted to manually creating semantic maps of these schemas for use in our system; queries generated via the GLDS or its RESTful search API are executed against the mapped schema concepts, and matching records are shown in a common object model representation (Figure 4). While this approach met our immediate goals of allowing users to query several data sources using our system, it required a good deal of resources and domain expertise to develop a schema mapping. Furthermore, maintaining this mapping over time as each of the data sources inevitably change will require more of our limited resources. The research community should recognize the value of federated system functions like the querying function that the GLDS offers, and urge all open access repositories and data systems to make their metadata schemas available to all according to the aforementioned FAIR principles. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Federated Search of Omics Data in the GLDS. The RESTful search API result shows 65 records from the four data sources searched (GLDS, GEO, PRIDE, and MG-RAST).

We assessed the “FAIRness” of NASA’s GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) along with four similar kinds of systems in the research omics data domain, using 14 FAIRness metrics. The range of overall FAIRness scores was 6-12 (out of 14), average 10.1, and standard deviation 2.4. The range of Pass ratings for the metrics was 29-79%, Partial Pass 0-21%, and Fail 7-50%. The systems we evaluated performed the best in the areas of data findability and accessibility, and worst in the area of data interoperability. Reusability of metadata, in particular, was frequently not well supported. We relate our experiences implementing semantic integration of omics data from some of the assessed systems for federated querying and retrieval functions, given their shortcomings in data interoperability. Finally, we propose two new principles that Big Data system developers, in particular, should consider for maximizing data accessibility.Introduction Over the last decade the vast increase in outputs from “omics” (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) assays, together with decreasing assay and data storage costs, have resulted in an exponentially increasing volume of these “big” data. The high feature-number aspect of these big data has highlighted the importance of data sharing (or reuse) functions of these systems, as data sets often have relevance for investigating a very large number of hypotheses. Thus, developers of big data systems increasingly are focusing on the needs of users to discover, annotate, share, and analyze data. Omics data sharing is especially crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen a huge rise in collaborative analysis systems1-3, databases4-14, and knowledge bases15-17 for omics and other systems biology data. The FAIR18 principles are a set of guiding principles that are being advocated as foundational in the broad areas of data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. However, the challenges involved in using current technologies and real-world infrastructures within organizational guidelines to develop data repositories and/or data analytical systems that are “FAIR” are substantial. The FAIR principles deal with aspects of data handling such as identification, representation, and attribution. Metrics to evaluate the “FAIRness” of a data system or its design are also currently being developed19. System developers should consider familiarizing themselves with these metrics, as many of the FAIR principles can have significant implications in terms of feasible design options and operations resource planning. We assessed the “FAIRness” of NASA’s GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS), along with four systems in the research omics data domain chosen for their similarity to the GLDS, using 14 FAIRness metrics. We relate these assessments in the context of discussion of the FAIRness concepts for the design of Big Data omics systems in particular, relating some of the challenges we faced developing the GLDS as a FAIR data system. In addition to designing a data system to be FAIR, developers of Big Data systems in particular should consider how system design can maximize data usability for its users. We propose two new design principles for FAIR systems that handle Big Data like omics data from our experiences developing the GLDS. By complying with these usability principles and the FAIR principles together, systems that manage Big Data can maximize both the usability and reusability of data.Methods NASA GeneLab GeneLab (http://genelab. nasa. gov) is a NASA initiative designed to accelerate “open science” biomedical research in support of the human exploration of space and the improvement of life on earth.20 GeneLab data have been used to research impacts of space on mice, humans, and plants. Phase I of GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) project implemented an “omics” (genomics, transcriptomics proteomics, and metabolomics) data repository for biomedical research data conducted in or relevant to space environments (Figure 1). This initial phase developed processes and systems for data submission, curation, indexing, search, and retrieval. In Phase II GeneLab implemented federated search and retrieval capabilities for data hosted by GeneLab and three other open-access, omics data systems, in order to facilitate data integration and biological meta-investigation (Figure 1a).21 (Note that these targets for search federation were selected independently and using different criteria than the data systems evaluated in this paper). Such meta-investigations are key to corroborating findings from different studies and/or kinds of bioassay data, and translating them into systems biology knowledge and, eventually, therapeutics22. In Phase III, GeneLab has begun to deploy an omics data analysis platform as part of the GLDS. Using this platform, investigators can design, execute and share in silico experimentation of omics data sets (Figures 1b and 1c). At the end of Phase III, users with results of these kinds of experiments will be able to store them directly into the GLDS repository, linked to originating data and to the analysis workflows that generated them. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS). (a) The GeneLab Data Repository. The federated search interface shown includes not only search of GLDS repository data, but of the extramural data sources Gene Expression Omnibus (“GEO”4), PRoteomics IDEntifications repository (“EBI PRIDE”5), and the Metagenomics Analysis server (“ANL MG-RAST”6). (b) The GLDS Workspace. (c) GLDS Tools for omics data analysis (part of a Galaxy server1).Even though the inception of the GLDS predated publication of the FAIR principles, many of the concepts behind the principles were discussed extensively prior to its design. These discussions included substantial input from the National Academies of Sciences and a steering committee of outside experts in omics biological data, and had significant impacts on selection of technological approaches and system architectures, required resources for development and operations, and policies developed for operating the GLDS. In the absence of best practices from the community in certain areas of design and policy (Figure 2), we wondered how we might assess the impact on FAIRness of the design and policy choices we faced, and how the GLDS would compare in FAIRness to other open-access, Big Data systems. Figure 2. Open in a new tab The FAIR principles18, and areas of design and operations of FAIR data systems (white boxes) for which best practices have yet to be defined.FAIRness of Omics Data The FAIR principles were designed to guide the management of data so that it is maximally findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. They are not precise prescriptions for FAIR system design specifications; rather they are aspirational guidelines with some references to exemplar standards and technologies. Among the findability principles are requirements that data be assigned a persistent, global unique identifier (GUID), be described by rich metadata, and be indexed by a system for retrieving the data. Accessibility requires the use of standardized, open (available for implementation to all) communications protocols for retrieval of data by GUID. Interoperability is supported through the use of machine-actionable metadata and data. Reusability requires systems to be compliant in the management of their data objects with the first three principles, specifically so that data and metadata can be linked and integrated across FAIR systems. Each of the authors assessed compliance of four open-access, omics data systems and the GLDS for FAIRness using the current working draft of the FAIRness metrics developed by the GO FAIR Metrics group23 (Table 1). The four systems selected were the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), the Metagenomics Analysis Server (MG-RAST), and Metabolights. We chose the systems for their similarity to the GLDS; all are open-access, government-operated or government-funded, research lab-developed omics data systems. As the FAIR principles themselves are only aspirational, the assessment of the systems can only be at most semi-quantitative, and they would likely be affected by further clarifications or details in the principles and/or metrics which are almost certain to come. We rated systems with Pass when we had no evidence of any failure of a test by the metric. Systems were rated as Partial Pass, if the metric had multiple steps or components, and the system passed some, but not all; or if we had evidence that some data inputs for the metric yielded a pass, while others did not. We chose Fail only if we could find no evidence the system was compliant with any part of the metric, for any inputs we tried. Individually-assessed ratings were then combined into the consensus ratings shown in Table 1 through dialogue among the raters. Finally, we developed an overall FAIRness Score by assigning a score to each rating of 1 for each Pass, 0.5 for each Partial Pass, and 0 for each Fail and totaling these score for each system. Table 1. The FAIR principles, corresponding draft FAIRness metrics, and semi-quantitative FAIRness ratings for select omics data systems. Metrics were those developed by the GO FAIR Metrics23 group. Open in a new tabSummary of FAIRness Assessments There is quite some variability in FAIRness among the omics data systems we assessed using the 14 metrics. The range of Pass ratings was 29-79% of metrics, Partial Pass 0-21%, and Fail 7-50%. The range of overall FAIRness scores was 6-12, with average of 10.1 and standard deviation, 2.4. All the systems were rated best in the areas of data accessibility and reusability, slightly worse in data findability, and far worse in data interoperability.Findability The first findability principle, F1 (Table 1), states that systems should identify data using globally unique and persistent identifiers; the FM-F1A metric focuses on identifier uniqueness, and FM-F1B on identifier persistence. The objective is to make data findable, but the implementation of F1 also supports data accessibility (FAIR principle A1). The qualifier “global” should be interpreted as global within the domain of conceivable use of the data. Thus, it is not sufficient to use locally (system-specific) controlled processes to manage data identifiers24, as this approach can never absolutely guarantee against overlap with other systems’ local identifier schemes. In addition, F1 specifies the persistence of issued identifiers; identification systems that employ Uniform Resource Locators (which rely on alterable domain name resolution) cannot guarantee persistence of identifiers. Among the schemes for providing data identifiers, the most reliable over time are likely to be those that use third-party resolution (versus those that rely on in-house redirection). Third-party resolution identifiers include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and those provided by identifers.org, among others25. All but one of the systems we assessed passed the metric for F1 metric by employing persistent, globally unique identifiers with third party resolution. (MG-RAST only offers such identifiers as an option during data submission, and so was assessed as Partial Pass.) In the biomedical research and clinical practice realms, publishers have now widely selected the DOI scheme for identification and citation of literature; more than 80% of 2015 articles indexed by PubMed have assigned DOIs26. As a consequence, the biomedical community is already (and continues to become more and more) familiar with using these identifiers to retrieve and cite literature. Yet to date only a few omics data repositories have similarly implemented DOIs for data publications. Consequently, actual findability and accessibility of data in these repositories is less than optimal, even though they are technically in compliance with F1, and will continue to be so, unless and until the biomedical community is trained on how to use other identifying schemes for citing data. Furthermore, metadata from these repositories are not currently indexed in DOI meta-indexes (such as the one produced by DataCite27). In order to be compliant with F1 and A1, the GLDS is implementing methods to issue DOIs for all data publications. Additionally, curated metadata records of the publications are transmitted to DataCite27 for meta-indexing, increasing the chances for reuse of GLDS-hosted data. FAIR data also need to be described “with rich metadata” in order to be findable. The draft metric to assess F2 compliance merely requires a metadata description document that specifies a format for machine-readable metadata. The definition of the term “machine-readable” varies somewhat, but it is generally agreed that it cannot be natural language. (Although F2 refers to reusability principles requiring data “have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes” (R1), the metric for F2 does not attempt to assess compliance with principle R1 [perhaps it should]). All the systems we assessed passed this metric. Furthermore, all systems passed F3, requiring association of metadata with data it describes. It should be noted that FM-F3 refers only to IRIs and not broadly to any other kinds of acceptable data identifiers; we assume that ultimately FM-F3 will be broadened to allow other kinds of F1-compliant data identifiers. Also, it is difficult to determine if any of the systems truly support IRIs, given that none of them currently appear to use non-ASCII character encodings in their data identifying schemes. The FAIRness metric FM-F4 is rather ill-defined currently. It requires submission of an identifier of FAIR data and its metadata to search engines (which precisely, it does not yet specify, but some common search engines are mentioned as examples in the comments for the metric). A Pass should be given if the returned search results include links to the published data (again, it does not yet specify where in the returned results, although among both the top 10 and top 40 are mentioned in metric comments). Some of the systems we assessed failed this metric, and it seems their data records are likely not indexed by at least some search engines. For example, search of the MG-RAST data record identified by “http://metagenomics.anl.gov/linkin.cgi?metagenome=mgm4447971.3” or any of its tabular metadata yielded no search results referring to the repository using Google. More of the systems would fail this metric if it required data to be submitted specifically to DOI-based search systems (such as DataCite).Accessibility All of the systems for which we assessed compliance with FAIR principle A1.1 passed; all use open source communication protocols to access data, which are retrieved by their identifiers. FAIR Principle A1.2 stipulates that any protocol used to retrieve data “allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.” All the systems we assessed describe which functions of the system require credentials, and how to obtain the credentials. It should be noted that A1.2 can be applied to the design of all types of systems, from those with highly restricted access controls, to the kinds of “open access” systems we assessed, that typically require minimal authentication and grant the widest possible access to all users. Furthermore, the data in question could be any kind of data, including raw instrument output, shared data analysis workflows or data products, or scientifically-relevant user comments and opinions. Even for open access systems, some systems functions such as user-workspace file management, user commenting and messaging, and user attribution of data always require authentication, because these functions must necessarily leverage user-specific information. A specific challenge that GeneLab faced when implementing A1.2 for the GLDS was a diversity of credentialing services available to the system’s target users, with no single service common to all users. Furthermore, the goal of GeneLab is to maximize access to GLDS data across all kinds of users, but within the bounds of authentication and credentialing policies of NASA - another challenge. Aside from policy restrictions, the development of any new credentialing and authentication functions or services can require considerable resources. A solution for organizations that are seeking to develop open-access systems is to consider investing in development of an organization-wide integrated credentialing and authentication architecture (ICAA, Figure 3), and policies for allowing users to leverage extramural credentials, with appropriate access limitations. ICAAs and attendant policies can provide flexibility to develop and/or deploy data systems with available resources that can meet policy requirements of the organization that support extramural user access. It should be noted that using an ICAA to leverage credentialing systems developed independently from the system requires 1) technical compatibility between the authentication services of credentialing providers and the ICAA; and 2) compatibility of the credentialing policies of credentialing organizations and those of the organization developing the data system. Technical compatibility is facilitated through the use of authentication protocols and standards. Organizational credentialing policy incompatibility is more problematic to resolve. For example, it may be that the organization deploying the data system requires credentials be updated at an interval that is different from that required by one or more extramural credential provider. If these differences cannot be resolved, the only option may be to limit access for some extramural users data system functions requiring authentication. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Use of an Integrated Credentialing and Authentication Architecture (ICAA) to comply with FAIR principle A1.2. The ICAA provides services and policies that use information from intra- and extramural credentialing services to authenticate users of a data system.NASA is developing an ICAA and adopting policies that permit certain intramural data systems to leverage it for user credentials and authentication. These policies stipulates that users within the organization must use the organization’s own credentialing services, while extramural users may authenticate using one from a defined set of externally-managed credentialing systems (currently including authentication by selected “social media” systems, such as Google.com credentials). At NASA (and at most U.S. federal agencies), intramural credentialing is quite a long process involving corroboration of much identifying information. The use of the ICAA, users without NASA credentials can specify a minimum of information (e.g., only a verifiable email address), which they can provide easily through a web browser, and gain almost immediate access to the GLDS. Through use of the ICAA, the GLDS is able to recognize a lower level of confidence when authenticating extramural users, and implement appropriate access controls to some functions for these users (e.g., they may not join system administrator groups). It seems reasonable to suggest that an additional principle be considered when designing FAIR data systems that have at least some functions requiring authentication or authorization (A1.2.1 in Table 2). This principle, would stipulate that an integrated credentialing architecture, like that shown in Figure 3 be leveraged, in order to offer access to data to the widest number of users possible, when and where data policies permit such access. Table 2. Additional principles for optimizing data accessibility Open in a new tabMost of the systems we assessed for FAIR compliance to A2 have some policy to retain at least some metadata when data are removed from the system. It is frequently unclear, however, which metadata were to be retained when data records are removed from the system. Data systems should ensure that policies for retaining metadata are clearly stated, including which metadata and for what period of time. Another factor that specifically affects accessibility to Big Data is data transport. Data to be used as inputs in Big Data systems, but which are not located in the same environment as executable code of the system, commonly must first be transported (duplicated or moved) to the environment first. This environment typically is a user-specific workspace. The transport process for Big Data can require minutes, hours or even days in some Big Data systems, and represents a significant barrier to efficient access. Designers of Big Data would benefit from a principle that stipulates the collocation within Big Data systems of data and executable code (A3 in Table 2).Interoperability I1 stipulates the “use a formal, accessible, etc. language for knowledge representation. The draft metric for this principle requires that the language for data or metadata be available by URL, and have a BNF representation. The comments on the metric suggest additional required language qualities, including that the language must have semantics (“[‘vanilla’] xml and json ..should fail”). While current knowledge representation languages such as RDF and OWL28 are available to generate metadata specifications with inherent semantics, tools that leverage such languages require some sophistication in their use. All the repositories we assessed have metadata specifications that do not have inherent semantics, and thus would not yield a Pass for this metric. Metabolights and the GLDS both use the ISATab metadata specification, which can be converted to RDF, and so were rated with Partial Pass. The metric for principle I2 has a related requirement: that data systems use open, community-developed vocabularies for data and metadata, and that such vocabularies be more than simple keywords (i.e., include semantics in some form). As the ISATab specification supported ontological lookup from such vocabularies, we again only rated Metabolights and the GLDS with Partial Pass, and the rest of the systems as FAIL. In addition to lack of experience with knowledge representation technologies like RDF and OWL, another likely reason for lack of compliance of the systems with I1 and I2 is a general lack of available semantic resources developed by the community to generate metadata specifications and vocabularies, particularly in more recent domains like genomics, proteomics and metabolomics. We have ourselves sought such resources for use in the GLDS development, where we are seeking to provide users with omics data analysis capabilities, an omics “workbench” consisting of user-specific workspaces and data access controls, together with access to a suite of omics analysis tools (see Figure 1b and Figure 1c). Users of these tools will create data processing (analysis) workflows to transform input data into “higher-order” data products, which they will likely want to share with others and/or associate with the workflows and data inputs. One of the challenges we have observed for making these kinds of processed information FAIR include a lack of semantic resources for creating metadata specifications for such processed data and the processing workflows that generate them. While schemas like the Common Workflow Language29 (CWL) specification provide a method to represent and reproduce the mechanics of data processing, they lack domain-specific semantics regarding the nature of these data transformations (e.g., what are the goals of the transformation from a biological perspective? What are the biological data concepts produced in output files? how do these relate to input data elements? etc.). Without these descriptors, systems may not adequately index these processed data and workflows for discovery and retrieval. While sophisticated users (e.g., trained bioinformaticians) who do encounter processed data and workflows may be able to understand and reuse them, others without domain-specific experience and knowledge of omics data processing may not. A challenge for the GLDS will be to help spur the creation of community resources so that it can implement rich metadata for processed omics data and workflows in a timely fashion. The objective of the metric for principle I3 is to measure how much data in one system are linked semantically to data in other systems. It is not surprising that none of the data sources link data “out” to data in external systems in semantically qualified ways; this is a challenging objective for any data system. (We ignored links to records that were merely duplicated between systems) Manual linking of data requires subject matter expertise and can be time-consuming for systems with many data records. Automated linking requires that source and linked data both be characterized semantically so that links may be inferred. As mentioned above, semantic resources for characterizing omics data are by and large still forthcoming.Reusability R1 is referred to by the findability FAIR principle F2 (see above); at this time there is no metric specifically for R1. R1.1 requires data systems to provide licenses for data usage (and is curiously intended to facilitate “legal interoperability” rather than reusability30. All the data repositories we assessed are governmental entities, and as such, licensing is traditionally prohibited. R1.2 and R1.3 require that data are published together with provenance metadata, and that data and metadata conform to community-derived standards, respectively. Such standards include taxonomies, ontologies and other vocabularies for metadata, and data and file formats. The metric for R1.2 involves the demonstration that a system can provide FAIR-compliant citational and contextual provenance metadata. While all the repositories provide such metadata, some do not use FAIR-compliant schemes for these metadata. Similarly, most of the repositories assess and validate submitted data files (but few validate metadata, as discussed above) against FAIR-schemes and formats.Discussion The systems we assessed for FAIRness clearly have shortcomings, particularly in the area of supporting data interoperability. None of the systems currently use a metadata representation language with sufficient semantics. In addition, none fully leverage FAIR vocabularies for metadata. There are perhaps several causes at work for these observations. There are often myriad vocabularies (ontologies) for metadata (each of which is a de facto community standard) even within a given biological sub-domain, and often much overlap in semantic content between them, creating the need for systems to be able to “normalize” input metadata across them somehow. For example, the concept of zero or very low-gravity experimental conditions appears in at least 5 different, widely-used biomedical vocabularies: SNOMED CT, MeSH, Read Codes Clinical Terms, Psychology Ontology, PLOS Thesaurus, and FAST Topical Facet, with varying language for the concept (“weightlessness” vs. “zero gravity”). True semantic interoperability and data reusability that would permit a user to find all data tagged with this concept require either that all these concept instances be individually associated with the data, or use of a system that reliably maps all the concepts from these ever-changing, ever-expanding set of ontologies. Even if such metadata normalizing mechanisms are developed, their performance and value in generating “rich” metadata is dependent on the quality of input concepts supplied either by original data submitters or biodata curators (typically employed by the system). The expertise that submitters have is critical to shaping metadata that have value for many different kinds of audiences, and that allow associated data to be found and reused. In the biomedical field, submitters to shared data repositories have relatively low motivation to go to any great lengths to provide “rich metadata” (or assist biocurators in generating them). This is likely due, at least in part, to the fact that only a small fraction of shared data appears to be cited in publication references when they are reused.31 Without their input, niche repositories and data systems, like the GLDS, with limited resources for acquiring (and maintaining) rich metadata that meet all the criteria above must constantly trade the use of resources to acquire or generate rich metadata with those that could be used for other worthy goals. The findability and interoperability principles, when implemented in data systems, support data integration functions like multi-source data querying and retrieval. Principles F2, I1, I2, and R1.3 require the use of community-developed metadata standards, formal languages for metadata representation, FAIR vocabularies, and qualified references to other data. These principles are unfortunately not yet widely or fully implemented across biomedical data systems, making it difficult for systems to develop functions that integrate data semantically. To illustrate this, we examine our own experience developing the GLDS to provide federated search and retrieval of omics data from several data sources. We sought to import metadata records from three open-access data systems into our own metadata warehouse: GEO, MG-RAST, and the PRoteomics IDEntifications repository (PRIDE)5. Each of these systems defines metadata for omics data sets differently, but none of them make these schemas available in a formal semantic language format (such as RDF or OWL). Furthermore, there are no existing maps of any of the metadata schemas to each other. As such, we resorted to manually creating semantic maps of these schemas for use in our system; queries generated via the GLDS or its RESTful search API are executed against the mapped schema concepts, and matching records are shown in a common object model representation (Figure 4). While this approach met our immediate goals of allowing users to query several data sources using our system, it required a good deal of resources and domain expertise to develop a schema mapping. Furthermore, maintaining this mapping over time as each of the data sources inevitably change will require more of our limited resources. The research community should recognize the value of federated system functions like the querying function that the GLDS offers, and urge all open access repositories and data systems to make their metadata schemas available to all according to the aforementioned FAIR principles. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Federated Search of Omics Data in the GLDS. The RESTful search API result shows 65 records from the four data sources searched (GLDS, GEO, PRIDE, and MG-RAST). Each records metadata is mapped using a single schema for display in the GLDS (see Figure 1a).References 1.Giardine B, Riemer C, Hardison RC, Burhans R, Elnitski L, Shah P, et al.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is one of the major risk factors that will impact the health of astronauts on extended missions outside the protective effects of the Earth’s magnetic field. The NASA GeneLab project has detailed information on radiation exposure using animal models with curated dosimetry information for spaceflight experiments. Methods: We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based and spaceflight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. A range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies, as well as samples flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total doses of 1.0 mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Results: From this analysis, we were able to identify distinct biological signatures associating specific ions with specific biological responses due to radiation exposure in space. For example, we discovered changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune pathways as a function of dose. Conclusions: We provided a summary of how the GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR exposures.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Space is a hostile environment, and human space travel will entail effects at many levels of biological organization leading to related physiological effects. One of the major environmental factors in space is radiation. Ionizing radiation in space is composed of a complex mixture of particles including protons from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system. The GCR is composed of atomic nuclei, including a component of heavy charged and energetic (HZE) particles that are relatively few in number but highly ionizing. A major risk-factor for human spaceflight is exposure GCR HZE that can cause DNA damage that is unrepaired or mis-repaired [1]. Current research has shown measurable impact on in several areas affecting human health bone loss [2], skeletal muscle atrophy [3,4,5], reproductive hazards in women and men [6], cognitive/behavioral changes [7], central nervous system (CNS) decrements [8,9], and changes in cardiovascular physiology [10]. The possibility that space radiation exposure to increase cardiovascular disease risk requires additional validation similar to the ongoing observations of increased cardiac impairment observed in radiotherapy-treated cancer survivors [11,12]. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks [13], possibly increasing carcinogenic risk [14]. At the molecular level, space radiation from high energy photons and atomic nuclei can cause damage to cellular components, in particular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Damaged DNA, which is inadequately repaired, can led to mutations and chromosomal aberrations that have potential to propagate into RNA, potentially leading to cancer. Simulations using ground-based datasets representative of a combined space radiation and microgravity exposure have demonstrated that oxidative stress processes and mitochondrial dysfunctions are important contributors to biological effects from spaceflight. Simulated microgravity studies have demonstrated an inhibitory effect on cell cycle and cell proliferation [15]. These studies show the value of research centered on understanding the totality of space exposures [16]. A multitude of other biological processes that are affected include increased genomic instability and mutation rates [17], immune dysregulation [18], and deregulated cellular energetics [19]. Conflicting results on cellular stemness [20] have been reported with effects such as elongation of telomere and altered telomerase function that require clarification [21,22]. A substantial amount of work has also been generated in the area of omics. For several decades, omics animal-based studies have been performed to understand the human health risks due to spaceflight missions using the International Space Station, the space shuttle, biosatellites, and ground-based experiments. NASA’s growing GeneLab omics database now hosts almost 250 experimental studies on spaceflight exposure and analogous ground-based experiments from microbes, plants, animal models, and human/animal-derived cell cultures [23]. These data are available as an open-access resource for single- and multi-omic analyses on microarray, RNA-sequencing, bisulfite-sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets. Although these data are targeted to better understand the risks associated with human spaceflight, these experiments also demonstrate a unique stress that provides a better understanding of adverse human health effects due to alterations in cellular behavior owing to factors such as microgravity, altered carbon dioxide levels, psychological stressors, and damaging ionizing radiation exposures from GCR and protons in the Earth’s radiation belts. These datasets, and in particular the in vivo animal models used, present a unique experimental setting to study the cellular and host-level interactions that impact human health. In this study, a meta-analysis of these accumulated transcriptomic datasets in GeneLab relevant to spaceflight was undertaken to uncover potential dose-dependent biological responses that will help in understanding the human health risks experienced in the spaceflight environment. The studies identified were from human- and animal-derived tissues or cells exposed to protons and GCR HZEs at doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies and using samples flown to the International Space Station or shuttle missions with total doses between 1.0 and 30 mGy. Ground experiments are a well-established analog for space flight, but are limited in that they are relatively high dose, high dose rate, and in most cases use single particle species, in contrast to the low dose, low dose rate mixed radiation in space. Further work is needed to elucidate platform-dependent differences (mixed fields now being offered at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory [24] are a step in this direction). The datasets were pooled and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify clusters of gene sets and associated biological processes. The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined effects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Chromosomal and Subsitution Error Rate Mapping Two mouse liver RNA-sequencing datasets (GLDS-168 and GLDS-242) from NASA spaceflight experiments were specifically analyzed for chromosomal or substitution error rates. Compressed fastq files were cleaned using TRIM galore (v0.6.4, https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Docs/Trim_Galore_User_Guide.md) to remove adapters and bases falling below a Q20 Phred quality score. Paired reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 reference genome using bowtie2 (v2.3.4.1,) and the output piped through samtools to generate a bam file. The bam file had read group information added and was coordinate sorted using Picard tools (v2.21.3,). Mapping metrics were calculated using Picard tools and final mismatches (MN flag) extracted with genomic coordinates using Bedtools (v2.26.0, https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Data were analyzed in R to determine the frequency of mismatches with respect to chromosome number and plotted. Mapping quality data from Picard tools was analyzed using GraphpadPrism (v7.0, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). 4.2. Bioinformatics, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and Visulization Using Cytoscape The transcriptome datasets used for this study were from openly available data housed by NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov,). There was a total of 25 GeneLab datasets (GLDS) with 30 experimental comparisons from RNA-sequencing or microarray platforms (Table 1). Data pre-processing was performed as previously published to obtain normalized expression values for the majority of the datasets [32,33,42]. For GLDS-73, human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were exposed to gamma-rays (1 Gy or 3 Gy), iron (56Fe), or silicon (26Si) particles (0.5 Gy or 1 Gy each). RNA extraction was executed 1 hr after exposure and the transcriptome data were evaluate by microarray technology using the Illumina HumanWG-6 V2 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) [52]. The raw data files were normalized using the quantile method and then background subtraction was performed using R Package PIMENTo (v1.0). Fold-change values between spaceflight/radiation exposure versus ground/control samples were calculated and used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA,) with three molecular signature dataset collections (C2, C5, and C6 gene sets) [54]. These results were imported into Cytoscape (v3.7) for further visualization and interpretation by the Enrichment Map tool [96]. Only gene set nodes with a false-detection rate (FDR) < 0.25 in at least 50% of the total datasets analyzed were considered for network evaluation. To reduce the complexity of the newly developed networks, we utilized the AutoAnnotate tool (v1.3.2, http://baderlab.org/Software/AutoAnnotate) in Cytoscape to group-related gene set nodes together. The newly annotated gene sets were then used for further analysis. 4.3. Principal Component Analysis, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, k-Means Clustering, Heatmaps, and Generalized Additive Model Fits The GSEA-produced nominal enrichment scores (NES) were compared using principle component analysis (PCA) plots from the R-program pca3d (v0.10, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pca3d/pca3d.pdf) [97], and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots using R-program Rtsne (v0.15, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rtsne/Rtsne.pdf). Further characterization was performed by hierarchical k-means clustering on the NES. Heatmaps were generated using the R-program pheatmap (v1.0.12, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/pheatmap.pdf). The auto-annotated gene sets for each k-means cluster were then plotted with the NES versus the dose for associated for each GeneLab dataset (Table 1) with R-program ggplot2 (v3.2.1,). Data points were then fit using a generalized additive model (GAM) [55,56] across all dose ranges from 1 to 1000 mGy with R-program mgcv (v1.8-28, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/mgcv.pdf) 4.4. Analysis on Common Individual Genes with Fold-Change Values and Fits as a Function of Dose A total of 19 spaceflight studies and 3 ground studies were selected from the GeneLab database. Table 1 summarizes the datasets including the tissue, species, the radiation type, and the measured dose. From each study, the fold-change value between irradiated and control for each gene was calculated. For spaceflight studies, the log2 fold-change was computed as the ratio of the spaceflight measurement to a ground control value. In studies where terrestrial measurements for ground control values were made in both an animal enclosure module (AEM, also referred to as the Rodent Habitat) and a vivarium, the AEM ground control value was used due to the similar module conditions experienced by tissue in the spaceflight AEMs. For the terrestrial studies that simulated space radiation, the experimental values were the samples that were irradiated with a specific ion (i.e., 56Fe, 26Si, or proton) compared to the sham unirradiated samples closest to the time of irradiation. Across all of the studies, the most common genes probed were chosen, which produced nine genes present with all the GLDS sets used for this manuscript. A polynomial of degree 2 was fit to the data in the range 1–1000 mGy for all datasets. For fits involving only spaceflight samples and only muscle tissues, due to the smaller range of doses up to 30 mGy, data were fit using a polynomial of degree 1. All fits were performed using a chi-square method via CERN’s ROOT toolkit (v.6.18/02,) [98]. The nine genes were entered in ToppCluster [99] to determine the predicted pathways and functions these genes will impact. The results from ToppCluster were imported into Cytoscape, where the predicted functions were displayed as a network.",
    "results": "2. Results Using primarily in vivo animal models and their associated curated datasets available from the NASA GeneLab’s omics database, an examination of biological responses as a function of radiation dose was made using transcriptional and sequencing data. A total of 30 experimental conditions from 25 GeneLab Data System (GLDS) datasets were collected (Table 1). Multiple datasets were included from human or murine cell cultures or animal tissues from several anatomical sites (adrenal gland, blood, bone marrow, brain, breast, heart, cartilage, skin, eye, hair follicle, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, or thymus). For the simulated space radiation ground studies (GLDS-73, -80, -109, and -117) information related to energy, linear energy transfer (LET, a measure of energy deposition at the cellular and molecular scale), dose rate, particle charge, and particle mass are available and can be viewed in Table S1. The dose data for all spaceflight experiments, with the exception of GLDS-111, were from instruments available on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. Analysis was completed by subject matter experts from the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), Johnson Space Center, NASA. The provenance of data from GLDS-111 (Bion-M1) is detailed in the environmental data section of the GLDS for Bion-M1. The doses and dose rates for ground-based exposures are from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory with uncertainties that are less than 2% [24]. Table 1.

Changes in RNA-Specific Error Rates Comparing Spaceflight Versus Ground Control Samples DNA mutations caused by ionizing radiation have been shown to propagate onto RNA during translation, unless they are adequately removed by transcription-coupled repair. Higher doses of radiation exposure to a cell will result in greater accumulated damage, up to a point where the cellular repair mechanisms are overwhelmed. However, lower levels of damage may be replicated into RNA with aberrant effects on translation and cellular function. Thus, RNA-sequencing data using mice liver samples from two experiments were analyzed to identify potential error rates due to spaceflight. Analysis of the GLDS-168 dataset showed no difference in overall mapping error rates across the entire genome (approximately 0.5%). Further investigation of the mismatches with respect to each chromosome identified error rates to be near 0.5%; however, there was no difference between the spaceflight and ground control groups (Figure 1A,B). Interestingly, there were differential error rates across some chromosomes, in particular the sex-associated chromosomes, and error rates for genes associated with mitochondrial DNA were lower than genomic DNA, supporting dynamic DNA damage repair in mitochondria (reviewed in [53]). Further analysis revealed increased rates of substitution in specific base sequences in GLDS-168 samples (Figure 1C) but not in the GLDS-242 dataset (Figure 1D). Specific base substitutions showed an increase in A>G and C>T substitutions in only GLDS-168 samples. We also observed a significant increase in CGT and GTA errors but a decrease in CAC and GTG errors in spaceflight animals versus ground controls (all corrected p < 0.05; Figure 1E). In contrast the GLDS-242 dataset showed an overall reduction, though non-significant, in specific base errors with a significant change in substitutions (p < 0.05, corrected) in spaceflight animals compared to ground controls (Figure 1D,F). Figure 1. Open in a new tab RNA-sequencing error rates in mouse livers from GLDS-168 (left column) and GLDS-242 (right column) experiments for spaceflight (black bars) compared to ground control samples (white bars). Error rates were examined as follows: (A,B) mismatch rates across chromosomes normalized by the number of bases sequenced; (C,D) single base substitution rates; (E,F) CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates. Significance indicated by * p-value < 0.05 and ** p-value < 0.01. 2.2. Comparison of Multiple Genelab Datasets Using Principal Component Analysis Each individual transcriptome dataset was analyzed by comparing flight/radiation exposure versus ground/control treatment. Utilizing standard bioinformatics pipelines for RNA-sequencing and microarray analyses, we obtained expression data for each dataset for use in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [54]. The results indicated a wide variance of significantly regulated gene sets per dataset (Figure 2). When considering a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, we observed some datasets with a low number of significantly regulated gene sets, whereas others had a high amount of significant results for the three GSEA molecular signature database collections (i.e., C5, C2, and C6). Thus, for further analysis, individual gene sets were considered for analysis if they had a FDR < 0.25 in 50% or more of the total datasets examined. Then, using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper, these gene sets were grouped into networks and further examined using the auto-annotate feature to cluster similar gene sets on the basis of biological similarity, referred to as “annotated gene sets”. Figure 2. Open in a new tab The number of statistically significant gene sets from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 for each dataset for the major molecular signatures database collections (i.e., C5, C2, and C6). The black bars represent the unaltered genes and the white bars represent the annotated gene sets.To observe if any trends or batch issues arise from this type of analysis, we compared the normalized enrichment scores (NES) for all the gene sets resulting from each molecular signature database collection (Figure 3 and Figures S1–S3). Principal component analysis (PCA) plots indicated that there were no batch issues occurring globally for either the pre- or post-annotated gene sets as a function of dose (Figure 3). In addition, we did not observe any tissue dependence or clustering for the pre- or post-annotated gene sets (Figure S1). Lastly, these samples were also clustered with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots to observe whether different methods would produce conflicting results (Figures S2 and S3). The t-SNE plots also provided additional validation that no batch issues are observed with this type of analysis when considering dose or tissue dependence. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Principal component analysis (PCA) plots on GLDS datasets using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) nominal enrichment scores before (top row) and after (bottom row) auto-annotation using Cytoscape’s enrichment map software. GSEA gene sets used were as follows: (A,B) C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, (C,D) C2 curated terms, and (E,F) C6 oncogenic signature terms. Each data point is represented by experimental radiation dose (color) or radiation type (shape).To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES for each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR < 0.25 (Figure 4). As expected, the annotated gene sets provided fewer gene sets, enabling a more streamlined analysis downstream. The overall pattern of the datasets between the annotated gene sets and all the genes sets did not change. This indicates that any analysis on the annotated gene sets should provide similar results for all the gene sets. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Heatmaps on all gene sets and also annotated gene sets for each molecular signature database collection. Euclidean clustering was used for clustering the rows and columns. 2.3. Transcriptome Evaluation of Biological Functions Impacted by Spaceflight Exposure in Animal Models To observe the impact of radiation exposure, transcriptional data from experiments spanning 1 to 1000 mGy doses in animal models and cell cultures were examined for alteration in multiple biological pathways. This analysis combined statistically significant biological pathways that resulted from GSEA analysis for each individual dataset [54]. This included the following three major molecular signatures database collections: (1) the Gene Ontology (GO; C5) gene sets from biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions; (2) the curated dataset (C2) gene sets from chemical and genetic perturbations and canonical pathways such as the BioCarta, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Pathway Interaction Database (PID), and Reactome pathway databases; and (3) the oncogenic signatures (C6) gene sets representing major pathways altered in cancer. 2.3.1. GSEA C5: Gene Ontology Results Using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper, 63 statistically significant GSEA gene sets from the Gene Ontology (C5) database had a FDR < 25% in 50% or more of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Using the auto-annotate clustering tool, these 63 gene sets represented 7 major biological pathways including: (1) ribosome assembly, (2) mitochondrial function, (3) interferon-gamma response, (4) chemotaxis, (5) cellular differentiation, (6) extracellular organization, and (7) cytokine production (Figure 5A). Each of these clusters was driven by an overrepresented enrichment of genes related to these pathways. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with Gene Ontology (GO) GSEA analysis. (A) Auto-annotated GO GSEA terms from Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper. Each node represents one specific GO term with each wedge representing one GeneLab datasets utilized for this manuscript. The yellow circles represent the auto-annotated go terms with common related pathways. (B) Heatmap with k-means clustering for the specific GO pathways. Six specific pathways were found to be clustered together through k-means clustering. (C) Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in milligrays and fitting with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in (C)). Each panel represents one of the clusters and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on each GO-annotated term in the cluster. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error.In addition to understanding common biological pathways disrupted by spaceflight and ground-based radiation exposure, these results were also used to examine possible dose-dependent trends. Using a k-means clustering of the heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, six major annotated clusters were overwhelmingly represented this data, including (1) mitochondrial pathways, (2) leukocyte and adaptive immune response, (3) wound healing and VEGF pathways, (4) ribosome, (5) lipid pathways, and (6) mitotic nuclear division (Figure 5B). The nominal enrichment score (NES) for these annotated gene sets was plotted from 1mGy to 1000 mGy and fitted using a generalized additive model (GAM) smoothing plot [55,56] (Figure 5C). Indeed, there was an observed activation as a function of dose for the mitochondrial pathway, whereas the clusters for the ribosome, lipid pathways, and mitotic nuclear division were generally inactivated. A more uncertain trend was observed for the immune related clusters involving leukocyte and adaptive immune response as well as wound healing and VEGF pathways, demonstrating the complex nature of normal tissue responses to inflammation and immune responses. We also performed an analysis with less stringent statistics, involving a larger set of gene sets, to observe whether other functions or pathways would appear. We performed the same analysis as above but included significant GSEA gene sets from the Gene Ontology (C5) database that had an FDR < 0.05 in only three of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Although the FDR was set at a lower threshold, the lower number of required datasets with an FDR < 0.05 threshold (Figure 2) would result in more gene sets for the downstream analysis. We saw this as true when observing the number of gene sets (Figure S4). Some k-means clusters were too dense and were split into sub-clusters (Figures S5 and S6). The GAM fits were provided for each cluster and sub-cluster (Figures S7–S9). As expected, this less stringent analysis approach produced less statistically significant fits with more noise confounding the data. Interestingly, some new trends appeared that can be related to space radiation-induced health risks, including decreases in muscle-related pathways as a function of increasing dose (Figure S7) and decreases in chromosome pathways with increasing dose (Figure S8). This inclusive analysis strategy demonstrated that analyzing the data in many different ways can reveal relevant results when that can easily be missed with only one methodology and overly strict statistical cutoffs. 2.3.2. GSEA C2: Curated Dataset Results To expand these results, the canonical pathways (C2) molecular signatures database collection was examined in a similar manner to the gene ontology collection (C5) above. For this analysis, there were 30 total datasets as opposed to 28 for the C5 gene set analysis. We determined 411 significantly regulated C2 gene sets using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper with an FDR ≤ 25% in 50% of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Due to the C2 GSEA database containing more gene sets, a larger number of gene sets and auto-annotated terms was expected. From these terms, we observed several key pathways, including mitotic and cell cycle pathways, cancer-related pathways, hypoxia-related pathways, interferon pathways, and pathways related to radiation impact on cells (Figure 6A). Cell cycle pathways [57], hypoxia [58], interferon dysregulation [59], and cancer [60,61,62] have all been observed in previous research studies as dysregulated due to spaceflight. Figure 6.

Each panel represents one of the clusters and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on each C2-annotated term in the cluster. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error.We performed a similar analysis with C2 genes sets as we did with the C5 dose-dependent analysis (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Using k-means clustering for heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, 15 major annotated clusters overwhelmingly represented these data, including (1) hypoxia, MYC, and phospholipid pathways; (2) EGF, TNF, and hematopoietic pathways; (3) E2F3, EGFR2, p53, and cell cycle pathways; (4) luminal, miR-21 targets, KRAS, and transformation pathways; (5) RB1, metastasis, mitotic division, and progenitor pathways; (6) hematopoiesis, interferons, and methylation pathways; (7) obesity-, oxidation-, and adipogenic-related pathways; (8) mitochondrial and adipogenesis pathways; (9) complex EIF binding; (10) progesterone; (11) apoptosis and phospholipid pathways; (12) inflammatory, invasion, NOTCH, and HNF1a pathways; (13) carcinoma, hypoxia, and IL1a pathways; (14) PKD1, ZMPSTE24, and cardiac dysfunctions; and (15) ICP with H3K27ME3 pathway (Figure 6B,C). Similar to the C5 GO analysis, we observed an increase in mitochondrial pathways as a function of dose. Observing this trend with another pathway database provided additional confidence with these results. A clear decrease with cardiac dysfunctions, PKD1, and ZMPSTE24 was revealed as a function of dose. Interestingly, deficiencies or decreases in both PKD1 [63] and ZMPSTE24 [64] expression have been previously shown to cause cardiac dysfunction. These observed biological functions seem to follow a trend that may have be missed by manual analysis. Lastly, less stringent statistics with an FDR < 0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets was also analyzed for C2 gene sets (Figures S10–S17). Like the C5 analysis, more gene sets were clustered per group after k-means clustering (Figure S10), leading to three clusters requiring additional k-means sub-clustering analysis (Figures S11–S13). This less statistically stringent analysis on C2 produced additional trends through the GAM fits that were not observed in the more conservative analysis (Figures S14–S17). A clear decrease in TNF pathways was observed with increasing dose (Figure S16), and a novel pathway related to taste transduction was observed as increasing with dose (Figure S17). Interestingly, it has been reported that both olfactory pathways and taste are altered in astronauts, which was previously thought to be due to fluid shifts in the head caused by microgravity conditions [65,66,67]. These data also indicate that space radiation may have some impact on this interesting phenomenon.2.3.3. GSEA C6: Oncogenic Signatures To observe specific oncogenic pathways that may change as a function of space radiation exposure, we also included an analysis of the GSEA C6 oncology-specific collection from the molecular signatures database (Figure 7). From the annotation analysis, we discovered that the main oncogenic pathway impacted by space radiation was KRAS (Figure 7A). KRAS is a known oncogene and has been heavily shown in the literature to be involved with lung cancer induced by space radiation [14]. The k-means clustering on the annotated gene sets produced the following five clusters: (1) KRAS- and LEF1-related pathways; (2) p53-, mTOR-, KRAS-, and CRX-related pathways; (3) PDGF- and TGFβ-related pathways; (4) TBK1, VEGFA, and ERBB2 pathways; and (5) embryonic stem cells (ESC) pathway (Figure 7B). When observing each cluster as a function of dose, there were interesting trends that can shed light on predicting potential oncogenic risk for longer exposure to space radiation. Thus, the following known oncogenes as well as the most regulated C6 oncogenic signatures were specifically analyzed as a function of dose for all datasets: (1) KRAS, (2) CSR, (3) p53, (4) ESC, (5) TGFβ, (6), VEGFa, and (7) mTOR pathways (Figure 8). These trends as a function of dose across multiple experimental datasets emphasized a need to functionally valid these observations. Figure 7.

Each panel represents one of the clusters and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on each C6-annotated term in the cluster. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error.Figure 8. Open in a new tab Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with the GSEA C6 oncology signature collection analysis. Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in milligrays and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on specific C6 oncogenes. Each panel represents one specific oncogene and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on the multiple C6 pathways associated with that oncogene. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error.As in the previous sections, we also performed analysis with less stringent statistics with a FDR < 0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets analyzed for C6 gene sets (Figures S18–S21). Because there are fewer gene sets in the C6 database, this analysis started to yield some of the same results as the analysis with the higher thresholds. The GAM fits for each cluster and sub-cluster produced similar results, with one sub-cluster purely associated with TGFβ demonstrating the same trend (Figure S21). Interestingly, one cluster associated with TBK1 did not appear in the higher threshold analysis and demonstrated a clear decrease in as a function of dose (Figure S20). Lastly, a major oncogene MYC [68,69] did not show up in the higher threshold analysis, whereas in this analysis MYC was clearly being activated with increasing dose (Figure S20), indicating that space radiation exposure would increase the potential for carcinogenesis. 2.4. Common Genes as a Function of Dose and Association with Biological Pathways To look at specific genes that might be common across all datasets, we performed analysis on the log2 fold-change values for all datasets. Nine genes (COPB2, UBE2D3, LYPLA2, ARF1, COPB1, CAPNS1, PHB2, DAD1, PRPF8) identified to be common across the spaceflight missions (1.0 to 30 mGy) and ground studies (0.1 to 1.0 Gy) were plotted as a function of dose and average log2 fold-change and fit to a complex polynomial model. These genes, which were expressed across the various tissue types, displayed no significant expression effects from spaceflight up to 100 mGy. At doses higher than 100 mGy, a slight deviation from baseline expression was observed (Figure 9A). The spaceflight studies alone showed slight fluctuations in expression across the identified gene sets (Figure 9B). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Common genes across all datasets. (A) Log2 fold-change with respect to dose for a subset of 9 genes that appeared across all 19 spaceflight studies and 3 ground studies. A polynomial of degree 2 was fit to each dose response in the range 1–1000 mGy. (B) Log2 fold-change with respect to dose for a subset of nine genes that appeared across spaceflight studies in the range 1–30 mGy. A polynomial of degree 1 was fit to each dose response. (C) Log2 fold-change with respect to dose for a subset of nine genes that appeared across all eight spaceflight studies specifically related to the muscle tissues. A polynomial of degree 1 was fit to each dose response in the range 1–30 mGy. The dashed lines denote the +/-1 sigma errors on the fitted polynomials. (D) The functional impact of the nine common genes determined by ToppCluster [70] and displayed using Cytoscape.A focused analysis of only the muscle tissue datasets identified a subset of nine different genes that were differentially expressed across the spaceflight studies from 0 to 30 mGy (Figure 9C). These genes displayed dose-response trends. The nine common genes associated with all tissue types were associated with pathways centered on Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum transport and post-translational protein modifications (Figure 9D). In addition, these genes also were predicted to regulated phospholipid activity, immune dysregulation, and embryonic lethality. We observed these pathways to also be involved with our GSEA analysis as a function of dose.",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion Here, we presented a novel approach in using publicly available transcriptomic data to determine potential health risks and dysregulation of biological pathways as a function of space radiation exposure. The use of NASA’s GeneLab platform [23] allowed us to mine data that might not have otherwise been possible to obtain from individual experimental datasets. The large number of radiation datasets available through this platform allowed the creative combination of different datasets from former experiments to generate new hypotheses [71]. Our hypothesis for this work suspected that there was a tissue independent dysregulation as a function of space radiation-absorbed dose that impacted key biological pathways associated with increased health risks such as induction of cancer. Because the GeneLab Data System contains spaceflight transcriptomic data from mice and tissues flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) for various time durations, we were able to obtain accumulated space radiation doses from 1 to 30 mGy. To obtain doses that will be more relevant to long-term deep space travel [7,14], we combined our analysis with simulated space radiation ground experiments performed in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory [24]. These experiments were performed on both mice and in vitro cell cultures with single ions (protons, 56Fe, and 26Si) at doses from 100 to 1000 mGy. By combining 25 GeneLab datasets over these doses, this work represents the first time a study has provided a comprehensive biological analysis and produced relevant and novel results indicating which relevant biological processes are being regulated as a function of space radiation exposure. These results may be further utilized to generate health risk assessment models and uncover potential targets for mitigation of space radiation effects via novel therapeutics. We chose to first look at the distribution of mapping errors within the RNA-sequencing results from liver samples by examining whether mice exposure to spaceflight resulted in detectable changes compared to ground controls. We chose to focus on liver tissue datasets from GeneLab with mice exposed to space radiation because on in the GLDS liver is the organ with the largest number of sequenced tissue thus far from rodent research missions [71]. This extremely novel analysis demonstrates how RNA-sequence data can be used to generate useful data other than the standard techniques to generate counts. With a cumulative exposure of 9.20 mGy for GLDS-168 mice, significant increases in A > G and C > T base substitutions were detected, as well as changes in CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates (Figure 1). However, there were no significant base-specific substitutions detected, and CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates all decreased significantly in GLDS-242 where mice received a cumulative dose of 8.03 mGy; however, due to the uncertainty inherent in the flight dosimetry, it was not possible to definitively determine whether this was the case. A major difference potentially impacting the observed differences between GLDS-168 and GLDS-242 was the animal sacrificing time at sample collection, which occurred during spaceflight for GLDS-168, but was 2 weeks after returning to Earth for GLDS-242. The recovery time for the mice after 2 weeks back on Earth might possibly allow recovery of the base substitutions and error rates observed during exposure to space radiation. The ability to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA and DNA datasets has been performed previously on the basis of the assumption of a homogeneous genomic sample for example from a tumor [70], whereas the sporadic and stochastic nature of HZE exposure is expected to result in random damage throughout the genome [72]. Therefore, approaches to map SNVs on the basis of bulk tissue approaches may not be able to account for the stochastic nature of the SNV damage accumulated in a tissue. Our interpretation of these results was that the spaceflight animals may have experienced more DNA damage/mutation than ground controls, but in the animals that were returned to Earth, the recovery of the animals allowed for repair to take place. Next, purely on the basis of statistical analysis, we were able to determine key biological functions that were being dysregulated as a function of space radiation. For example, in the C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figure 5C), ribosomal pathways were observed as decreasing with dose. Ribosomal assembly consisted of a number of ribosomal protein large (rpl) genes that are necessary in the assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome 60S subunit, as well as the ribosomal protein small genes involved 40S and/or 60S subunit assembly. Indeed, ribosome-related genes have been previously reported to be disrupted following exposure to ionizing radiation [73,74,75]. We observed a clear trend of increased activation of mitochondrial-related pathways in multiple different pathway databases, which include both the C5 GO terms (Figure 5C) and C2 curated gene sets (Figure 6C). Mitochondrial gene expression is susceptible to radiation-sensitivity [76]. A number of gene sets in these clusters showed dysregulation of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDUF) gene family and mitochondria-related function, in agreement with effects of ionizing radiation on the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in previous studies [77,78,79]. This is especially relevant to human health, as the NASA Twins Study recently revealed mitochondrial stress and increased mitochondrial debris in the blood [21]. A distinct elicitation of inflammatory and immune-related cellular functions was also observed in this analysis with alteration in chemokine, cytokine, and interferon expression (Figure 5C and Figure 6C). Indeed, it has been very well appreciated that ionizing radiation exposure will cause both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory expression as cellular signals attempt to resolve the unique normal tissue radiation injury that occurs both acutely and longer-term [80,81,82]. This immune signaling dysregulation has also been reported to occur when exposed to space radiation [83,84]. We also explored the potential cancer risk as a function of space radiation. The datasets we utilized for this study were from both in vitro and in vivo samples that did not have any cancer present and were not prone to induction of cancer. From our analysis, we observed several interesting results indicative of increased risk for the induction of cancer. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGFβ were clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster 3 in Figure 7C). This observation is closely tied to previously established findings. In the literature, PDGF and TGFβ are closely related to cancer progression [85]. In addition, it has been shown in the clinic that decreases in PDGF and TGFβ levels after radiotherapy for breast cancer can cause echocardiographic alterations affecting cardiovascular morbidity [86]. We also observed the highest frequency of the KRAS pathway, a known oncogene [87], being impacted as a function dose (Figure 7A). It has been previously described in experiments with single ion species that KRAS can induce lung cancer due to HZE particles [14]. Our tissue-independent analysis did not demonstrate any significant induction of KRAS with increasing dose (cluster 1 in Figure 7C and Figure 8). This might indicate that either previous experiments done with single ions at higher HZE doses did not capture the dose-dependent trend in tissues, or when considering the full spectrum of ions at lower doses KRAS might not be the key driver in inducing tumor growth. Other oncogenic trends we observed were decreases in CSR, ESC, TGFβ, VEGFA, and mTOR C6 pathway levels as a function of increasing radiation dose (Figure 7 and Figure 8). TGFβ, VEGFa, and mTOR have all previously shown similar trends with increasing dose of simulated space radiation [32,88]. The ESC C6 term is refers to differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) [89]. This rather surprising result indicates that increasing dose of space radiation reduces the efficiency of stem cell differentiation. It has been reported that after ionizing radiation exposure, mitochondria are heavily involved with stem cell development [90]. Exploiting these different pathway databases (i.e., GO, C2, and C6) provided key insights on how these different pathway trends are intertwined. The CSR C6 term refers to “common serum response” (CSR) specifically related to fibroblast serum [91]. Fibroblast serum response refers to factors released in the serum from fibroblasts involved in assisting with wound healing during tumorigenesis [91]. We can relate the decrease to the CSR pathways to what we observed in the GO analysis (cluster 3 in Figure 5) related to wound healing and VEGF pathways. We also observed with that wound healing should decrease with increasing doses of space radiation. This decrease can also reduce wound healing due to CSR and has shown that it can lead to tumorigenesis [91]. In addition, it has been reported that impairment occurs in space wound healing [92,93], and these data can potentially indicate an increased chance for tumor induction. These observed trends as a function of space radiation exposure revealed unique pathways that seem to be specifically related to GCR, whereas some pathways from our analysis are known to be universal responses to radiation. The mechanisms of damage are common to highly ionizing radiation regardless of the source [94]; what is unique to chronic space radiation exposure is the combination of highly ionizing particles, low dose, and a low dose rate, which may have implications for DNA repair [17], mitochondrial pathways [16], and lipid pathways [42] as just a few examples of what emerged from our analysis. In addition, we found specific cancer-related pathways that may be unique to space radiation. For example, decreases in TGFβ [32], embryonic stem cells (ESC) [95], and VEGFa seem to be unique to space radiation. Spaceflight studies have previously revealed a plethora of effects that radiation can have at individual doses or over a small range of discreet doses. However, the pooling and meta-analysis of these datasets in this study allowed for a unique visualization and comparison over a larger range of radiation doses. This in turn made it possible to identify trends in physiological response from low to high doses and provided insight into the response to accumulating doses that may occur in long duration space missions or over a few days during solar particle events. This technique may also be utilized to determine potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, because we report that mitochondrial pathways decrease as a function of space radiation, this argues for additional validation and research on specific mitochondrial targets for countermeasure development. In addition, from this analysis we can extrapolate to specific doses that may pose greater health risks. This analysis can only be done by utilizing a large number of datasets that are available from platforms such as NASA’s GeneLab. The resolution obtained from this analysis can easily be lost once we lower the number datasets that will be used. Our analysis has indicated several different health risks that may occur with increasing exposure to space radiation. Through an unbiased technique purely driven by statistics and utilizing a large amount of transcriptomic data from NASA’s GeneLab platform, we were able to identify tissue-independent biological pathways that are dysregulated as a function of space radiation dose. We believe this technique can further be used with other datasets and databases to generate more hypotheses that will assist with determining optimal therapeutic countermeasures and targets that can mitigate space radiation response in humans.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions This work is an example of how GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be exploited to better understand the effects of ionizing radiation and the resulting potential risks to humans. This large-scale analysis of multiple transcriptome datasets including RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets provides a valuable examination of dose-dependent perturbations of cellular function across multiple tissue types in animal models. Individually, these experiments were limited by flight duration, resulting in a single accumulated dose from a micture of particles or, in ground-based studies, exposure to a single particle species. When analyzing multiple molecular databases using our approach to many omics datasets, a more comprehensive analysis of significantly impacted biological factors can be obtained than was previously possible.",

Copyright notice ID: 7072278 PMID: 32045996 Abstract Background: Ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is one of the major risk factors that will impact the health of astronauts on extended missions outside the protective effects of the Earth’s magnetic field. The NASA GeneLab project has detailed information on radiation exposure using animal models with curated dosimetry information for spaceflight experiments. Methods: We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based and spaceflight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. A range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies, as well as samples flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total doses of 1.0 mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Results: From this analysis, we were able to identify distinct biological signatures associating specific ions with specific biological responses due to radiation exposure in space. For example, we discovered changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune pathways as a function of dose. Conclusions: We provided a summary of how the GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR exposures.

Introduction Space is a hostile environment, and human space travel will entail effects at many levels of biological organization leading to related physiological effects. One of the major environmental factors in space is radiation. Ionizing radiation in space is composed of a complex mixture of particles including protons from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system. The GCR is composed of atomic nuclei, including a component of heavy charged and energetic (HZE) particles that are relatively few in number but highly ionizing. A major risk-factor for human spaceflight is exposure GCR HZE that can cause DNA damage that is unrepaired or mis-repaired [1]. Current research has shown measurable impact on in several areas affecting human health bone loss [2], skeletal muscle atrophy [3,4,5], reproductive hazards in women and men [6], cognitive/behavioral changes [7], central nervous system (CNS) decrements [8,9], and changes in cardiovascular physiology [10]. The possibility that space radiation exposure to increase cardiovascular disease risk requires additional validation similar to the ongoing observations of increased cardiac impairment observed in radiotherapy-treated cancer survivors [11,12]. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks [13], possibly increasing carcinogenic risk [14]. At the molecular level, space radiation from high energy photons and atomic nuclei can cause damage to cellular components, in particular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Damaged DNA, which is inadequately repaired, can led to mutations and chromosomal aberrations that have potential to propagate into RNA, potentially leading to cancer. Simulations using ground-based datasets representative of a combined space radiation and microgravity exposure have demonstrated that oxidative stress processes and mitochondrial dysfunctions are important contributors to biological effects from spaceflight. Simulated microgravity studies have demonstrated an inhibitory effect on cell cycle and cell proliferation [15]. These studies show the value of research centered on understanding the totality of space exposures [16]. A multitude of other biological processes that are affected include increased genomic instability and mutation rates [17], immune dysregulation [18], and deregulated cellular energetics [19]. Conflicting results on cellular stemness [20] have been reported with effects such as elongation of telomere and altered telomerase function that require clarification [21,22]. A substantial amount of work has also been generated in the area of omics. For several decades, omics animal-based studies have been performed to understand the human health risks due to spaceflight missions using the International Space Station, the space shuttle, biosatellites, and ground-based experiments. NASA’s growing GeneLab omics database now hosts almost 250 experimental studies on spaceflight exposure and analogous ground-based experiments from microbes, plants, animal models, and human/animal-derived cell cultures [23]. These data are available as an open-access resource for single- and multi-omic analyses on microarray, RNA-sequencing, bisulfite-sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets. Although these data are targeted to better understand the risks associated with human spaceflight, these experiments also demonstrate a unique stress that provides a better understanding of adverse human health effects due to alterations in cellular behavior owing to factors such as microgravity, altered carbon dioxide levels, psychological stressors, and damaging ionizing radiation exposures from GCR and protons in the Earth’s radiation belts. These datasets, and in particular the in vivo animal models used, present a unique experimental setting to study the cellular and host-level interactions that impact human health. In this study, a meta-analysis of these accumulated transcriptomic datasets in GeneLab relevant to spaceflight was undertaken to uncover potential dose-dependent biological responses that will help in understanding the human health risks experienced in the spaceflight environment. The studies identified were from human- and animal-derived tissues or cells exposed to protons and GCR HZEs at doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies and using samples flown to the International Space Station or shuttle missions with total doses between 1.0 and 30 mGy. Ground experiments are a well-established analog for space flight, but are limited in that they are relatively high dose, high dose rate, and in most cases use single particle species, in contrast to the low dose, low dose rate mixed radiation in space. Further work is needed to elucidate platform-dependent differences (mixed fields now being offered at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory [24] are a step in this direction). The datasets were pooled and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify clusters of gene sets and associated biological processes. The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined effects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation. 2. Results Using primarily in vivo animal models and their associated curated datasets available from the NASA GeneLab’s omics database, an examination of biological responses as a function of radiation dose was made using transcriptional and sequencing data. A total of 30 experimental conditions from 25 GeneLab Data System (GLDS) datasets were collected (Table 1). Multiple datasets were included from human or murine cell cultures or animal tissues from several anatomical sites (adrenal gland, blood, bone marrow, brain, breast, heart, cartilage, skin, eye, hair follicle, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, or thymus). For the simulated space radiation ground studies (GLDS-73, -80, -109, and -117) information related to energy, linear energy transfer (LET, a measure of energy deposition at the cellular and molecular scale), dose rate, particle charge, and particle mass are available and can be viewed in Table S1. The dose data for all spaceflight experiments, with the exception of GLDS-111, were from instruments available on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. Analysis was completed by subject matter experts from the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), Johnson Space Center, NASA. The provenance of data from GLDS-111 (Bion-M1) is detailed in the environmental data section of the GLDS for Bion-M1. The doses and dose rates for ground-based exposures are from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory with uncertainties that are less than 2% [24]. Table 1.

Changes in RNA-Specific Error Rates Comparing Spaceflight Versus Ground Control Samples DNA mutations caused by ionizing radiation have been shown to propagate onto RNA during translation, unless they are adequately removed by transcription-coupled repair. Higher doses of radiation exposure to a cell will result in greater accumulated damage, up to a point where the cellular repair mechanisms are overwhelmed. However, lower levels of damage may be replicated into RNA with aberrant effects on translation and cellular function. Thus, RNA-sequencing data using mice liver samples from two experiments were analyzed to identify potential error rates due to spaceflight. Analysis of the GLDS-168 dataset showed no difference in overall mapping error rates across the entire genome (approximately 0.5%). Further investigation of the mismatches with respect to each chromosome identified error rates to be near 0.5%; however, there was no difference between the spaceflight and ground control groups (Figure 1A,B). Interestingly, there were differential error rates across some chromosomes, in particular the sex-associated chromosomes, and error rates for genes associated with mitochondrial DNA were lower than genomic DNA, supporting dynamic DNA damage repair in mitochondria (reviewed in [53]). Further analysis revealed increased rates of substitution in specific base sequences in GLDS-168 samples (Figure 1C) but not in the GLDS-242 dataset (Figure 1D). Specific base substitutions showed an increase in A>G and C>T substitutions in only GLDS-168 samples. We also observed a significant increase in CGT and GTA errors but a decrease in CAC and GTG errors in spaceflight animals versus ground controls (all corrected p < 0.05; Figure 1E). In contrast the GLDS-242 dataset showed an overall reduction, though non-significant, in specific base errors with a significant change in substitutions (p < 0.05, corrected) in spaceflight animals compared to ground controls (Figure 1D,F). Figure 1. Open in a new tab RNA-sequencing error rates in mouse livers from GLDS-168 (left column) and GLDS-242 (right column) experiments for spaceflight (black bars) compared to ground control samples (white bars). Error rates were examined as follows: (A,B) mismatch rates across chromosomes normalized by the number of bases sequenced; (C,D) single base substitution rates; (E,F) CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates. Significance indicated by * p-value < 0.05 and ** p-value < 0.01.2.2. Comparison of Multiple Genelab Datasets Using Principal Component Analysis Each individual transcriptome dataset was analyzed by comparing flight/radiation exposure versus ground/control treatment. Utilizing standard bioinformatics pipelines for RNA-sequencing and microarray analyses, we obtained expression data for each dataset for use in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [54]. The results indicated a wide variance of significantly regulated gene sets per dataset (Figure 2). When considering a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, we observed some datasets with a low number of significantly regulated gene sets, whereas others had a high amount of significant results for the three GSEA molecular signature database collections (i.e., C5, C2, and C6). Thus, for further analysis, individual gene sets were considered for analysis if they had a FDR < 0.25 in 50% or more of the total datasets examined. Then, using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper, these gene sets were grouped into networks and further examined using the auto-annotate feature to cluster similar gene sets on the basis of biological similarity, referred to as “annotated gene sets”. Figure 2. Open in a new tab The number of statistically significant gene sets from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 for each dataset for the major molecular signatures database collections (i.e., C5, C2, and C6). The black bars represent the unaltered genes and the white bars represent the annotated gene sets.To observe if any trends or batch issues arise from this type of analysis, we compared the normalized enrichment scores (NES) for all the gene sets resulting from each molecular signature database collection (Figure 3 and Figures S1–S3). Principal component analysis (PCA) plots indicated that there were no batch issues occurring globally for either the pre- or post-annotated gene sets as a function of dose (Figure 3). In addition, we did not observe any tissue dependence or clustering for the pre- or post-annotated gene sets (Figure S1). Lastly, these samples were also clustered with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots to observe whether different methods would produce conflicting results (Figures S2 and S3). The t-SNE plots also provided additional validation that no batch issues are observed with this type of analysis when considering dose or tissue dependence. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Principal component analysis (PCA) plots on GLDS datasets using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) nominal enrichment scores before (top row) and after (bottom row) auto-annotation using Cytoscape’s enrichment map software. GSEA gene sets used were as follows: (A,B) C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, (C,D) C2 curated terms, and (E,F) C6 oncogenic signature terms. Each data point is represented by experimental radiation dose (color) or radiation type (shape).To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES for each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR < 0.25 (Figure 4). As expected, the annotated gene sets provided fewer gene sets, enabling a more streamlined analysis downstream. The overall pattern of the datasets between the annotated gene sets and all the genes sets did not change. This indicates that any analysis on the annotated gene sets should provide similar results for all the gene sets. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Heatmaps on all gene sets and also annotated gene sets for each molecular signature database collection. Euclidean clustering was used for clustering the rows and columns.2.3. Transcriptome Evaluation of Biological Functions Impacted by Spaceflight Exposure in Animal Models To observe the impact of radiation exposure, transcriptional data from experiments spanning 1 to 1000 mGy doses in animal models and cell cultures were examined for alteration in multiple biological pathways. This analysis combined statistically significant biological pathways that resulted from GSEA analysis for each individual dataset [54]. This included the following three major molecular signatures database collections: (1) the Gene Ontology (GO; C5) gene sets from biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions; (2) the curated dataset (C2) gene sets from chemical and genetic perturbations and canonical pathways such as the BioCarta, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Pathway Interaction Database (PID), and Reactome pathway databases; and (3) the oncogenic signatures (C6) gene sets representing major pathways altered in cancer. 2.3.1. GSEA C5: Gene Ontology Results Using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper, 63 statistically significant GSEA gene sets from the Gene Ontology (C5) database had a FDR < 25% in 50% or more of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Using the auto-annotate clustering tool, these 63 gene sets represented 7 major biological pathways including: (1) ribosome assembly, (2) mitochondrial function, (3) interferon-gamma response, (4) chemotaxis, (5) cellular differentiation, (6) extracellular organization, and (7) cytokine production (Figure 5A). Each of these clusters was driven by an overrepresented enrichment of genes related to these pathways. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with Gene Ontology (GO) GSEA analysis. (A) Auto-annotated GO GSEA terms from Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper. Each node represents one specific GO term with each wedge representing one GeneLab datasets utilized for this manuscript. The yellow circles represent the auto-annotated go terms with common related pathways. (B) Heatmap with k-means clustering for the specific GO pathways. Six specific pathways were found to be clustered together through k-means clustering. (C) Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in milligrays and fitting with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in (C)). Each panel represents one of the clusters and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on each GO-annotated term in the cluster. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error.In addition to understanding common biological pathways disrupted by spaceflight and ground-based radiation exposure, these results were also used to examine possible dose-dependent trends. Using a k-means clustering of the heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, six major annotated clusters were overwhelmingly represented this data, including (1) mitochondrial pathways, (2) leukocyte and adaptive immune response, (3) wound healing and VEGF pathways, (4) ribosome, (5) lipid pathways, and (6) mitotic nuclear division (Figure 5B). The nominal enrichment score (NES) for these annotated gene sets was plotted from 1mGy to 1000 mGy and fitted using a generalized additive model (GAM) smoothing plot [55,56] (Figure 5C). Indeed, there was an observed activation as a function of dose for the mitochondrial pathway, whereas the clusters for the ribosome, lipid pathways, and mitotic nuclear division were generally inactivated. A more uncertain trend was observed for the immune related clusters involving leukocyte and adaptive immune response as well as wound healing and VEGF pathways, demonstrating the complex nature of normal tissue responses to inflammation and immune responses. We also performed an analysis with less stringent statistics, involving a larger set of gene sets, to observe whether other functions or pathways would appear. We performed the same analysis as above but included significant GSEA gene sets from the Gene Ontology (C5) database that had an FDR < 0.05 in only three of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Although the FDR was set at a lower threshold, the lower number of required datasets with an FDR < 0.05 threshold (Figure 2) would result in more gene sets for the downstream analysis. We saw this as true when observing the number of gene sets (Figure S4). Some k-means clusters were too dense and were split into sub-clusters (Figures S5 and S6). The GAM fits were provided for each cluster and sub-cluster (Figures S7–S9). As expected, this less stringent analysis approach produced less statistically significant fits with more noise confounding the data. Interestingly, some new trends appeared that can be related to space radiation-induced health risks, including decreases in muscle-related pathways as a function of increasing dose (Figure S7) and decreases in chromosome pathways with increasing dose (Figure S8). This inclusive analysis strategy demonstrated that analyzing the data in many different ways can reveal relevant results when that can easily be missed with only one methodology and overly strict statistical cutoffs. 2.3.2. GSEA C2: Curated Dataset Results To expand these results, the canonical pathways (C2) molecular signatures database collection was examined in a similar manner to the gene ontology collection (C5) above. For this analysis, there were 30 total datasets as opposed to 28 for the C5 gene set analysis. We determined 411 significantly regulated C2 gene sets using Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper with an FDR ≤ 25% in 50% of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Due to the C2 GSEA database containing more gene sets, a larger number of gene sets and auto-annotated terms was expected. From these terms, we observed several key pathways, including mitotic and cell cycle pathways, cancer-related pathways, hypoxia-related pathways, interferon pathways, and pathways related to radiation impact on cells (Figure 6A). Cell cycle pathways [57], hypoxia [58], interferon dysregulation [59], and cancer [60,61,62] have all been observed in previous research studies as dysregulated due to spaceflight. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with the GSEA C2 curated collection analysis. (A) Auto-annotated C2 GSEA terms from Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper. Each node represents one specific C2 term with each wedge representing one GeneLab dataset utilized for this manuscript. The yellow circles represent the auto-annotated GO terms with common related pathways. (B) Heatmap with k-means clustering for the specific C2 pathways. A total of 15 specific pathways were found to be clustered together through k-means clustering. (C) Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in (B)). Each panel represents one of the clusters and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on each C2-annotated term in the cluster. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error.We performed a similar analysis with C2 genes sets as we did with the C5 dose-dependent analysis (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Using k-means clustering for heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, 15 major annotated clusters overwhelmingly represented these data, including (1) hypoxia, MYC, and phospholipid pathways; (2) EGF, TNF, and hematopoietic pathways; (3) E2F3, EGFR2, p53, and cell cycle pathways; (4) luminal, miR-21 targets, KRAS, and transformation pathways; (5) RB1, metastasis, mitotic division, and progenitor pathways; (6) hematopoiesis, interferons, and methylation pathways; (7) obesity-, oxidation-, and adipogenic-related pathways; (8) mitochondrial and adipogenesis pathways; (9) complex EIF binding; (10) progesterone; (11) apoptosis and phospholipid pathways; (12) inflammatory, invasion, NOTCH, and HNF1a pathways; (13) carcinoma, hypoxia, and IL1a pathways; (14) PKD1, ZMPSTE24, and cardiac dysfunctions; and (15) ICP with H3K27ME3 pathway (Figure 6B,C). Similar to the C5 GO analysis, we observed an increase in mitochondrial pathways as a function of dose. Observing this trend with another pathway database provided additional confidence with these results. A clear decrease with cardiac dysfunctions, PKD1, and ZMPSTE24 was revealed as a function of dose. Interestingly, deficiencies or decreases in both PKD1 [63] and ZMPSTE24 [64] expression have been previously shown to cause cardiac dysfunction. These observed biological functions seem to follow a trend that may have be missed by manual analysis. Lastly, less stringent statistics with an FDR < 0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets was also analyzed for C2 gene sets (Figures S10–S17). Like the C5 analysis, more gene sets were clustered per group after k-means clustering (Figure S10), leading to three clusters requiring additional k-means sub-clustering analysis (Figures S11–S13). This less statistically stringent analysis on C2 produced additional trends through the GAM fits that were not observed in the more conservative analysis (Figures S14–S17). A clear decrease in TNF pathways was observed with increasing dose (Figure S16), and a novel pathway related to taste transduction was observed as increasing with dose (Figure S17). Interestingly, it has been reported that both olfactory pathways and taste are altered in astronauts, which was previously thought to be due to fluid shifts in the head caused by microgravity conditions [65,66,67]. These data also indicate that space radiation may have some impact on this interesting phenomenon.2.3.3. GSEA C6: Oncogenic Signatures To observe specific oncogenic pathways that may change as a function of space radiation exposure, we also included an analysis of the GSEA C6 oncology-specific collection from the molecular signatures database (Figure 7). From the annotation analysis, we discovered that the main oncogenic pathway impacted by space radiation was KRAS (Figure 7A). KRAS is a known oncogene and has been heavily shown in the literature to be involved with lung cancer induced by space radiation [14]. The k-means clustering on the annotated gene sets produced the following five clusters: (1) KRAS- and LEF1-related pathways; (2) p53-, mTOR-, KRAS-, and CRX-related pathways; (3) PDGF- and TGFβ-related pathways; (4) TBK1, VEGFA, and ERBB2 pathways; and (5) embryonic stem cells (ESC) pathway (Figure 7B). When observing each cluster as a function of dose, there were interesting trends that can shed light on predicting potential oncogenic risk for longer exposure to space radiation. Thus, the following known oncogenes as well as the most regulated C6 oncogenic signatures were specifically analyzed as a function of dose for all datasets: (1) KRAS, (2) CSR, (3) p53, (4) ESC, (5) TGFβ, (6), VEGFa, and (7) mTOR pathways (Figure 8). These trends as a function of dose across multiple experimental datasets emphasized a need to functionally valid these observations. Figure 7.

The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error.Figure 8. Open in a new tab Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with the GSEA C6 oncology signature collection analysis.

Each panel represents one specific oncogene and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on the multiple C6 pathways associated with that oncogene. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error.As in the previous sections, we also performed analysis with less stringent statistics with a FDR < 0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets analyzed for C6 gene sets (Figures S18–S21). Because there are fewer gene sets in the C6 database, this analysis started to yield some of the same results as the analysis with the higher thresholds. The GAM fits for each cluster and sub-cluster produced similar results, with one sub-cluster purely associated with TGFβ demonstrating the same trend (Figure S21). Interestingly, one cluster associated with TBK1 did not appear in the higher threshold analysis and demonstrated a clear decrease in as a function of dose (Figure S20). Lastly, a major oncogene MYC [68,69] did not show up in the higher threshold analysis, whereas in this analysis MYC was clearly being activated with increasing dose (Figure S20), indicating that space radiation exposure would increase the potential for carcinogenesis. 2.4. Common Genes as a Function of Dose and Association with Biological Pathways To look at specific genes that might be common across all datasets, we performed analysis on the log2 fold-change values for all datasets. Nine genes (COPB2, UBE2D3, LYPLA2, ARF1, COPB1, CAPNS1, PHB2, DAD1, PRPF8) identified to be common across the spaceflight missions (1.0 to 30 mGy) and ground studies (0.1 to 1.0 Gy) were plotted as a function of dose and average log2 fold-change and fit to a complex polynomial model. These genes, which were expressed across the various tissue types, displayed no significant expression effects from spaceflight up to 100 mGy. At doses higher than 100 mGy, a slight deviation from baseline expression was observed (Figure 9A). The spaceflight studies alone showed slight fluctuations in expression across the identified gene sets (Figure 9B). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Common genes across all datasets. (A) Log2 fold-change with respect to dose for a subset of 9 genes that appeared across all 19 spaceflight studies and 3 ground studies. A polynomial of degree 2 was fit to each dose response in the range 1–1000 mGy. (B) Log2 fold-change with respect to dose for a subset of nine genes that appeared across spaceflight studies in the range 1–30 mGy. A polynomial of degree 1 was fit to each dose response. (C) Log2 fold-change with respect to dose for a subset of nine genes that appeared across all eight spaceflight studies specifically related to the muscle tissues. A polynomial of degree 1 was fit to each dose response in the range 1–30 mGy. The dashed lines denote the +/-1 sigma errors on the fitted polynomials. (D) The functional impact of the nine common genes determined by ToppCluster [70] and displayed using Cytoscape.A focused analysis of only the muscle tissue datasets identified a subset of nine different genes that were differentially expressed across the spaceflight studies from 0 to 30 mGy (Figure 9C). These genes displayed dose-response trends. The nine common genes associated with all tissue types were associated with pathways centered on Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum transport and post-translational protein modifications (Figure 9D). In addition, these genes also were predicted to regulated phospholipid activity, immune dysregulation, and embryonic lethality. We observed these pathways to also be involved with our GSEA analysis as a function of dose.3. Discussion Here, we presented a novel approach in using publicly available transcriptomic data to determine potential health risks and dysregulation of biological pathways as a function of space radiation exposure. The use of NASA’s GeneLab platform [23] allowed us to mine data that might not have otherwise been possible to obtain from individual experimental datasets. The large number of radiation datasets available through this platform allowed the creative combination of different datasets from former experiments to generate new hypotheses [71]. Our hypothesis for this work suspected that there was a tissue independent dysregulation as a function of space radiation-absorbed dose that impacted key biological pathways associated with increased health risks such as induction of cancer. Because the GeneLab Data System contains spaceflight transcriptomic data from mice and tissues flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) for various time durations, we were able to obtain accumulated space radiation doses from 1 to 30 mGy. To obtain doses that will be more relevant to long-term deep space travel [7,14], we combined our analysis with simulated space radiation ground experiments performed in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory [24]. These experiments were performed on both mice and in vitro cell cultures with single ions (protons, 56Fe, and 26Si) at doses from 100 to 1000 mGy. By combining 25 GeneLab datasets over these doses, this work represents the first time a study has provided a comprehensive biological analysis and produced relevant and novel results indicating which relevant biological processes are being regulated as a function of space radiation exposure. These results may be further utilized to generate health risk assessment models and uncover potential targets for mitigation of space radiation effects via novel therapeutics. We chose to first look at the distribution of mapping errors within the RNA-sequencing results from liver samples by examining whether mice exposure to spaceflight resulted in detectable changes compared to ground controls. We chose to focus on liver tissue datasets from GeneLab with mice exposed to space radiation because on in the GLDS liver is the organ with the largest number of sequenced tissue thus far from rodent research missions [71]. This extremely novel analysis demonstrates how RNA-sequence data can be used to generate useful data other than the standard techniques to generate counts. With a cumulative exposure of 9.20 mGy for GLDS-168 mice, significant increases in A > G and C > T base substitutions were detected, as well as changes in CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates (Figure 1). However, there were no significant base-specific substitutions detected, and CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates all decreased significantly in GLDS-242 where mice received a cumulative dose of 8.03 mGy; however, due to the uncertainty inherent in the flight dosimetry, it was not possible to definitively determine whether this was the case. A major difference potentially impacting the observed differences between GLDS-168 and GLDS-242 was the animal sacrificing time at sample collection, which occurred during spaceflight for GLDS-168, but was 2 weeks after returning to Earth for GLDS-242. The recovery time for the mice after 2 weeks back on Earth might possibly allow recovery of the base substitutions and error rates observed during exposure to space radiation. The ability to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA and DNA datasets has been performed previously on the basis of the assumption of a homogeneous genomic sample for example from a tumor [70], whereas the sporadic and stochastic nature of HZE exposure is expected to result in random damage throughout the genome [72]. Therefore, approaches to map SNVs on the basis of bulk tissue approaches may not be able to account for the stochastic nature of the SNV damage accumulated in a tissue. Our interpretation of these results was that the spaceflight animals may have experienced more DNA damage/mutation than ground controls, but in the animals that were returned to Earth, the recovery of the animals allowed for repair to take place. Next, purely on the basis of statistical analysis, we were able to determine key biological functions that were being dysregulated as a function of space radiation. For example, in the C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figure 5C), ribosomal pathways were observed as decreasing with dose. Ribosomal assembly consisted of a number of ribosomal protein large (rpl) genes that are necessary in the assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome 60S subunit, as well as the ribosomal protein small genes involved 40S and/or 60S subunit assembly. Indeed, ribosome-related genes have been previously reported to be disrupted following exposure to ionizing radiation [73,74,75]. We observed a clear trend of increased activation of mitochondrial-related pathways in multiple different pathway databases, which include both the C5 GO terms (Figure 5C) and C2 curated gene sets (Figure 6C). Mitochondrial gene expression is susceptible to radiation-sensitivity [76]. A number of gene sets in these clusters showed dysregulation of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDUF) gene family and mitochondria-related function, in agreement with effects of ionizing radiation on the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in previous studies [77,78,79]. This is especially relevant to human health, as the NASA Twins Study recently revealed mitochondrial stress and increased mitochondrial debris in the blood [21]. A distinct elicitation of inflammatory and immune-related cellular functions was also observed in this analysis with alteration in chemokine, cytokine, and interferon expression (Figure 5C and Figure 6C). Indeed, it has been very well appreciated that ionizing radiation exposure will cause both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory expression as cellular signals attempt to resolve the unique normal tissue radiation injury that occurs both acutely and longer-term [80,81,82]. This immune signaling dysregulation has also been reported to occur when exposed to space radiation [83,84]. We also explored the potential cancer risk as a function of space radiation. The datasets we utilized for this study were from both in vitro and in vivo samples that did not have any cancer present and were not prone to induction of cancer. From our analysis, we observed several interesting results indicative of increased risk for the induction of cancer. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGFβ were clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster 3 in Figure 7C). This observation is closely tied to previously established findings. In the literature, PDGF and TGFβ are closely related to cancer progression [85]. In addition, it has been shown in the clinic that decreases in PDGF and TGFβ levels after radiotherapy for breast cancer can cause echocardiographic alterations affecting cardiovascular morbidity [86]. We also observed the highest frequency of the KRAS pathway, a known oncogene [87], being impacted as a function dose (Figure 7A). It has been previously described in experiments with single ion species that KRAS can induce lung cancer due to HZE particles [14]. Our tissue-independent analysis did not demonstrate any significant induction of KRAS with increasing dose (cluster 1 in Figure 7C and Figure 8). This might indicate that either previous experiments done with single ions at higher HZE doses did not capture the dose-dependent trend in tissues, or when considering the full spectrum of ions at lower doses KRAS might not be the key driver in inducing tumor growth. Other oncogenic trends we observed were decreases in CSR, ESC, TGFβ, VEGFA, and mTOR C6 pathway levels as a function of increasing radiation dose (Figure 7 and Figure 8). TGFβ, VEGFa, and mTOR have all previously shown similar trends with increasing dose of simulated space radiation [32,88]. The ESC C6 term is refers to differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) [89]. This rather surprising result indicates that increasing dose of space radiation reduces the efficiency of stem cell differentiation. It has been reported that after ionizing radiation exposure, mitochondria are heavily involved with stem cell development [90]. Exploiting these different pathway databases (i.e., GO, C2, and C6) provided key insights on how these different pathway trends are intertwined. The CSR C6 term refers to “common serum response” (CSR) specifically related to fibroblast serum [91]. Fibroblast serum response refers to factors released in the serum from fibroblasts involved in assisting with wound healing during tumorigenesis [91]. We can relate the decrease to the CSR pathways to what we observed in the GO analysis (cluster 3 in Figure 5) related to wound healing and VEGF pathways. We also observed with that wound healing should decrease with increasing doses of space radiation. This decrease can also reduce wound healing due to CSR and has shown that it can lead to tumorigenesis [91]. In addition, it has been reported that impairment occurs in space wound healing [92,93], and these data can potentially indicate an increased chance for tumor induction. These observed trends as a function of space radiation exposure revealed unique pathways that seem to be specifically related to GCR, whereas some pathways from our analysis are known to be universal responses to radiation. The mechanisms of damage are common to highly ionizing radiation regardless of the source [94]; what is unique to chronic space radiation exposure is the combination of highly ionizing particles, low dose, and a low dose rate, which may have implications for DNA repair [17], mitochondrial pathways [16], and lipid pathways [42] as just a few examples of what emerged from our analysis. In addition, we found specific cancer-related pathways that may be unique to space radiation. For example, decreases in TGFβ [32], embryonic stem cells (ESC) [95], and VEGFa seem to be unique to space radiation. Spaceflight studies have previously revealed a plethora of effects that radiation can have at individual doses or over a small range of discreet doses. However, the pooling and meta-analysis of these datasets in this study allowed for a unique visualization and comparison over a larger range of radiation doses. This in turn made it possible to identify trends in physiological response from low to high doses and provided insight into the response to accumulating doses that may occur in long duration space missions or over a few days during solar particle events. This technique may also be utilized to determine potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, because we report that mitochondrial pathways decrease as a function of space radiation, this argues for additional validation and research on specific mitochondrial targets for countermeasure development. In addition, from this analysis we can extrapolate to specific doses that may pose greater health risks. This analysis can only be done by utilizing a large number of datasets that are available from platforms such as NASA’s GeneLab. The resolution obtained from this analysis can easily be lost once we lower the number datasets that will be used. Our analysis has indicated several different health risks that may occur with increasing exposure to space radiation. Through an unbiased technique purely driven by statistics and utilizing a large amount of transcriptomic data from NASA’s GeneLab platform, we were able to identify tissue-independent biological pathways that are dysregulated as a function of space radiation dose. We believe this technique can further be used with other datasets and databases to generate more hypotheses that will assist with determining optimal therapeutic countermeasures and targets that can mitigate space radiation response in humans.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Chromosomal and Subsitution Error Rate Mapping Two mouse liver RNA-sequencing datasets (GLDS-168 and GLDS-242) from NASA spaceflight experiments were specifically analyzed for chromosomal or substitution error rates. Compressed fastq files were cleaned using TRIM galore (v0.6.4, https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Docs/Trim_Galore_User_Guide.md) to remove adapters and bases falling below a Q20 Phred quality score. Paired reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 reference genome using bowtie2 (v2.3.4.1,) and the output piped through samtools to generate a bam file. The bam file had read group information added and was coordinate sorted using Picard tools (v2.21.3,). Mapping metrics were calculated using Picard tools and final mismatches (MN flag) extracted with genomic coordinates using Bedtools (v2.26.0, https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Data were analyzed in R to determine the frequency of mismatches with respect to chromosome number and plotted. Mapping quality data from Picard tools was analyzed using GraphpadPrism (v7.0, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). 4.2. Bioinformatics, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and Visulization Using Cytoscape The transcriptome datasets used for this study were from openly available data housed by NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov,). There was a total of 25 GeneLab datasets (GLDS) with 30 experimental comparisons from RNA-sequencing or microarray platforms (Table 1). Data pre-processing was performed as previously published to obtain normalized expression values for the majority of the datasets [32,33,42]. For GLDS-73, human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were exposed to gamma-rays (1 Gy or 3 Gy), iron (56Fe), or silicon (26Si) particles (0.5 Gy or 1 Gy each). RNA extraction was executed 1 hr after exposure and the transcriptome data were evaluate by microarray technology using the Illumina HumanWG-6 V2 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) [52]. The raw data files were normalized using the quantile method and then background subtraction was performed using R Package PIMENTo (v1.0). Fold-change values between spaceflight/radiation exposure versus ground/control samples were calculated and used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA,) with three molecular signature dataset collections (C2, C5, and C6 gene sets) [54]. These results were imported into Cytoscape (v3.7) for further visualization and interpretation by the Enrichment Map tool [96]. Only gene set nodes with a false-detection rate (FDR) < 0.25 in at least 50% of the total datasets analyzed were considered for network evaluation. To reduce the complexity of the newly developed networks, we utilized the AutoAnnotate tool (v1.3.2, http://baderlab.org/Software/AutoAnnotate) in Cytoscape to group-related gene set nodes together. The newly annotated gene sets were then used for further analysis.4.3. Principal Component Analysis, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, k-Means Clustering, Heatmaps, and Generalized Additive Model Fits The GSEA-produced nominal enrichment scores (NES) were compared using principle component analysis (PCA) plots from the R-program pca3d (v0.10, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pca3d/pca3d.pdf) [97], and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plots using R-program Rtsne (v0.15, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rtsne/Rtsne.pdf). Further characterization was performed by hierarchical k-means clustering on the NES. Heatmaps were generated using the R-program pheatmap (v1.0.12, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/pheatmap.pdf). The auto-annotated gene sets for each k-means cluster were then plotted with the NES versus the dose for associated for each GeneLab dataset (Table 1) with R-program ggplot2 (v3.2.1,). Data points were then fit using a generalized additive model (GAM) [55,56] across all dose ranges from 1 to 1000 mGy with R-program mgcv (v1.8-28, https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/mgcv.pdf)4.4. Analysis on Common Individual Genes with Fold-Change Values and Fits as a Function of Dose A total of 19 spaceflight studies and 3 ground studies were selected from the GeneLab database. Table 1 summarizes the datasets including the tissue, species, the radiation type, and the measured dose. From each study, the fold-change value between irradiated and control for each gene was calculated. For spaceflight studies, the log2 fold-change was computed as the ratio of the spaceflight measurement to a ground control value. In studies where terrestrial measurements for ground control values were made in both an animal enclosure module (AEM, also referred to as the Rodent Habitat) and a vivarium, the AEM ground control value was used due to the similar module conditions experienced by tissue in the spaceflight AEMs. For the terrestrial studies that simulated space radiation, the experimental values were the samples that were irradiated with a specific ion (i.e., 56Fe, 26Si, or proton) compared to the sham unirradiated samples closest to the time of irradiation. Across all of the studies, the most common genes probed were chosen, which produced nine genes present with all the GLDS sets used for this manuscript. A polynomial of degree 2 was fit to the data in the range 1–1000 mGy for all datasets. For fits involving only spaceflight samples and only muscle tissues, due to the smaller range of doses up to 30 mGy, data were fit using a polynomial of degree 1. All fits were performed using a chi-square method via CERN’s ROOT toolkit (v.6.18/02,) [98]. The nine genes were entered in ToppCluster [99] to determine the predicted pathways and functions these genes will impact. The results from ToppCluster were imported into Cytoscape, where the predicted functions were displayed as a network.5. Conclusions This work is an example of how GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be exploited to better understand the effects of ionizing radiation and the resulting potential risks to humans. This large-scale analysis of multiple transcriptome datasets including RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets provides a valuable examination of dose-dependent perturbations of cellular function across multiple tissue types in animal models. Individually, these experiments were limited by flight duration, resulting in a single accumulated dose from a micture of particles or, in ground-based studies, exposure to a single particle species. When analyzing multiple molecular databases using our approach to many omics datasets, a more comprehensive analysis of significantly impacted biological factors can be obtained than was previously possible.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/12/2/381/s1: Figure S1: Principal component analysis (PCA) plots on GeneLab datasets (GLDS) using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) nominal enrichment scores before (top row) and after (bottom row) auto-annotation using Cytoscape’s enrichment map software, Figure S2: t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plots on GeneLab datasets (GLDS) using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) nominal enrichment scores before (top row) and after (bottom row) auto-annotation using Cytoscape’s enrichment map software, Figure S3: t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plots on GeneLab datasets (GLDS) using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) nominal enrichment scores before (top row) and after (bottom row) auto-annotation using Cytoscape’s enrichment map software, Figure S4: Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with Gene Ontology (GO) GSEA analysis with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 for three datasets, Figure S5: Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with Gene Ontology (GO) GSEA analysis with FDR < 0.05 for three datasets for cluster 2, Figure S6: Analysis of all GeneLab Datasets utilized for direct comparisons with Gene Ontology (GO) GSEA analysis with FDR < 0.05 for three datasets for cluster 3, Figure S7: Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in Figure S4), Figure S8: Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in Figure S5), Figure S9: Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in Figure S5), Figure S10: Analysis of all GeneLab Datasets utilized for direct comparisons with C2 curated gene sets GSEA analysis with FDR < 0.05 for three datasets, Figure S11: Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with C2-curated gene set GSEA analysis with FDR < 0.05 for three datasets for cluster 1, Figure S12: Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with C2-curated gene set GSEA analysis with FDR < 0.05 for three datasets for cluster 2, Figure S13: Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with C2-curated gene set GSEA analysis with FDR < 0.05 for three datasets for cluster 3, Figure S14: Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in Figure S10), Figure S15: Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in Figure S11), Figure S16: Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in Figure S12), Figure S17: Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in Figure S13), Figure S18: Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with C6 Oncogenic Signature GSEA analysis with FDR < 0.05 for three datasets, Figure S19: Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with C6 Oncogenic Signature GSEA analysis with FDR < 0.05 for three datasets for cluster 1, Figure S20: Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in Figure S18), Figure S21: Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in Figure S19), Table S1: Doses and dose rates for ground-based exposures at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

    "abstract": "SUMMARY We have identified and validated a spaceflight-associated microRNA (miRNA) signature that is shared by rodents and humans in response to simulated, short-duration and long-duration spaceflight. Previous studies have identified miRNAs that regulate rodent responses to spaceflight in low-Earth orbit, and we have confirmed the expression of these proposed spaceflight-associated miRNAs in rodents reacting to simulated spaceflight conditions. Moreover, astronaut samples from the NASA Twins Study confirmed these expression signatures in miRNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data. Additionally, a subset of these miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) was found to regulate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of key spaceflight-associated miRNAs, we utilized antagomirs to inhibit their expression and successfully rescue simulated deep-space-radiation-mediated damage in human 3D vascular constructs.",

Copyright notice ID: 8441986 MSID: MS1653539 PMID: 33242410 The publisher's version of this article is available at Cell Rep SUMMARY We have identified and validated a spaceflight-associated microRNA (miRNA) signature that is shared by rodents and humans in response to simulated, short-duration and long-duration spaceflight. Previous studies have identified miRNAs that regulate rodent responses to spaceflight in low-Earth orbit, and we have confirmed the expression of these proposed spaceflight-associated miRNAs in rodents reacting to simulated spaceflight conditions. Moreover, astronaut samples from the NASA Twins Study confirmed these expression signatures in miRNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data. Additionally, a subset of these miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) was found to regulate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of key spaceflight-associated miRNAs, we utilized antagomirs to inhibit their expression and successfully rescue simulated deep-space-radiation-mediated damage in human 3D vascular constructs.Graphical Abstract In Brief Malkani et al. uncover the role of circulating microRNAs as both a potential biomarker for health risks associated with spaceflight and a countermeasure to mitigate the damage caused to the body by the space environment.INTRODUCTION Humans and vertebrate organisms exhibit a unique set of biological responses to the space environment, including bone and muscle atrophy (Burkhart et al., 2019; Gerbaix et al., 2017), immune dysfunction (Baqai et al., 2009), neurobehavioral changes (Ronca et al., 2019), vision impairment (Mader et al., 2011), and cardiovascular damage (Elgart et al., 2018). Ionizing radiation (IR) and microgravity are the main biological stressors in low-Earth orbit (LEO), which is the region encompassed by the Earth’s magnetosphere where all crewed missions currently occur. Although exposure to deep space radiation, which is primarily composed of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), is reduced within LEO due to the magnetosphere, IR still poses a risk to astronauts in LEO, and GCRs are a critical health risk in the upcoming lunar and Mars missions (Townsend, 2005). Thus, combining LEO experiments with ground-based analogs of spaceflight stressors, including simulated GCRs, allows investigations into the mechanisms behind biological responses to spaceflight. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (~22 nucleotides long) sequences of non-coding RNA that can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level and interact directly with proteins (Vanderburg and Beheshti, 2020). miRNAs have been implicated as predictors and regulators for several diseases, including cancer (Macfarlane and Murphy, 2010), neurodegenerative diseases (Konovalova et al., 2019), and autoimmune disorders (Chen et al., 2016). miRNAs have also been found to be involved in biological responses to both microgravity (Girardi et al., 2014) and IR (Simone et al., 2009). Therefore, identifying miRNAs (and their networks) that are shared between humans and model organisms in response to spaceflight stressors could reveal targets for biomarker and countermeasure development to reduce the associated health risks. Previously, we used spaceflown rodent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from the NASA GeneLab database to make unbiased predictions about miRNAs potentially involved in regulating the transcriptional response to spaceflight (Beheshti et al., 2018). The datasets analyzed in that study are described in the STAR Methods. Our analysis identified a set of 13 spaceflight-associated miRNAs that were predicted to drive a systemic response and suggested transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 as an overarching regulator of their expression (Beheshti et al., 2018). TGF-β1 is a major regulatory cytokine mediating the progression of cancer (Rooke and Crosier, 2001), autoimmunity (Marie et al., 2006), and neuroinflammation (Cekanaviciute et al., 2014). However, it is important to note that this spaceflight-associated miRNA signature was defined computationally, based on transcriptomic analysis, and not measured experimentally. Here, we experimentally validated the predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA signature by quantifying circulating miRNAs in serum from rodents exposed to simulated spaceflight conditions: microgravity, partial gravity, LEO-relevant IR, simulated deep space radiation, and combined exposures to reduced gravity and simulated space radiation, as well as true spaceflight in LEO. We supported spaceflight-stressor-mediated changes in the expression of the predicted miRNAs by performing agnostic miRNA-seq in selected datasets, and our experimental validation also incorporated simulated deep space radiation conditions to help evaluate the extent to which the miRNA signature may be shared by different space environments. Finally, we addressed the human relevance of our findings by analyzing miRNAs released by irradiated human immune cells ex vivo and miRNA expression changes in astronauts from the NASA Twins Study in vivo (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). We expanded our initial panel of 13 candidate miRNAs (Beheshti et al., 2018) to include 15 target miRNAs with the following justifications: (1) miRNA let-7 was subdivided into two more specific family members (let-7a and let-7c) identified in recent space biology studies (Režen et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2018), and (2) an additional miRNA (miR-92a) was added after analyzing astronaut data from the NASA Twins Study. Furthermore, we investigated the potential downstream effects of spaceflight-associated human miRNAs using single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing of a targeted gene panel of leukocyte-depleted fractions in the NASA Twins Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Specifically, we compared gene expression in cells collected within 3 days upon spaceflown twin’s (TW) return to his preflight and postflight samples, as well as control samples taken from the ground control twin (HR). Single-cell transcriptomics also let us determine the individual cell types that display the strongest perturbations in gene expression consistent with miRNA signatures identified in bulk transcriptomics, and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC) sequencing data were used to delineate chromatin changes that may have altered the accessibility of the spaceflight-associated miRNAs.RESULTS Predicted Spaceflight miRNA Signature in Rodents Was Validated Using Simulated Microgravity and Deep Space Radiation To validate the predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA panel, we quantified their changes in response to ground analogs of individual spaceflight stressors in rodent models: simulated microgravity using hindlimb unloading (HU) (Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998) as well as IR using either gamma rays or major components of galactic cosmic rays—protons and/or high mass and charge 56Fe particles (deep space relevant exposure) (Mewaldt, 1994). We exposed male 16-week-old C57BL/6J mice to HU, IR, or their combination and measured the set of selected 15 miRNAs in their serum at 1 or 11 days post-exposure using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (Hindson et al., 2013). Euclidean clustering of serum miRNA concentrations separated the miRNAs into two main clusters: (1) deep-space-radiation-associated clusters, which are significantly regulated by 56Fe IR and 56Fe IR in combination with HU; and (2) microgravity-associated clusters, primarily altered in HU-only conditions (Figures 1A–1C). An additional subset of miRNAs was significantly increased in mouse serum only, early (1 day) after exposure to the combination of mixed proton/56Fe irradiation and HU, but was not affected by individual stressors (Figure 1A). Of note, we have provided a discussion regarding potential hemolysis that might occur with the serum/plasma samples utilized throughout this manuscript in the STAR Methods. Figure 1.

(G) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways predicted to be regulated by all statistically significant spaceflight-associated miRNAs.Most miRNAs (with the exception of miR-217) were observed to increase with radiation dose and linear energy transfer (LET; gamma < 150 MeV proton < 600 MeV/n 56Fe) in mouse serum both at 1 day and 11 days post-IR. At 11 days post-IR, the only significant miRNA increases were observed in IR-only (no HU) mice irradiated with either 1 Gy or 2 Gy 600 MeV/n 56Fe or 1 Gy protons (Figures 1A and 1B). In combination, these results indicate that the miRNA signature is mainly driven by the particle radiation component, which is proportional to dose and LET. Based on all miRNAs that were significantly different in spaceflight-associated conditions, we predicted the top 50 targeted genes (Figure 1D), key diseases regulated by the miRNAs (Figure 1E), and significant pathways (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1). The top 50 genes targeted by these miRNAs (Figure 1D) primarily regulate cell-cycle pathways and protein kinase activity, in addition to hematopoiesis and blood cell development (Figures 1F and S1). The majority of diseases regulated by these miRNAs are related to cancer (Figure 1E), though we also uncovered other diseases associated with spaceflight, including cardiovascular (green circles), neurological (yellow circles) and digestive disorders (purple circles), and muscular degeneration (orange circles) (Figure 1E). Similarly, key significantly regulated pathways include carcinogenesis as well as TGF-β signaling, which supports our previous prediction of TGF-β as a key regulator of spaceflight-associated miRNA functions and implies downstream carcinogenic and immune effects. Finally, the pathways also include adherens junctions, which, combined with cardiovascular disease associations, suggests vascular impacts (Figures 1F and 1G). To examine the contribution of reduced gravity to the miRNA signature at higher resolution, a partial weight bearing (PWB) Wistar male rat model (Mortreux et al., 2018) was used to simulate varying degrees of gravitational loading. We observed that decreasing amounts of gravitational loading increased the quantities of miRNAs of interest, suggesting a gravity-dependent dose response (Figures 2A–2C). These results also validated a reduced-gravity-specific miRNA signature in both mice and rats and separated the miRNAs associated with reduced gravity from those associated with exposure to simulated deep space radiation in mice. The only observed exception was miR-217, which did not change. A similar miRNA dose response was observed based on correlation with muscle mass (Figure 2D): the miRNAs of interest increased with reduced muscle mass (which is associated with lower simulated gravity both in this rat model and in astronauts).

The significance of each correlation is indicated in the circles. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, two-tailed Student’s t test. Circle size is proportional to the correlation coefficient.Notably, this model included two control groups of animals exposed to full gravitational loading: no harness (NH) and full harness (FH) (Figures 2A and 2B). Both conditions had been included in prior studies, and no functional or phenotypical differences were recorded, although there was a difference in miRNA expression between NH and FH 100% gravity groups (Figures 2A and 2B), possibly due to a trend in reduction in muscle mass in FH controls (not significant). Therefore, further comparison between groups included only the FH control (Figure 2C).Predicted Spaceflight miRNA Signature Was Partially Observed in Serum from Mice Exposed to LEO Next, we investigated whether the spaceflight-environment-linked miRNA signature is distinguishable in true spaceflight samples, using serum from young and old female BALB/cAnNTac mice flown to the International Space Station (ISS) on Rodent Research Mission 8. In contrast with the simulated spaceflight cohorts, these mice experienced short-lasting hypergravity during takeoff and landing in addition to microgravity while in orbit, spent 4 days reacclimating on ground after the flight before sample collection, and received a significantly lower dose of IR than simulation experiments: 0.01128 Gy over approximately 30 days on the ISS. Although the combined mouse cohort did not exhibit any significantly increased miRNAs compared to basal (no spaceflight, normal housing conditions) controls (Figure 2E), when the samples were separated by age (Figures 2F and 2G), we observed clustering between spaceflight and basal controls in the older group (31–37 weeks at sacrifice) corresponding to middle-age in humans, which is more representative of typical astronaut cohorts, and no detectable clustering in the younger group (10–16 weeks at sacrifice) (Figures 2H–2J). Considering that these mice had 4 days to reacclimate to ground conditions before the samples were collected, these results may suggest that it takes longer for serum miRNA levels to return to basal levels in older mice, while younger mice recover faster. This finding is consistent with our prior results from simulated spaceflight studies, in which miRNA levels in irradiated mice start to return to control by 11 days following an over-100-fold-higher dose of IR than received by the spaceflown mice (Figure 1A). Another notable result from this spaceflight experiment is the correlation between organ weights and miRNA concentration in spaceflight mice and basal controls. Normalized to total body weight, adrenal gland weight increases with concentration of the majority of quantified miRNAs, and, conversely, brain weight decreases with increasing miRNA concentrations. While these correlations are not statistically significant, they suggest the possibility of lingering impacts on specific organs (Figure 2K). Increases in adrenal gland weight might be related to chronic stress, since the adrenal gland regulates stress responses (Ulrich-Lai et al., 2006) that have been previously associated with increased systemic corticosterone levels during spaceflight (Pecaut et al., 2017). Meanwhile, a volumetric reduction of brain features has been observed in cosmonauts (Pechenkova et al., 2019), though the physiological relevance of these findings remains to be elucidated. Since systemic increases in corticosterone levels also lead to reduced brain weight (Coburn-Litvak et al., 2004), chronic stress might be an underlying factor behind both adrenal gland and brain results, and future studies are needed to examine miRNA as its potential biomarker.Spaceflight-Relevant miRNA Signature Was Also Identified in Agnostic Sequencing Study of Simulated-Spaceflight-Exposed Mice To understand the specificity and variation of spaceflight-relevant miRNA levels within the global miRNA population, miRNA-seq was performed on tissue samples from 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice after exposure to simulated spaceflight conditions: normal loading (NL) or HU for 2 weeks prior to irradiation with 5 Gy gamma, 1 Gy simulated solar particle event (simSPE), 0.5 Gy simulated simplified galactic cosmic rays (SimGCRSim), or sham control. SimGCRSim consists of five ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV (Simonsen et al., 2020). This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 min instead of the actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. Simulated solar particle event (SimSPE) irradiation consists of protons from 50 MeV to 150 MeV. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, the mice were sacrificed, and miRNA-seq was performed on tissue samples from the plasma, heart, liver, and soleus muscle. We observed highly variable miRNA expression profiles between organs, with the exception of heart and soleus muscle (Figures 3A and 3B). This variation underscores the importance of establishing a circulating systemic miRNA signature that can be measured in plasma, which is the most accessible source for biomarker evaluation in spaceflight conditions. Additionally, the high correlation between miRNA expression changes in heart and soleus muscle unsurprisingly suggests that the damage in these muscle tissues may be driven by similar changes in miRNAs (Figures 3A and 3B). Notably, miRNA-seq profiles from plasma also are more heterogeneous than those from individual organs, suggesting that plasma miRNA quantification might allow a more finely tuned spaceflight signature that could differentiate between different types of exposures or provide personalized risk assessment (Figures 3A and 3B).

(E) Pathways that are significantly regulated by the top 20 genes shown in (D). (F) miRNA fold changes between HU and NL groups for each irradiation condition. miRNAs from our proposed signature are included, as well as the four additional miRNAs implicated by miRNA-seq in (C). (G) C2 pathways analysis from miRNA-seq data shows pathways that are being suppressed. The larger the circle, the more significant the effect, and darker purple indicates a larger magnitude of suppression. miRNAs highlighted in yellow or blue were included in our predicted spaceflight signature. miRNAs highlighted in yellow are known to be involved in spaceflight-induced cardiac damage.Comparison of significantly regulated miRNAs identified four miRNAs that are increased in all organs in the GCR+HU (“combined spaceflight stressors”) group compared to sham NL (“no spaceflight stressors” control) (Figure 3C). Therefore, we decided to focus on the GCR+HU irradiated group for further analysis. We computed the top 20 genes regulated by the four common differentially expressed miRNAs (Figure 3D) as well as the pathways that were significantly regulated by these genes (Figure 3E) and found potential cardiovascular as well as systemic circulatory targets (Figure 3E). We next quantified miRNA fold changes between GCR/SPE/Gamma+HU and sham NL conditions, focusing on the panel of spaceflight-associated miRNAs (top 15) as well as the four additional miRNAs that were found to be shared among all tissues for GCR+HU versus NL by miRNA-seq (bottom 4) (Figure 3F). Additional data is available in a companion paper (Wuu et al., 2020). We observed trends or significance for multiple spaceflight miRNAs, and the same miRNA family members differentially expressed across multiple tissues. For example, for miRNA-503-5p, expression was decreased in the liver, soleus, and heart but strongly increased in plasma (Figure 3F), indicating potential organ-dependent miRNA changes with the key systemic stressor response stemming from the circulating miRNAs. MiR-503 belongs to the miR-16 extended family (Caporali and Emanueli, 2011; Wang et al., 2019), which is one of the miRNAs predicted to be involved in the spaceflight response (Figure 1A) and impacts cardiovascular diseases through the inhibition of angiogenesis (Besnier et al., 2019; Caporali and Emanueli, 2011). Finally, we performed pathway analysis utilizing the miRNA-seq data with C2 curated gene sets from MSigDB on the miRNA-seq data and displayed all significantly regulated pathways (Figure 3G) for the liver and soleus muscle. Data for the plasma and heart tissues are in companion papers and show similar results (Paul et al., 2020; Wuu et al., 2020), and the pathways that showed suppression (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p value < 0.25; Figure 3G) have been previously implicated in cardiovascular adaptations to spaceflight (Beheshti et al., 2018, 2019). These specific pathways were selected for the countermeasure experiments (below). This experiment demonstrates that although the individual response of the miRNAs might not be significantly regulated, the global response of miRNAs on downstream gene targets reveals regulation by miRNAs belonging to the spaceflight signature.Spaceflight-Associated Rodent miRNA Signature Was Partially Shared by Human Responses Ex Vivo and In Vivo We next show that spaceflight-associated miRNA signature is partially conserved in human samples that had been exposed to real or simulated space environment conditions. First, we analyzed human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses to 0.3 Gy 600 MeV/n 56Fe particles that form a biologically significant component of GCRs, using PBMCs isolated from 12 healthy human (non-astronaut) donors. Thus, this experiment simulated deep-space-relevant radiation, without simulating microgravity. We observed an increase in spaceflight-associated miRNAs in the supernatant of irradiated PBMCs 4 hours, post-irradiation (Figures 4A–4D), as well as a positive correlation with increasing donor BMI and cell number (Figures 4B and 4D; Table S3) .

(E and F) NASA Twins Study data for (E) unsorted PBMCs and (F) LD cells in comparison to the spaceflight miRNA signature predictions.Finally, in order to assess the impact of the real spaceflight environment on human cells, we analyzed miRNA-sequence data on total PBMC and lymphocyte-depleted (LD) samples from the NASA Twins Study. This study involved actual LEO (low-LET radiation and microgravity) exposure for 340 days for a total of 146.34 mSv (or 0.1463 Gy). Unsorted PBMCs isolated during and after LEO spaceflight showed persistent changes in miRNA expression for the astronaut in space, which partially follows the predicted spaceflight signature (Figure 4E). Similarly, LD cells sampled before and after flight also indicated persistent changes in miRNA expression, though not all miRNAs behaved as predicted by the spaceflight signature (Figure 4F). Notably, the spaceflown twin (TW) had consistently higher expression of the miRNA target genes compared to the HR even at baseline/preflight, despite having higher levels of miRNAs as well (Figures 4E and 4F); thus, TW pre-flight levels were considered a better control than ground control twin (HR) pre-flight levels. This difference in miRNA expression is not surprising, due to known discordant miRNA expression profiles in twins (Xiao et al., 2019). Of the miRNAs found in the irradiated PBMC panel, only miR-92a-3p was significantly downregulated and let-7c-5p was upregulated in the TW miRNA-sequence data (Figure 4F). However, the downstream targets of the irradiation-associated miRNAs were significantly decreased between preflight and postflight samples, except the targets of hsa-miR-92a-3p and hsa-miR-26a-5p. This suggests that there was an increase in some irradiation-associated miRNA functions in TW, and the effects of miR-92a-3p and miR-26a-5p were more acute than the other miRNAs. Similar to the lack of response of miR-217 in animal models based on ddPCR results, miR-217 only had three targets within the targeted panel, none of which were significantly changed by spaceflight, indicating that miR-217, although implicated by original unbiased in silico predictions, does not respond to the stress of the space environment. We next analyzed the changes in miRNA expression across different blood cell populations that were associated with spaceflight-mediated miRNA differences in the same NASA Twins Study. Specifically, we conducted targeted scRNA-seq and scAb-seq (epitope mapping) of LD Twins Study samples across multiple time points. In total, 23,408 cells were sequenced across 12 samples: 6 TW and 6 HR (Figure S2 and Table S4). Cell types were identified on a per cluster basis by both RNA and epitope levels (Figure 5A). Module scores for the targets of the subset of spaceflight-associated miRNAs that were found to be upregulated in irradiated human PBMCs were calculated using Seurat and compared among TW preflight, return, and postflight samples (Figures 5B–5N). Figure 5. Spaceflight-Associated miRNA Target Genes Are Downregulated upon TW Return and Postflight Compared to Preflight, with Individual Cell Types Being Differentially Affected. Open in a new tab (A) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot of 23,408 cells grouped by cell-type-identified clusters. (B–N) Violin plots with mean and first and third quartiles of the indicated miRNA target gene module scores. Cells were separated into four groups: cells from HR GD114, GD138, GD182, GD3, GD-66, and GD66 as Ground; TW L-162 and L-148 days as Preflight; TW R0 as Return; and TW R36 and R191 as Postflight. Differences in expression of miRNA target gene modules scores was tested by Wilcoxon rank sum test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (O–W) Dot plots colored by average expression and size based on percent expression of the spaceflight-associated mRNA target gene module scores of cell types grouped by Ground, Preflight, Return, and Postflight.When the cell population was split by cell type, we observed that the changes in miRNA-mediated gene expression were highly variable across cell types (Figure 5O). Dividing each cell type into ground, preflight, return, and postflight groups demonstrated that individual cell types were differentially affected by spaceflight-associated miRNAs. For example, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes responded differently to hsa-miR-92a-3p: CD14+ monocytes showed decreased expression of hsa-miR-92a-3p targets, while CD16+ monocytes expressed higher levels of hsa-miR-92a-3p target genes upon return compared to either preflight or postflight. Progenitor (circulating hematopoietic stem) cells stood out in this analysis, as expression of the spaceflight-associated miRNA target genes increased specifically at the return time point. These differences among cell types indicate that immune cell composition may play a role in the downstream effects of spaceflight-associated miRNA increases and suggest return to Earth as a major stressor affecting miRNA expression.The Increase in Expression of Spaceflight-Associated miRNAs Is Not Driven by Epigenetic Changes To determine whether the changes in miRNA expression were due to spaceflight-induced chromatin changes, we used scATAC-seq on 11,344 cells (Figure S3 and Table S5). SnapTools and SnapATAC were used to create 5-kb bins across the genome and determine genome accessibility based on ATAC activity per cell, and then genes and miRNAs were assigned the ATAC activity based on the overlapping bin. ATAC activity is associated with chromatin accessibility, which can be used to determine whether the miRNAs upregulated in irradiated PBMCs were differently accessible in TW during spaceflight (Figure 6B). Of note, open chromatin peaks were observed at let-7c-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-125b-5p, let-7a-5p, and miR-146a-5p. Furthermore, both control PBMCs and HR ground PMBCs displayed consistent ATAC peaks across the majority of the miRNA loci. Together, this suggests that the chromatin around these miRNA loci is open but not strongly affected by spaceflight. In addition, we assessed ATAC activity in different cell types (Figures 6C and 6D). The module score and dot plots of the miRNAs upregulated in irradiated PBMCs demonstrate that CD14+ monocytes and pre-dendritic cells (pDCs) show more miRNA accessibility that other cell populations (Figures 6C and 6D), indicating that chromatin states depend more on immune cell type than spaceflight. Figure 6. Spaceflight Does Not Induce Epigenetic Changes around Spaceflight-Associated miRNA.

(F and G) Dot plots of ATAC activity at miRNA upregulated (F) or downregulated (G) in the LD miRNA-seq.We next investigated immune cell composition at different time points during flight, specifically the proportion of CD14+ monocytes. Due to a low number of cells in the TW preflight sample, data from ATAC-seq and scRNA-seq experiments were combined to determine the immune cell distribution in LD fractions. (Figure 6E). Notably, the TW return samples had the highest proportion of CD14+ monocytes. This result, combined with the scRNA-seq of downstream targets, suggests that miRNA expression during spaceflight is regulated not by chromatin accessibility, but by immune cell distribution, and is particularly high in CD14+ monocytes. Finally, we evaluated whether specific ATAC peak changes correlated with expression levels from the Twins Study miRNA-seq (Figures 6F and 6G). However, ATAC activity was observed in the HR samples for upregulated miRNAs, indicating that the chromatin was already open prior to spaceflight.Selective Inhibition of Spaceflight-Associated miRNAs Reduces Cardiovascular Damage in a Human Tissue Model after Exposure to Simulated Deep Space Radiation Finally, we developed and utilized a mature human 3D microvascular tissue model (Grabham et al., 2011; Templin et al., 2016; Wuu et al., 2020) seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to examine the physiological effects of the candidate miRNAs on structural cardiovascular damage caused by heavy ion irradiation (Grabham et al., 2011; unpublished data). Forty-eight hours after irradiation with 0.5 Gy SimGCRSim, several of the candidate miRNAs showed marked increases compared to controls (Figure 7A), though the increases were not significant, possibly due to low sample numbers. Figure 7. miRNA Changes and Impacts in a 3D Microvascular Tissue Model. Open in a new tab (A) Quantification of miRNAs from a 3D culture of mature human microvessels with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) irradiated with 0.5 Gy of simplified simulated galactic cosmic rays (SimGCRSim) compared to sham irradiated samples 48 h after irradiation. All candidate miRNAs were examined, but only the miRNAs that seemed to respond differently for each group are shown. The error bars represent SEM.

Scrambled version of the antagomir was used a vehicle control. (D) Summary of all the fold-change values for all experiments utilized in this manuscript (including both ddPCR and miRNA-seq data). (E) The summary of the overall impact of the miRNAs on the gene targets determined in Figure 3D through pathway analysis on the miRNA-seq data. The arrows indicate the degree of up- or downregulation, and the colors of the arrows indicate the significance (i.e., p values). The gray-shaded regions represent the 11-day time points after irradiation. The red-shaded miRNAs represent the miRNAs used for the antagomir experiments in (B) and (C).Three of the miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) that were increased by SimGCRSim irradiation were also previously predicted to be associated with space-radiation-induced cardiovascular damage (Beheshti et al., 2019) and were chosen to be inhibited using antagomirs (Krützfeldt et al., 2005). Further data showing that these miRNAs are associated with disrupted angiogenesis following IR have been reported elsewhere (Wuu, et al., 2020). In addition, these miRNAs show consistent presence and impact on downstream functions in the space environment (i.e., Twins Study data) compared to all other miRNAs. Antagomirs were applied 24 h before irradiation, and morphology of the tissue constructs was assessed 48 h after irradiation with 0.5 Gy SimGCRSim. We observed irradiation-mediated loss of vascularization because the microvessels had shrunk or collapsed, indicating that 0.5 Gy SimGCRSim is sufficient to disrupt microvessels. This impact of SimGCRSim exposure was reversed by application of the three antagomirs 24 h before irradiation, while a scrambled antagomir control did not induce the rescue phenotype (Figures 7B and 7C). Based on the summary of the of spaceflight-stressor-induced changes across all miRNAs (Figure 7D) and the miRNAs that have global significant impact on the downstream gene targets determined in Figure 3D (Figure 7E), it is apparent that these three miRNAs have a uniform trend across all different conditions (red shaded miRNAs in Figures 7D and 7E). Thus, microvessel structure was protected by selectively inhibiting three miRNAs that are the most universally associated with spaceflight responses, proving that the vascular impairments caused by simulated deep space radiation are at least partially mediated through miRNAs and in the future might be rescued using antagomirs in human tissue constructs. Future steps to further explore the impact of this potential countermeasure will be performed in murine models and are currently ongoing. Although the results with the antagomirs are promising in the in vitro model, we still cannot account for the complexity in an in vivo model and the efficacy of this treatment.DISCUSSION In summary, we have validated the previously predicted panel of candidate spaceflight-relevant miRNAs using a combination of spaceflight, simulated microgravity, partial gravity, and simulated deep space radiation conditions in male and female mouse and rat in vivo, astronaut, and human ex vivo models. The majority of rodent serum miRNAs followed the pattern of dose-dependent increase in response to IR, with the notable exception of miR-217 (Figures 7D and 7E). We evaluated the applicability of this miRNA signature to humans by examining miRNA content in the supernatant of primary human immune cell samples exposed to simulated deep space radiation, as well as immune cells from the NASA Twins Study, and observed partial conservation across species. The functional significance of key miRNAs was predicted by analyzing miRNA-dependent changes in gene expression at the single-cell level in the NASA Twins Study and experimentally evaluated utilizing antagomirs to mitigate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation in a 3D human microvascular tissue model. When viewing these results independently, it may appear that some level of variability occurs for the miRNA between the different conditions (Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4), but when observing all conditions together, this variability is in fact accounted for, based on which component of the space environment is being observed. A summary of how all the miRNA patterns and downstream targets demonstrate the consistency over all the models utilized for this study is shown in Figures 7D and 7E. For example, certain miRNAs (e.g., let-7a-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-223-3p) are more significantly regulated with microgravity experiments as opposed space radiation experiments, while other miRNAs (e.g., miR-16-5p) are consistently being expressed in all conditions (Figure 7D). Collectively, our samples identify two spaceflight miRNA signatures, the first associated with reduced gravity and LEO and the second representing the responses to simulated deep space radiation. Specifically, gamma-irradiated mice, sham HU mice, PWB rats, ISS-flown mice, and the Twins Study data collectively display a LEO/microgravity miRNA signature, while 600 MeV/n 56Fe and proton-irradiated mice, human PBMCs, and human 3D microvascular tissue models exposed to 600 MeV/n 56Fe ions and simplified simulated GCRs show a deep-space-radiation-dependent signature (Figure 7D). Notably, significant overlaps exist between both signatures, indicating a miRNA panel that might be particularly relevant to future lunar and Mars missions that will combine both stressors. The absence of significant differences in miRNA-217 expression in these datasets serves as a negative control and demonstrates that the responses that had been observed in the remaining candidate miRNAs are unlikely to be caused by universal miRNA increases induced by an arbitrary stressor. A miRNA signature unique to the spaceflight response has potential uses as a biomarker of systemic biological damage as well as a source for targets for mitigating the health risks caused by spaceflight and deep space radiation. While specific miRNAs have previously been implicated in spaceflight-associated biological damage (Girardi et al., 2014; Simone et al., 2009; Teodori et al., 2019), recent systems biology studies indicate that using an entire miRNA network as a biomarker can provide a more robust association with biological changes (Beheshti et al., 2017). In addition, we have observed that individual components of the space environment have unique miRNA signatures: some miRNAs are associated with the microgravity component of real or simulated spaceflight, others are associated with exposure to deep space radiation, and still others are only significantly increased after exposure to both, suggesting that different miRNA-based biomarkers would be applicable to different conditions, with the latter being particularly important in deep space exploration. The sensitivity of miRNA responses is underscored by the fact that the magnitude of miRNA increases appears to be dose dependent for both radiation and microgravity, as observed in the mouse simulated space environment model and the PWB rat model, respectively. Similarly, for the IR component, the signature is also LET dependent, as we report more significant miRNA changes after 600 MeV/n 56Fe compared to proton or gamma irradiation, which suggests its potential relevance for future deep space missions. Finally, conserved increases of key miRNAs across species, sexes, and experiments emphasizes the reliability of the miRNA signature. Since the majority of the data in this paper are from males, there can be sex-specific differences that are not captured here. It has been shown that certain miRNAs and family members of miRNAs are significantly expressed in one sex over the other, in normal and cancerous (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas) tissues (Guo et al., 2017). For example, miR-503 is linked to female-related cardiovascular disease (Florijn et al., 2018), indicating that miRNAs in the same family have similar behaviors in different sexes while still linked to the original family of miRNAs. Future research will need to explore the sex differences and the spaceflight signatures for specific miRNAs as well as related miRNA family members. Of note, miRNA signatures may be applied for improving astronaut health by providing the first step toward identifying a network of circulating regulatory molecules that are activated by spaceflight. Identifying, validating and targeting such systemic regulatory networks, as opposed to addressing symptomatic damage in isolated organs and tissues, may accelerate our ability to mitigate the damage to several organ systems at once. Additionally, this approach may be used for preemptive risk reduction. Indeed, we experimentally demonstrated the countermeasure potential of miRNAs by using antagomirs to inhibit three miRNAs associated with spaceflight cardiovascular health risks in human 3D tissue models. In general, antagomirs are a powerful tool for preventing the downstream effects of miRNA, which can be extensive due to the ability of a single miRNA to interact with hundreds of genes at the transcriptional, translational, and protein levels (Krützfeldt et al., 2005). Antagomirs have been shown to effectively inhibit their miRNA targets in vivo in mouse models of disease; however, more research is required for understanding their off-target effects and tissue specificity (Ishida and Selaru, 2013). In our model, antagomirs were applied as a countermeasure prior to deep-space-relevant irradiation and successfully prevented microvascular damage. Thus, our suggested network of miRNAs and their implied targets not only provides mechanistic insight into spaceflight-induced organ damage, but also may be a valuable platform for preventing the adverse health effects of spaceflight. However, in our experiments, the antagomir therapy was only applied against the cardiovascular component of the miRNA signature due to the model only recapitulating human microvasculature. It would be important to measure the effects of miRNA inhibition of the rest of the miRNA signature in a model that more fully captures spaceflight-mediated immune dysfunction and cancer progression as well as in vivo. The panel of spaceflight-associated miRNAs has been predicted to disrupt cell signaling and metabolic pathways, at least in part via their interactions with TGF-β1 (Beheshti et al., 2018). TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been shown previously to be significantly modulated during spaceflight conditions (Jessup et al., 2000; Westerlind and Turner, 1995), and its expression has been successfully altered as a therapeutic approach in cancer and inflammation. However, TGF-β1 is involved in a wide variety of endothelial and immune cell processes, which makes it a risky target (Otten et al., 2010). Furthermore, given that TGF-β1 has been found to exert both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting effects at different stages of tumorigenesis (Ikushima and Miyazono, 2010), the ability of miRNAs to target the TGF-β1 pathway at multiple specific sites may suggest a more effective and dynamic modulation of TGF-β1 effects than simple overexpression or inhibition (Butz et al., 2012). Thus, antagomir-mediated miRNA inhibition may allow more context-specific TGF-β1 pathway modulation and may be a promising countermeasure for spaceflight applications as well. The interactions between the proposed miRNA candidates and TGF-β1 have important consequences for inflammation during different stages of spaceflight, particularly during landing. miR-145 and miR-146a, which are both associated with a pro-inflammatory response (Tahamtan et al., 2018), have been found to be increased during landing (Capri et al., 2019). miR-21, which is involved in the resolution of inflammation (Tahamtan et al., 2018), has been found to be decreased during spaceflight (Hughes-Fulford et al., 2015; Makedonas et al., 2018) and increased during landing (Capri et al., 2019). Changes in these miRNAs during different stages of spaceflight likely contribute to the overall dysregulation of inflammation, which may persist long after astronauts return to Earth (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) In general, miRNAs have yet to be studied extensively in the context of space biology. Previous rodent and human spaceflight (LEO) experiments that specifically examined miRNAs have been limited to in vitro cellular models (human fibroblasts and leukocytes), though some miRNAs (miR-34, miR-21, let-7a, and let-7c) identified in those studies do overlap with our proposed spaceflight signature (Hughes-Fulford et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). Simulated microgravity studies in humans undergoing 21-day bedrest have also reported let-7a, let-7c, miR-25, miR-125b, and miR-92a from our panel (Rullman et al., 2016). Finally, simulated deep space radiation studies in mice have implicated miR-34 and miR-125 (Templin et al., 2012), which we have also observed in irradiated mouse serum. Further studies will be necessary to compare spaceflight-associated miRNA effects at the individual organ, tissue, and cellular levels and to explore potential sex differences. Although we have observed strong similarities in miRNA expression in cardiac and soleus muscles (Figures 7D and 7E), the miRNA content in these organs was not sufficient to explain the systemic changes in plasma miRNAs, indicating that other organs and tissues not quantified in this study may play a major role in miRNA expression. Therefore, there is a need for a more comprehensive and unbiased assessment of all miRNA through miRNA-seq in a wide range of tissues from each of the experimental models investigated here. In addition, scRNA-seq has indicated major changes in miRNA-associated gene expression among different blood immune cell types in the human blood from the NASA Twins Study (Gertz et al., 2020). CD14+ monocytes are particularly likely to express and respond to miRNAs, suggesting a potential regulatory role of miRNAs on the innate immune response that is known to be dysregulated in spaceflight (Crucian et al., 2011). Despite the demonstrated contribution of CD14+ monocytes to increases in the circulating miRNAs, it is also possible that the miRNAs could be coming from another organ where they are more abundantly expressed. Thus, further studies will be necessary to determine the exact origin of the increased miRNAs and tissue response, such as with cell-free DNA profiling (Bezdan et al., 2020), which will be beneficial for mapping and developing effective countermeasures. Finally, the successful prevention of vascular damage through antagomir therapy in our proof-of-concept human tissue model demonstrates the need for further experiments to fully characterize antagomir therapies in vivo to understand their clinical safety and efficacy and to examine which components of the spaceflight miRNA signature make effective targets for antagomir therapies. Collectively, our results provide experimental confirmation of a previously predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA signature (Beheshti et al., 2018) in multiple rodent and human models in true spaceflight, simulated gravitational changes, and simulated deep space radiation. We also demonstrate the potential for preventing biological damage by strategic inhibition of specific miRNAs with antagomirs. The immediate impact of this study is the first step toward developing a systemic miRNA signature as a novel space biology research metric for assessing spaceflight-induced damage in astronauts and animal models of true spaceflight as well as ground analogs, while its expected long-term outcome is revealing new avenues for spaceflight countermeasure development that modulates systemic effects rather than isolated organ damage.STAR★METHODS RESOURCE AVAILABILITY Lead Contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Afshin Beheshti (afshin.beheshti@nasa.gov).Materials Availability This study did not generate new unique reagents.Data and Code Availability The published article includes all datasets generated and analyzed during this study.

Forty 16-week old male C57BL/6J (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) mice were divided into four equal groups: sham, irradiated (IR), hindlimb unloaded (HU), or HU + IR. Mice were given sham or 2Gy of gamma (137Cs) irradiation, on day 3 of normal loading or HU, and were sacrificed on day 14. Animals assigned to the HU group were suspended with traction tape based on previously established procedures (Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998). The room was maintained at an average 73.3°F, 31% humidity, 12-hour light/dark cycle, with food and water provided ad libitum. Animal weights were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment to assess health of the mice. The NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all procedures. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. All animals were individually housed. At 16 weeks of age, mice were exposed to 2 Gy gamma total body irradiation (137Cs at 0.83 Gy/min, JL Shepherd Mark I, San Gabriel, CA). For this treatment, mice were housed individually in a custom animal holding cage, maintaining HU mice in a head-down position. Mice were placed in the irradiator chamber and exposed to total body irradiation. The unloading of mice was maintained during irradiation by custom small HU cages. Sham-irradiated controls were handled similarly and placed in the irradiation chamber with the radiation source turned off. Additional mouse serum was obtained from Dr. Yasaman Shirazi from a simulated microgravity and radiation study (Table S1). Eighty 16-week old C57BL/6J male mice (Jackson Laboratory Maine, BNL protocol Globus 2015 #481) were divided into seven groups: sham (n = 14), 1Gy proton irradiation (1H, 150 MeV/n, LET ~0.52 KeV/um) (n = 9), 1Gy iron (56Fe, 600 MeV/n, LET ~175 KeV/um) irradiation (n = 9), 2Gy iron irradiation (n = 6), 1Gy mixed iron and proton irradiation (1H/56Fe/1H at 25/50/25cGy) (n = 14), hindlimb unloaded (HU) (n = 14), and HU+1Gy mixed iron and proton irradiation (n = 14). Total body irradiations were carried out at NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) on conscious mice with 600 MeV/n 56Fe (1 Gy), 150 MeV/n 1H (1Gy), or mixed beam (1H/56Fe/1H at 25/50/25cGy), maintaining respective hindlimb unloading (HU) or normal loading (NL) conditions. Mice were irradiated after 3 days of HU or NL, and maintained HU or NL for 1 or 11 days before being sacrificed. For both the above simulated microgravity and radiation studies, serum was isolated from blood draws from the vena cava of the mice. In order to prevent hemolysis from interfering in the results, the following protocol was uniformly conducted for all serum isolations: the blood was placed in a 4mL EDTA coated blood collection tube (BD Vacutainer Lavender K2-EDTA Cat# 367861) and kept at room temperature for 30 mins to allow for clotting. Then, the tubes were centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C followed by immediate freezing of the aliquots at −80°C. Samples were always mixed gently to prevent hemolysis.Partial weight bearing rat model Partial weight bearing rat serum was donated by Dr. Marie Mortreux and Dr. Seward Rutkove from a previous study. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 40 adult male Wistar rats (14 weeks of age at baseline, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were assigned to 1 of 5 groups to ensure equal distribution of the body weights at baseline (428.3 ± 5.2g). Animals were assigned to either normal loading without apparatus (PWB100 N), normal loading with full harness (PWB100 FH), 70% of normal loading (PWB70), 40% of normal loading (PWB40), or 20% of normal loading (PWB20) for 28 consecutive days. Partial weight-bearing (PWB) was performed in custom cages using a quadrupedal unloading composed of a forelimb jacket and a pelvic harness and extensively described elsewhere (Mortreux et al., 2018). Across our 28-day study, the only significant difference between the NH and FH control groups was observed in weight gain where the 100% gravity NH group gained significantly more weight than the 100% gravity FH group. The weight gain was also associated with a slightly (but not significant) increased daily food intake that did not result in a different cumulative food intake throughout our study. The device did not exert any pressure nor prevented the animals from moving freely in their cage. Rats were singly housed in a room maintained at 22 ± 2°C with a 12h:12h light-dark cycle starting at 7:00 am, and allowed 48 hours to acclimate before baseline. On day 28, animals were euthanized using CO2 inhalation per IACUC guidelines and blood was collected via cardiac puncture. Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature and was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10,000g. Serum was collected and frozen upon further analysis. 4 animals per group were selected randomly to perform miRNA analysis, and are outlined in Table S1.ISS-flown mice Serum was isolated from 36 space-flown female BALB/cAnNTac mice (Taconic) (Table S1). These mice were launched to the ISS on Rodent Research Reference Mission 1 (RRRM-1)/Rodent Research Mission 8 (RR-8) on 12/05/2018, docked to the ISS on 12/08/2018 and were returned to Earth as live animals on 01/13/2019, a total of 39 days after launch. The total absorbed radiation dose the mice received was 11.28mGy. The mice were sacrificed 4 days after returning to Earth. There were two different age groups, young (n = 18, 10-16 weeks) and old (n = 18, 31-37 weeks) as outlined in Table S1.Space irradiation and hindlimb unloading of mice for miRNA-sequencing 15-week ± 3-day old, C57BL/6J wild-type (Wt) female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Upon arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a standard 12:12h light:dark cycle, with controlled temperature/humidity for 1-week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water were given ad libitum, and standard bedding was changed once per week. Mice were cage acclimated (n = 10 mice per group; 2 mice per cage to maintain social interaction) 3-days prior to HU, followed by 14-days either normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, see details below). Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-hours post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated tubes (0.5 M) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2,000xg for 15 minutes. Plasma was collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for −80°C storage. A 100 μL aliquot of cellular fraction was flash frozen and stored at −80°C for RNA analyses, while the remaining cellular fraction was lysed with 1x RBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by flow cytometric preparation and analyses, as describe below. The heart, liver, and soleus muscle were flash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at −80°C. Body weight tracking was performed on days −3, 0, 7 and 14. Hindlimb unloading (HU) was performed using the adjusted Morey-Holton method for social housing (n = 2 per cage) (Tahimic et al., 2019). Briefly, mice were suspended from the tail using non-invasive traction tape attached to an adjustable pulley mounted on the top of a standard rodent cage. The adjustable nature of the device allows the user to position the animal in a head-down position (approximately 30° to the horizon) once attached. The crossbar height, lateral crossbar position, and chain length are adjustable. The pulley is free to move along the crossbar that spans the length of the top of the cage enabling the mouse to navigate freely on one half of the cage using its forepaws and to interact with the second mouse in the cage, without enabling ambulation of the limbs. Individual food and water sources are provided to each mouse and replaced daily. Control mice were housed in identical cages with normal ambulation. On day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility by animal care staff and were transferred to individual HU boxes. The following doses of irradiation were administered; simplified GCR sim (0.5 Gy), SPE (1 Gy), Gamma (5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). Mice were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irradiation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. To simulate GCR, we used the simplified GCR simulation of ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula that consists of 5 ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 minutes instead of the actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. Further, GCR sim is a mixture of high and low LET ions in a ratio of 15% to 85%, respectfully. To simulate SPE, we used a total dose of 1Gy protons with energy ranges from 50MeV to 150MeV. For all irradiations a 60x60 beam was utilized at NSRL. For radiation dose equivalence and biological reference, we used 5 Gy gamma irradiation with the cesium resource available at BNL, in the absence of HU due to resource limitations. Sham controls were treated similar to GCR/SPE irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simualtion, i.e., 25 minutes. In vitro models Irradiated human PBMCs Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from Dr. Sylvain Costes from a human irradiation sensitivity study (NASA HRP #NNJ16HP24I, NASA Ames Research Center Human Research IRB #HRI-357) (Table S1). Briefly, PBMCs were isolated from blood donated by 12 healthy adults: 8 females and 4 males. PBMC isolation was performed using Ficoll-Paque (VWR Cat# 95038-168) density gradient centrifugation followed by red blood cell lysis (VWR Cat# 420301-BL), and cells were frozen at 1x107 cells/mL until the day before irradiation. All subjects were of European descent and 20 - 64 years old. Cells were plated in 12-well plates (VWR Cat# 29442-040) 24 hours before irradiation in RPMI 1640 (Sigma Cat# R8758) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (VWR Cat# 1300-500H) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin/Glutamine (Fisher Cat# 10-378-016). Each well received approximately 1.6x106 cells and 2mL media. 24 hours later, the cells were irradiated with 0Gy or 0.3Gy 600MeV/n 56Fe. Cell supernatants were collected 4 hours after irradiation and stored at −80°C until miRNA extractions.3D human vascular model Mature human 3D microvascular tissue models are grown by seeding-human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Lonza Cat# CC-2519) into a collagen/matrigel mixture as described (Grabham et al., 2011). Briefly, HUVECs were first grown in EGM Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Cat# CC-3124), then cells (1 × 106/ml) were embedded into a collagen/matrigel mixture (Cat# 354236 and Cat# 356230). Microvessels are grown in EGM-2 Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Cat# CC-3162) plus 50 nM Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate: (PMA) (Cat# 524400) for 7 days to form tubular microvessels before irradiations. These tissue models were used to study vascular changes associated with specific miRNAs (Table S1). Irradiations were carried out at Brookhaven National Lab using 50cGy of SimGCRSim (5-ion simplified galactic cosmic ray simulation: protons at 1000MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV). A dose of 0.5 μm of each antagomir was administered to the appropriate groups 24 hours prior to irradiation. Prior work has shown that lentivirus particles efficiently incorporate into these constructs, therefore it was assumed that antagomirs would have no trouble either. The tissue constructs used for fluorescence analysis were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Cat# 158127100G) for 5 minutes at 37°C followed by 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma Cat# X100) to solubilize the fats. Cell structures were stained with 5-(4,6-Dichlorotriazinyl) Aminofluorescein (DTAF) (Cat# D 16) and Images captured on a Nikon TE 200 confocal C1 microscope with EZ-C1 software. The tissue constructs used for miRNA analysis were dissolved by submerging in TRIzol (ThermoFisher Cat# 15596026) 48 hours post irradiation, without any fixation or homogenization.Simulated GCR irradiation To simulate GCR, we used the simplified GCR simulation of ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula that consists of 5 ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, 56Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV, in the following proportions; Protons 100MeV at 34.8%, Si at 1.1%, He at 18%, O at 5.8%, 56Fe at 1%, and Protons 250 MeV at 39.3%. This mixture is the simplified version of the full GCR simulation and represents the proportions of ions found in space and thus translates to exploratory class missions (Simonsen et al., 2020). The low LET particles (Protons and Helium) make up the majority of radiation although high LET ions generally have a greater RBE.NASA Twins study samples The NASA Twins Study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time of launch. The flight twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS while his identical twin stayed on Earth as the ground control. Blood samples were collected into 4mL CPT tubes (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. Cell separation was performed by centrifugation in at 1800 X g for 20 minutes at room temperature, both on the ISS and for the ground-based samples. Ambient blood collected samples slated for immediate return on Soyuz capsule were stored at 4°C until processing (average of 35-37 hours after collection, including repatriation time). Samples collected on Earth and the ISS and planned for long-term storage were mixed by inversion and immediately frozen at −80°C. Fresh processing of CPT tubes was performed using the following steps: 1. plasma was retrieved from the CPT tubes and flash frozen prior to long term storage at −80°C. 2. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered and washed in PBS. 0.5 million PBMCs were retrieved from one pre-flight and one post-flight samples, pelleted, flash frozen and stored at −80°C until use for RNA extractions. The flow through from cell sorting steps was recovered as the lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction; LD and PBMC cell specimens were lysed into RLT+ buffer (QIAGEN Cat# 1053393), flash frozen and stored at −80°C until use.METHOD DETAILS Accounting for Hemolysis in Samples Although hemolysis is unavoidable for blood/serum samples obtained from in vivo studies similar to what is described throughout this manuscript, we believe that we have accounted for this to the best to our ability for our analysis. There are many papers discussing this topic and impact on circulating miRNAs with the conclusions from these papers stating that for in vivo samples hemolysis can’t be avoided but procedures can be done to reduce the effects dramatically (Blondal et al., 2013; Pizzamiglio et al., 2017; Poel et al., 2018). Due the constraints for space biology experiments, the main step to reduce hemolysis variations for miRNAs is by handling all the samples identically. Both the controls and all other samples were handled under the exact same conditions throughout the manuscript. So if miRNAs levels would have been altered due to hemolyzed blood, then all miRNA levels would have been altered the same way between our comparisons. In fact in the negative controls all the miRNAs from our spaceflight signature are either nonexistent or at extremely low levels compared to samples under experimental conditions. This indicated that although it has been reported that hemolysis will alter miRNAs levels for all samples (Pizzamiglio et al., 2017), the levels of the miRNAs should have been altered identically in our controls and experimental conditions, allowing for reduced variability between results.miRNA extraction MiRNA extractions from serum, plasma, all tissues, and cell supernatants were carried out using the QIAGEN miRNeasy serum/plasma kit (#217184). MiRNA extractions from dissolved microvessel constructs were carried out using the QIAGEN miRNeasy Mini Kit (#217004). Quantitation of miRNA samples was done using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Total RNA extraction from the NASA Twin Study LD and PBMC lysates was carried out using the QIAGEN Allprep kit (Cat# 80204). Quantitation of RNA was assessed using Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA quality control was performed using RNA Nano kit (Agilent) on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) per manufacturer’s recommendations.cDNA generation and Droplet Digital PCR First, cDNA was synthesized from miRNA samples using the QIAGEN miRCURY LNA RT Kit (Cat# 339340) using a concentration of 5ng/μl for the miRNA per sample. Next, samples were mixed with a 1:20 dilution of the generated cDNA with the BioRad QX200 ddPCR Evagreen Supermix (Cat# 1864034) and the appropriate miRNA primers from miRCURY LNA miRNA PCR Assays (QIAGEN). BioRad QX200 Automated Droplet Generator (Cat# 1864101) was used to create emulsion droplets. With the C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler with 96–Deep Well Reaction Module (Bio-Rad) the following PCR reaction was used for all the primers: 1 cycle 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s and 58°C for 1 min (the annealing temperature can change depending on the primer), 1 cycle of 4°C for 5 min, and 1 cycle of 90°C for 5 min. Not all miRNA primers sets for ddPCR will have the same annealing temperature, so optimizing the annealing temperature is required for each primer set. Their respective annealing temperatures are found in Table S2. Finally, the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) quantified the amount of miRNA for each primer set per sample. QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad) generated the data for each primer set and sample. The same threshold setting was used for all samples per primer set. The concentration (miRNA copies/μl) value generated by QuantaSoft was converted to miRNA copies/ng of serum. These values were used for all miRNA analysis. For all analysis the miRNA concentrations were log2(x+1) transformed to allow for easy comparison between miRNAs and samples.miRNA sequencing on murine samples Library construction and sequencing was performed from miRNAs isolated from plasma, liver, heart, and soleus muscle from the mouse experiments described above. The miRNA extraction was carried out using the QIAgen miRNeasy kit (#217004). The total RNA quality and quantity were analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number > 7. Approximately 1 μg of total RNA was used to prepare small RNA library according to protocol of TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Single-end sequencing was performed using 50 bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the LC Sciences (Hangzhou, China) following the vendor’s recommended protocol. All miRNA-sequence raw data was deposited on NASA’s GeneLab data repository/platform with the following identifiers: for all heart tissue related data: GLDS-334, https://doi.org/10.26030/cg2g-as49 for all liver tissue related data: GLDS-335, https://doi.org/10.26030/72ke-1k67: for all soleus muscle related data: GLDS-337, https://doi.org/10.26030/m73g-2477 and for all plasma related data: GLDS-336, https://doi.org/10.26030/qasa-rr29.miRNA sequencing on NASA Twins Study samples Small RNA libraries were prepared from 50 ng total RNA using the NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® (NEB #E7560) per manufacturer’s recommendations with the following modifications: adaptors and RT primer were diluted four fold, 17 cycles of PCR were used for library amplification, and no size selection was performed. The i7 primers in the NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina® Dual Index Primers (NEB# E7600, NEB#E7780) were used to supplement the index primers in NEB #E7560. The libraries were sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq instrument (1x50bp).Single cell RNA and epitope sequencing on NASA Twin Study samples Cells were isolated prepared using the BD Rhapsody platform according to the BD Rhapsody Express Single-Cell Analysis System Instrument User Guide, with a custom-designed RNA and epitope panel. Briefly, cells from each sample were labeled with sample tags, then pooled after being washed twice with FACS buffer. Combined samples were then washed an additional time before being stained with the BD AbSeq Ab-Oligo reagents. After staining, the cells were washed twice before resuspension at approximately 20,000 cells in 620 μL. These cells were then isolated using the Single-Cell Analysis System and cDNA Synthesis with the BD Rhapsody Express Single-Cell Analysis System using the manufacturers’ protocol (BD Biosciences). Cells were loaded onto 3 BD Rhapsody nanowell cartridges. Cartridges were loaded with Cell Capture Beads (BD Biosciences) before shaking for 15 s at 1,000 rpm. Cells were lysed and cell capture beads were retrieved and washed prior to Exonuclease I treatment and reverse transcription. Targeted amplification of cDNA with the Human Immune Response Panel primers and custom supplemental panel (all targets listed in Table S3) was done through 10 PCR cycles. PCR products were purified, and mRNA and AbSeq products were separated by SPRIselect beads with double-sided selection. mRNA products were amplified further with 15 PCR cycles. Final libraries were indexed with 8 PCR cycles. Library quality was assessed by Bioanalyzer (D1000 HS, Agilent). Library DNA concentration was quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher, #Q32854) on a Qubit Fluorometer. Libraries were diluted to 2nM and multiplexed before being sequenced on three lanes of a Novaseq-6000. Mean read depth per cell was 13,244.31 mRNA reads per cell and 11,506.98 AbSeq reads per cell for a combined 243751.30 reads per cell.Single cell ATAC sequencing on NASA Twins Study samples Cells were isolated and prepared according to the SureCell ATAC-Seq Library Prep Kit User Guide (17004620, Bio-Rad) by the Weill Cornell Epigenomics Core. Briefly, lysis and tagmentation was performed simultaneously on the leukocyte depleted fraction of PBMC samples. Cells were washed before resuspension in Whole Cell Tagmentation Mix. Cells were tagmented using a thermal protocol before being mixed and agitated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Prior to encapsulation, tagmented cells were kept on ice. Tagmented cells were loaded onto the ddSEQ Single-Cell Isolator (12004336, Bio-Rad). The SureCell ATAC-Seq Library Prep Kit (17004620, Bio-Rad) and SureCell ddSEQ Index Kit (12009360, Bio-Rad) were used to prepare scATAC libraries. Ampure XP beads (A63880, Beckman Coulter) were used to clean up the libraries. Barcoded amplicons were further amplified through 7 PCR cycles. These PCR products were cleaned up using Ampure XP beads and quality was assessed on both a TapeStation (D5000, Agilent) and Bioanalyzer. Library concentrations were quantified by on a Qubit Fluorometer by Qubit dsDNA HS Kit. Experiments were then pooled and sequenced by Bio-Rad on four lanes of a Novaseq-6000.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS miRNA quantification analysis from ddPCR data We previously utilized NASA GeneLab database to make unbiased predictions about miRNAs potentially involved in regulating the spaceflight response (Beheshti et al., 2018). The transcriptomic datasets analyzed in this study include GLDS-25 (livers from female C57BL/6J mice, n = 15 per group), GLDS-21 (gastrocnemius from female C57BL/6J mice, n = 4 per group), GLDS-63 (mammary gland, liver, and adipose tissue from pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats, n = 4 per group), GLDS-111 (soleus and extensor digitorum longus from male C57/BL6 mice, n = 3 per group), GLDS-4 (thymus from C57BL/6NTac mice, n = 4 per group), GLDS-61 (skin from male C57Bl/J10 mice, n = 3 per group), and GLDS-48 (liver from female C57BL/6J mice, n = 6 per group). Details for this work and analysis is available in Beheshti et al. (Beheshti et al., 2018) and is the basis of the analysis we are describing in these methods. Experimental groups and the number of replicates (n) within each group are summarized in Table S1. For analysis on the archived serum from the simulated murine experiments, we grouped all miRNA copies/ng values for NL Sham controls together and all other experimental groups were compared to the NL Sham conditions. For all analysis the p values reported are two-sided and adjusted with the significance indicated by * p value < 0.05, ** p value < 0.01, and *** p value < 0.001. Hierarchical clustering of the miRNA values were displayed as heatmaps with pheamap and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analysis (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) was done to determine how the samples cluster together based on the miRNA values. The miRNA values were also plotted using R-program ggplot2 (v3.2.1) (Wickham, 2016.) as scatterplots and data points were then fit using a generalized additive model (GAM) (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1986; Wood et al., 2015). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway predictions from the miRNAs were determined by the DIANA-TarBase v7.0 algorithm. Correlation plots between miRNAs and different conditions were plotted using R program corrplot v0.84. Lastly, OriginPro 2015 was used to plot bar plots and of the fold-change values between conditions and also boxplots. In silico predictions of genes from miRNAs Through the use of a Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) plug-in called ClueGo/CluePedia (Bindea et al., 2013), we were able to predict genes targeted by the miRNAs determined. This involved entering all miRNAs in ClueGo and allowing the software to determine the top 50 genes that were significantly regulated and connected to the miRNAs. The predictions only reflect the functions that will be regulated by the miRNAs and do not show whether the function will be activated or inhibited. We also predicted the impact of the miRNAs on overall pathways by utilizing DIANA microT-CDS tool which allows for pathway discovery from targeted miRNAs (Paraskevopoulou et al., 2013; Reczko et al., 2012). Lastly, miRNet 2.0 was utilized to predict the diseases that are associated with the miRNAs (Chang et al., 2020).Analysis of miRNA sequencing from murine samples Raw reads were subjected to an in-house software program, ACGT101-miR (LC Sciences, Houston, Texas, USA) to remove adaptor dimers, junk, low complexity, common RNA families (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and repeats. Subsequently, unique sequences with length in 18~26 nucleotide were mapped to specific species precursors in miRBase 22.0 (Kozomara et al., 2019) by BLAST search to identify known miRNAs and novel 3p- and 5p- derived miRNAs. Length variation at both 3′ and 5′ ends and one mismatch inside of the sequence were allowed in the alignment. The unique sequences mapping to specific species mature miRNAs in hairpin arms were identified as known miRNAs. The unique sequences mapping to the other arm of known specific species precursor hairpin opposite to the annotated mature miRNA-containing arm were considered to be novel 5p- or 3p- derived miRNA candidates. The remaining sequences were mapped to other selected species precursors (with the exclusion of specific species) in miRBase 22.0 by BLAST search, and the mapped pre-miRNAs were further BLASTed against the specific species genomes to determine their genomic locations. The above two we defined as known miRNAs. The unmapped sequences were BLASTed against the specific genomes, and the hairpin RNA structures containing sequences were predicated from the flank 80 nt sequences using RNAfold software (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi). The criteria for secondary structure prediction were: (1) number of nucleotides in one bulge in stem (≤12); (2) number of base pairs in the stem region of the predicted hairpin (≥16); (3) cutoff of free energy (kCal/mol ≤ −15); (4) length of hairpin (up and down stems + terminal loop ≥ 50); (5) length of hairpin loop (≤20); (6) number of nucleotides in one bulge in mature region (≤8); (7) number of biased errors in one bulge in mature region (≤4); (8) number of biased bulges in mature region (≤2); (9) number of errors in mature region (≤7); (10) number of base pairs in the mature region of the predicted hairpin (≥12); and (11) percent of mature in stem (≥80). Differential expression of miRNAs based on normalized deep-sequencing counts was analyzed by selectively using Fisher exact test, Chi-square 2X2 test, Chi-square nXn test, Student t test, or ANOVA based on the experimental design. The significance threshold was set to be 0.01 and 0.05 in each test. To determine gene ontology (GO) (Smith and Eppig, 2009) and C2 pathways being regulated by the miRNAs we performed miRNA gene set analysis utilizing the RBiomirGS v0.2.12 R package (Zhang and Storey, 2018) from the processed miRNA analysis for all conditions in the plasma and heart tissues. From the pathways we chose an FDR < 0.25 cutoff for significantly regulated pathways. We plotted the specific pathways with R packages ggplot2.Analysis of miRNA sequencing from NASA Twin Study samples Standard libraries were preprocessed and quality controlled using miRTrace (Kang et al., 2018). Subsequently, reads were mapped against MirGeneDB sequences (Fromm et al., 2020) using the miRDeep2 (Friedländer et al., 2012) quantifier module. Expression values were normalized to reads per million (RPM) considering only miRNA counts. The normalized RPM value were utilized for all analysis. If the value for the miRNA was zero for all samples that miRNA was excluded from the analysis. To determine statistically significant miRNAs, ANOVA analysis with p value < 0.2 was independently performed for each cell type. For flight only comparisons, the same statistical significance was applied for all time points excluding the ground samples and all ambient return samples. All statistics were run independently for each cell condition/type. To determine the overlap of the miRNA signature in this paper with the Twin Study miRNA-seq data, the proposed miRNAs were used as well as all mature components of the miRNAs included in the miRNA family.Analysis of scRNA and abseq from NASA Twins Study samples Fastq files were uploaded to Seven Bridges Genomics. Data was demultiplexed and sequences analyzed with BD’s Rhapsody pipeline (BD Rhapsody Analysis Pipeline 1.4 Beta) on Seven Bridges (https://www.sevenbridges.com). Data was then loaded into Seurat (version 3.2.0) for analysis (Stuart et al., 2019). This generated a sparse matrix file of features by barcodes. This sparse matrix data was then read into R using the R package Seurat 3.2.0, and standard quality control was run to remove cells with few genes. Data was then scaled and normalized. MAST (Finak et al., 2015) was used to determine DEGs between all combinations of preflight, return and postflight for both TW and HR samples. Linear dimensional reduction was performed by calculation of PCA from the most variable genes. Cells were then clustered using a resolution value of 0.5 and visualized by UMAP. Marker genes were checked for RNA and epitope expression for each cluster and assigned to the indicated cell types, with cell subtypes being grouped to match the scATAC data (Figures S2E and S2F). multiMiR was used to extract target genes for spaceflight-associated miRNA (Ru et al., 2014). Module scores for each spaceflight-associated miRNA target signature was calculated by AddModuleScore with a control value of 5. Violin plots were created with ggplot2 (version 3.3.2, (Wickham, 2016.) and significance tested by Wilcoxon rank sum using the geom_signif function. Cells were subsetted by cell type and dot plots were generated using the Seurat DotPlot function. Full list of RNA and AbSeq target genes are found in Table S3.Analysis of scATAC from NASA Twins Study samples Fastq files from each sample were processed individually through BioRad’s scATAC processing pipeline according to the Bio-Rad ATAC-seq Analysis Toolkit Tutorial using the Bio-Rad docker images to run FastQC, debarcode, align reads, filter and deconvolute beads, and cell filtration. The aligned reads for each experiment were then processed using SnapTools (version 1.2.3) to create 5kb bins and a bin by cell matrix (Fang et al., 2020). The matrices for each sample were combined and then processed using SnapATAC (version 1.0.0) using the suggested parameters to filter for high-quality barcodes and remove bins that overlapped with ENCODE hg38 blacklisted regions or ChrM (Fang et al., 2020). Diffusion maps were computed for dimensionality reduction, and significant components were determined. Genes were assigned to each bin based off of GRCh38.p13. The resulting Snap object was then converted to a Seurat object and exported to Seurat (version 3.2.0). Samples were scaled and normalized, and anchors were transferred from the 10X PBMC dataset to the experiment from date 1/30/2019, as it contained the control, non-leukocyte depleted PBMCs. This data was then integrated using the IntegrateData function with the experiment from date 4/18/2019, and anchors were transferred from the 1/30/2019 experiment to the integrated object. Cells were assigned cell types based off of the predicted score, with cell subtypes being grouped to match the scRNA and epitope data (Figure S3I). Due to the sparsity of the data, MAGIC (Rmagic 2.0.3) was then used to impute activity using the default parameters (van Dijk et al., 2018). The imputed activity was then used to generate dot plots and violin plots, with significance being tested by Wilcoxon rank sum using the geom_signif function.

    "title": "Machine learning algorithm to characterize antimicrobial resistance associated with the International Space Station surface microbiome",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for long-distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes).Results We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics.Conclusion Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

    "methods": "Methods Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) methodology The paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads from  Short Read Archive (SRA) under the bio-project number PRJNA438545 were processed with Trimmomatic [12] to trim adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with a minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of the read used as a quality cut-off. Reads shorter than 80 bp were removed after trimming. Remaining high-quality reads were subsequently assembled using metaSPAdes [37]. Contigs were binned using Metabat2 v2.11.3 [31]. Recovered genomes were evaluated with CheckM [39], and a recovered genome was considered good with at least 90% completeness and at most 10% contamination. Each genome was subsequently annotated with the help of Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST), and near identifications were predicted [6]. Sample collection for Microbial Tracking 1 mission During the microbial tracking investigation to characterize airborne and surface-associated microbial population aboard the International Space Station, samples were collected from ISS locations, and ground samples were collected from the Crew resupply vehicle. A sterile polyester wipe premoistened with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to collect the samples from various areas across these ISS locations, and the details and description of the sample collection and cultivation have already been reported in Checinska Sielaff et al. [14] and Singh et al. [43]. Pure isolates were selected and sub-cultured, and the sub-cultures were sequenced. Isolates from Microbial Tracking 1 mission To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol [44], using NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell 2150 paired-end (PE) sequencing. Verification of the quality of the raw sequencing data was carried out using FastQC v0.11.7 [2]. Quality control for adapter trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp v0.20.0 [15], and then SPAdes v3.11.1 [7] was used to assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control was based on the following three parameters: (i) correction of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences, and (iii) quality trimming at the 59 and 39 ends. To determine the quality of the assembled sequences, the number of contigs, the N50 value, and the total length were calculated using QUAST v5.0.2 [26]. Default parameters were used for all software. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) [59] was calculated using OrthoANIu by comparing each of the scaffolds to the WGS of the respective type strains. Identification of ORFs in microbial DNA sequences Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov ModelER) v3.02 was used with default parameters to identify the coding regions and distinguish them from non-coding DNA in MAGs and MT-1 scaffolds that could be used as an input in DeepARG-LS. Minimum gene length was indicated as 50 bp (‘glimmer3 -g50’). Glimmer reads DNA sequences in a FASTA file format and predicts genes in them using an Interpolated Context Model [21]. Prediction of antibiotic resistance genes in short reads and full-gene length sequences DeepARG version 2 [3], a deep learning-based approach for predicting ARGs and annotation, was run with the ‘--reads’ option (DeepARG-SS) for NGS reads and the ‘--genes’ option (DeepRG-LS) for longer gene-like sequences obtained with Glimmer. The DeepARG model consists of four dense hidden layers of 2000, 1000, 500, and 100 units that propagate a bit score distribution. The output layer of the deep neural network consists of 30 units that correspond to the antibiotic resistance categories (102 antibiotics consolidated into 30 antibiotic categories). The model was trained with a curated database of 14,933 genes from three databases (CARD, ARDB, and UNIPROT) [3]. Default options were used: 50% minimum percentage of identity to consider, significance of the prediction probability cut-off of 0.8 as recommended [3], and E-value of alignments (default 1e−10). The software was downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/gusphdproj/deeparg-ss. Microbial nucleotide BLAST Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST 2.10.1+ (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was used to identify microbial species associated to MT-1 scaffolds. Sequences producing significant alignments were ranked and the species associated to maximum Score (bits) and minimum E value was deemed as the closest match. Gene annotations and pan-genome analysis of MT-1 scaffolds A Docker image with the software tool Prokka v1.14.5 [42] was pulled and used with default parameters to annotate bacterial isolates. The master annotations in GFF3 format for the 226 isolates have been deposited at the Zenodo platform [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6518836]. Using the annotated assemblies in GFF3 format for E. bugandensis and B. cereus strains, Roary v3.13.0 was run with default parameters to compare isolates based on genes and the number of isolates they are present in. Phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing Disc assays experiments were performed and reported in Urbaniak et al. [51]. The isolates were streaked from glycerol stocks onto R2A plates. A single colony was inoculated into 5 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and grown overnight at 30°C. Aliquots of 100 μL were plated on TSA. Agar diffusion discs (BD BBLTM Sensi-DiscTM, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed aseptically on a plate and the strains were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The tested antibiotics included: 30-μg cefazolin (CZ-30); 30-μg cefoxitin (FOX-30), 5 μg ciprofloxacin (CIP-5), 15 μg erythromycin (E-15), 10-μg gentamicin (GM-10), 1-μg oxacillin (OX), 10-μg penicillin (P-10), 5-μg rifampin (RA-5), and 10 μg tobramycin (NN-10). The diameter of inhibition zones was measured for each antibiotic disk and recorded in millimeters. The resistance results were compared with the zone diameter interpretive charts provided by the manufacturer. When the spontaneous mutants were present in response to some antibiotics, they were isolated, subcultured and tested for the specific antibiotic resistance. Data availability Raw metagenomics reads from three flights on multiple locations were downloaded from NASA GeneLab repository https://genelab.nasa.gov (GLDS-69). The ISS MAGs datasets are available at the SRA database under the accession number: PRJNA438545 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA438545/]. Microbial tracking-1 (MT-1) datasets (raw sequencing data and sequence assembly files) were obtained from GLDS-67, GLDS-302, GLDS-303, GLDS-309, GLDS-311 and GLDS-350. The rest of the samples are deposited at DDBJ/ ENA/GenBank or are unpublished.",
    "results": "Results Predictions based on short metagenomics sequences and ORFs partly overlap with previous analyses and reveal new AMR determinants at the ISS surface microbiome The first shotgun metagenome sequencing of intact microbial cells (Propidium monoazide-PMA treated) without whole-genome amplification was performed by Singh et al. [43]. There, samples were taken in 8 locations across three flights (F1, F2, F3) during a period of 12 months. A detailed description of sampling procedures and locations, species diversity and functional characterization can be found in Singh et al. [43]. To deploy a deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data, we used DeepARG, a computational resource proven to be more accurate than traditional approaches [3]. We first run DeepARG-SS (DeepARG for short reads) using the recommended prediction probability cut-off of 0.8 to obtain read counts of AMR genes (Fig. 2a). As in the seminal paper [43], quantification of antibiotics associated with AMR revealed ‘beta lactams’ ranking first and ‘peptide’ second, and generally more AMR reads counts observed in Flight 3 (F3) than in previous two flights (Fig. 2a). However, reads counts in certain antibiotics such as pleuromutilin, mupirocin and rifamycin were found largely in Flight 2 (Fig. 2a). Our read counts correlate (r = 0.86, p = 6.879e−7; Pearson’s product-moment correlation) with read counts obtained for antimicrobial resistance by Singh et al. [43] (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these suggest a partial overlap with results obtained in Singh et al. [43] analyzed using the traditional approach. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Prediction of ARGs using a pre-trained DeepARG-SS model. a Distribution of ARG read counts across antibiotic classes for the three flights (F1, F2, F3). b Correlation of read counts found by DeepARG-SS and those in Singh et al. [43]. Pearson's product-moment correlation r = 0.86, (p = 6.879e−07) for the three flights and their locations. c Read counts of ARG class across flights for each location for PMA-treated samples in Singh et al. [43, 44]. The antibiotic class (multi-drug) is not shown. Results are for ARGs with probability > 0.8While more AMR reads counts were found in Flight 3, we also observed variability between the different locations and flights, and an increasing number of read counts associated with time. For instance, location 4 (L4, surface of the dining table) increased the number of AMR reads counts with successive flights (Fig. 2b, c). While resistance to ‘beta lactams’ was evenly distributed across flights and locations, resistance to ‘polymyxin’ and especially ‘peptide’ represents a more significant proportion of AMR counts in locations of Flight 3 (Fig. 2c). In addition, we also observed the widespread presence of reads related to Macrolides, Lincosamides, Streptogamines (MLS), and tetracycline resistance. To investigate the possible association between AMR patterns and specific microbes, we assembled the short reads into Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs; see Methods), identified their Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and repeated the prediction of ARGs using DeepARG-LS [3]. Figure 3a shows the distribution of DeepARG classification probabilities and best-hit identity of ARGs in MAGs from the ISS. As we can retrieve highly probable ARGs (probability > 0.8) presenting low sequence identity (for many ARGs, identity is < 40%), this method is likely more advantageous than using the ‘best-hit’ approach only. Compared to DeepARG-SS results obtained previously, the analysis of MAGs did not reveal significant differences in the number of ARGs predicted in the ORFs for the different flights (Fig. 3b). However, interestingly the results show a smaller number bacterial species having ARGs in Flight #1 (F1) when compared to Flights #2 and #3 (Fig. 3b, c) (data is shown for MAGs with at least 1 predicted ARG; the total number of MAGs analyzed is 24). Specifically, the number of locations is smaller in Flight 1 (n = 3) than in F2 (n = 6) and F3 (n = 7) (Fig. 3b). Many ARGs were identified in Kalamiella piersonii MAGs in multiple locations during F3, showing AMR patterns related to (glyco)peptide, fluoroquinolone and MLS (Fig. 3c). Of note, the K. piersonii strain closely related to one found at the ISS has been associated to human urinary tract infection [40]. The potentially very pathogenic microbe E. bugandensis was found in location 2 (forward side panel wall of the Waste and Hygiene Compartment) in Flight 1, presenting more than 40 ARGs. In addition, in the original study, Pantoea species were found to be the dominant genus in samples in 5 out of 7 locations sampled from Flight 3, especially at location 5 (surface rack). In our re-analysis, we observed Pantoea brenneri and Pantoea dispersa having ARGs related to beta-lactams and peptide [43], as well as to triclosan and polymyxin resistance. Fig. 3.

Most common antibiotic class (multi-drug) not shown. The black arrows indicate Kalamiella piersoniiOverall, our results partially agree with earlier findings while providing new insights into previously unobserved antibiotic resistance classes (of the 30 antibiotic resistance categories included in the model). Specifically, the re-analysis of short sequences and MAGs from the ISS reveals dominance of K. piersonii antibiotic resistance in different locations of Flight 3 (Fig. 3c). Distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in scaffolds of Microbial Tracking-1 strains isolated from the ISS We then applied DeepARG-LS to 226 Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) isolates (Mason and Venkateswaran labs, published and unpublished WGS of MT-1 pure strains isolated from ISS environment). We found a range of 2 to 92 ARGs in 184 out of 226 isolates (Fig. 4a; Table S1). This machine learning approach allowed us to go beyond the traditional cut-off based only on high sequence DNA similarity (Figure S1). These results suggest a widespread presence of potential ARGs in the isolates, with ‘multi-drug’ class being first, followed by glycopeptides, beta-lactams, bacitracin, and tetracyclines. The ‘multi-drug’ antibiotic class was defined by aggregating several antibiotic names from the CARD and ARDB databases (efflux, multi-drug and na_antimicrobials). We then used BLAST to match isolates showing AMR sequences predicted by DeepARG to microbial species (Fig. 4a) and identified Bacillus cereus and E. bugandensis, which were previously profiled organisms on the ISS [44, 54] as the top 2 ranking species with a high number of ARGs. We have previously shown that five E. bugandensis isolates were almost equivalent to nosocomial earth isolates showing resistance to multi-drug antibiotic compounds, fluoroquinolones, and fosfomycin [44]. In addition, E. bugandensis strains were shown to be resistant to 9 antibiotics [51]. Our results reinforce the potential pathogenicity of this microbe. Nonetheless, antimicrobial resistance was not examined for B. cereus strains in Venkateswaran et al. [54]. B. cereus is a food poisoning microorganism that might be a concern for crew members' health. In addition, we found novel ARGs associated with other species such as K. pneumoniae, Pantoea, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus velezensis, Enterococcus faecalis, Sphingomonas, and, with a lower number of ARGs, several species of Staphylococcus. E. faecalis virulence was previously shown to be affected by microgravity [28]. We then used the tool Prokka [42] to fully annotate the bacterial isolates, finding as expected that the number of coding sequences, but not the number of ARGs, increased in proportion to genome sizes (Figure S2a). Then, we ran the pan-genome analysis tool Roary [38] to compare isolates of E. bugandensis (10) and B. cereus (10) finding that the core set of genes was highly conserved among strains of the same species (Figure S2b). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Heatmap and clustering of ARG counts detected in MT-1 pure strains isolated from the ISS and AST validations. a Heatmap with ARG count. The barplots illustrate the number of ARGs across rows and across columns. Species were identified using BLAST.

Pearson's product-moment correlation values are indicatedTo experimentally validate machine learning predictions on previously unobserved AMR patterns above, we performed Antibacterial Susceptibility Tests (AST) for the species found to be potentially most pathogenic, in our case E. bugandensis and B. cereus as they have a higher number of ARGs (Table S1; Fig. 4a). For that, we use disc diffusion on strains isolated at the ISS for the following antimicrobials: Cefazolin (beta−lactam), Cefoxitin (beta−lactam), Ciprofloxacin (quinolone), Erythromycin (MLS), Gentamycin (aminoglycoside), Oxacillin (beta−lactam), Penicillin (beta−lactam), Rifampin (rifamycin), and Tobramycin (aminoglycoside) (Fig. 4b). The prediction patterns closely matched the AST results (Fig. 4b), although DeepARG failed to detect Rifampin resistance, especially for E. bugandensis. Although different antibiotics have different inhibitory zone cut-offs for a strain to be considered as resistant (Table S2), remarkably we found an inverse correlation between the zone of inhibition and ARG count for B. cereus (r = − 0.637, Pearson's product-moment correlation, p = 2.2e−7) and E. bugandensis (r = − 0.517; p = 0.0002765) (Fig. 4c), demonstrating the applicability and high accuracy of computational prediction of AMR for microbiome data obtained in space.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Many ARGs that present high probability but low sequence identity to known sequences will be missed using traditional ‘best-hit’ approaches that require a high degree of sequence identity. To solve this, computational methods have been developed to identify AMR in genomes and metagenomes [3, 9, 16, 33, 41]. Despite these developments, a consensus approach to detect AMR in metagenomics datasets is yet to be defined [41]. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with cultivated strains and metagenomes generated from the ISS environmental surfaces using an accurate deep learning approach (Fig. 1). Firstly, we re-analyzed shotgun metagenome sequences of 21 environmental samples that were treated with PMA (viable microbes), and their associated 24 MAGs retrieved from the PMA-treated samples. The re-analysis showed increased read counts associated with AMR and in more locations for flight 3 when considering MAGs (Fig. 2). This could be explained due to the ISS crew being replaced during Flight 3. The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in Flight 3 was discussed in Singh et al. [43]. We have not observed any differences between early vs. late ISS microbiome cultures. For example, Enterobacter bugandansis strains were isolated from F2 and F3 sample sets, but the genome comparison and phenotype analyses revealed limited change, with a maximum of 15 SNPs among ISS isolates [44]. In addition, K. piersonii spread across four different locations (L1, L5, L7, L8) at Flight 3, presenting resistance to specific antibiotics (glyco/peptide, fluoroquinolone and MLS) (Fig. 3c). We have previously isolated strains from Locations 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7, defining a novel bacterial genus from the ISS samples [45]. While K. piersonii do have virulence genes in the genome, a dichotomy was found as disc diffusion tests revealed multi-drug resistance, while the PathogenFinder algorithm predicted K. piersonii strains as non-human pathogens. All seven K. piersonii isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (beta_lactam class in DeepARG), erythromycin (MLS), oxacillin (beta_lactam), penicillin (beta_lactam), and rifampin. At the same time, all strains were susceptible to cefazolin, ciprofloxacin (quinolone), and tobramycin (aminoglycoside) [45]. The DeepARG database does not include some of these antibiotics, but we found AMR sequences related to resistance to (glyco)peptide, fluoroquinolone, and MLS, validating some previous results. Therefore, PathogenFinder [17] results in Singh et al. [45] suggesting K. piersonii as a non-human pathogen should be treated with caution. Furthermore, the strain YU22 (closest match is IIIF1SW-P2T detected as ISS) isolated in urine microbiome of a kidney stone patient has shown to be an uropathogenic bacteria, showing many virulence factors that are needed for host cell invasion and colonization [40]. Secondly, the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 226 pure strains (cultivable microbes) were analyzed to identify AMR genes (Fig. 4a). We found the human pathogens E. bugandensis and B. cereus presenting many potential ARGs in the MT-1 scaffolds. Up to five strains isolated from the ISS have been closely related to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077) and share similar AMR patterns [44]. One hundred twelve genes were found to be involved in virulence, disease, and defence in the ISS strains [44]. Our re-analysis confirms the multi-drug resistance (MDR) to antibiotics for the ISS isolates, which is the highest among all the isolates. Our previous research uncovered the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump [44], belonging to RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division) protein family, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [20]. MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to substances like host defense molecule and bile, which can lead to pathogenicity in humans [48]. Unlike in Singh et al. [43], we found fluoroquinolone resistance low, and null for fosfomycin. Conversely, B. cereus is a gram-positive bacterium commonly found in food. After infection, most emetic patients recover within 24 hours, but in some cases, the toxin can be fatal via a fulminant hepatic failure [22, 34]. Overall, multi-drug resistance was found widespread in many microbes. Third, phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing data obtained from traditional antibiotic tests generated for biosafety level 2 strains were compared with the computational approaches that predicted the presence of the AMR genes, showing an excellent agreement for the antibiotics tested (Fig. 4b, c). A disadvantage of the deep learning model developed by Arango-Argoty et al. [3] is that the prediction can disentangle the family of antibiotics but not specific compounds. Many studies have shown the association between several microorganisms (bacterial, as well as phage and non-phase viral sequences) and several cancer features. Although it is unclear whether this corresponds to correlation or causation, the microbiome can undoubtedly be used as a cancer biomarker. For instance, certain strains of Fusobacterium sp. can be utilized as an independent diagnostic assay for colon cancer [62]. Therefore, a better understanding of the microbial communities and their degree of pathogenicity in surface-human microbiomes in space could also be useful for human health monitorization with detection and prognostic values in long term space travel. Rather than the gather-and-return sampling model currently used for the ISS, new developments in sequencing technologies in combination with Artificial Intelligence will allow for efficient analysis onboard the ISS and in long-duration space missions. We are currently collecting more data for Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) and MT-3 missions. We plan to extend the AMR catalog, characterize microbial diversity, and monitor the evolution of AMR in longer time periods to discover new factors involved in pathogenicity of microorganisms exposed to space conditions.",

Copyright notice ID: 9400218 PMID: 35999570 Abstract Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for long-distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes).Results We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics.Conclusion Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

Accordingly, with NASA setting the course to return to the Moon with the Artemis mission and eventually venture out to Mars, maintaining the health of astronauts during long-term spaceflight is of paramount importance [1]. One area of particular concern is the reported increase in virulence and antibiotic resistance of microorganisms in space experiments [4, 30, 36, 49, 51, 56, 61]. Combined with a depressed or altered immune response in astronauts [25, 46], there is an increased risk of opportunistic microbial infection. Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation [32], and bacteria cultured from astronauts during flight were more resistant than isolates obtained from the same individual either pre- or post-flight [50]. Mutations also occurred more frequently in long-term spaceflights [24]. An alternative non-mutually exclusive hypothesis to increased virulence or microbial resistance to antibiotics is that spaceflight conditions might alter the stability of pharmaceuticals [23]. In any case, bacterial infections might be more challenging to treat in space. The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed-built environment with its own environmental microbiome shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human presence [53]. We and others have shown that microbiomes are dynamic, diverse and sometimes intertwined at the ISS. Be et al. [8] analyzed antibiotic resistance and virulence genes from dust and vacuum filter samples of ISS (treated with propidium monoazide, or PMA), demonstrating that human skin-associated microbes impact the ISS microbiome. Indeed, the skin and intestinal microbiomes of astronauts that spent 6 to 12 months in the ISS have been shown to be altered [55]. In addition, the salivary microbiome of astronauts changed as a result of spaceflight, potentially activating microbes that promote viral replication [52] and altering the abundance of some antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [35]. The ISS itself also presents specific core microbiome signatures on its surfaces that we characterized recently using shotgun metagenome and amplicon sequencing [14, 43, 51], analogous to microbiome signatures found in specific geographies on Earth [18]. Further analyses across several missions have revealed that the microbiome of the crew's skin resembled those of the surfaces inside the ISS collected by the crewmember on the same flight [5]. To better understand the composition of these bacterial populations we and others have characterized shotgun whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of several ISS microorganisms [10, 11, 45]. Although most of them have been found to be non-pathogenic to humans, there are exceptions such as antibiotic-resistant Enterobacter bugandensis strains that could have an increased chance of pathogenicity [44]. Computational analyses of microbiome data collected in Earth have shown that AMR can be predicted from genomic sequence of pure cultures alone [29, 47], but a consensus approach on the best way to detect AMRs in metagenomic datasets has yet to be established [41]. Generally, predictions are restricted to high identity (high sequence similarity to databases) cut-offs, requiring a ‘best-hit’ on an appropriate AMR database with a sequence identity greater than 80% by many programs such as ResFinder [60]. Although the ‘best-hit’ approach has a low false-positive rate, the false-negative rate can be very high, and a large number of actual Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) are predicted as non-ARGs, thus concealing the identification of potentially functional ARGs [3]. Another method of identification is to link the immune repertoire of the astronaut to the peptides of the microbes on the ISS, but this requires complex coordination with crew sampling and is rare [19]. However, it has been shown recently that deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, can expand the catalog of AMR genes and increase the accuracy of the predictions based on metagenomic data [3, 13, 27]. We then hypothesized that the characterization of AMR from sequencing data at the ISS could be investigated from an artificial intelligence perspective using a robust deep learning framework. For that, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 226 pure strains (cultivable microbes), metagenome sequences of 21 environmental samples, and 24 MAGs retrieved from PMA treated samples (Fig. 1) using the supervised deep learning approach proposed by Arango-Argoty et al. [3], which has shown high sensitivity for detection of AMR genes in an independent benchmark [57]. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Overview of sample collection and data analysis for the characterization of antibiotic resistance at the ISS using deep learning. The data are processed in a step-wise fashion including data QC, mapping, quantification, and matching to time of collection and mission. The figure has been generated using BioRender (http://biorender.com)Results Predictions based on short metagenomics sequences and ORFs partly overlap with previous analyses and reveal new AMR determinants at the ISS surface microbiome The first shotgun metagenome sequencing of intact microbial cells (Propidium monoazide-PMA treated) without whole-genome amplification was performed by Singh et al. [43]. There, samples were taken in 8 locations across three flights (F1, F2, F3) during a period of 12 months. A detailed description of sampling procedures and locations, species diversity and functional characterization can be found in Singh et al. [43]. To deploy a deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data, we used DeepARG, a computational resource proven to be more accurate than traditional approaches [3]. We first run DeepARG-SS (DeepARG for short reads) using the recommended prediction probability cut-off of 0.8 to obtain read counts of AMR genes (Fig. 2a). As in the seminal paper [43], quantification of antibiotics associated with AMR revealed ‘beta lactams’ ranking first and ‘peptide’ second, and generally more AMR reads counts observed in Flight 3 (F3) than in previous two flights (Fig. 2a). However, reads counts in certain antibiotics such as pleuromutilin, mupirocin and rifamycin were found largely in Flight 2 (Fig. 2a). Our read counts correlate (r = 0.86, p = 6.879e−7; Pearson’s product-moment correlation) with read counts obtained for antimicrobial resistance by Singh et al. [43] (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these suggest a partial overlap with results obtained in Singh et al. [43] analyzed using the traditional approach. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Prediction of ARGs using a pre-trained DeepARG-SS model. a Distribution of ARG read counts across antibiotic classes for the three flights (F1, F2, F3). b Correlation of read counts found by DeepARG-SS and those in Singh et al. [43]. Pearson's product-moment correlation r = 0.86, (p = 6.879e−07) for the three flights and their locations. c Read counts of ARG class across flights for each location for PMA-treated samples in Singh et al. [43, 44]. The antibiotic class (multi-drug) is not shown. Results are for ARGs with probability > 0.8While more AMR reads counts were found in Flight 3, we also observed variability between the different locations and flights, and an increasing number of read counts associated with time. For instance, location 4 (L4, surface of the dining table) increased the number of AMR reads counts with successive flights (Fig. 2b, c). While resistance to ‘beta lactams’ was evenly distributed across flights and locations, resistance to ‘polymyxin’ and especially ‘peptide’ represents a more significant proportion of AMR counts in locations of Flight 3 (Fig. 2c). In addition, we also observed the widespread presence of reads related to Macrolides, Lincosamides, Streptogamines (MLS), and tetracycline resistance. To investigate the possible association between AMR patterns and specific microbes, we assembled the short reads into Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs; see Methods), identified their Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and repeated the prediction of ARGs using DeepARG-LS [3]. Figure 3a shows the distribution of DeepARG classification probabilities and best-hit identity of ARGs in MAGs from the ISS. As we can retrieve highly probable ARGs (probability > 0.8) presenting low sequence identity (for many ARGs, identity is < 40%), this method is likely more advantageous than using the ‘best-hit’ approach only. Compared to DeepARG-SS results obtained previously, the analysis of MAGs did not reveal significant differences in the number of ARGs predicted in the ORFs for the different flights (Fig. 3b). However, interestingly the results show a smaller number bacterial species having ARGs in Flight #1 (F1) when compared to Flights #2 and #3 (Fig. 3b, c) (data is shown for MAGs with at least 1 predicted ARG; the total number of MAGs analyzed is 24). Specifically, the number of locations is smaller in Flight 1 (n = 3) than in F2 (n = 6) and F3 (n = 7) (Fig. 3b). Many ARGs were identified in Kalamiella piersonii MAGs in multiple locations during F3, showing AMR patterns related to (glyco)peptide, fluoroquinolone and MLS (Fig. 3c). Of note, the K. piersonii strain closely related to one found at the ISS has been associated to human urinary tract infection [40]. The potentially very pathogenic microbe E. bugandensis was found in location 2 (forward side panel wall of the Waste and Hygiene Compartment) in Flight 1, presenting more than 40 ARGs. In addition, in the original study, Pantoea species were found to be the dominant genus in samples in 5 out of 7 locations sampled from Flight 3, especially at location 5 (surface rack). In our re-analysis, we observed Pantoea brenneri and Pantoea dispersa having ARGs related to beta-lactams and peptide [43], as well as to triclosan and polymyxin resistance. Fig. 3.

Most common antibiotic class (multi-drug) not shown. The black arrows indicate Kalamiella piersoniiOverall, our results partially agree with earlier findings while providing new insights into previously unobserved antibiotic resistance classes (of the 30 antibiotic resistance categories included in the model). Specifically, the re-analysis of short sequences and MAGs from the ISS reveals dominance of K. piersonii antibiotic resistance in different locations of Flight 3 (Fig. 3c).Distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in scaffolds of Microbial Tracking-1 strains isolated from the ISS We then applied DeepARG-LS to 226 Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) isolates (Mason and Venkateswaran labs, published and unpublished WGS of MT-1 pure strains isolated from ISS environment). We found a range of 2 to 92 ARGs in 184 out of 226 isolates (Fig. 4a; Table S1). This machine learning approach allowed us to go beyond the traditional cut-off based only on high sequence DNA similarity (Figure S1). These results suggest a widespread presence of potential ARGs in the isolates, with ‘multi-drug’ class being first, followed by glycopeptides, beta-lactams, bacitracin, and tetracyclines. The ‘multi-drug’ antibiotic class was defined by aggregating several antibiotic names from the CARD and ARDB databases (efflux, multi-drug and na_antimicrobials). We then used BLAST to match isolates showing AMR sequences predicted by DeepARG to microbial species (Fig. 4a) and identified Bacillus cereus and E. bugandensis, which were previously profiled organisms on the ISS [44, 54] as the top 2 ranking species with a high number of ARGs. We have previously shown that five E. bugandensis isolates were almost equivalent to nosocomial earth isolates showing resistance to multi-drug antibiotic compounds, fluoroquinolones, and fosfomycin [44]. In addition, E. bugandensis strains were shown to be resistant to 9 antibiotics [51]. Our results reinforce the potential pathogenicity of this microbe. Nonetheless, antimicrobial resistance was not examined for B. cereus strains in Venkateswaran et al. [54]. B. cereus is a food poisoning microorganism that might be a concern for crew members' health. In addition, we found novel ARGs associated with other species such as K. pneumoniae, Pantoea, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus velezensis, Enterococcus faecalis, Sphingomonas, and, with a lower number of ARGs, several species of Staphylococcus. E. faecalis virulence was previously shown to be affected by microgravity [28]. We then used the tool Prokka [42] to fully annotate the bacterial isolates, finding as expected that the number of coding sequences, but not the number of ARGs, increased in proportion to genome sizes (Figure S2a). Then, we ran the pan-genome analysis tool Roary [38] to compare isolates of E. bugandensis (10) and B. cereus (10) finding that the core set of genes was highly conserved among strains of the same species (Figure S2b). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Heatmap and clustering of ARG counts detected in MT-1 pure strains isolated from the ISS and AST validations. a Heatmap with ARG count. The barplots illustrate the number of ARGs across rows and across columns. Species were identified using BLAST. Only ARGs with probability > 0.8 were considered, as recommended. b Antibacterial susceptibility tests (AST) on E. bugandensis and B cereus strains for several antibiotics (top), and comparison with machine learning predictions shown in (a) (bottom). c Scatterplot of zone of inhibition value (in mm.) and ARG count shown in (b), together with a linear model fit. Pearson's product-moment correlation values are indicatedTo experimentally validate machine learning predictions on previously unobserved AMR patterns above, we performed Antibacterial Susceptibility Tests (AST) for the species found to be potentially most pathogenic, in our case E. bugandensis and B. cereus as they have a higher number of ARGs (Table S1; Fig. 4a). For that, we use disc diffusion on strains isolated at the ISS for the following antimicrobials: Cefazolin (beta−lactam), Cefoxitin (beta−lactam), Ciprofloxacin (quinolone), Erythromycin (MLS), Gentamycin (aminoglycoside), Oxacillin (beta−lactam), Penicillin (beta−lactam), Rifampin (rifamycin), and Tobramycin (aminoglycoside) (Fig. 4b). The prediction patterns closely matched the AST results (Fig. 4b), although DeepARG failed to detect Rifampin resistance, especially for E. bugandensis. Although different antibiotics have different inhibitory zone cut-offs for a strain to be considered as resistant (Table S2), remarkably we found an inverse correlation between the zone of inhibition and ARG count for B. cereus (r = − 0.637, Pearson's product-moment correlation, p = 2.2e−7) and E. bugandensis (r = − 0.517; p = 0.0002765) (Fig. 4c), demonstrating the applicability and high accuracy of computational prediction of AMR for microbiome data obtained in space.Discussion Many ARGs that present high probability but low sequence identity to known sequences will be missed using traditional ‘best-hit’ approaches that require a high degree of sequence identity. To solve this, computational methods have been developed to identify AMR in genomes and metagenomes [3, 9, 16, 33, 41]. Despite these developments, a consensus approach to detect AMR in metagenomics datasets is yet to be defined [41]. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with cultivated strains and metagenomes generated from the ISS environmental surfaces using an accurate deep learning approach (Fig. 1). Firstly, we re-analyzed shotgun metagenome sequences of 21 environmental samples that were treated with PMA (viable microbes), and their associated 24 MAGs retrieved from the PMA-treated samples. The re-analysis showed increased read counts associated with AMR and in more locations for flight 3 when considering MAGs (Fig. 2). This could be explained due to the ISS crew being replaced during Flight 3. The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in Flight 3 was discussed in Singh et al. [43]. We have not observed any differences between early vs. late ISS microbiome cultures. For example, Enterobacter bugandansis strains were isolated from F2 and F3 sample sets, but the genome comparison and phenotype analyses revealed limited change, with a maximum of 15 SNPs among ISS isolates [44]. In addition, K. piersonii spread across four different locations (L1, L5, L7, L8) at Flight 3, presenting resistance to specific antibiotics (glyco/peptide, fluoroquinolone and MLS) (Fig. 3c). We have previously isolated strains from Locations 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7, defining a novel bacterial genus from the ISS samples [45]. While K. piersonii do have virulence genes in the genome, a dichotomy was found as disc diffusion tests revealed multi-drug resistance, while the PathogenFinder algorithm predicted K. piersonii strains as non-human pathogens. All seven K. piersonii isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (beta_lactam class in DeepARG), erythromycin (MLS), oxacillin (beta_lactam), penicillin (beta_lactam), and rifampin. At the same time, all strains were susceptible to cefazolin, ciprofloxacin (quinolone), and tobramycin (aminoglycoside) [45]. The DeepARG database does not include some of these antibiotics, but we found AMR sequences related to resistance to (glyco)peptide, fluoroquinolone, and MLS, validating some previous results. Therefore, PathogenFinder [17] results in Singh et al. [45] suggesting K. piersonii as a non-human pathogen should be treated with caution. Furthermore, the strain YU22 (closest match is IIIF1SW-P2T detected as ISS) isolated in urine microbiome of a kidney stone patient has shown to be an uropathogenic bacteria, showing many virulence factors that are needed for host cell invasion and colonization [40]. Secondly, the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 226 pure strains (cultivable microbes) were analyzed to identify AMR genes (Fig. 4a). We found the human pathogens E. bugandensis and B. cereus presenting many potential ARGs in the MT-1 scaffolds. Up to five strains isolated from the ISS have been closely related to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077) and share similar AMR patterns [44]. One hundred twelve genes were found to be involved in virulence, disease, and defence in the ISS strains [44]. Our re-analysis confirms the multi-drug resistance (MDR) to antibiotics for the ISS isolates, which is the highest among all the isolates. Our previous research uncovered the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump [44], belonging to RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division) protein family, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [20]. MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to substances like host defense molecule and bile, which can lead to pathogenicity in humans [48]. Unlike in Singh et al. [43], we found fluoroquinolone resistance low, and null for fosfomycin. Conversely, B. cereus is a gram-positive bacterium commonly found in food. After infection, most emetic patients recover within 24 hours, but in some cases, the toxin can be fatal via a fulminant hepatic failure [22, 34]. Overall, multi-drug resistance was found widespread in many microbes. Third, phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing data obtained from traditional antibiotic tests generated for biosafety level 2 strains were compared with the computational approaches that predicted the presence of the AMR genes, showing an excellent agreement for the antibiotics tested (Fig. 4b, c). A disadvantage of the deep learning model developed by Arango-Argoty et al. [3] is that the prediction can disentangle the family of antibiotics but not specific compounds. Many studies have shown the association between several microorganisms (bacterial, as well as phage and non-phase viral sequences) and several cancer features. Although it is unclear whether this corresponds to correlation or causation, the microbiome can undoubtedly be used as a cancer biomarker. For instance, certain strains of Fusobacterium sp. can be utilized as an independent diagnostic assay for colon cancer [62]. Therefore, a better understanding of the microbial communities and their degree of pathogenicity in surface-human microbiomes in space could also be useful for human health monitorization with detection and prognostic values in long term space travel. Rather than the gather-and-return sampling model currently used for the ISS, new developments in sequencing technologies in combination with Artificial Intelligence will allow for efficient analysis onboard the ISS and in long-duration space missions. We are currently collecting more data for Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) and MT-3 missions. We plan to extend the AMR catalog, characterize microbial diversity, and monitor the evolution of AMR in longer time periods to discover new factors involved in pathogenicity of microorganisms exposed to space conditions.Methods Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) methodology The paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads from  Short Read Archive (SRA) under the bio-project number PRJNA438545 were processed with Trimmomatic [12] to trim adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with a minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of the read used as a quality cut-off. Reads shorter than 80 bp were removed after trimming. Remaining high-quality reads were subsequently assembled using metaSPAdes [37]. Contigs were binned using Metabat2 v2.11.3 [31]. Recovered genomes were evaluated with CheckM [39], and a recovered genome was considered good with at least 90% completeness and at most 10% contamination. Each genome was subsequently annotated with the help of Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST), and near identifications were predicted [6].Sample collection for Microbial Tracking 1 mission During the microbial tracking investigation to characterize airborne and surface-associated microbial population aboard the International Space Station, samples were collected from ISS locations, and ground samples were collected from the Crew resupply vehicle. A sterile polyester wipe premoistened with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to collect the samples from various areas across these ISS locations, and the details and description of the sample collection and cultivation have already been reported in Checinska Sielaff et al. [14] and Singh et al. [43]. Pure isolates were selected and sub-cultured, and the sub-cultures were sequenced.Isolates from Microbial Tracking 1 mission To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol [44], using NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell 2150 paired-end (PE) sequencing. Verification of the quality of the raw sequencing data was carried out using FastQC v0.11.7 [2]. Quality control for adapter trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp v0.20.0 [15], and then SPAdes v3.11.1 [7] was used to assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control was based on the following three parameters: (i) correction of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences, and (iii) quality trimming at the 59 and 39 ends. To determine the quality of the assembled sequences, the number of contigs, the N50 value, and the total length were calculated using QUAST v5.0.2 [26]. Default parameters were used for all software. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) [59] was calculated using OrthoANIu by comparing each of the scaffolds to the WGS of the respective type strains.Identification of ORFs in microbial DNA sequences Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov ModelER) v3.02 was used with default parameters to identify the coding regions and distinguish them from non-coding DNA in MAGs and MT-1 scaffolds that could be used as an input in DeepARG-LS. Minimum gene length was indicated as 50 bp (‘glimmer3 -g50’). Glimmer reads DNA sequences in a FASTA file format and predicts genes in them using an Interpolated Context Model [21].Prediction of antibiotic resistance genes in short reads and full-gene length sequences DeepARG version 2 [3], a deep learning-based approach for predicting ARGs and annotation, was run with the ‘--reads’ option (DeepARG-SS) for NGS reads and the ‘--genes’ option (DeepRG-LS) for longer gene-like sequences obtained with Glimmer. The DeepARG model consists of four dense hidden layers of 2000, 1000, 500, and 100 units that propagate a bit score distribution. The output layer of the deep neural network consists of 30 units that correspond to the antibiotic resistance categories (102 antibiotics consolidated into 30 antibiotic categories). The model was trained with a curated database of 14,933 genes from three databases (CARD, ARDB, and UNIPROT) [3]. Default options were used: 50% minimum percentage of identity to consider, significance of the prediction probability cut-off of 0.8 as recommended [3], and E-value of alignments (default 1e−10). The software was downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/gusphdproj/deeparg-ss.Microbial nucleotide BLAST Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST 2.10.1+ (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was used to identify microbial species associated to MT-1 scaffolds. Sequences producing significant alignments were ranked and the species associated to maximum Score (bits) and minimum E value was deemed as the closest match.Gene annotations and pan-genome analysis of MT-1 scaffolds A Docker image with the software tool Prokka v1.14.5 [42] was pulled and used with default parameters to annotate bacterial isolates. The master annotations in GFF3 format for the 226 isolates have been deposited at the Zenodo platform [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6518836]. Using the annotated assemblies in GFF3 format for E. bugandensis and B. cereus strains, Roary v3.13.0 was run with default parameters to compare isolates based on genes and the number of isolates they are present in.Phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing Disc assays experiments were performed and reported in Urbaniak et al. [51]. The isolates were streaked from glycerol stocks onto R2A plates. A single colony was inoculated into 5 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and grown overnight at 30°C. Aliquots of 100 μL were plated on TSA. Agar diffusion discs (BD BBLTM Sensi-DiscTM, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed aseptically on a plate and the strains were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The tested antibiotics included: 30-μg cefazolin (CZ-30); 30-μg cefoxitin (FOX-30), 5 μg ciprofloxacin (CIP-5), 15 μg erythromycin (E-15), 10-μg gentamicin (GM-10), 1-μg oxacillin (OX), 10-μg penicillin (P-10), 5-μg rifampin (RA-5), and 10 μg tobramycin (NN-10). The diameter of inhibition zones was measured for each antibiotic disk and recorded in millimeters. The resistance results were compared with the zone diameter interpretive charts provided by the manufacturer. When the spontaneous mutants were present in response to some antibiotics, they were isolated, subcultured and tested for the specific antibiotic resistance.Data availability Raw metagenomics reads from three flights on multiple locations were downloaded from NASA GeneLab repository https://genelab.nasa.gov (GLDS-69). The ISS MAGs datasets are available at the SRA database under the accession number: PRJNA438545 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA438545/]. Microbial tracking-1 (MT-1) datasets (raw sequencing data and sequence assembly files) were obtained from GLDS-67, GLDS-302, GLDS-303, GLDS-309, GLDS-311 and GLDS-350. The rest of the samples are deposited at DDBJ/ ENA/GenBank or are unpublished.Supplementary Information 40168_2022_1332_MOESM1_ESM.pdf (50.1KB, pdf) Additional file 1: Figure S1.

    "conclusion": "8. Conclusions The current data reveal a scarcity of knowledge about the impact of space radiation and microgravity on gynecologic cancer, as there have been insufficient numbers of female astronauts exposed to long-duration, low-dose rate, and proton and heavy ion radiation to reliably determine the impact on the female reproductive system. With the upcoming Artemis missions set to place the first females on the Moon, there will be longer duration of exposures to both microgravity and space radiation; hence, the influence of flight length on risks related to gynecological cancers will demand a larger focus in ensuring astronaut safety during flight and postflight. Indeed, among all body tissues, the male and female gonads are among the most sensitive to radiation. Therefore, these tissues may be one of the best to study to determine space radiation related exposures.",

Introduction Human spaceflight and deep space exploration are the aspirational activities of numerous national space agencies including the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Canadian Space Agency (CSA), as well as many commercial and other private entities. Studies to determine the long-term physiological responses and adaptation to the space environment and further re-adaptation to the environmental conditions on Earth are of crucial importance to the safety and health of the astronauts [1]. Beyond the stressors of getting to space, such as vibration and acceleration forces, microgravity and radiation are the most significant hazards during space travel [2]. There are other sources of physiological and psychological stress during spaceflight, including circadian shifting, dietary alterations, confined spaces, and isolation [2]. The impact of spaceflight and the cosmic environment on those organ systems essential to carry out tasks in space (motor skills, cardiovascular system, and maintenance of overall bodily function) and which are essential upon return to Earth, have received the majority of focus as they relate to studies of astronaut health and wellbeing. A long-standing concern has also been the effects of the cosmic environment on male and female reproductive health including carcinogenesis of the primary reproductive organs secondary to cosmic radiation exposure. However, this area of research lags behind. Advances in molecular biology, genetics, oncology and radiotherapy have provided more insights in recent years [2]; however, there is a paucity of research evaluating the risks of gynecological cancers, ovarian insufficiency, or infertility following spaceflight. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of what is known so far from studies conducted on Earth, together with the research questions and challenges requiring further study to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of female astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.2. Space-Environmental Factors: Microgravity and Space Radiation Space travel, the final frontier, presents a challenge that few have faced before. Since the first flight to space in 1961, five key threats to long-duration space travel have been identified: distance from Earth, isolation and confinement, hostile/closed environments, gravity (or lack thereof), and radiation [3]. These are all areas of potentially significant concern during long-duration spaceflight. An exploration-class mission to Mars is expected to last three years, all in an enclosed environment with a small crew [4,5]. At least one of these three years would include transit time in deep space during which microgravity and radiation exposures would be elevated compared to the Martian surface. Previous literature highlights the harmful effects of such environments on several body systems, including cardiac, neurological, and immune functioning [6,7]. In addition to the elevated medical risks during exploration missions, triage and management of such conditions is complicated by limited resources, ability to evacuate, and ground communication abilities. The distance between the Earth base and Mars leads to a communication time delay of around 5–20 min one-way. This can be a particular challenge as the expertise available on Earth is no longer able to provide real-time assistance (as is the case for astronauts on the International Space Station). 2.1. Microgravity Microgravity (or reduced gravity) leads to complex biological and systemic-level changes. Given that life has evolved and adapted to the presence of near-constant gravity on Earth, these changes can have consequences [3]. When exposed to altered gravity, these changes can be classified into short- or long-term effects. Over a few minutes of spaceflight, astronauts may experience space motion sickness [8]. Over a longer period, there can be remodeling of the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems [9]. The effects of microgravity on human physiology have been extensively investigated with the main goal of developing adequate countermeasures to minimize risks associated with long-duration spaceflight. These microgravity effects have been shown to be significant, global, and amplified with mission duration and distance from Earth. In particular, those associated with cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, and immune systems are easily diagnosed and clinically observable upon return from space. Microgravity may synergistically combine with other factors such as radiation, additionally compromising the health and safety of the astronauts. However, though much is known about how microgravity can affect these bodily systems, research into sex/gender-related differences in the response and adaption to spaceflight as well as how microgravity can affect the female reproductive system is limited [10].2.2. Space Radiation Radiation (as waves or particles) is energy that can be classified as non-ionizing (e.g., radiowaves, microwaves, infrared) or ionizing (e.g., X- or gamma rays, protons, neutrons, heavy ions). However, ionizing radiation is the most biologically active. While popular culture imagines radiation stemming from nuclear meltdowns and atomic bombs like Chernobyl or Hiroshima, in medical practice, ionizing radiation plays critical roles in both imaging and cancer radiotherapies. In imaging, X-rays and computed tomography provide critical information allowing clinicians to tailor further interventions. In contrast, when used in radiotherapies, ionizing radiation can be used to target a tumor with a minimal impact on surrounding tissue [11]. The total radiation dose is often delivered as a series of fractionated doses over the span of 4–6 weeks. Even though the exact treatment protocol varies depending upon the type and stage of the tumor itself, typical total doses used for the treatment of gynecological cancers range from around 40–60 Gray (Gy) [12]. Ionizing radiation can impact the cells directly, where the particles impact a vital target molecule and directly transfer their energy, or indirectly, where particles impact other molecules, such as water, leading to longer lasting, very reactive free radicals. When impacting DNA, ionizing radiation can cause single-strand or double-strand DNA breaks. Double-strand DNA breaks, especially those caused by close single hits or high-energy hits, are much harder to repair. Non-rejoined breaks can lead to cell death, while incorrectly rejoined breaks can lead to mutation. Space radiation has a complex impact on human tissues and is an etiological agent for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system impairment, radiation sickness, and other harmful conditions [3,13]. The Earth’s magnetic field is a crucial protective element. Given the nature of ionizing space radiation, an increased rate of carcinogenesis is a primary concern for long-duration spaceflight [14]. While no increase in gynecologic cancer risk has yet been revealed in the female astronaut population [15,16], as exploration missions will be outside of low Earth orbit and for increasingly long durations, concern remains regarding the effects of even a low-dose rate accumulating over time [17]. The three main sources of ionizing space radiation are galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and the Van Allen radiation belt [18]. These exposures are exceedingly different from terrestrial sources of radiation with respect to the type, energy transfer, dose rate, and total dose. Ionizing GCR is composed of 98% nuclei and 2% electrons and positrons and constitutes a significant part of the total radiation dose [19]. The nuclear component itself is composed of hydrogen (87%; i.e., protons), helium (12%), and heavy metal nuclei (1%; including lithium, carbon, oxygen, silicon, iron, etc.) [20]. These energetically charged particles are accelerated to relativistic speeds by intra-galactic supernovae [21]. During this process, the protons and heavy-metal ions are stripped of their orbital electrons. Thus, the role of personal and spacecraft shielding will be particularly important. Electrons and positrons do not pose a major biological hazard as spacecraft shielding is sufficient to stop these particles. However, the high-energy particles (HZEs, protons, and heavy ions) are energetic enough to penetrate the shielding materials used in spacecrafts [22]. Just as these particles penetrate spacecraft shields, they also penetrate the body, raising concerns regarding the long-term health effects of GCR exposure [23]. Linear Energy Transfer (LET) is the amount of energy a particle delivers along this penetrating path to the material it travels through [24]. The value of LET determines how the particles interact with cells. The LET value is also directly proportional to how deep the particle will be able to travel. Thus, high LET radiation particles reach deeper tissues than low LET radiation particles. For example, HZEs and protons generally have high LET values as they have high energy [13,25,26]. Therefore, they are highly penetrating. This makes them very damaging to biological tissue [27,28]. It is this high-density penetrating nature that allows for these particles to induce complex double-strand breaks [13,25]. Given these differences, the International Commission on Radiological Protection created weighting factors to relate different types of radiation to cancer mortality risks (Table 1) [29]. While these weighting factors may be problematic for understanding radiation exposures in space, a conservative assumption is that a given dose of heavy ion irradiation, for example, may be at least 20 times as harmful as a given dose of x- or gamma irradiation terrestrially. Table 1. Types of radiation and the radiation weighting factor. Type of Radiation Radiation Weighting Factor (WR) X-rays/Gamma rays 1 Electrons 1 Protons 2–5 Neutrons 5–20 Heavy ions 20 Open in a new tabImportantly, not only do these particles penetrate spacecraft shielding and bodily tissues, but they also interact with them, leading to the generation of secondary neutron radiation and reactive oxygen species, which can be just as, if not more, biologically harmful than the primary GCR particles. All of these details lead to a complex radiation environment onboard mission spacecraft, adding to the challenge of protecting astronauts from the ionizing effects of space radiation [23,30]. Of additional concern within the interplanetary radiation environment beyond the constant exposure to GCR is the relationship between solar cycles, solar wind, and solar particle events to the overall exposure [31]. Solar particle events (SPEs) occur when particles emitted from the sun are accelerated, either close to the sun or in interplanetary space. These particles consist of mainly 95% protons, electrons, HZE ions, and alpha particles [32]. However, unlike GCR, SPE radiation is of high flux and low energy. Thus, spacecraft shielding is much more effective at blocking SPE radiation and most residual SPE radiation can be absorbed by superficial tissues. Skin doses of SPE are 5–10× higher than that of internal organs and are therefore more likely to cause skin lesions and hematological and immunological disturbances [19,23]. While SPEs can range in size, they rarely result in high total dose exposures. Furthermore, the exposure is different between the low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond-LEO environment during interplanetary travel, which will also be different from that on the Mars surface. Defined as 80–2000 km above Earth’s surface (and below the Van Allen Belts), the radiation environment in LEO is starkly different to that beyond LEO. The LEO is naturally shielded by Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field. Although there can be increases in solar radiation during rare large solar particle events and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we are largely protected from the majority of GCR [28]. In comparison to the ~1 mGy/year at sea level, estimates of around 0.3–1 mGy/day have been suggested to occur in deep space [30,33]. The projected dose received during a Mars mission (6 months of travel each way and 2 years of surface stay) could therefore result in a total cumulative dose equivalent close to 1000 mGy [17]. More recently, with radiation dosimeter readings during the cruise phase of the Mars Curiosity mission, we can expect trans Earth–Mars exposures up to 1.8 mGy/day [34]. Still, these can be subject to change based on local conditions and extreme events such as solar flares. All of these unique features of space radiation make it very difficult to extrapolate conclusions from terrestrial radiation research for hypothesizing risk profiles in the space environment. The majority of data are derived from human studies in which inadvertent exposures to high total dose or high-dose rate, short-duration exposures to gamma irradiation that have occurred after nuclear events, or exposures in patients being treated for existing cancer with high-dose rate external beam radiation or internal gamma radiation (brachytherapy) or in non-human mammalian studies have been analyzed. However, the vast majority of animal studies use X-ray and gamma irradiation, which are equivalent to GCR exposures. Moreover, X-ray and gamma irradiation exposures predicted to be seen in spaceflight are not of clinical significance. Studies completed at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where researchers can simulate GCR by using a mix-beam of protons and heavy ions, provides a mechanism to study exposures in model mammalian systems. However, these studies are also limited to using a small number of high fractionated doses to achieve a desired total dose for exploration missions, because it would not be feasible to run daily low-dose rate exposures for long durations in order to replicate a 3-year Mars mission. In summary, to try and predict the risk of gynecologic cancer during or following spaceflight, we must understand that with the exception of true long-duration human spaceflight studies, our current knowledge is severely limited by the characteristics of the study. These characteristics include radiation type, energy transfer, dose rate/duration of exposure, total dose, animal model, presence of atmosphere, presence of magnetosphere, personal shielding, craft/dwelling shielding, and use of antioxidants or other countermeasures.3. Effect of Spaceflight on Female Reproduction There is a paucity of evidence highlighting the effects of microgravity, space radiation, and spaceflight on the male and female reproductive systems, with significantly less for the female system based on the lack of women being exposed to GCR in the Apollo missions and past inequities. Most of our current knowledge on the female reproductive system stems from animal studies and are summarized in Figure 1. Notably, the past decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of women living and working in space. NASA astronaut candidate class ratios of men to women have achieved parity since 2013, making it likely that the future of long-duration spaceflight may also feature equal numbers of men and women [16], thus warranting further study into how the cosmic environment affects reproductive health. Figure 1. Open in a new tab A summary of the effects of microgravity, space radiation, and space flight on the female reproductive system.3.1. Microgravity Microgravity exposure poses multiple female reproductive health concerns. These include effects of weightlessness on gonadal function and fertility as well secondary spaceflight stressors, such as sleep disruption, that may degrade female reproductive health during and after spaceflight. However, the scientific literature on reproductive changes in female astronauts during and after spaceflight or exposure to simulated microgravity (bedrest) remains sparse [10,16,35]. While female astronauts have successfully conceived and born children after spaceflight, detailed information on post-spaceflight fertility, pregnancy complications, and birth outcomes in women is not available. Further, female astronauts tend to delay pregnancy, making it difficult to separate the effects of spaceflight stressors from maternal aging on fertility and pregnancy outcomes. However, some animal studies attempting to understand reproductive outcomes in spaceflight have occurred, the first was in 1979 aboard an 18.5-day COSMOS 1129 mission, where a barrier between the two male and five female rats was removed on day two of orbit to allow for mating. Upon return to Earth, no pregnancies were observed. However, no pregnancies were observed in the control group of rats maintained on Earth either. It is not clear whether the absence of pregnancy was due to an inability to copulate in the weightless space environment, or to secondary more complex endocrine and/or embryonic developmental causes, or even attributable to housing/caging concerns [35,36]. Studies of female mice that were maintained on the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days prior to euthanasia in space (eliminating re-entry stressors) revealed evidence that these female mice could be detected at different stages of the estrous cycle post-mortem, suggesting that some females were likely exhibiting estrous cyclicity [37]. Mouse embryos flown on China’s SJ-10 biosatellite completed a series of cell divisions leading to blastocoel morphology during spaceflight, but both the rate of blastocyst formation and blastocyst quality were impaired [38]. Severe DNA damage was observed in the embryonic cells, and the genome of the blastocysts developed in space was globally hypomethylated with a unique set of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The authors suggest that these changes are similar to developmental defects, DNA damage, and epigenetic abnormalities that occur with exposure to ground-based low-dose radiation. However, given the dramatic differences already noted between cosmic radiation and that of gamma irradiation that they used in their experiments, as well as to the inability to separate out the effects of microgravity from the impact of space radiation in these studies, much remains to be determined. While a large effort in understanding fertility outcomes is still needed, a few studies have been performed evaluating mammalian pregnancy and embryonic/prenatal development in space [39]. In 1982, COSMOS 1514 examined the effect of a 4.5-day flight exposure on gestational days 13–18 of a 21-day rat pregnancy. Dams were euthanized immediately upon landing and the fetuses exhibited neurobiological aberrations and impaired bone development. Four of five dams successfully delivered their litters postflight. Additional findings included poor maternal weight gain and evidence of fetal growth restriction in comparison to controls, possibly related to the potato diet used to provision both water and food, but no change in litter dynamics. Male and female offspring from these litters that developed to adulthood were fertile and reproduced successfully. In 1994 and 1996, two jointly sponsored NASA-National Institutes of Health missions (.R1) (STS-66) and .R2 (STS-70) launched pregnant (gestational day 9 and 11, respectively) dams that were returned to Earth on gestational day 20 prior to parturition. Space-flown pregnant rats gave birth at the expected time; however, they exhibited twice as many ‘lordosis’ contractions during labor coupled with decreased uterine myometrial connexin 43 (gap junction) protein expression relative to controls, suggesting changes to the uterine smooth musculature tone with exposure to microgravity. However, the duration of labor, maternal weight gain, miscarriage/stillbirth rate, litter size, neonatal birthweight, placentophagia, and maternal care patterns were not significantly different from ground controls [40,41]. Importantly, .R1 and R2 offspring were flown for the second half of the rats’ gestational period, after organogenesis was complete, and returned to Earth for parturition. There have been no additional studies of mammalian pregnancy during spaceflight, and no mammal has yet given birth in space. Few studies have investigated rodent pregnancy utilizing terrestrial analogs for microgravity although past studies have exposed reproducing adult rodents to hypergravity produced via chronic acceleration [42,43,44]. This work provides strong evidence that, for some reproductive parameters such as pregnancy outcome and mammary gland metabolism, gravity load elicits a response continuum, and a single study compared responses to spaceflight and hypergravity. Analysis of mammary glands from G20 dams revealed a strong negative correlation between metabolic rate and gravity loads spanning 0, 1.5, 1.75, and 2 g. Approximately 98% of the variation in glucose oxidation and 94% of the variation in glucose incorporation into lipids was accounted for by differences in gravity ‘dose’. These data demonstrate a remarkable continuum of response across the microgravity and hypergravity environments for this reproductive parameter. As reproductive factors such as age at first pregnancy, parity, and breastfeeding are all inversely linked with gynecologic and breast cancers terrestrially [45,46,47], more studies will be needed to explore any link between reproductive fitness after spaceflight and future risks of cancer occurring in these same organs.3.2. Hormonal Modalities in Spaceflight A unique operational consideration for premenopausal female astronauts is the use of hormonal contraception to suppress ovarian function, prevent pregnancy, and reduce menstrual flow or induce amenorrhea during pre-flight training and spaceflight. With the pathway that astronauts follow to reach candidate selection and the mission training phase, female astronaut candidates often opt to use hormonal contraception through the phases of candidate selection and training, while awaiting mission selection, during mission-specific training, and during the mission itself, potentially amounting to 11 or more years of reproductive suppression [48]. The combined oral contraceptive pill and levonorgestrel intrauterine device are the most commonly used hormonal contraceptive options. However, it is difficult to predict how hormonal contraception use in combination with the complex deep space environmental exposure will affect female astronaut health as it relates to the intertwined nature of reproductive function on multiple organ systems. It is unknown how the environment of deep space, especially for long durations, will impact the shelf-life, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the contraceptive agents as well as contraceptive efficacy, menses/abnormal uterine bleeding, ovarian cysts/torsion, venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular health, musculoskeletal health during exploration-class missions, or indeed gynecological cancers.3.3. Space Radiation The likelihood of a significant acute exposure that would lead to acute radiation syndrome while a crew is in LEO is very low. However, the likelihood of an acute high-dose radiation exposure is higher for a crew traveling in interplanetary space in a minimally shielded spacecraft. As previously mentioned, SPEs of sufficient intensity to breach clinical thresholds during a trip to Mars have been recorded in the recent past. Tissue sensitivity depends on the cellular, extracellular, and stroma composition of the tissue. In general, tissues that have a large number of active stem cells are highly sensitive to radiation, whereas tissues with mainly terminally differentiated or with large amounts of supporting stroma and noncellular elements are relatively radioresistant. In females, the ovary is extremely radiosensitive. Radiation-induced cessation of hormone production can lead to temporary or permanent infertility. The vagina is similar to other mucous membranes in terms of radiosensitivity, but the vulva, labia, and clitoris are more radiosensitive. The uterus is radioresistant. Transient sterility can occur after doses as low as 1250 mGy, although most report the threshold dose for temporary sterility as being 1700 mGy [49]. The dose required for permanent sterility in women ranges from 3500–20,000 mGy (Table 2), with lower doses needed for women older than 40 years [50,51]. Radiation damage to the female gonads is cumulative because gametogenesis essentially stops at the time of birth. Table 2. Radiation effects on female reproductive function. Age Dose, mGy Effect All ages 1700 Temporary sterility lasting 1–3 years 1250–1500 Amenorrhea in 50% 3200–6250 Permanent sterility Ages 15–40 1250–2500 Temporary amenorrhea 2500–5000 Ovulary suppression in 40–100% 5000–8000 Permanent ovulary suppression in 40–100% 8000–20,000 Permanent ovulary suppression in 100% Open in a new tab4. Effect of Space Travel on Cancer Carcinogenesis is the multi-step transformation of normal cells into malignant tumors, requiring the accumulation of several genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Cancer is characterized by the continuous proliferation of tumor cells, accompanied by resistance to cell death, induction of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis [52]. DNA mutations altering protein-coding genes and signal transduction pathways are among the factors involved in cancer etiology. The protein-coding gene mutations involve tumor-suppressor genes, transmembrane proteins, platelet-derived growth factors, sex hormones, components of the insulin-like growth factor axis, transcription factors of the forkhead/winged helix-box transcription factor (Fox), and the SMAD families. Signal transduction pathways that are involved in carcinogenesis include sonic hedgehog (SHH), Wnt, and Notch [2]. There are also viruses like the human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein–Barr virus, and Hepatitis B and C, which are oncogenic [53]. Recent advances in the field of tumor biology are highlighting the role of the microenvironment and the altered stress response favoring overall survival [54]. There are multiple environmental factors, such as space radiation and microgravity, which can contribute to possibly increasing any risk of tumor development and the possible underlying cellular mechanisms associated with spaceflight [55]. In addition to the studies reviewed in Moreno-Villanueva and Wu [55], more investigations involving microgravity and radiation have been carried out, as shown in Table 3 [56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63] and Table 4 [64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73], respectively. Although ionizing radiation is a known carcinogen, irradiation with particles in space differs quantitatively and qualitatively from γ-radiation or X-rays [30]. This limits our understanding of the risk of carcinogenesis, which may be possibly associated with space radiation. The biological effects of irradiation with heavy ions leading to DNA damage and repair, genomic instability, mutagenesis, chromosome aberrations, and neoplastic transformation have been documented [74]. Mouse models have generally been used for studying radiation-induced carcinogenesis, but these do not reflect the full range of complexity of cancer in humans [75]. Indeed, one main limitation for quantifying space-associated cancer risk is that there are no human data from extended exposure to space radiation, and in fact, estimation of carcinogenic risk for humans exposed to cosmic radiation is very difficult to ascertain [76,77].

In addition, radiation effects ratio (RER) is a new metric that is being proposed, which compares the effects of two radiations at the same dose [78]. However, there are still important dilemmas regarding cancer risk at low-dose rates [79,80]. Therefore, in order to improve the estimation of carcinogenesis risk of long-duration space travel, there needs to be more mechanistic analysis and biological insight of radiation quality effects and long-duration exposure to low radiation dose rates. The relationship between multiple space–environmental factors that can influence the development of cancer should be investigated separately and also in combination. To date, there have been a limited number of studies investigating the combined effect of space radiation and microgravity on cancer development. Recent findings suggest that the antiproliferative effect of simulated microgravity may lead to novel therapeutic strategies in combating cancer. In contrast, an impaired radiation-induced DNA damage response that can promote tumor initiation has been observed under microgravity conditions in vitro [55]. In studies using devices that simulate microgravity, a microgravity-associated increased radiosensitivity has been reported. However, there are currently minimal data regarding the effect of spaceflight on the capacity of the cells to repair any artificially induced DNA damage. Moreover, experiments investigating DNA damage response in simulated microgravity are not always concordant with those conducted in real microgravity [81]. Beyond the concerns of radiation-induced DNA damage, numerous molecular studies add to the hypothesis that individualized risk could be increased in the setting of microgravity, as important signaling pathways commonly involved in carcinogenesis could also be dysregulated under microgravity conditions. One example includes the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway [82,83,84], which is a key driver of metabolism, cell survival, and proliferation in response to growth factor stimulation [85]. Sex-specific cancers (involving the breast, ovary, or uterus) together contribute heavily to overall cancer incidence and mortality in women. Breast cancer is the largest contributor to cancer incidence following terrestrial radiation and the three organs combined make up over 30% of the risk of exposure-induced cancer. Breast cancer is also the second largest contributor to cancer mortality following terrestrial radiation, and the three organs combined make up over 20% of the risk of exposure-induced death. Both ovarian and uterine cancers have 5-year survival rates of 49.1% and 66.3%, respectively. Colorectal, breast, prostate, and lung cancer cells have been studied in simulated microgravity in relation to the dysregulation of the PI3K pathway. In colorectal cancer cells exposed to simulated microgravity in a Rotational Cell Culture System-High Aspect Ratio Vessel (RCCS-HARV), Akt phosphorylation was found to decrease whilst PTEN expression and activity increased, leading to the induction of apoptosis [86]. Similarly, apoptosis rate was seen to increase in lung cancer cells exposed to simulated microgravity, as tumor-suppressor genes were upregulated when cells were cultured in a random-positioning machine (RPM), and AKT3 and PIK3CA expression remained unaltered. Interestingly, a study carried out on normal and cancerous breast cells found that the paradox between weightlessness-induced apoptosis and Akt upregulation under microgravity conditions depends on whether the cells are adhered or detached. It has been concluded that survival strategies under this type of mechanical stress vary between cell types. They do in fact observe that apoptosis occurs in the cancerous cell line growing in floating organoid-like structures after 72 h due to major cytoskeletal rearrangements happening as a result of the simulated loss of gravity using an RPM [87]. These findings are supported by the study carried out on prostate cancer cells cultured in an RPM; Hybel et al. also reported that cells adhered to the culture flask significantly upregulated genes of the PI3K pathway, such as Akt and mTOR, and floating cells that formed multicellular spheroids downregulated these [88]. However, it remains unclear how accurately the different methods used to simulate microgravity reflect the results that would be observed in tissues under real microgravity, and how different equipment may affect experimental reproducibility, as conflicting results have often been reported in the past [89]. There is no definitive evidence of increased rates of carcinogenesis amongst astronauts exposed to space radiation in comparison to terrestrial controls (likely because of their overall excellent health pre-flight, low overall doses experienced to date, and very small sample sizes) [90]. However, it is reasonable to assume that space radiation would increase an astronaut’s individualized risk [30]. Furthermore, when reviewing astronaut and analog populations of aircrews exposed to cosmic radiation, Di Trolio et al. concluded that it was unclear whether increased exposure to cosmic radiation was directly linked to carcinogenic risk or whether the risk may be more attributable to lifestyle factors [91].5. Gynecological Cancers and Space 5.1. Brief Overview on Gynecological Cancers Gynecological cancers (GCs) arise in the female reproductive organs and include tubo-ovarian, uterine/endometrial, cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers [92]. GCs pose a serious global health burden due to their high incidence among women of all ages [93]. There is a high mortality rate among women with GCs, which can be attributed to several factors including lack of screening, limited awareness of specific symptoms, or even misdiagnosis. In advanced GCs, delayed diagnosis, together with limited treatment options, are major contributing factors leading to high mortality. In the case of rare GCs (for example gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, malignant germ-cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors, vaginal/vulvar carcinoma, etc.), these issues are even more problematic [94]. These tumors are generally associated with an overall poor prognosis. The low incidence of each of these rare tumors, with an annual incidence of <6 per 100,000 women, poses a major hurdle in the management of patients due to limited therapy options [93]. Considerable studies have shown that the occurrence and development of GCs are related to the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, the activation of oncogenes, and the activation of abnormal cell signaling pathways. In addition, epigenetic processes regulate gene expression through histone modification, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNA, thereby playing a central role in the occurrence and development of GCs [95]. Ovarian cancer (OC) is an umbrella term for a heterogeneous group of tumors that are very diverse behaviorally, morphologically, and molecularly. Up to 90% of OCs are of epithelial origin [96]. OC is commonly associated with alterations in BRCA1/2 and TP53, both of which are linked with a poor prognosis [97,98,99]. Typically, the onset is insidious, with no specific clinical symptoms in the early stage of the disease. To date, there is a paucity of sensitive and effective clinical screening tools for OC, with approximately 70% of cases being diagnosed at an advanced stage [100]. According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States alone, approximately 21,000 new cases of OC are diagnosed annually, accounting for 5% of all female malignancies, with a mortality rate of 62% and a five-year survival rate of 20–30% [101]. Thus, there is an urgent need for highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tools that identify OC at an earlier stage together with the development of new therapeutic approaches to improve patient survival rate. Worldwide, cervical cancer (CC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women [102]. Clinically, CC is associated with persistent infection with ‘high-risk’ human papillomaviruses (HPVs), particularly the subtypes HPV16 and HPV18 [103,104]. In addition, a number of other risk factors have been associated with CC, including early sexual activity [105], multiple sexual partners [106], other viral infections (such as HIV, herpes simplex virus type II), chlamydia infections [107], genetic factors (active oncogenes, including PIK3CA, ATAD2, and CRNDE; tumor-suppressor genes, including TP53, RASSF1A, and NOL7) [108], and tobacco use [109]. For the detection of pre-invasive cervical disease, Papanicolaou smears and liquid-based cytology were historically utilized as the main screening tests [110]; however, there is currently a shift in practice underway towards primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening. Despite the continuous advances in treatment, including radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy together with surgery, early lymph node metastasis can still occur in a number of patients with CC, leading to poor prognosis. The five-year survival rate is still approximately 40% [111,112,113,114]. Although the HPV-associated carcinogenic pathway of CC is now well elucidated, further in-depth studies are necessary to aid in the discovery of novel molecular therapeutic targets that would contribute to the management of patients with advanced or recurrent CC. Endometrial cancer (EC) is another common type of gynecological tumor, comprising 4.8% of worldwide cancer incidence and 2.1% of mortality related to cancer [115,116]. Underlying risk factors are associated with high circulating levels of estrogen and include early menarche, obesity, diabetes mellitus, Lynch syndrome, nulliparity, late menopause, advanced age, breast cancer, tamoxifen therapy, and radiotherapy [117]. When considering both biological and clinical parameters, gene mutations are being used for EC classification [118]. EC can be divided into endometrioid (Type I), affecting approximately 80% of patients, and non-endometrioid (Type II) in the rest of the patients [119,120]. Non-endometrioid ECs include clear-cell carcinoma, endometrial serous carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma. Type 1 ECs have alterations in different genes, including CTNNB1, PTEN, KRAS, and DNA characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI) [121,122]. In contrast, Type 2 EC tumors are defined as having TP53 mutations, amplification of HER2, increased CDH1 expression, and a high Ki-67 (MIB1) score, which is a marker of proliferation. The standard treatment is total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is usually effective for stage I disease [123]. However, in advanced stages, surgery is followed by radio- and/or chemotherapy. Despite advances in drugs and surgical treatments for EC, survival rates have not improved significantly. Thus, improving the ability to identify the prognostic risk factors of EC and formulating reasonable new treatment plans are essential for improving the prognosis and survival rate of patients with EC [124]. Vaginal and vulvar cancers are rare malignancies with similar estimated incidence and mortality rates [125]. Due to the difficulty in performing large prospective randomized trials in patients with these rare tumors, systemic chemotherapeutic regimens have generally been extrapolated from experience in the management of CC. This is because these malignancies share similar epidemiologic risk factors, are strongly associated with HPV infection and are predominantly of the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histologic subtype [126,127,128]. However, vaginal and vulvar cancers can be challenging to treat particularly when disease is not amenable to surgical resection or radiation [129]. There is currently no consensus on effective treatment as response rates to systemic chemotherapeutic regimens are variable in the recurrent setting for vaginal and vulvar SCC [129]. Additionally, given the tendency for vaginal and vulvar SCC to develop later in life, treatment options may be further limited by associated toxicity and co-morbidity [127,128]. Clinical and pathological prognostic factors are constantly being explored in order to minimize unnecessary treatments especially in elderly patients. Furthermore, new molecules are being investigated as targeted therapies to increase patient survival. Building on the previous knowledge about the individual and combined effects of radiation and microgravity on cancer and tumor cell processes [130], the relatively few studies on GCs in simulated space conditions that have been published to date will be described.5.2. Effects of Microgravity and Radiation on Gynecological Cancers: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies Microgravity has different effects on normal and cancer cells, but the related underlying mechanisms are still being elucidated. Experiments using normal or cancer cells performed in space on the International Space Station (ISS) or under s-µg-conditions using devices approved by ESA and NASA to create µg conditions on Earth (known as ground-based facilities) [131], belong to a newly evolving area of research in oncobiology [132]. Numerous studies have demonstrated how a short- and long-term exposure to r- and s-µg influences differentiation, proliferation, migration, survival, apoptosis, adhesion, and other processes involved in carcinogenesis [53]. Space exploration missions also need to have strategies in order to mitigate the potentially harmful exposure to galactic cosmic radiation, which can cause cancer. Ongoing studies investigate these effects using cell- and animal-based studies in low Earth orbit [133]. The costs and logistic challenges involved when sending biological specimens to space have spearheaded the development of surrogate ground-based radiation experiments to study the mechanisms of biological injury and cancer risk. However, simulating galactic cosmic radiation has proven to be difficult. In fact, current studies are only partially succeeding at replicating the complexity of this radiation and its downstream injury pathways [133]. The following section discusses the few studies about various types of gynecological normal or cancer cells under conditions of weightlessness and/or real/simulated galactic cosmic radiation (Table 5 and Table 6). It is important to keep in mind that studies of cancer cells in culture do not necessarily reflect the actual tumor scenario in vivo. Table 5.

Ovarian Normal and Cancer Cells Exposed to Microgravity and/or Radiation Altered Gravity and Microgravity In order to study cellular interactions involved in the growth and differentiation of OC, a cell line, designated as LN1, was established from a mixed mullerian tumor of the ovary [134]. This cell line was cultured on microcarrier beads in the high aspect rotating-wall vessel (RWV), and the tumor cells readily proliferated without the need for cocultivation with a supportive cell layer. Phase contrast light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of three-dimensional multicellular aggregates consisting of multiple cell-coated beads bridged together, as well as scattered aggregates proliferating as spheroids free in suspension. This illustrates the ability of this culture system to provide the biological conditions necessary for pluripotent cell growth [134]. The same group later demonstrated that the RWV culture system is suitable for in vitro production of ovarian tumor cells with the same morphologic, oncogenic, and immunocytochemical characteristics shown in vivo [135]. In another study, LN1 cells were cultured for 14 days on the ISS during Expedition 3. When compared with ground controls, LN1 cells exposed to microgravity showed reduced expression of vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen [136], as well as reduced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 [132]. Both of these cytokines are associated with the growth of several types of tumors, including OC. Przystupski et al. showed that exposure to microgravity affects the morphology of SKOV-3 cells, as well as drug efficiency. Altered cell shape, presence of membrane blebbing and lamellipodia, and lack of filopodia have been observed in cells cultured on 3D-clinostat (3D-C). After exposure on the 3D-C with cisplatin, there was an increase in apoptotic cells and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in comparison to the static control cells. Cell proliferation and migration were also altered after exposure to microgravity. These findings suggest that the altered gravity conditions affect cellular mechanisms that are involved in resistance to cisplatin. This is a crucial step towards understanding the relationship between cellular resistance to chemotherapy and the response to microgravity [137]. An integrated set of systems biology tools and databases were collated together by Mukhopadhyay et al., who analyzed more than 8000 molecular pathways on published global gene expression datasets of human cells in microgravity. Interestingly, microgravity alone may induce several cancer related signatures, including OC [138].Radiation In one particular experiment, six-week-old female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 439 mGy heavy ion irradiation, as a 290 MeV/u carbon-ion beam (LET 10 keV/micron) at 2 cm from the upper proximal point of a spread Bragg beam, and were autopsied 13.5 months after the irradiation [139]. The total tumor incidence was 32.3% (mainly OC), in the irradiated group and 0% in the controls. These results indicate that heavy ion irradiation can induce ovarian tumors in females. The effects of heavy ion and X-ray irradiation on tumorigenesis in B6C3F1 mice were investigated by exposure to 426 mGy heavy ion irradiation of 290 MeV/u carbon-ion beam (LET 60–210 KeV/micron) at the dose rate of 400 +/− 200 mGy/min, 500 mGy of X-ray irradiation at 100 mGy/min, or 5000 mGy of X-ray irradiation at 1000 mGy/min [140]. Interestingly, in the females after 13.5 months of whole-body irradiation, tumorigenicity was significantly lower for heavy ion than for 500 mGy and 5000 mGy X-ray irradiation. The incidences of OC (which was the main tumor), were 73%, 17%, and 41%, respectively. These findings indicate that 426 mGy of heavy ion irradiation is associated with a lower risk of inducing cancer than 5000 mGy of X-ray irradiation. In another experiment carried out to investigate the relationship between oocyte apoptosis and ovarian tumors induced by high and low LET radiations, C57BL/6N mice were exposed to 252Cf fission neutron (2.13 MeV), 1000 mGy monoenergetic neutrons (0.317, 0.525, and 1.026 MeV), or 137Cs g-rays at 7 days of age [141]. The cumulative apoptotic index of oocytes was 65.6%, 77.9%, and 41.6% for the 2.13 MeV neutron, 0.525 MeV neutron, and g-rays, respectively. Follicles with apoptotic pregranulosa cells were 18.3%, 53.0%, and 22.8% of cumulative index for the three groups, respectively. Granulosa cell tumors developed only in the g-ray groups (3.2% for 1000 mGy and 15.6% for 3000 mGy), whereas tubular adenomas developed in the groups of g-ray (35.5%) and monoenergetic neutrons (26.1%). In addition, partial-body irradiation with 3000 mGy g-rays to the ovaries induced granulosa cell tumors in 27.3% of mice. These findings show that there is a higher effectiveness of neutrons than g-rays to induce oocyte and pregranulosa cell apoptosis, which correlates with the inhibition of the development of granulosa cell tumor. Mishra et al. hypothesized that, in mice, charged iron particle irradiation induces ovarian carcinogenesis. Three-month-old female mice were exposed to 0 mGy (sham) or 500 mGy iron ions at the Brookhaven National laboratory and euthanized at 18 months. The 500 mGy irradiated mice showed signs of ovarian failure, with increased weight gain and lack of estrous cycling. A total of 7% and 47% of mice irradiated with 500 mGy had bilateral and unilateral ovarian tumors, respectively, whereas 14% of mice in the 0 mGy group had unilateral tumors. The tumors were tubular adenomas or mixed tubular adenoma/granulosa cell tumors. Though conclusions are limited by the dose rate, this study demonstrated a that space radiation analog can induce ovarian tumors in mice, raising concerns about ovarian tumors as late sequelae of deep space travel in female astronauts [142].5.2.2. Cervical Normal and Cancer Cells Exposed to Microgravity and/or Radiation Microgravity In a study investigating the multicellular interaction between CC cell lines and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which were grown in a RWV, it was found that the co-culture presented tubular structures penetrating the tumor cell masses. This co-culture formed aggregates larger in size than the monocultures, with increased cell mass and number. This suggests that a RWV provides a new model that can be used to investigate the regulatory factors that govern tumor angiogenesis [143]. Kelly et al. investigated various cell types, including melanoma cells, prostate cancer cells, osteosarcoma cells, lung cancer cells, and cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) on the NASA-developed hydrofocusing bioreactor (HFB) and the rotary cell culture system (RCCS). It has been demonstrated that HFB exposure increased CD133-positive cell growth from various cell lines, when compared with the RCCS vessel and normal gravity control [144].Spaceflight Studies So far, the majority of studies on spaceflight focus on normal cells and tissues. However, little is known of the effects of spaceflight on cancer cells. To investigate the potential effects of the exposure of the space environment on cancer cells, one of the experiments included sending human cervical carcinoma CaSki cells on “Shen Zhou IV” space shuttle mission. The cell morphology and proliferation were investigated after flying to ground. The growth of CaSki cells in the flight group was slow when compared with ground groups. Light microscopy revealed differences in cell morphology between ground controls and flight groups, with the latter being characterized by smaller, rounder, smoother and low adhesion cells. Furthermore, space-grown CaSki cells showed altered gene expression in genes regulating the cell cycle, cell morphology, signal transduction, and apoptosis [145,146].Radiation In contrast to the numerous studies that have been conducted on the ground using particles generated in accelerators, investigations on DNA damage from direct exposure to natural space radiation are very limited. In one study, where fixed human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells were flown in the Russian MIR space station for 40 days or on the Space Shuttle for 9 days, the resulting DNA damage levels, as measured by enzymatic incorporation of [3 H]-dATP from terminal deoxyribo-nucleotidyl transferase, correlated with the space flight duration. This suggests that the measured DNA damage was caused by space radiation and was dependent on the duration of the space flight [71]. However, further experiments need to be performed in the true space environment in order to further investigate and address this critical question.Viral Reactivation A potential inducer of gynecological cancers during space travel may be linked to oncogenic virus reactivation. It has been reported that HPV is responsible for 4.5% of CCs and 630,000 new cancer cases per year [147]. HPV can infect both genders and can also cause anal, penis, vagina, vulva, and oropharynx cancers. Despite immune clearance, some viral infections may persist in the latent phase and can cause reactivation or outbreaks. HPV virus latency and reactivation has been widely documented in literature [148], and this reactivation risk increases in women with co-infections, such as HIV and herpesviruses [149]. HPV and co-infection with HSV-2 have been reported in both cervical precancerous lesions and invasive CCs with a prevalence of 13–30% [149]. There is also evidence of the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 4, as a cofactor in cervical pathologies. EBV has been detected in CIN and CC cells [149]. In 2017, Mehta et al. reported reactivation of latent EBV, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus in a population of astronauts (male and female) as well as increased in viral copy numbers during long-duration space travel in comparison to short-duration space missions (10 to 16 days) [150]. During spaceflight, immune dysregulation, impaired NK cell function, and reduced T cell activation have all been reported [151,152]. Both short- and long-duration spaceflights can cause reactivation of the latent herpes virus infections [153]. In addition to the herpes virus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and EBV shedding increased in ISS missions [153]. Currently, it is unknown if spaceflight would alter the HPV clearance and/or reactivation. Based on the current evidence of immune dysfunction and reactivation of some viruses, HPV screening may need to be modified in the future, especially for longer duration spaceflights. Up to 23% of astronaut candidates had a history of treated or current cervical dysplasia. If research shows increased risk for reactivation of viruses like HPV in spaceflight, these women may be at increased risk for CC [154].5.2.3. Endometrial Normal and Cancer Cells Exposed to Microgravity and/or Radiation Microgravity The possible effect of simulated microgravity (SM) on the process of proliferation and in vitro decidualization was investigated in primary human endometrial stromal cells (eSCs) (Cho et al.). Following 36 h of exposure to SM, there was a decrease in the proliferation and migration of eSCs, without inducing apoptosis and changes in cell cycle progression. A decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt and levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and FOXO3a were also observed, impeding autophagic flux by reducing the levels of autophagy-related genes. Overall, these results suggest that exposure to SM decreases proliferation and migration in eSCs through Akt/MMP and FOXO3a/autophagic flux [155]. A three-dimensional (3D) cell culture model of human EC was established by Grun et al., using a RCCS and appeared histologically similar to the primary tumors. This is likely to be useful in the study of the molecular and biological mechanisms of endometrial tumor progression and especially when testing novel molecular targets for cancer therapy [156].Radiation The effect of space radiation on expression of apoptosis-related genes was investigated in endometrial cells (HEC1B and AN3CA cells) by Palumbo et al., whereby cell death was induced by monoenergetic protons (1000–10,000 mGy; LET 8.35 keV/μm and 4.86 MeV) and γ-rays (200–1600 mGy) after irradiation for 4 h. Following exposure to 1000 mGy protons and 400 mGy γ-rays, HEC1B cells underwent apoptosis, as assessed by presence of PARP cleavage. However, this was not observed after higher doses, as cells were likely to have progressed directly to necrosis. AN3CA cells, which are less differentiated than HEC1B, did not undergo apoptosis, but underwent rapid necrosis following 10,000 mGy proton radiation and above 200 mGy γ-radiation. Since the experiments included only three replicates per group, with no statistical analyses, it is still unclear whether there is greater potency of proton radiation compared to γ-radiation for these endpoints in uterine carcinoma cells [157].6. Current Challenges in Gynecological Cancer Risk Prediction for Spaceflight Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that female astronauts have an increased incidence of gynecological cancers. However, we should note that given the low number of female astronauts, conducting studies to determine whether spaceflight increases gynecological cancer risk is difficult. Another possibility could be that the current limitations enforced on the time females spend in space are effective at reducing the incidence of gynecology-specific cancers. At present, studies focusing on subjects that experience similar occupational risk factors to astronauts is the closest form of data we can use to address cancer risk in female astronauts. For example, there are epidemiological studies that have found that there is an increased incidence of breast cancer in female commercial flight attendants. Since female astronauts are exposed to similar occupational risk factors and may also have piloting experience, they may also be at an increased risk for breast cancer [15]. 6.1. Gynecologic Medical Standards for Career and Private Astronauts The prevention of gynecologic morbidity in space begins with the selection process and continues with personalized preventive medicine programs during the astronaut’s Earth-based career [158]. The medical selection criteria for female astronauts with different space agencies undertaking short- and long-term journeys in LEO are identical to those of males except for reproductive system standards and radiation exposure limits. Until 2022, career exposure limits for women of all ages were lower than those for men [14]. The difference in radiation exposure limits reflected the increased incidence of breast, thyroid, and OC in women compared to the incidence in men and the increased risk of lung cancer among female atomic bomb survivors. Moreover, due to reduced cardiovascular and trauma risks, women live approximately 5–7 years longer than men, thus allowing for more time for post flight radiation-induced carcinogenesis. However, the new radiation standard for the radiation exposure limit is now set to be less than 600 mGy and is universal for all ages and sexes. For example, the updated value has been fully integrated into the NASA Space Flight Human-System Standard on Crew Health that sets standards for fitness for duty, space permissible exposure limits, and permissible outcome limits, as well as levels of medical care, medical diagnosis, intervention, treatment and care, and countermeasures [159]. Gynecologic selection standards for astronauts have evolved and generally have been relaxed as spaceflight experiences progress [158]. Current medical standards allow for a history of endometriosis but would disqualify candidates with endometriosis that results in severe dysmenorrhea, endometriomas, or extensive pelvic adhesive diseases. Premenstrual syndrome must interfere with performance of duties to disqualify a female candidate during selection. Any gynecologic malignancy is disqualifying for selection and for flight except for successfully treated cervical carcinoma in situ. As part of the final astronaut selection process, each female candidate finalist undergoes pelvic and abdominal sonography, colposcopy, gynecologic examination, pap smear, and screening for high-risk HPV. Up to the 2013 selection, no female finalists have been disqualified because of gynecologic conditions found at the time of the selection examination. However, several female astronaut finalists were required to undergo surgical procedures or biopsies to rule out disqualifying pathology or neoplasia in ovarian masses, breast masses, or breast microcalcifications, or to remove large leiomyomata uteri [158]. For astronauts, the annual examination includes a physical test by a flight surgeon. Extensive blood analysis, periodic exercise capacity tests, mammography or breast MRI, and bone density analysis (every 3 years unless postflight). Colposcopy is performed based on current practice guidelines and known individual risk factors. During the examination, careful consideration is given to effective contraception for training and flight, optimizing bone density, potential pregnancy timing, and desire for menstrual control during an upcoming mission. For astronauts over 35 years of age and experiencing spotting or breakthrough bleeding on cyclic or combined oral contraceptive, a saline infusion sonogram or hysteroscopy is usually completed to rule endometrial polyps, submucous myomas, or other abnormalities of the endometrial cavity. Preflight medical evaluations are more comprehensive than annual exams and include abdominal and pelvic ultrasound studies and breast MRI. Currently, all female astronauts receive a pre-flight transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). While TVUS is not recommended for routine terrestrial OC screening, surgical management of ovarian masses can be considered [16]. Furthermore, if an endometrial stripe abnormality is noted on TVUS, terrestrial guidelines for endometrial hyperplasia/cancer screening can be considered, especially in the setting of abnormal uterine bleeding [160]. In addition to the CC screening recommended by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), all astronauts should be encouraged to obtain the HPV vaccine series. Routine screening for a personal and family history of precancerous lesions and cancer is recommended to trigger consideration for preflight genetic screening of hereditary cancer syndromes. Lastly, when discussing the risks and benefits of hormonal modalities during spaceflight, counseling regarding the known effect on breast, ovarian, and EC should be part of this counseling. Astronauts in training that develop a disqualifying gynecologic condition are often granted a waiver if the medical threat or risk can be eliminated or reduced to an accepted level or the condition, so that it does not interfere with performance of duties or mission assurance. Decisions regarding waivers for flight to the ISS are made on a case-by-case basis by NASA and the International Partners following a thorough review of the condition, inputs from specialist consultants, successful therapeutic intervention (if needed), and complete recovery. Final determination of medical certification currently rests with NASA and the Multilateral Space Medicine Board of the ISS International Partners (MSMBIP). For the postflight female astronaut population, more conservative recommendations including annual mammography with adjunctive ultrasound for dense breast tissue, or alternating mammography with biennial breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), earlier and more frequent colon cancer screening (starting at 40 y and every 5 y thereafter), and an annual skin exam by dermatologist [154,158] have been recommended [161]. In the case of future female spaceflight participants on NASA-sponsored commercial crew orbital flights (Boeing and SpaceX), Axiom missions, and Inspiration 4 missions, they will probably come under standards and medical selection testing that evolved from a previously published ISS Medical Evaluation Document Volume C and Appendix F [162]. The published standard finds certain gynecologic conditions disqualifying, and individuals outside the standards can be assessed for a waiver based on a risk assessment/mitigation approach. Disqualifying conditions include: (1) disease, injury, or other disorders of the gynecologic tract that could require emergency treatment or interfere with mission completion; (2) any disabling disorders of the reproductive system or associated anatomical structures that could potentially require emergency medical care; and/or (3) history of tumors or pathological growth will be reviewed by the MSMBIP. However, totally private spaceflight participants traveling to LEO or on suborbital flights will have limited flight-related responsibilities and come under the jurisdiction of the US Federal Aviation Administration and each company’s medical policy. Proposed gynecology guidance for private spaceflight participants includes assessing the history of surgery, medication use, current pregnancy, recent postpartum state, or recent pregnancy loss status [158].6.2. Countermeasures There are numerous protective measures specific to ionizing space radiation exposure that could be considered, particularly for exploration-class missions. As discussed, space radiation remains one of the primary factors limiting human tolerance to long-term spaceflight. At present, one of the principal countermeasures to protect astronauts from the biological effects of space radiation is limiting the time spent in space. However, this is not feasible for long-term interplanetary space travel, so other remaining measures will have to be implemented. Preventing space radiation exposure through shielding remains a major challenge for space travel. Reasons for this include restrictions on cost, spacecraft mass, and the nature of ionizing particles, which can penetrate spacecraft hulls and result in secondary intra-vehicular radiation [19]. Spacecraft shielding can be divided into two main categories: passive shielding, constructed of specific materials and always present on spacecraft, and active shielding, which utilizes magnetic or electrostatic fields. In 2019, Barthel and Sarigul-Klijn reviewed shielding optimization methods for space travel beyond the influence of the Earth’s magnetic fields [163]. Regarding passive shielding, optimization of shielding placement could help overcome the mass limitations of spacecraft. Furthermore, due to the interactions between the spacecraft and ionizing particles, materials with lighter nuclei atoms are ideal as high mass nuclei in shielding materials would increase the number of neutrons inside the spacecraft; an electron plasma would be most effective followed by liquid hydrogen. Special space suits with built-in shielding have also been proposed to eradicate the cost of shielding an entire spacecraft but to still provide reasonable protection to astronauts. Active shielding could provide protection, potentially without compromising the mass of spacecraft to the same degree. Electrostatic shielding would work by placing several charged spheres in specific orientations around the spacecraft. This would create a “safe zone” in a particular location on the spacecraft. Magnetic shielding would be created by using a superconducting solenoid around the spacecraft, generating a high magnetic field that would deflect particles below a certain energy threshold. The shielding technology described still has a long way to go in its development but holds the potential to provide effective protection to astronauts on exploration class missions. Biological countermeasures could also be utilized to protect against the ill-effects of ISR-induced oxidative stress. In 2021, Montesinos et al. discussed the role of these countermeasures, which will also be summarized here [164]. Several studies have found that dietary measure and supplementation is likely to have a protective effect in astronauts. It has long been known that a varied diet full of plant foods provides us with the nutrition needed for optimum health. The limitations of storage space and mass on spacecraft restricts the access of crew to a wide variety of foods that would provide them with an abundance of phytochemicals, antioxidants, and other compounds known to interfere with oxidative stress pathways. N-Acetyl-l-Cysteine (NAC) contains an acetyl group that enhances its lipophilicity and allows for the molecule to cross the cell lipid bilayer. This contributes to replenishment of glutathione and thus may reduce both cellular ROS and mitochondrial damage. Because NAC tends to be more stable, it can be stored and administered in the form of a supplement to enhance cellular antioxidant capacity to combat the adverse effects of space environment exposure during space travels. DNA protection was observed in mice who received oral NAC treatment followed by a whole-body irradiation of 1000 mGy gamma radiation at a dose rate of 5000 mGy/min [165]. Treatment with NAC increased the overall health and quality of post ovulatory oocytes in vitro. Reduced spindle defects, decreased abnormal mitochondrial distribution, reduced reactive oxygen species, increased levels of intracellular ATP, and decreased abnormal cortical granules distribution were observed in oocytes treated with NAC [166]. However, more studies are needed to try to closely replicate space radiation to more accurately determine the effects of such radiation or the protective effects of countermeasures such as this. Selenium is amongst the group of micronutrients that is found to be depleted during long-duration spaceflight. This compound is needed for the normal function of oxidative stress protection molecules like glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and the selenoprotein family [167]. Selenium deficiency is also associated with dysfunction of the immune system [168]. Furthermore, taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid also involved in mitochondrial health. Previous studies suggested that taurine conjugates with tRNALeu (UUR) or tRNALys (UUU) of mitochondria, which is important for proper codon-anticodon matching, thus increasing the accuracy and quality of mitochondrial proteins produced [169]. Supplementation of selenium, taurine, and other compounds that protect against oxidative stress might be important in lessening the ionizing effects of long-term radiation exposure on interplanetary space travel. However, many antioxidant compounds are typically needed in large doses in order to achieve the desired clinical effect as single agents. Unfortunately, the doses needed to achieve this exceed tolerability and/or safe levels. The use of a single agent may also downregulate other natural antioxidant pathways, given the complexity of these mechanisms in the human body [170]. Due to the limitations on the dietary intake of astronauts, the development of a single supplementation method that combines safe levels of the most effective chemopreventive compounds would be most desirable for long-term spaceflight missions. Better yet, developing a way for astronauts to grow their own fresh produce in space from which they can source their antioxidants and nutrients would be another desirable way of providing astronauts with compounds that are protective against oxidative stress and cancer development. Other studies have looked into several interesting biological methods like injecting tardigrade DNA [171] or neulasta, which is a bone marrow stimulant, into human tissue [172]. When injected in mini pigs, these were found to have a modest effect on the body’s response to irradiation. With respect to women astronauts, hormonal contraception is already standard practice, which may have countermeasure impacts. There are also non-contraceptive health benefits of using hormonal contraceptives. Many considerations related to cancer risk have been examined on Earth. There are extensive data demonstrating combined oral contraceptive use protects against the development of colon, endometrial, and OC, with increasing protective effects with longer duration use [173]. Similarly, the levonorgestrel intrauterine device is associated with a reduced risk of EC and OC [173]. However, CC risk has been found to increase with increasing duration of oral contraceptive use and newer combined hormonal contraceptive options of the vaginal ring and transdermal patch have a similar increased risk of CC [174,175]. Progestin-only contraceptive users do not have an increased relative risk of developing CC [175]. Furthermore, in HPV-positive women, it has been suggested that the estrogens and progestogens in hormonal contraception could enhance expression of HPV genes through hormone response elements on the viral genome, consequently increasing the risk of CC [176]. Current combined oral contraceptive use is associated with a slightly higher risk of breast cancer (7%); however, this appears to be more associated with triphasic oral contraceptive pills and decreases after discontinuation of oral contraceptives [177,178]. Current evidence also suggests that levonorgestrel intrauterine device users also have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, and this risk is increased with increasing age [178,179]. Overall, the benefits of hormonal contraceptive use outweigh the slight increased risks of cancer development. This information is reassuring, however, as mentioned before, there is a lack of knowledge on hormonal contraception use for long-term spaceflight missions, and contraception use is still an important factor to account for in the overall reproductive health of female astronauts. The risk of breast cancer in female astronauts also merits further study, especially with relation to the exposure to space radiation. Additionally, proposed pharmacological measures include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical radioprotectors and immunomodulation. Pharmaceutical radioprotectors are administered before exposure to a radiation environment. Radiation mitigators are administered after exposure but before the signs and symptoms of radiation exposure occur [180]. To date, the use of these agents thus far in controlled clinical scenarios, where radiation exposure can be controlled and quantitated, does not reflect the unpredictable radiation environment in space. Timing the administration of these agents would therefore be much harder in astronauts [164]. Immunomodulation-based agents include prospective DNA- and RNA-based anti-radiation vaccines in addition to anti-radiation antidotes. These would work via a group of antibodies and natural inhibitory proteins that prevent inflammation, pathological apoptosis, and necrosis of radiation-exposed tissues [164]. As discussed before, radiation has been shown to have molecular effects. These include genetic and epigenetic changes that alter molecular functioning and can lead to carcinogenesis [181]. Genetic counseling and screening guidelines are available through the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC), and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), and it is reasonable to consider screening astronauts preflight for genetic risk factors for certain cancers. Consideration may need to given for genetic screening, especially of female astronauts for certain mutations such as BRCA1/BRCA2 and others associated with breast cancer. If a carrier condition has been identified, screening and risk-reduction protocols can be discussed depending on the type of mutation. Terrestrially, risk-reduction surgeries depending on the mutation recommended at various ages. Salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended at age 35–40 years for BRCA1 carriers and at age 40–45 years for BRCA2 carriers. For BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D carriers, it is recommended at age 45–50 years [182]. While work is ongoing in categorizing the radiosensitive/radioresistant genes, we should note that this may be an interesting application of gene/epigenetic modification technologies as radiation countermeasures. Recent advances in these methods have shown improved overall outcomes, where approaches altering the epigenome are readily reversible [183,184]. Successful identification and modulation of these genes could allow for a significant reduction in negative outcomes experienced by future generations of astronauts.7. Future Perspectives Omics approaches are likely to help in understanding the human health risks due to spaceflight missions. Since its inception in 2014, the NASA GeneLab data repository currently boasts over 271 omics data collected from spaceflight and ground simulation experiments, but it contains no data on female human gynecological cancers [185]. Interestingly, there exists only one dataset relevant to females, and the study only investigated the mammary gland of mice [186]. Therefore, there is a significant need for studies that investigate female physiology in space. There are a number of research opportunities that remain for considering the risks and management of breast and gynecologic cancers pre- and postflight. These include the following: histological differences of any tumors that have occurred in astronauts, characterizing molecular pathways involved in carcinogenesis in analog mammalian models, exploratory omics endpoints, the possibility HPV reactivation, the role of radiation countermeasures in prevention, optimizing in-flight or postflight screening protocols, changes in the microbiota of the reproductive tract during spaceflight and their relation to gynecological cancers, and evaluating the role that artificial intelligence and machine learning will play in cancer detection and prevention. Further study on gynecological cancers, including the incidence of the rare types, in space will build a knowledge base that will help to ensure the safety and health of female astronauts by giving them access to prevention, diagnosis, and countermeasures during their space missions. It would be extremely beneficial to the community to come with a roadmap of studies that needs to be conducted so gynecological risks associated with exploration class missions to the Moon and Mars are minimized. Further, as commercial and private astronauts become more common, obtaining gynecologic and reproductive endpoints following spaceflight will be critical for the creation of preflight, in-flight, and postflight protocols for the screening, diagnosis, and management of gynecologic morbidity and overall astronaut safety.8. Conclusions The current data reveal a scarcity of knowledge about the impact of space radiation and microgravity on gynecologic cancer, as there have been insufficient numbers of female astronauts exposed to long-duration, low-dose rate, and proton and heavy ion radiation to reliably determine the impact on the female reproductive system. With the upcoming Artemis missions set to place the first females on the Moon, there will be longer duration of exposures to both microgravity and space radiation; hence, the influence of flight length on risks related to gynecological cancers will demand a larger focus in ensuring astronaut safety during flight and postflight. Indeed, among all body tissues, the male and female gonads are among the most sensitive to radiation. Therefore, these tissues may be one of the best to study to determine space radiation related exposures.Abbreviations ACMG American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics ACOG American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ASCCP American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology CC cervical cancer CSA Canadian Space Agency 3D-C 3D-clinostat EC endometrial cancer ESA European Space Agency GCR galactic cosmic radiation HFB hydrofocusing bioreactor HPV human papillomavirus HZE high Z and energy ISS International Space Station JAXA Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency LEO low Earth orbit LET Linear Energy Transfer MSMBIP Multilateral Space Medicine Board of the ISS International Partners NAC N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration NSGC National Society of Genetic Counselors OC ovarian cancer RBE relative biological effectiveness RCCS rotary cell culture system RER radiation effects ratio RWV rotating-wall vessel SGO Society of Gynecologic Oncology SPE solar particle events Open in a new tabAuthor Contributions Conceptualization, R.D.-F., R.D.F., A.B. and J.C.-A.; writing—original draft preparation, R.D.-F., R.D.F., F.K., Y.S., S.D., B.A.M., J.G.S., A.B. and J.C.-A.; writing—review and editing, R.D.-F., R.D.F., F.K., Y.S., S.D., B.A.M., S.A., A.P.G.-C., A.S., A.S.G., W.K., J.B., S.S., D.M.P., A.C., L.K.C., A.E.R., J.G.S., A.B. and J.C.-A.; funding acquisition, J.C.-A.

    "abstract": "Summary Human expansion in space is hampered by the physiological risks of spaceflight. The muscle and the liver are among the most affected tissues during spaceflight and their relationships in response to space exposure have never been studied. We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice on NASA RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceflight using GSEA, ORA, and sparse partial least square-differential analysis. We found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the two organs. A specific gene cluster expression pattern in the liver strongly correlated with glucose sparing and an energy-saving response affecting high energy demand process gene expression such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation in the muscle. Our results show that impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver and muscle atrophy gene expression are two paired events during spaceflight, for which dietary changes represent a possible countermeasure.

    "introduction": "Introduction The presence of humans in space has considerably increased since the beginning of space conquest and the space population is expected to continue to grow with tourism and private research activities. The NASA Artemis program plans to take humans back to the Moon for 2024, and a walk on Mars soil is estimated in the course of the 2030s (Bukley, 2020). Meanwhile, space research is driving more and more astronauts in low Earth orbit as an invaluable tool used to deepen humanity’s understanding of the universe and our place within it. But not only do humans want to visit and explore space, humans want to live in space. Outer space settlement has become a new goal of space agencies and the private sector. The Artemis program, SpaceX, the Moon Village Association, and the Mars Society are examples of the driving force of human performance in space. Recently, the USA Air Force Space Command reported eight most plausible scenarios to the year 2060, all of which anticipating a permanent occupation of the Moon surface ranging from a small-sized crew to colony of thousands of people (Air Force Space Command, 2019). Over fifty years after the first foot imprint on the lunar surface, humans could very soon become an interplanetary species. This endeavor is hampered by space stressors such as space radiation, microgravity, confinement, isolation, hostile conditions, and distance from Earth, that all induce physiological changes (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). These changes can be seen as physiological adaptation to the space environment, but they can become maladaptive and deleterious over time and upon gravity re-exposure during a planetary mission such as to Mars. Nine major spaceflight systemic and physiological health risks have been identified: cardiovascular dysregulation, central nervous system impairment, increased cancer risk, muscle degeneration, bone loss, liver dysfunction and lipid dysregulation, circadian rhythm dysregulation, immune dysfunction, and space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). Muscle atrophy is a major risk for these missions as it impairs mobility, thus compromising critical mission operations such as post-landing vehicle egress. Muscle atrophy is characterized by unbalanced protein degradation and the loss of muscle mass. However, protein supplementation fails to counteract muscle loss in sarcopenia, cachexia, and spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy (Gao and Chilibeck, 2020). Many studies have documented spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy as a consequence of weightlessness and decreased muscle solicitation (Fitts et al., 2000). Daily exercises as countermeasures succeed in slowing down the process but the muscle still shrinks during missions. Despite the important advances in human physiology in space, the molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological changes are poorly understood. Therefore, molecular analyses are needed to enable a new countermeasure approach to monitor astronaut health and ensure safety of future habited space missions. The liver and the muscle are among the most affected tissues during spaceflight. The liver and the muscle are two master organs of the metabolism, with the muscle tissue representing up to 50% of the total body mass. Consistently, astronauts and living organisms exposed to space environment display many features of dysregulated metabolism. Rats on the SpaceLab-2 mission displayed increased serum cholesterol levels (Popova et al., 1999). In mice, activated lipotoxic pathways are associated with abnormal liver lipid accumulation and increased lipid metabolism and lipid localization gene expression (Jonscher et al., 2016; Beheshti et al., 2019). Beheshti et al. recently showed using a multi-omic analysis that lipid dysregulation in mice liver and lipotoxic pathways was a specific response to space stressors alone (Beheshti et al., 2019). Dysregulated lipid metabolism, especially lipid accumulation, is strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty acid liver diseases (NAFLD), liver dysfunction, insulin resistance (IR), and diabetes (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). Of note, mice showed early signs of liver injury on a short space flight (STS-135), and subclinical diabetogenic changes have been shown to occur during spaceflight and bedrest studies (Jonscher et al., 2016; Tobin et al., 2002). In mice flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, the transcriptome response of the longissimus dorsi was mainly linked to metabolism, especially insulin signaling and sensitivity, highlighting the impact of spaceflight on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (Gambara et al., 2017a). Glucagon and insulin, two hormones of glucose metabolism, were predicted to be the common upstream regulators of spaceflight metabolic shift (Beheshti et al., 2019). In the Twin Study, increased levels of lactic acid were found in the urine of the flight astronaut, consistent with metabolomics data showing an increased lactic acid/pyruvic acid ratio suggesting a metabolic shift (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Interestingly, insulin resistance and liver diseases are associated with muscle atrophy and a potential reciprocal influence of insulin resistance and muscle disuse atrophy (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Rudrappa et al., 2016; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). As such, metabolic stress is a priority research for human space exploration (Bergouignan et al., 2016). The roles of the liver and the muscle are often interlinked, and muscle-liver crosstalk are described in metabolic diseases NAFLD, NASH, IR, and diabetes (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Soeters and Soeters, 2012). However, the relationship of the two organs in the response to space environment has not been yet elucidated. In this study, we describe for the first time the relationship of the response of both the liver and the muscle of mice during spaceflight using the R software package mixOmics widely used in the omic field. The mixOmics package enables datasets comparison, correlations, and associations visualization in various research areas (Duruflé et al., 2021; González et al., 2012).",

Method details Full experimental procedures are available at: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/ and https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168. The omics data of mice liver and muscle were obtained from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR1) protocol accessible on the NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository. Also, all animal procedures, ethics, and tissues harvesting, disposal, and experiments have been previously conducted and performed by external experimenters. Thus, animal procedures were performed according to the relevant guide-lines at each institution and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Full experimental procedures are available at: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/ and https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168. Briefly, the study was conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2014 on twelves female C57BL/6J mice, six in flight mice (M23, M24, M25, M26, M27, M28) referred to as the FLT group, and six ground controls mice (M33, M34, M35, M36, M37, M38), referred to as the GC group, for 37 days upon 12h day/night cycle, and fed with Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB)63. The research platform used for this experiment was NASA’s Rodent Research Hardware System also referred to as the Rodent Research Habitat System. Mice were sacrificed with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation on orbit on the ISS for the FLT group, and on the ground at the same time for the GC group. The entire carcasses of 10 mice were stored at −80C until processing. Two FLT mice were dissected on-board the ISS, and livers were isolated on-orbit and stored in the MELFI. Frozen FLT mice carcasses were then returned on Earth by the SpaceX-4 spacecraft and delivered to the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) for disposal. The ten frozen mice carcasses, GC and FLT, were dissected at room temperature, and harvested samples stored at −80C. RNA extraction from 20–30mg mice liver and muscle were realized at 4C using a lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and a beta-mercaptoethanol (1:100)/Buffer RLT solution, lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice. Samples were then homogenized for 20 s at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at room temperature to remove tissue debris. RNA from homogenates were further purified using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and eluted in DNase/RNase-free water. RNA concentrations were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA sequencing and library construction was performed on 1 μg of RNA having RIN values of 7 or above, using Illumina HiSeq 4000 kit and experimental protocol. Quantification and statistical analysis RNAseq data processing Raw FASTQ files were proceed using the “GeneLab RNAseq data processing protocol” as reported at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/ and https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168. On this work we used the mentioned protocol up to the step “Quantification data was imported to R (version 3.6.0) with tximport”.R Differential Expression (DE) analysis has been performed using the R studio software Version 1.2.5001 and the DESeq2 package version 1.30.1 that uses shrinkage estimation for dispersion and fold change. RSEM expected counts were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. Statistical significance of differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤0.05) were assessed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment procedure.Biological process, pathways, networks and clusters analysis For biological process, pathways, networks and clusters analysis, normalized count from RR1 mice quadriceps and liver were processed by the DEseq2 package and assessed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways Over Representation Analysis on the online Webgesalt platform, and for Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) and KEGG pathways GeneSets Enrichment by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. The Cytoscape software was used to build geneset networks from GSEA results. GSEAs were run with a ‘‘Flight vs Ground Control’’ comparison setting. The ranked list of genes was defined by the signal-to-noise metric, and the statistical significance were determined by 1000 permutations of the gene sets. Enrichment importance were sorted according to the enrichment score calculated by GSEA (Müller, 2019). Venn diagrams were generated on the online platform Venny available at: https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index2.0.2.html.mixOmics mixomics is a R package developed by Kim-anh Lê Cao, Sébastien Déjean and collaborators to visualize associations between paired omics datasets using correlation circles plots, heatmaps, and networks (Duruflé et al., 2021; González et al., 2012; Rohart et al., 2017). In the present study we used mixOmics package version 6.14.1. More information can be found on the online mixOmics platform available at: http://mixomics.org/.sPLS and sPLS-DA Transcriptome from 6 matched NASA RR1 mice, 3 ground controls (M36, M37, M38) and 3 inflight (M25, M26, M28), between the liver and the quadriceps were analyzed by sPLS (Partial Least Square) and sPLS-DA (sparse Partial Least Square-Differential Analysis). Correlation circle and correlation network were generated from sPLS-DA performed on 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of total normalized counts according to the process suggested in Duruflé et al. (2021). This method is an internal method to validate that the pattern of genes evaluated with the strongest importance for discrimination maintain across input reduction. These genes are referred to as to “discriminating genes” in this study. The correlation circle plot is a 1 sized radius were variable pools located between |0,5| and |1| have the strongest correlation. Correlation heatmaps are generated from sPLS analyses. Post 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA DEG are DEG still present in reported genes from 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA.

    "results": "Results Lipid metabolic processes are the most common biological processes affected in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceflight Previous studies showed that the muscle and the liver are differentially affected by metabolic changes during spaceflight (da Silveira et al., 2020). Here, we first investigated the commonalities between the two organs. We chose to focus on the quadriceps, which is the most important in term of size and as such potentially in terms of effects. Transcriptomic data from C57BL/6J mouse liver and quadriceps from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR1) protocol were analyzed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method and visualized with Cytoscape software (Figure 1A). In the quadriceps, “fatty coA process” and “axon extension negative” were the most enriched processes. In the liver, most enriched processes were related to mitochondria (“proton triphosphate gsea”, “electron transport cytochrome”, and “mitochondrial translational elongation”) followed by lipid metabolism-related processes (“oxidation fatty acyl”, “plasma lipoprotein particle”, and “positive lipid process”) (Figure S1A, Related to Figure 1). Similarly, lipid metabolism-related pathways were also the most enriched reported by KEGG pathways over representation analysis in the liver (Figure S1B, Related to Figure 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Lipid metabolic processes are the most commonly biological processes affected in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceflight (A) Cytoscape network of most common biological processes shared by the liver and the quadriceps reported by Gene Ontology biological Pathway (GOBP) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in mice during spaceflight (p-value 0.05, FDR 0.05). Yellow circles indicate lipid metabolism related processes, pink circles indicate mitochondrial function related processes, green circles indicates protein post-translational processes, and the blue circle indicates a DNA Repair-related process. (B) Venn diagram of common KEGG GSEA pathways between the liver and the quadriceps in mice during spaceflight. (C) Summary of the common KEGG GSEA pathways between mice liver and quadriceps. FDR: False Discovery Rate, GOBP: Gene Ontology Biological Process, GSEA: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.Among the 24,961 transcripts identified in the liver samples and the 22,657 transcripts in the identified quadriceps sample, the most enriched gene ontology biological processes altered by spaceflight assessed by GSEA commonly shared were related to lipid metabolism (Figure 1A). “β-oxidation lipid”, “plasma lipoprotein particle”, and “triglycerides neutral biosynthetic” genesets were upregulated in both organs, while “cholesterol alcohol biosynthetic” and “fatty acyl coa” displayed opposed expression patterns between the two organs. Consistent with previous studies, mitochondria-related process genesets were also among the most shared processes and were upregulated in the liver, while downregulated in the quadriceps. Endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome-related process genesets were also among the most shared process genesets, potentially suggesting impaired protein metabolism. Both positively (upregulated) and negatively (downregulated) enriched KEGG pathways obtained by GSEA for each organ were compared together in a Venn diagram (Figures 1B and 1C). Among the 70 pathways analyzed, 11 pathways were common to the two organs. Again, lipid metabolism-related pathways were the most represented among the common ones (Figure 1B), with “KEGG_BIOSYNTHESIS_OF_UNSATURED_FATTY_ACIDs” and the two short chain fatty acid metabolism pathways “KEGG_BUTANOATE_METABOLISM” and “KEGG_PROPANOATE_METABOLISM” (Figure 1C). Protein metabolism (“KEGG_RIBOSOME”, “KEGG_PROTEASOME”, “KEGG_RNA_POLYMERASE”) and DNA repair-related pathways were also among the common downregulated pathways between the two organs. Thus, spaceflights induce a strong transcriptional response of the metabolism, especially for lipid metabolism in the liver and in the quadriceps. Hypoglycemic signaling pathways genes are the most significantly downregulated in mice quadriceps during spaceflight In the quadriceps, 972 genes were significantly differentially expressed, among which 562 were downregulated and 410 were upregulated. KEGG pathways over representation analysis (ORA) in the online software Webgesalt reported 30 most enriched pathways (Figure 2A). Pathways involved in metabolism are particularly enriched, especially those regulating glycemia: HIF1, ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression was decreased in flight mice compared to ground control mice (Figure 2B). Interestingly, glucose transport processes were among the most negatively enriched in GSEA reports, and glucose transport process gene expression was decreased in flight mice compared to ground control mice (Figures 2C and 2D).

DEG: Differentially Expressed Genes, FDR: False Discovery Rate, GOBP: Gene Ontology Biological Process, GSEA: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, ORA: Over Representation Analysis, sPLS-DA: sparse Partial Least Square- Differential Analysis.We investigated the relationships between the downregulation of glucose transport process genes and the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathway genes using the supervised method sPLS-DA (sparse partial least square-differential analysis) with the R-mixOmics package. We compared the reported genes by the sPLS-DA performed at 100% (22657), 75% (16992), 50% (11328), and 25% (5664) (according to the process suggested in Duruflé et al., 2021) transcript input in a Venn diagram, and we found that 3463 genes were commonly reported with the strongest importance for discrimination (“discriminating genes”) (Figure S2A, Related to Figure 2). KEGG pathways ORA on these specific genes reported several enriched pathways among which were the previously mentioned hypoglycemic signaling pathways. Moreover, 491 significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) were still present among the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes, and KEGG pathway ORA on these genes demonstrated fewer enriched pathways than on the original analysis of the 972 DEG (Figure 2A) and on the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes (Figure S2A, Related to Figure 2), but the hypoglycemic ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and HIF-1 signaling pathways were still among the most enriched (Figure S2B, Related to Figure 2). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that inflight mice and ground control mice groups were clearly discriminated by gene variability (Figure S2C, Related to Figure 2), despite PCA being an unsupervised method. Finally, we found that glucose transport process and hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression correlate (Figure 2E), and this correlation is strong as indicated by the correlation intensity level shown on the correlation heatmap (Figure S2D, Related to Figure 2). Muscle glucose transport gene expression correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translation processes gene expression In the quadriceps, DNA repair, autophagy, and translation are among the most enriched processes and pathways reported by GSEA and ORA. DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process genes are decreased in inflight mice compared to ground control mice (Figures 3A–3C). Muscle glucose transport gene expression strongly correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process gene expression as shown by the correlation circle plot (Figures 3D–3F) and the correlation heatmap (Figures 3G–3I). These processes are both high energy demand processes. Thus, decreased energy intake gene expression correlated with an energy-saving transcriptome in mice quadriceps during spaceflight. Figure 3.

Lipid metabolic processes gene expression in the liver correlates with gene expression changes in the muscle and muscle atrophy phenotype Lipid metabolism pathways are among the most reported by GSEA and ORA (Figures 1 and S1). In addition, discriminating genes after 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA and post DEG 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA still maintain this pattern as shown by KEGG ORA (Figures S3A and S3B, Related to Figure 4). Of note, the two short chain fatty acid “butanoate” and ‘propanoate” were always among the most enriched KEGG pathways (Figure S3C, Related to Figure 4). Since fatty liver diseases are associated with IR and diabetes, we investigated whether altered glucose transport gene expression was linked to liver lipid metabolism. We found that glucose transport process gene expression strongly correlated with liver lipid metabolism gene expression during spaceflight (Figures 4B and 4C). Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression also correlated with muscle autophagy, DNA repair, and translation process gene expression (Figures 5A–5C). Furthermore, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression (Figure 5D). Indeed, liver lipid metabolism and muscle atrophy genes formed a gene correlation network (Figure 5E). Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Serpina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1 formed a gene cluster strongly correlating with muscle gene expression (Figure 5F). Figure 4.

    "discussion": "Discussion Despite the systemic and physiological health risk of spaceflight, it is a fact that humans have become a space-faring species. Muscle atrophy has been shown to occur in both weightlessness and bed rest studies. The decreased gravity load on the locomotive apparatus is often presented as the main driver of muscle atrophy and bone loss. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism were impaired in both astronauts and mice during spaceflight. Da Silveira and colleagues previously showed that a mitochondrial stress is a central hub for spaceflight-induced physiological changes (da Silveira et al., 2020). Mitochondria are complex organelles inside the cell where fundamental biomolecules are metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and coupled to energy production by the electron transport chain. Thus, mitochondria play a key role in metabolism and energy management. Here, we found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome in mice during spaceflight. Impaired lipid metabolism and fatty acid accumulation is associated with muscle atrophy. Of note, butanoate and propanoate metabolism were the most affected in the two organs analyzed, decreased in the liver while increased in the muscle. Butanoate and propanoate, also known as butyrate and propionate, are short chain fatty acids produced in the intestinal lumen by bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates, especially resistant starch, dietary fiber, and to a lesser extent proteins. Resistant starch is found in some grains, beans, and legumes. The gut microbiome is disturbed during spaceflight; astronauts’ gut microbiome showed an alteration in the composition pattern of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, the main butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gut (Venegas et al., 2019), with the presence of different genus increasing or decreasing during spaceflight but also showing a consistent decrease in bacteria from the taxa Pseudobutyrivibrio and Akkermansia, also known to produce butyrate in the intestine (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Voorhies et al., 2019; Venegas et al., 2019). Microbiome analysis from RR1 mice showed an overall increase of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, but the authors linked that to similar alterations that occur with aging (Jiang et al., 2019). This Firmicute increase in older mice is seen as a sign of dysbiosis and this alteration was shown to be followed by a ∼70% decrease in butyrate levels (Spychala et al., 2018). The upregulation of butyrate and propionate pathways in the muscle can reflect a possible need for these fatty acids and derivatives. In this context, dietary changes could represent a feasible countermeasure to spaceflight-induced physiological changes. The TCA cycle activity and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ratio are decreased in muscle during spaceflight suggesting disturbed energy production. Consistently, we found that spaceflight induced a hyperglycemic response in mouse muscle involving the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathways downstream of the insulin receptor (HIF, ErbB, AMPK, FoxO, and PI3K-Akt). This signaling response mostly affected glucose import gene expression. In addition, high energy demand processes such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation gene expression were decreased in inflight mice quadriceps, suggesting a shift toward an energy-saving mode in the muscle during spaceflight. The muscle is a high energy demand organ. Since the muscle represent up to 50% of the total body mass, its metabolism radically affects glucose availability in the body. Consequently, glucose sparing and energy saving by the muscle in detrimental conditions can compensate for the energy needs of other such as the brain that requires stable and continuous glucose supply. Oxidative stress and DNA damage overload, that can impair mitochondrial function and the metabolism, are examples of detrimental conditions occurring during spaceflight (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Also, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to muscle atrophy (Abrigo et al., 2019). The HIF-1 signaling enriched pathways suggest that oxidative stress occurred in RR1 inflight mice. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction promote insulin resistance and diabetes (Bashan et al., 2009; Di Meo et al., 2017; Sivitz and Yorek, 2010). Our results, in line with previous space studies, suggest an insulin resistance phenotype. Meanwhile, insulin resistance has been proposed as an evolutionary mechanism to spare glucose that can benefit survival in various states such as starvation, immune activation growth, and cancer (Soeters and Soeters, 2012). Insulin resistance and diabetes are often associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism and liver diseases. Fatty acids inhibit the insulin signaling pathways by directly interfering in the signaling through diacylglycerol or by overloading the TCA with the precursor acetyl CoA (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). During spaceflight, liver lipid metabolic gene expression correlated with muscle glucose import gene expression in RR1 mice. Insulin resistance, NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cirrhosis are associated with muscle atrophy and their severity correlates positively (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). During a stress starvation, fatty acids together with ketone bodies become the primary source of energy for cells while peripheral organs such as the muscle, but also the skin and bones, provide amino acids taken up by central organs such as the liver, the spleen, immune cells, and healing tissues, ultimately leading to protein loss (Soeters and Soeters, 2012). During a spaceflight, all cells are exposed to space stressors such as radiation, endocrine system perturbation induced by altered circadian rhythm or psychological issues, and microgravity, all promoting oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, it has been shown that spaceflight induces a shift from slow aerobic and highly enriched mitochondria muscle fibers (“slow fiber”, “type I”) toward fast anaerobic and fast low-enriched mitochondria muscle fiber (“fast fiber”, “type II”) (Gambara et al., 2017b; Ulanova et al., 2015). Mitochondria are the major source of reactive oxygen species. As such, spaceflight-induced fiber shift and mitochondrial dysfunction can be seen as a biological mechanism to decrease mitochondrial activity and mitigate oxidative stress. If mitochondrial stress is a central biological hub during spaceflight, and if the mitochondria are the master organelle of metabolism regulation and energy management, we can then expect a general metabolic shift in the body toward a starvation-like phenotype that promotes decreased mitochondrial activity, decreased metabolism and protein loss in the muscle, and increased lipid metabolism in the liver, to the benefit of all body cells during spaceflight. Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle DNA repair, autophagy, translation, and finally muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression. Butanoate and propanoate metabolism-related genes were still among the one with the strongest correlation. Interestingly, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation improve mitochondrial function, fat accumulation, insulin resistance, diabetes, and liver diseases (Gao et al., 2009; Khan and Jena, 2016; Mollica et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018). Moreover, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation decreased muscle atrophy in various conditions (Chang et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2022; Walsh et al., 2015). Thus, butyrate supplementation or dietary modification to stimulate microbial production represents simple options to counteract muscle atrophy while preventing insulin resistance and lipid accumulation during spaceflight. Gambara et al. previously identified insulin- and glucose metabolism-linked transcripts as main DEG in BION-M1 biosatellite flown mice longissimus dorsi. In the present study, 17 and 13 differentially expressed genes in the liver and the muscle, respectively, were common to the 89 previously identified (Gambara et al., 2017a). Acas1a, Cpt2, Agt, Lcn2, and Prkcd, which were among the most DEG in Gambara’s study were not found significantly differentially expressed neither in the liver nor the quadriceps in the present study. The present study is based on the analyses of discriminating genes identified by the spls-DA performed with the mixOmics script. This method is designed to identify variations that are correlated, here gene expression in the liver and gene expression in the quadriceps. Also, 31 over the 9753, among which Agt and Cpt2, and 24 over the 3463 discriminating genes in the liver and the quadriceps, respectively, were in common with the 89 of the Gambara’s study. These differences may reflect the variability of gene expression between the different muscle types. Nonetheless, in line with the literature, both converge to an altered insulin transcriptome, thus highlighting a general adaptive response in muscle during spaceflight despite different molecular pathways. Moreover, the present study highlights the importance of discriminating genes over DEG in deciphering omic data. We found that discriminating genes are mainly linked to lipid metabolism in the liver and insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in the quadriceps. This means that lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver correlates with insulin signaling and glucose metabolism gene expression in the quadriceps in mice during spaceflight. We identified a cluster of lipid metabolism processes-related genes in the liver, including Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Serpina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1, correlating the most with glucose transport gene expression and potentially insulin resistance in the muscle. Among these genes, some are already described for their insulin sensitivity. Fabp2, Abcg5, and Abcg8 genes polymorphisms are associated with insulin sensitivity while Apom might protect against insulin resistance (Gylling et al., 2004; Kurano et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2020). Interestingly, Sestrin 1 (Sesn1), a well-known regulator of cell metabolism upregulated in longissimus dorsi of BION-M1 mice, was reported as a discriminating gene in both the liver and the quadriceps (Gambara et al., 2017a). Sestrin proteins are involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, autophagy, and insulin signaling (Lee et al., 2013). Sesn1 together with the present lipid metabolism-related gene cluster may thus account in insulin resistance research. The liver influence on quadriceps gene expression we identified needs to be carried out by organ communication mechanisms and we identified hepatokines as the most likely effector. Hepatokines are proteins secreted by the liver that can modulate signaling pathways associated with energy metabolism in the muscle and influence the development of chronic metabolic diseases (Seo et al., 2021). Important for our context, an increased blood concentration of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin increases insulin sensitivity, muscle hypertrophy, and mitochondrial function and diminishes fat mass in the muscle (Seo et al., 2021). Interestingly, increased concentration of Fetuin-A showed to have the inverse effect of the previously described hepatokines (Jensen-Cody and Potthoff, 2021; Seo et al., 2021). The levels of Fetuin-A increase after 60 day of bed rest, a ground model for microgravity effects, and we found in the literature a positive correlation between the Fetuin-A levels and the gene expression of Serpina6 and Rdh7, two genes we identified in our gene cluster (Herrmann et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2020). Interestingly, Fetuin-A, as well as FGF21 and ANGPTL4 genes are among the correlating genes in the liver of mice during spaceflight reported by the liver versus quadriceps sPLS-DA. We hypothesize that the gene expression correlation identified in our work likely involves an increased Fetuin-A production by the liver and a diminished production of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin. In conclusion, we described for the first time a strong correlation between liver lipid metabolism gene expression and the downregulation of hypoglycemic and energy demand process-related genes. In the light of current knowledge, our result suggests that a starvation-like phenotype could promote a metabolic shift toward an energy-saving mode, resource sparring, and lipid mobilization through a tight liver-muscle crosstalk contributing to muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Dietary changes based on starch supplementation and microbiome modulation represent an affordable and sustainable countermeasure to support our planetary goals and outer space settlement. Meanwhile, improving food habits and body energy monitoring is an overall human challenge both on Earth and beyond. Limitations of the study Sample size was only six mice to match sample availability in the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome. Future space studies should be designed to match individuals for any factors (organs, environmental parameters, psychological parameters, etc.). Here, we studied biological processes and pathways at a transcriptional level. Transcription regulation, post-transcriptional stabilization, and post-translational modifications impact cell response from gene expression to the final protein activity. In addition, transcriptomics provides a static view of one single moment in the cell. However, spatial repartition also impacts molecular dynamics, and a transcriptional ecosystem theory has been defined (Silveira and Bilodeau, 2018). To further understand the biological significance of the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in mice quadriceps, both functional analysis and multi-omics studies are needed. Additional factors account for inducing muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Circadian rhythm pathways genes are among those enriched in both the quadriceps and the liver in mice during spaceflight (Figure S1B, Related to Figures 1 and 2A), and circadian rhythm perturbation is associated with muscle atrophy (Choi et al., 2020). Astronauts experience continuous circadian rhythm stressors on board the ISS, with sixteen sunsets per day and sustained artificial light exposure as the only illumination source. However, assessing and deciphering circadian rhythm dynamics and correlation at molecular levels require proper protocol and experimental design (Zeitgeber time method) that should be implemented in future space biology research. We used the method implemented in mixOmics between the same molecular variables. This method is a powerful tool to compare any types of datasets. In this context, multiple variables comparisons, e.g., temperature variation inside the spacecrafts, food intake levels, dietary type, cognitive performances, psychological parameters, and allowing multiscale comparisons, will considerably widen our understanding of spaceflight’s impact on living organisms.

Copyright notice ID: 9576569 PMID: 36267920 Summary Human expansion in space is hampered by the physiological risks of spaceflight. The muscle and the liver are among the most affected tissues during spaceflight and their relationships in response to space exposure have never been studied. We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice on NASA RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceflight using GSEA, ORA, and sparse partial least square-differential analysis. We found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the two organs. A specific gene cluster expression pattern in the liver strongly correlated with glucose sparing and an energy-saving response affecting high energy demand process gene expression such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation in the muscle. Our results show that impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver and muscle atrophy gene expression are two paired events during spaceflight, for which dietary changes represent a possible countermeasure.

The NASA Artemis program plans to take humans back to the Moon for 2024, and a walk on Mars soil is estimated in the course of the 2030s (Bukley, 2020). Meanwhile, space research is driving more and more astronauts in low Earth orbit as an invaluable tool used to deepen humanity’s understanding of the universe and our place within it. But not only do humans want to visit and explore space, humans want to live in space. Outer space settlement has become a new goal of space agencies and the private sector. The Artemis program, SpaceX, the Moon Village Association, and the Mars Society are examples of the driving force of human performance in space. Recently, the USA Air Force Space Command reported eight most plausible scenarios to the year 2060, all of which anticipating a permanent occupation of the Moon surface ranging from a small-sized crew to colony of thousands of people (Air Force Space Command, 2019). Over fifty years after the first foot imprint on the lunar surface, humans could very soon become an interplanetary species. This endeavor is hampered by space stressors such as space radiation, microgravity, confinement, isolation, hostile conditions, and distance from Earth, that all induce physiological changes (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). These changes can be seen as physiological adaptation to the space environment, but they can become maladaptive and deleterious over time and upon gravity re-exposure during a planetary mission such as to Mars. Nine major spaceflight systemic and physiological health risks have been identified: cardiovascular dysregulation, central nervous system impairment, increased cancer risk, muscle degeneration, bone loss, liver dysfunction and lipid dysregulation, circadian rhythm dysregulation, immune dysfunction, and space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). Muscle atrophy is a major risk for these missions as it impairs mobility, thus compromising critical mission operations such as post-landing vehicle egress. Muscle atrophy is characterized by unbalanced protein degradation and the loss of muscle mass. However, protein supplementation fails to counteract muscle loss in sarcopenia, cachexia, and spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy (Gao and Chilibeck, 2020). Many studies have documented spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy as a consequence of weightlessness and decreased muscle solicitation (Fitts et al., 2000). Daily exercises as countermeasures succeed in slowing down the process but the muscle still shrinks during missions. Despite the important advances in human physiology in space, the molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological changes are poorly understood. Therefore, molecular analyses are needed to enable a new countermeasure approach to monitor astronaut health and ensure safety of future habited space missions. The liver and the muscle are among the most affected tissues during spaceflight. The liver and the muscle are two master organs of the metabolism, with the muscle tissue representing up to 50% of the total body mass. Consistently, astronauts and living organisms exposed to space environment display many features of dysregulated metabolism. Rats on the SpaceLab-2 mission displayed increased serum cholesterol levels (Popova et al., 1999). In mice, activated lipotoxic pathways are associated with abnormal liver lipid accumulation and increased lipid metabolism and lipid localization gene expression (Jonscher et al., 2016; Beheshti et al., 2019). Beheshti et al. recently showed using a multi-omic analysis that lipid dysregulation in mice liver and lipotoxic pathways was a specific response to space stressors alone (Beheshti et al., 2019). Dysregulated lipid metabolism, especially lipid accumulation, is strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty acid liver diseases (NAFLD), liver dysfunction, insulin resistance (IR), and diabetes (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). Of note, mice showed early signs of liver injury on a short space flight (STS-135), and subclinical diabetogenic changes have been shown to occur during spaceflight and bedrest studies (Jonscher et al., 2016; Tobin et al., 2002). In mice flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, the transcriptome response of the longissimus dorsi was mainly linked to metabolism, especially insulin signaling and sensitivity, highlighting the impact of spaceflight on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (Gambara et al., 2017a). Glucagon and insulin, two hormones of glucose metabolism, were predicted to be the common upstream regulators of spaceflight metabolic shift (Beheshti et al., 2019). In the Twin Study, increased levels of lactic acid were found in the urine of the flight astronaut, consistent with metabolomics data showing an increased lactic acid/pyruvic acid ratio suggesting a metabolic shift (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Interestingly, insulin resistance and liver diseases are associated with muscle atrophy and a potential reciprocal influence of insulin resistance and muscle disuse atrophy (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Rudrappa et al., 2016; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). As such, metabolic stress is a priority research for human space exploration (Bergouignan et al., 2016). The roles of the liver and the muscle are often interlinked, and muscle-liver crosstalk are described in metabolic diseases NAFLD, NASH, IR, and diabetes (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Soeters and Soeters, 2012). However, the relationship of the two organs in the response to space environment has not been yet elucidated. In this study, we describe for the first time the relationship of the response of both the liver and the muscle of mice during spaceflight using the R software package mixOmics widely used in the omic field. The mixOmics package enables datasets comparison, correlations, and associations visualization in various research areas (Duruflé et al., 2021; González et al., 2012).Results Lipid metabolic processes are the most common biological processes affected in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceflight Previous studies showed that the muscle and the liver are differentially affected by metabolic changes during spaceflight (da Silveira et al., 2020). Here, we first investigated the commonalities between the two organs. We chose to focus on the quadriceps, which is the most important in term of size and as such potentially in terms of effects. Transcriptomic data from C57BL/6J mouse liver and quadriceps from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR1) protocol were analyzed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method and visualized with Cytoscape software (Figure 1A). In the quadriceps, “fatty coA process” and “axon extension negative” were the most enriched processes. In the liver, most enriched processes were related to mitochondria (“proton triphosphate gsea”, “electron transport cytochrome”, and “mitochondrial translational elongation”) followed by lipid metabolism-related processes (“oxidation fatty acyl”, “plasma lipoprotein particle”, and “positive lipid process”) (Figure S1A, Related to Figure 1). Similarly, lipid metabolism-related pathways were also the most enriched reported by KEGG pathways over representation analysis in the liver (Figure S1B, Related to Figure 1). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Lipid metabolic processes are the most commonly biological processes affected in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceflight (A) Cytoscape network of most common biological processes shared by the liver and the quadriceps reported by Gene Ontology biological Pathway (GOBP) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in mice during spaceflight (p-value 0.05, FDR 0.05). Yellow circles indicate lipid metabolism related processes, pink circles indicate mitochondrial function related processes, green circles indicates protein post-translational processes, and the blue circle indicates a DNA Repair-related process. (B) Venn diagram of common KEGG GSEA pathways between the liver and the quadriceps in mice during spaceflight. (C) Summary of the common KEGG GSEA pathways between mice liver and quadriceps. FDR: False Discovery Rate, GOBP: Gene Ontology Biological Process, GSEA: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.Among the 24,961 transcripts identified in the liver samples and the 22,657 transcripts in the identified quadriceps sample, the most enriched gene ontology biological processes altered by spaceflight assessed by GSEA commonly shared were related to lipid metabolism (Figure 1A). “β-oxidation lipid”, “plasma lipoprotein particle”, and “triglycerides neutral biosynthetic” genesets were upregulated in both organs, while “cholesterol alcohol biosynthetic” and “fatty acyl coa” displayed opposed expression patterns between the two organs. Consistent with previous studies, mitochondria-related process genesets were also among the most shared processes and were upregulated in the liver, while downregulated in the quadriceps. Endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome-related process genesets were also among the most shared process genesets, potentially suggesting impaired protein metabolism. Both positively (upregulated) and negatively (downregulated) enriched KEGG pathways obtained by GSEA for each organ were compared together in a Venn diagram (Figures 1B and 1C). Among the 70 pathways analyzed, 11 pathways were common to the two organs. Again, lipid metabolism-related pathways were the most represented among the common ones (Figure 1B), with “KEGG_BIOSYNTHESIS_OF_UNSATURED_FATTY_ACIDs” and the two short chain fatty acid metabolism pathways “KEGG_BUTANOATE_METABOLISM” and “KEGG_PROPANOATE_METABOLISM” (Figure 1C). Protein metabolism (“KEGG_RIBOSOME”, “KEGG_PROTEASOME”, “KEGG_RNA_POLYMERASE”) and DNA repair-related pathways were also among the common downregulated pathways between the two organs. Thus, spaceflights induce a strong transcriptional response of the metabolism, especially for lipid metabolism in the liver and in the quadriceps.Hypoglycemic signaling pathways genes are the most significantly downregulated in mice quadriceps during spaceflight In the quadriceps, 972 genes were significantly differentially expressed, among which 562 were downregulated and 410 were upregulated. KEGG pathways over representation analysis (ORA) in the online software Webgesalt reported 30 most enriched pathways (Figure 2A). Pathways involved in metabolism are particularly enriched, especially those regulating glycemia: HIF1, ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression was decreased in flight mice compared to ground control mice (Figure 2B). Interestingly, glucose transport processes were among the most negatively enriched in GSEA reports, and glucose transport process gene expression was decreased in flight mice compared to ground control mice (Figures 2C and 2D).

DEG: Differentially Expressed Genes, FDR: False Discovery Rate, GOBP: Gene Ontology Biological Process, GSEA: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, ORA: Over Representation Analysis, sPLS-DA: sparse Partial Least Square- Differential Analysis.We investigated the relationships between the downregulation of glucose transport process genes and the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathway genes using the supervised method sPLS-DA (sparse partial least square-differential analysis) with the R-mixOmics package. We compared the reported genes by the sPLS-DA performed at 100% (22657), 75% (16992), 50% (11328), and 25% (5664) (according to the process suggested in Duruflé et al., 2021) transcript input in a Venn diagram, and we found that 3463 genes were commonly reported with the strongest importance for discrimination (“discriminating genes”) (Figure S2A, Related to Figure 2). KEGG pathways ORA on these specific genes reported several enriched pathways among which were the previously mentioned hypoglycemic signaling pathways. Moreover, 491 significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) were still present among the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes, and KEGG pathway ORA on these genes demonstrated fewer enriched pathways than on the original analysis of the 972 DEG (Figure 2A) and on the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes (Figure S2A, Related to Figure 2), but the hypoglycemic ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and HIF-1 signaling pathways were still among the most enriched (Figure S2B, Related to Figure 2). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that inflight mice and ground control mice groups were clearly discriminated by gene variability (Figure S2C, Related to Figure 2), despite PCA being an unsupervised method. Finally, we found that glucose transport process and hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression correlate (Figure 2E), and this correlation is strong as indicated by the correlation intensity level shown on the correlation heatmap (Figure S2D, Related to Figure 2).Muscle glucose transport gene expression correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translation processes gene expression In the quadriceps, DNA repair, autophagy, and translation are among the most enriched processes and pathways reported by GSEA and ORA. DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process genes are decreased in inflight mice compared to ground control mice (Figures 3A–3C). Muscle glucose transport gene expression strongly correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process gene expression as shown by the correlation circle plot (Figures 3D–3F) and the correlation heatmap (Figures 3G–3I). These processes are both high energy demand processes. Thus, decreased energy intake gene expression correlated with an energy-saving transcriptome in mice quadriceps during spaceflight. Figure 3.

FDR: False Discovery Rate, sPLS-DA: sparse Partial Least Square- Differential Analysis.Lipid metabolic processes gene expression in the liver correlates with gene expression changes in the muscle and muscle atrophy phenotype Lipid metabolism pathways are among the most reported by GSEA and ORA (Figures 1 and S1). In addition, discriminating genes after 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA and post DEG 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA still maintain this pattern as shown by KEGG ORA (Figures S3A and S3B, Related to Figure 4). Of note, the two short chain fatty acid “butanoate” and ‘propanoate” were always among the most enriched KEGG pathways (Figure S3C, Related to Figure 4). Since fatty liver diseases are associated with IR and diabetes, we investigated whether altered glucose transport gene expression was linked to liver lipid metabolism. We found that glucose transport process gene expression strongly correlated with liver lipid metabolism gene expression during spaceflight (Figures 4B and 4C). Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression also correlated with muscle autophagy, DNA repair, and translation process gene expression (Figures 5A–5C). Furthermore, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression (Figure 5D). Indeed, liver lipid metabolism and muscle atrophy genes formed a gene correlation network (Figure 5E). Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Serpina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1 formed a gene cluster strongly correlating with muscle gene expression (Figure 5F). Figure 4.

Muscle atrophy has been shown to occur in both weightlessness and bed rest studies. The decreased gravity load on the locomotive apparatus is often presented as the main driver of muscle atrophy and bone loss. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism were impaired in both astronauts and mice during spaceflight. Da Silveira and colleagues previously showed that a mitochondrial stress is a central hub for spaceflight-induced physiological changes (da Silveira et al., 2020). Mitochondria are complex organelles inside the cell where fundamental biomolecules are metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and coupled to energy production by the electron transport chain. Thus, mitochondria play a key role in metabolism and energy management. Here, we found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome in mice during spaceflight. Impaired lipid metabolism and fatty acid accumulation is associated with muscle atrophy. Of note, butanoate and propanoate metabolism were the most affected in the two organs analyzed, decreased in the liver while increased in the muscle. Butanoate and propanoate, also known as butyrate and propionate, are short chain fatty acids produced in the intestinal lumen by bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates, especially resistant starch, dietary fiber, and to a lesser extent proteins. Resistant starch is found in some grains, beans, and legumes. The gut microbiome is disturbed during spaceflight; astronauts’ gut microbiome showed an alteration in the composition pattern of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, the main butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gut (Venegas et al., 2019), with the presence of different genus increasing or decreasing during spaceflight but also showing a consistent decrease in bacteria from the taxa Pseudobutyrivibrio and Akkermansia, also known to produce butyrate in the intestine (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Voorhies et al., 2019; Venegas et al., 2019). Microbiome analysis from RR1 mice showed an overall increase of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, but the authors linked that to similar alterations that occur with aging (Jiang et al., 2019). This Firmicute increase in older mice is seen as a sign of dysbiosis and this alteration was shown to be followed by a ∼70% decrease in butyrate levels (Spychala et al., 2018). The upregulation of butyrate and propionate pathways in the muscle can reflect a possible need for these fatty acids and derivatives. In this context, dietary changes could represent a feasible countermeasure to spaceflight-induced physiological changes. The TCA cycle activity and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ratio are decreased in muscle during spaceflight suggesting disturbed energy production. Consistently, we found that spaceflight induced a hyperglycemic response in mouse muscle involving the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathways downstream of the insulin receptor (HIF, ErbB, AMPK, FoxO, and PI3K-Akt). This signaling response mostly affected glucose import gene expression. In addition, high energy demand processes such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation gene expression were decreased in inflight mice quadriceps, suggesting a shift toward an energy-saving mode in the muscle during spaceflight. The muscle is a high energy demand organ. Since the muscle represent up to 50% of the total body mass, its metabolism radically affects glucose availability in the body. Consequently, glucose sparing and energy saving by the muscle in detrimental conditions can compensate for the energy needs of other such as the brain that requires stable and continuous glucose supply. Oxidative stress and DNA damage overload, that can impair mitochondrial function and the metabolism, are examples of detrimental conditions occurring during spaceflight (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Also, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to muscle atrophy (Abrigo et al., 2019). The HIF-1 signaling enriched pathways suggest that oxidative stress occurred in RR1 inflight mice. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction promote insulin resistance and diabetes (Bashan et al., 2009; Di Meo et al., 2017; Sivitz and Yorek, 2010). Our results, in line with previous space studies, suggest an insulin resistance phenotype. Meanwhile, insulin resistance has been proposed as an evolutionary mechanism to spare glucose that can benefit survival in various states such as starvation, immune activation growth, and cancer (Soeters and Soeters, 2012). Insulin resistance and diabetes are often associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism and liver diseases. Fatty acids inhibit the insulin signaling pathways by directly interfering in the signaling through diacylglycerol or by overloading the TCA with the precursor acetyl CoA (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). During spaceflight, liver lipid metabolic gene expression correlated with muscle glucose import gene expression in RR1 mice. Insulin resistance, NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cirrhosis are associated with muscle atrophy and their severity correlates positively (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). During a stress starvation, fatty acids together with ketone bodies become the primary source of energy for cells while peripheral organs such as the muscle, but also the skin and bones, provide amino acids taken up by central organs such as the liver, the spleen, immune cells, and healing tissues, ultimately leading to protein loss (Soeters and Soeters, 2012). During a spaceflight, all cells are exposed to space stressors such as radiation, endocrine system perturbation induced by altered circadian rhythm or psychological issues, and microgravity, all promoting oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, it has been shown that spaceflight induces a shift from slow aerobic and highly enriched mitochondria muscle fibers (“slow fiber”, “type I”) toward fast anaerobic and fast low-enriched mitochondria muscle fiber (“fast fiber”, “type II”) (Gambara et al., 2017b; Ulanova et al., 2015). Mitochondria are the major source of reactive oxygen species. As such, spaceflight-induced fiber shift and mitochondrial dysfunction can be seen as a biological mechanism to decrease mitochondrial activity and mitigate oxidative stress. If mitochondrial stress is a central biological hub during spaceflight, and if the mitochondria are the master organelle of metabolism regulation and energy management, we can then expect a general metabolic shift in the body toward a starvation-like phenotype that promotes decreased mitochondrial activity, decreased metabolism and protein loss in the muscle, and increased lipid metabolism in the liver, to the benefit of all body cells during spaceflight. Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle DNA repair, autophagy, translation, and finally muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression. Butanoate and propanoate metabolism-related genes were still among the one with the strongest correlation. Interestingly, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation improve mitochondrial function, fat accumulation, insulin resistance, diabetes, and liver diseases (Gao et al., 2009; Khan and Jena, 2016; Mollica et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018). Moreover, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation decreased muscle atrophy in various conditions (Chang et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2022; Walsh et al., 2015). Thus, butyrate supplementation or dietary modification to stimulate microbial production represents simple options to counteract muscle atrophy while preventing insulin resistance and lipid accumulation during spaceflight. Gambara et al. previously identified insulin- and glucose metabolism-linked transcripts as main DEG in BION-M1 biosatellite flown mice longissimus dorsi. In the present study, 17 and 13 differentially expressed genes in the liver and the muscle, respectively, were common to the 89 previously identified (Gambara et al., 2017a). Acas1a, Cpt2, Agt, Lcn2, and Prkcd, which were among the most DEG in Gambara’s study were not found significantly differentially expressed neither in the liver nor the quadriceps in the present study. The present study is based on the analyses of discriminating genes identified by the spls-DA performed with the mixOmics script. This method is designed to identify variations that are correlated, here gene expression in the liver and gene expression in the quadriceps. Also, 31 over the 9753, among which Agt and Cpt2, and 24 over the 3463 discriminating genes in the liver and the quadriceps, respectively, were in common with the 89 of the Gambara’s study. These differences may reflect the variability of gene expression between the different muscle types. Nonetheless, in line with the literature, both converge to an altered insulin transcriptome, thus highlighting a general adaptive response in muscle during spaceflight despite different molecular pathways. Moreover, the present study highlights the importance of discriminating genes over DEG in deciphering omic data. We found that discriminating genes are mainly linked to lipid metabolism in the liver and insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in the quadriceps. This means that lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver correlates with insulin signaling and glucose metabolism gene expression in the quadriceps in mice during spaceflight. We identified a cluster of lipid metabolism processes-related genes in the liver, including Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Serpina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1, correlating the most with glucose transport gene expression and potentially insulin resistance in the muscle. Among these genes, some are already described for their insulin sensitivity. Fabp2, Abcg5, and Abcg8 genes polymorphisms are associated with insulin sensitivity while Apom might protect against insulin resistance (Gylling et al., 2004; Kurano et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2020). Interestingly, Sestrin 1 (Sesn1), a well-known regulator of cell metabolism upregulated in longissimus dorsi of BION-M1 mice, was reported as a discriminating gene in both the liver and the quadriceps (Gambara et al., 2017a). Sestrin proteins are involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, autophagy, and insulin signaling (Lee et al., 2013). Sesn1 together with the present lipid metabolism-related gene cluster may thus account in insulin resistance research. The liver influence on quadriceps gene expression we identified needs to be carried out by organ communication mechanisms and we identified hepatokines as the most likely effector. Hepatokines are proteins secreted by the liver that can modulate signaling pathways associated with energy metabolism in the muscle and influence the development of chronic metabolic diseases (Seo et al., 2021). Important for our context, an increased blood concentration of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin increases insulin sensitivity, muscle hypertrophy, and mitochondrial function and diminishes fat mass in the muscle (Seo et al., 2021). Interestingly, increased concentration of Fetuin-A showed to have the inverse effect of the previously described hepatokines (Jensen-Cody and Potthoff, 2021; Seo et al., 2021). The levels of Fetuin-A increase after 60 day of bed rest, a ground model for microgravity effects, and we found in the literature a positive correlation between the Fetuin-A levels and the gene expression of Serpina6 and Rdh7, two genes we identified in our gene cluster (Herrmann et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2020). Interestingly, Fetuin-A, as well as FGF21 and ANGPTL4 genes are among the correlating genes in the liver of mice during spaceflight reported by the liver versus quadriceps sPLS-DA. We hypothesize that the gene expression correlation identified in our work likely involves an increased Fetuin-A production by the liver and a diminished production of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin. In conclusion, we described for the first time a strong correlation between liver lipid metabolism gene expression and the downregulation of hypoglycemic and energy demand process-related genes. In the light of current knowledge, our result suggests that a starvation-like phenotype could promote a metabolic shift toward an energy-saving mode, resource sparring, and lipid mobilization through a tight liver-muscle crosstalk contributing to muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Dietary changes based on starch supplementation and microbiome modulation represent an affordable and sustainable countermeasure to support our planetary goals and outer space settlement. Meanwhile, improving food habits and body energy monitoring is an overall human challenge both on Earth and beyond. Limitations of the study Sample size was only six mice to match sample availability in the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome. Future space studies should be designed to match individuals for any factors (organs, environmental parameters, psychological parameters, etc.). Here, we studied biological processes and pathways at a transcriptional level. Transcription regulation, post-transcriptional stabilization, and post-translational modifications impact cell response from gene expression to the final protein activity. In addition, transcriptomics provides a static view of one single moment in the cell. However, spatial repartition also impacts molecular dynamics, and a transcriptional ecosystem theory has been defined (Silveira and Bilodeau, 2018). To further understand the biological significance of the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in mice quadriceps, both functional analysis and multi-omics studies are needed. Additional factors account for inducing muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Circadian rhythm pathways genes are among those enriched in both the quadriceps and the liver in mice during spaceflight (Figure S1B, Related to Figures 1 and 2A), and circadian rhythm perturbation is associated with muscle atrophy (Choi et al., 2020). Astronauts experience continuous circadian rhythm stressors on board the ISS, with sixteen sunsets per day and sustained artificial light exposure as the only illumination source. However, assessing and deciphering circadian rhythm dynamics and correlation at molecular levels require proper protocol and experimental design (Zeitgeber time method) that should be implemented in future space biology research. We used the method implemented in mixOmics between the same molecular variables. This method is a powerful tool to compare any types of datasets. In this context, multiple variables comparisons, e.g., temperature variation inside the spacecrafts, food intake levels, dietary type, cognitive performances, psychological parameters, and allowing multiscale comparisons, will considerably widen our understanding of spaceflight’s impact on living organisms. The list of possible datasets combinations is infinite, as much as the number of studies which can raise from.STAR★Methods Key resources table REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Biological samples Mouse Liver NASA Rodent Research-1 Mission https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/13380 Mouse quadriceps muscle NASA Rodent Research-1 Mission https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/13380 Deposited data GLDS-103 NASA/GeneLab https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/ GLDS-168 NASA/GeneLab https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168/ Experimental models: Organisms/strains Mouse: C57BL/6 Jackson Labs C57BL/6J (Stock No: 000,664) Software and algorithms R Version 4.0.5 R Core Team (2021). https://www.r-project.org/, RRID: SCR_001905 DESeq2 Version Version 1.30.1 Love et al., 2014 https://github.com/mikelove/DESeq2, RRID: SCR_01568 GSEA Sergushichev (2016); Subramanian et al., 2005 https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp, RRID: SCR_003199 Cytoscape Shannon et al., 2003 https://cytoscape.org, RRID: SCR_003032 WebGestalt Liao et al.

The omics data of mice liver and muscle were obtained from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR1) protocol accessible on the NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository. Also, all animal procedures, ethics, and tissues harvesting, disposal, and experiments have been previously conducted and performed by external experimenters. Thus, animal procedures were performed according to the relevant guide-lines at each institution and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Full experimental procedures are available at: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/ and https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168. Briefly, the study was conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2014 on twelves female C57BL/6J mice, six in flight mice (M23, M24, M25, M26, M27, M28) referred to as the FLT group, and six ground controls mice (M33, M34, M35, M36, M37, M38), referred to as the GC group, for 37 days upon 12h day/night cycle, and fed with Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB)63. The research platform used for this experiment was NASA’s Rodent Research Hardware System also referred to as the Rodent Research Habitat System. Mice were sacrificed with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation on orbit on the ISS for the FLT group, and on the ground at the same time for the GC group. The entire carcasses of 10 mice were stored at −80C until processing. Two FLT mice were dissected on-board the ISS, and livers were isolated on-orbit and stored in the MELFI. Frozen FLT mice carcasses were then returned on Earth by the SpaceX-4 spacecraft and delivered to the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) for disposal. The ten frozen mice carcasses, GC and FLT, were dissected at room temperature, and harvested samples stored at −80C. RNA extraction from 20–30mg mice liver and muscle were realized at 4C using a lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and a beta-mercaptoethanol (1:100)/Buffer RLT solution, lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice. Samples were then homogenized for 20 s at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at room temperature to remove tissue debris. RNA from homogenates were further purified using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and eluted in DNase/RNase-free water. RNA concentrations were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA sequencing and library construction was performed on 1 μg of RNA having RIN values of 7 or above, using Illumina HiSeq 4000 kit and experimental protocol.Quantification and statistical analysis RNAseq data processing Raw FASTQ files were proceed using the “GeneLab RNAseq data processing protocol” as reported at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/ and https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168. On this work we used the mentioned protocol up to the step “Quantification data was imported to R (version 3.6.0) with tximport”.R Differential Expression (DE) analysis has been performed using the R studio software Version 1.2.5001 and the DESeq2 package version 1.30.1 that uses shrinkage estimation for dispersion and fold change. RSEM expected counts were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. Statistical significance of differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤0.05) were assessed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment procedure.Biological process, pathways, networks and clusters analysis For biological process, pathways, networks and clusters analysis, normalized count from RR1 mice quadriceps and liver were processed by the DEseq2 package and assessed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways Over Representation Analysis on the online Webgesalt platform, and for Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) and KEGG pathways GeneSets Enrichment by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. The Cytoscape software was used to build geneset networks from GSEA results. GSEAs were run with a ‘‘Flight vs Ground Control’’ comparison setting. The ranked list of genes was defined by the signal-to-noise metric, and the statistical significance were determined by 1000 permutations of the gene sets. Enrichment importance were sorted according to the enrichment score calculated by GSEA (Müller, 2019). Venn diagrams were generated on the online platform Venny available at: https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index2.0.2.html.mixOmics mixomics is a R package developed by Kim-anh Lê Cao, Sébastien Déjean and collaborators to visualize associations between paired omics datasets using correlation circles plots, heatmaps, and networks (Duruflé et al., 2021; González et al., 2012; Rohart et al., 2017). In the present study we used mixOmics package version 6.14.1. More information can be found on the online mixOmics platform available at: http://mixomics.org/.sPLS and sPLS-DA Transcriptome from 6 matched NASA RR1 mice, 3 ground controls (M36, M37, M38) and 3 inflight (M25, M26, M28), between the liver and the quadriceps were analyzed by sPLS (Partial Least Square) and sPLS-DA (sparse Partial Least Square-Differential Analysis). Correlation circle and correlation network were generated from sPLS-DA performed on 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of total normalized counts according to the process suggested in Duruflé et al. (2021). This method is an internal method to validate that the pattern of genes evaluated with the strongest importance for discrimination maintain across input reduction. These genes are referred to as to “discriminating genes” in this study. The correlation circle plot is a 1 sized radius were variable pools located between |0,5| and |1| have the strongest correlation. Correlation heatmaps are generated from sPLS analyses. Post 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA DEG are DEG still present in reported genes from 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA.

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily 56Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas 28Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage.

    "introduction": "Introduction With a growing interest in space travel1, it is pivotal to better understand how galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) impacts human health and how its detrimental effect can be minimized2. Ionizing radiation damages DNA structure by inducing double-stranded breaks, single-stranded breaks, base damage and changing epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation patterns3,4. During long exposure, these alterations are likely to increase the risk of cancer and degenerative diseases occurrence5. Besides hydrogen and helium, GCR consists of heavier atomic nuclei with high linear energy transfer (high-LET) values which are of great danger for human health. Recently, Kennedy et al.6 investigated an effect of high-LET 56Fe, 28Si ions on DNA methylation patterns in comparison to low-LET X-ray appearing in terrestrial radiation. The researchers found that the methylation status of 56Fe irradiated CpG sites can distinguish normal tissue from lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell lung carcinomas. Additionally, the researchers showed acute radiation-induced methylation changes which persisted over time with heritable imprint across epigenome. These findings where further investigated by Nwanaji-Enwerem et al.7 showing that 56Fe exposure was associated with accelerations in epiTOC2 epigenetic clock suggesting that DNA methylation may be a sensitive biomarker of high-LET 56Fe ion exposure. Chromatin packages the eukaryotic genome through DNA folding ranging from single nucleosome to entire chromosome8. Negatively charged DNA is wrapped around nucleosomes consisting of two copies of four positively charged histone proteins9. In addition to the core chromatin components, histone-modifying enzymes may alter chromatin compaction by changing its accessibility. The accessibility level is connected with chromatin modifications. In particular, H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) were used to profile ‘active’ and ‘repressed’ promoters respectively. Furthermore, histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) was used to profile heterochromatin loci and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) to profile enhancers10. There were a few reports suggesting that high-LET4 and ultraviolet11 induced DNA damage may be affected by chromatin structure. However, until now there are no studies investigating a DNA methylation pattern induced by low-/high-LET and spatial chromosomal conformation capture to explore the effects of chromatin physical properties on irradiation outcome. Importantly, with the recent development of high-throughput capture chromatin confirmation methods (Hi-C)12 and advanced algorithms to simulate the three-dimensional structure of nuclei such as Chrom3D, it is now possible to address the irradiation effects associated with chromatin conformation13. Recently, to access the multi-dimensional chromatin interactions researches were using Hi-C data for compartmentalization dividing chromatin into compartments associated with gene expression regulation14,15. For the purpose of our work, we used Hi-C data to create detailed nuclear division introducing five distinct radial nuclear layers. Additionally, we characterized each layer separately using various of epigenetic and transcriptomic features. Specifically, we explored an effect of high-LET and low-LET ions on methylation DNA patterns in human lung epithelial cells using a previously published dataset of Kennedy et al.6. Further, we tried to understand how the radiation penetrates cell nucleus and influences methylation levels in distinct layers of nucleus, as well as how spatial chromosomal conformation and epigenetic architecture influence DNA alterations triggered by external radiation. To achieve this, we used existing publicly available in-vitro and in-vivo data and performed the following analyses: (1) Hi-C analysis to check how three-dimensional structure of cell nucleus impacts response to irradiation. Additionally, we divided cell nucleus into five laterally distributed layers to identify potential irradiation effects associated with peripheral and internal positioning of chromatin and other epigenetic features; (2) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data to assess the impact of distinct histone modifications on DNA methylation changes and (3) microarrays, and RNA-seq data to assess the impact of gene expression on irradiation response. This research addresses the pressing need to understand the impact of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health, driven by the increasing interest in space travel. Our study builds on existing knowledge, investigating the influence of DNA structure on radiation outcomes. We used the concept of radial nuclear layers to explore how chromatin properties, including histone modifications and spatial conformation, affect DNA methylation alterations induced by low- and high-LET ions. Leveraging recent technological advances, such as high-throughput capture chromatin confirmation, we created a nuanced nuclear division with five nonoverlapping nuclear layers to better understand the spatial distribution of chromatin and its features, as well as its impact on radiation response. Our multiomics approach integrates Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and microarray/RNA-seq data, providing insights into the complex interplay between chromatin architecture, epigenetic modifications, gene expression and the cellular response to GCR. This research aims to contribute valuable information for developing strategies to minimize the adverse effects of cosmic radiation during space travel.",

    "results": "Results Ion-specific effects on DNA methylation profile 48 h after irradiation To analyze DNA methylation patterns caused by high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) participles, we used publicly available data set6. The schematic representation of performed analysis is shown in Fig. 1A. By applying differential methylation analysis on 48-h post irradiation samples, we identified 26,751, 31,818 and 24,807 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) for 56Fe 0.3 Gy versus 28Si 0.3 Gy; 56Fe 1 Gy versus 28Si 1 Gy; 56Fe 1 Gy versus X 1 Gy, pair comparisons, respectively (see methods for details). We did not identify any significant DMPs for 28Si 1 Gy versus X 1 Gy pair comparison (adjusted p-value > 0.05), suggesting their similar effect (Fig. 1B). Similarly, to Kennedy et al.6, we observed that regardless of the dose, 56Fe predominantly increases DNA methylation whereas X ray decrease DNA methylation levels when compared to control. However, contrary to primary article where no effect of 28Si was observed, we discovered its activity in decreasing DNA methylation levels (Fig. 1C,D, S1B,C). It could happen due to different hypothesis testing in the original article, where authors were focused on DNA methylation changes caused by an increase in the dose of the same radiation. The opposite methylation effect between 56Fe and 28Si or X-rays was observed nearly among all identified DMPs for all comparisons (Fig. 1E,F, S1D). The distribution of differentially methylated probes indicates a stochastic process To further identify the distinct effect of each particle on DNA methylation patterns, in addition, to direction of methylation change (Fig. 1E,F, S1D) we divided DMPs into distinct subgroups, based on post-exposure and control M value (hypomethylation [M Value < 0] or hypermethylation [M Value > 0]; see methods for details). Specifically, we showed that 56Fe was able to induce, both hypermethylation of primarily hypomethylated sites and hypomethylation of primarily hypermethylated sites whereas 28Si induced only the latter (Fig. S1E,F). Accordingly, X-ray induces hypomethylation of previously hypermethylated sites, however, it does have a minor effect on hypomethylated sites inducing its hypermethylation. In summary, when comparing post-radiation to control DNA methylation levels, 56Fe affects hypomethylated and hypermethylated sites whereas 28Si is more likely to affect hypomethylated sites at control. Further, to check whether DNA methylation changes occur in a close relationship to each other and around the radiation beam, we built differentially methylation regions (DMRs) from previously identified paired DMPs (Fig. S1G). In total, we identified 3805, 4863 and 3631 DMRs for 56Fe 0.3 Gy versus 28Si 0.3 Gy; 56Fe 1 Gy versus 28Si 1 Gy; 56Fe 1 Gy versus X 1 Gy, pair comparisons, respectively. Interestingly, only 41%, 47% and 43% of DMPs built DMRs, respectively, leaving more than 50% of identified DMPs outside of DMRs (Fig. S1H). As such, we applied a larger base pair limit for DMRs building, however, did not observe a relevant change in amount of DMRs (Fig. S1I). Finally, by permutating methylation probe names from primary dataset, we simulated differential DNA methylation analysis in one thousand unique datasets. In all replicates, we observed lower frequencies of DMPs building DMRs when compared to primarily established comparisons (p < 0.001). This observation suggested that the distribution of radiation induced DNA methylation changes seems to be spread across the whole genome rather than being grouped in DMRs. Assignment of differentially methylated probes (DMPs) to genomic location Following previous results, to investigate specific genomic locations of DMPs, we looked at the relation to CpG islands localized in the close relationship of gene promoters18. We found that, regardless of radiation type and dose, grouped DMPs were more likely located inside promoter regions (Fig. 1G; p < 0.001 for all particles and doses; data not shown). It suggests that proximal regulatory regions of human genome are more prone to accumulate radiation induced DNA methylation changes. Additionally, the enrichment in upstream and downstream locations for DMPs outside of DMRs showed that when looking only at DMRs, we would lose an important regulatory information. Next, we checked if this observation could be due to a higher accumulation of CpG rich regions in the corresponding promoters or higher accumulation of primary probes in these locations. However, when comparing fractions (ratio of a component to the total amount) of post-exposure samples to control, we observed distinct patterns, especially in terms of CpG islands and regulatory opensea regions (Fig. 1H,I; p < 0.001 for all comparisons)37. Finally, we observed, that regardless of radiation dose, DMPs inside DMRs were more likely to be located inside CpG islands which are known to be positioned in close relationship of promoters (Fig. S1J–L)38,39. Additionally, when taking into consideration the direction of methylation change, CpG islands were more prevalent among sites which methylation increased after 56Fe or decreased after 28Si and X exposure (Fig. S1J–L). In summary, these observations indicate that 56Fe primary increases DNA methylation, 28Si decreases DNA methylation whereas X-rays induce minor effect in both directions. Moreover, radiation induced DMPs are primary located around active promoter regions and opensea regulatory regions. Radial chromosomal distribution in nucleus affects changes in DNA methylation profiles after irradiation Further, we investigated whether DNA methylation changes are conditioned by the epigenetic state and chromatin physical properties. We studied the induced DNA methylation changes in the context of 3D chromatin structure and histone modification profiles in untreated cells. We overlapped Hi-C compartment coordinates of IMR-90 human lung fibroblast cell line provided by Rao et al.12 with baseline probes analyzed previously6. We identified 430,748 probes to which we assigned a compartment Hi-C score which determines the positioning of certain probes in cell nucleus. The greater the score is, the deeper into nucleus a certain probe should be located (Fig. 2A)40. As such, we drew an approximate radial positioning of each chromosome in the nucleus and later investigated its impact on the frequency of DNA methylation sites (Fig. S2A). First, we normalized the number of DMPs on each chromosome with regard to the total number of probes on each chromosome used in the experiment. This way corrected for bias associated with the design of the microarray. The highest DMPs prevalence was observed on chromosomes 4, 13, 10 for 56Fe (Fig. 2B; Fig. S2B–D); 4, 2, 18, 14 for 28Si (Fig. S2E,F) and 13, 18, 15 for X (Fig. S2G). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Radial nucleus architecture and DNA methylation patterns. (A) The schematic representation of nucleus division based on the high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technique score. Layers boundaries were assigned quantile 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% values of Hi-C score of all raw probes used in the primary experiment. Hence, each layer contains the same amount of DNA, but can vary in width. (B) Chromosome positioning of non-irradiated primary probes among five nucleus layers (dashed red lines). Chromosomes 13, 10 and 4 have the highest 48-h DMPs frequency after Fe 1 Gy exposure. Y axis represents a Hi-C score for individual DMP.

Top three chromosomes with the highest overall DMPs frequency are bolded. Boxplots represent data for whole genome. (E) Absolute mean DNA methylation change in DMPs versus control among nucleus layers.To investigate whether the observed DMP frequencies depend on the 3D chromatin structure we divided the nucleus into five distinct layers as shown on Fig. 2B and S2A (see methods for details). Nucleus layers were created based on the even distribution of all DNA methylation probes in order to include the same amount of DNA within each layer. On the graph, we showed the frequency percentage of all DMPs in each layer separately to visualize where DMPs are the most prevalent. Accordingly, for each radiation type we observed the highest prevalence (% of DMPs in a layer/all DMPs) of DMPs among outer “L1” and “L2” layers with a significant decrease towards the depth of nucleus (p = 0.027; Fig. 2C, S2H). As such, we looked at the chromosomal frequencies in each layer separately. We discovered that chromosomes with the highest DMPs frequency are cumulating DNA methylation sites at the “L2”–“L3” junction and among the following layers (Fig. 2D; S2I–M). Thus, in the outer “L1” layer the effect of radiation seemed to be limited and resulting in a more spread distribution of DMPs. The corresponding chromosomal frequencies patterns were observed in deeper layers of the nucleus starting at “L2”–“L3” junction. Accordingly, we looked at the absolute methylation change across distinct layers. We discovered the highest DNA methylation change being present around the middle “L3” layer (Fig. 2E; S2N). Interestingly, the methylation change induced by 56Fe persisted until the “L5” having the lowest value in “L1” whereas the effect of 28Si and—ray seemed to be limited having the lowest change in “L5”. In summary, these observations could suggest that outer layers of nucleus absorb the highest radiation dose, thus having more differently methylated sites, however, they are randomly distributed across all chromosomes without a particular pattern. Interestingly, despite high frequency of DMPs in outer layers, the average methylation change peaks in the middle “L3” layer which may suggest other factors limiting the effect of GCR radiation in outer layers of nucleus. Irradiation induced DNA methylation patterns are associated with histone modification Next, we explored how chromatin modifications predispose cells to particular irradiation response, and we looked at the distribution of histone modifications. Specifically, we examined four histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3) which are known to have a major role in chromatin organization. We used enrichment profiles published by Stolzenburg et al.26 and Mazumdar et al. 27 (see methods for details). When overlapped filtered histone modifications peaks with primary probes, euchromatin-associated histone modifications were more frequent than heterochromatin-associated ones, however, it may be due to distinct primary datasets used in this study (Fig. 3A). Comparing between nucleus layers, we observed the enrichment of H3K9me3 among external layers with a decreasing towards inner nucleus layers. That distribution was contrary to other histone modifications which level did not depend on the layer (H3K4me3, H3K27me3) or increased (H3K27ac; Fig. 3B). Further, we examined the probability of DMP occurrence ([DMP in regulatory regions/all DMP]/[regulatory regions in layers/all regulatory regions]) in distinct histone marks among nucleus layers. Interestingly, regardless of radiation type and dose, we found a decreasing trend for H3K27ac (p < 0.05), an increasing one for H3K9me3 (p < 0.05) and no trend for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (p > 0.05; Fig. 3C; data shown for 56Fe 1 Gy). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Radial nucleus architecture of histone modifications. (A) The frequency of distinct histone modifications among non-irradiated primary probes. (B) The distribution of distinct histone modifications among non-irradiated primary probes within nucleus radial layers. (C) The probability of DMP overlapping distinct histone modification peak in each nucleus layer. (D–F) Absolute mean DNA methylation change versus control among histone modification peaks overlapped with DMPs within nucleus layers. (G) Absolute mean DNA methylation change versus control among histone modification associated regulatory regions overlapped with DMPs within nucleus layers.Looking at the spatial baseline average methylation level inside histone modifications picks, heterochromatin-associated marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) had higher baseline methylation levels than euchromatin-associated marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me3; Fig. S4A). Specifically, as for H3K27ac and H3K4me3, the methylation level was rather stable (p = 0.22; p = 0.087, respectively) across distinct nucleus layers whereas among H3K9me3, H3K27me3 a methylation increase was observed towards the inner layers (p = 0.027). Next, we checked for absolute methylation changes (vs. control) induced by irradiation in epigenetic modifications. We found that, regardless of radiation type and dose, the average absolute methylation change in each mark was rather stable, without a particular trend observed between nucleus layers (p > 0.05; Fig. 3D–F; S3B–D). However, when compared the mean absolute methylation change to all DMPs, we discovered that the methylation change was higher in all histone marks, regardless of radiation type and dose (except Si 0.3 Gy; Fig. 3D–F; S3B–D). Furthermore, to investigate the DNA methylation patterns in regulatory elements, we overlapped transcription starting sites (TSS) regions with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks using GENCODE annotation41. Additionally, we examined H3K27ac associated gene enhancers outside of TSS and gene bodies. In total, we included five distinct groups of regions in the analysis: (1) H3K4me3-associated promoters; (2) H3K27ac-associated promoters; (3) H3K4me3- and H3K27ac-associated promoters; (4) no histone associated promoters; (5) H3K27ac-associated enhancers. As expected, when looking at the spatial frequency of these regions, we observed higher prevalence of promoters and enhancers in deeper layers of nucleus which was contrary to the no histone associated regions (Fig. S3E). Next, we checked for spatial frequencies of primary probes overlapping them with previously established regions. We observed a strong increasing trend towards inner parts of nucleus for all regulatory regions (p < 0.05; Fig. S3F). Moreover, the baseline methylation levels of histone associated regulatory regions overlapped with primary probes were much lower than those not associated with any histone mark (Fig. S3G). Next, we checked for absolute methylation change in DMPs which were overlapping these regions. Interestingly, the highest observed methylation change was observed in outer nucleus layers among H3K4me3 and/or H3K27ac associated regions (Fig. 3G; S3H–L). Specifically, for most prevalent 56Fe irradiated samples the highest methylation change was observed in “L1” and “L2” layers in both H3K4me3 and H3K27ac associated promoters (Fig. 3G). More importantly, when comparing an absolute mean methylation change between regulatory regions and previously established samples (Fig. 3D–F), we discovered that in general methylation change was higher in histone mark associated sites, especially among regulatory regions. In summary, these findings show that promoters and enhancers are prone to GCR induced DNA methylation changes. Moreover, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks are associated with the highest DNA methylation change, suggesting its vulnerability to irradiation. To summarize, genomic regions prevalent with distinct histone marks, especially regulatory regions are associated with higher methylation changes. Interestingly, the highest changes are observed in outer layers of nucleus. Hence, all these results may highlight the role of histone modifications in response to external radiation, for instance, by protecting inner euchromatin-associated regions. On the other hand, regulatory regions associated with histone marks are more prone to accumulate radiation associated damage with regard to DNA methylation. Chronic (> 48 h) DNA methylation patterns of various radiation types in in-vitro and in vivo models Finally, to further explore the DNA methylation changes induced by the selected irradiation, we looked at the methylation change over time. We discovered that regardless of the dose and the direction of methylation change 56Fe induces persistent DNA methylation changes (Fig. 4A; S4A). On the other side, 28Si and X induce DNA methylation changes which are not durable, hence the post-exposure methylation level steadily comes back towards the baseline level (Fig. 4B; S4A). To check if similar effect is observed on functional level, we used gene expression data of the NASA’s OSDR (see methods for details). We examined heart, breast, liver, retina and blood tissues using in-vivo and RNA-sequencing and microarrays data of whole-body irradiated mice and blood tissue RNA-sequencing of six JAXA astronauts (Fig. 4C). Specifically, we did not juxtapose DNA methylation results, as we looked only at the gene expression patterns of differentially expressed genes over time. Hence, we wanted to verify if the previously observed radiation effect is also observed on the transcriptomic level. Figure 4.

(F) The absolute mean gene expression changes among nucleus layers for differentially expressed genes. (G,H) The average change of change expression in astronauts’ blood over time among up-regulated and down-regulated genes.Accordingly, we observed corresponding long-term gene expression patterns in mice liver tissue, irradiated with 56Fe 0.2 Gy particles. For both the sets up-regulated and down-regulated genes the change of average gene expression level was the highest a month after irradiation and later stabilized, and persisted up to 12 months (p = 0.05, p = 0.01, respectively; Fig. 4D,E). On the other side, in microarrays data, we observed corresponding short-term gene expression patterns in mice heart tissue, irradiated with 56Fe 0.15 Gy particles (p = 0.33 and p = 0.17, respectively; Fig. S4B-C). We also examined, long-term gene expression patterns in mice breast tissue, irradiated with 28Si 0.3 Gy particles and observed corresponding, however not significant, pattern to our in vitro analysis. Hence, fluctuating towards baseline level in the last point of observation (Fig. S4D,E). Finally, to check if observed expression patterns are specific for each radiation type, we investigated the chronic effect of protons, gamma rays, 137Cs and 57Co, exposing distinct gene expression patterns over time (Fig. S4F–L; see method for details). Lastly, we checked spatial and long-term gene expression patterns in blood tissue of JAXA astronauts (see methods for details). Specifically, among nucleus layers we checked if we observe a corresponding pattern in gene expression to DNA methylation change right after astronauts were sent to space and exposed to GCR and if it persists during and after their mission in space. Importantly, we observed that the change of gene expression peaks in the middle “L3” nucleus layer for differentially expressed and all identified genes (Fig. 4F; S4M, respectively), which stands in line with previous DNA methylation observations (Fig. 2E). Moreover, we discovered corresponding long-term persistence of gene expression change for up-regulated (p = 0.02) and down-regulated genes (p = 0.07; Fig. 4G,H). Specifically, we observed increase or decrease of gene expression right after launch and during the mission, as well as effect persistence up to 3–4 months (the last timepoint) after earth landing. In summary, despite variety of timepoints used when compared to DNA methylation study, we saw corresponding trends in gene expression patterns in several mice tissues and astronauts’ blood tissue. Hence, we observed a gene expression change right after irradiation exposure, however, the epigenome imprint was persistent for 56Fe or space exposure when compared with 28Si. As such, we confirmed the previous DNA methylation findings on functional level. Lastly, we checked for DNA methylation change persistence over time in histone modification peaks, promoters and enhancers regions overlapped with DMPs and observed corresponding results to previously established patterns (data not shown).",
    "discussion": "Discussion This is the first study exposing influence of chromatin physical properties on DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET and low-LET radiation. Our work shows that each of investigated radiation types induce distinct DNA methylation patterns. Additionally, we exposed the major role of spatial chromosomal positioning and distribution of histone modifications which have undeniable influence on the effect of cosmic radiation on human cells. Finally, we validated our in vitro observations regarding chronic effect of high-LET particles, with in vivo models and astronauts’ data. As such, we supported our primary analysis with gene expression data of radiation exposed mice tissues including liver, heart, mammary gland, blood and retina as well as blood tissue from six JAXA astronauts’. Our findings partially support those reported in the original publication by Kennedy et al.6. Similarly, we showed that each of primarily investigated radiation types induce a unique imprint on the epigenome. However, we observed that methylation changes which occur early, persist over time only when caused by 56Fe particle. Thus, after 28Si and X-rays’ exposure, we found a methylation peak at the beginning and a decrease towards baseline level over time. In line to previous observations a vast majority of identified methylation sites was located in and around CpG islands, and active genic regions (promoters, enhancers). The differences in results when compared to original publication could be of a various reason6. Specifically, we focused on rigorously chosen differentially methylated sites applying several thresholds of significance. To asses this, we established pairs to compare particles between each other. On the other side, in primary publication authors were focused on global DNA methylation status including all probes without DNA methylation change thresholds and later on assessing differences only by comparison of doses within the individual particle. To support our approach, we validated the perseverance of epigenome imprints associated with distinct radiation exposure. To do this, we looked at gene expression of various mice tissues irradiated with different radiation types as well as JAXA astronauts data from blood liquid biopsies21,30–34. Collectively, our analysis confirmed that each of investigated radiation type induces a unique chronic gene expression pattern. Importantly, we found corresponding changes between DNA methylation and gene expression levels in terms of GCR particles as well as astronauts’ exposure to space radiation. Thus, however to properly examine the persistence of these patterns, multiple timepoints with longer period of observation would be preferred. Additionally, all experiments should be performed in the same research model to minimize potential heterogeneity among even similar cell lines or more advanced models. Interestingly, in recent years other researchers investigated both DNA methylome and transcriptome changes in several tissues exposed to spaceflight. In retinas of mice flown to space for 37-days period, Chen et al. found a large number of differentially methylated (DM) genes and fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Majority of DM sites were hypomethylated and located in genes and promoters. The functional analysis of these data revealed that spaceflight had a major effect on extracellular matrix/cell junction and cell proliferation/apoptosis signaling42. On the other side, Acharya et al. demonstrated increased DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus and ultimately impaired cognitive condition of irradiated mice which could be mitigated by 5-iodotubercidin administration43. Finally, in NASA Twins Study, despite observing minor genome-wide DNA methylation changes, the gene enrichment analysis showed that during flight genes involved in the response to platelet-derived growth factor and T cell differentiation, and activation pathways in both CD4 and CF8 cells were enriched. Specifically, for CD4 cells genes involved in platelet aggregation, regulation of ossification, and cellular response to UV-B were enriched, whereas for CD8 cells genes involved in somatostatin signaling pathway and positive regulation of superoxide anion generation were enriched44. To further investigate the methylation data, our analyses focused on the impact of spatial chromosomal positioning on DNA methylation patterns or radiation properties and in vivo validation of induced epigenome imprints45. At first, based on spatial chromosome distribution, we tried to establish features associated with DMPs prevalence. At the beginning, we associated the higher frequency with outer positioning of chromosomal fragments in “L1” layer and its absence in “L5” layer. Hence, suggesting that when penetrating the nucleus, externally exposed DNA fragments are at the highest exposure to radiation beams which effect decreases with nucleus depth4. This observation however seemed promising, was not persistent for the whole genome, proposing the influence of other unknown factors. Recently, Garcia-Nieto et al.11, demonstrated that epigenome architecture in ultra violet (UV) irradiated non-malignant lung fibroblasts cells plays a role of a barrier to cancer development by regulation of carcinogen susceptibility. These findings highlighted the role of H3K9me3 modification in accumulating UV-induced DNA lesions in external heterochromatin regions, thus protecting inner localized euchromatin. As such, we looked at the spatial distribution of epigenetic histone modifications which may also play a role in the context of GCR11,46. Likewise, we observed the highest prevalence of DMPs in the periphery with the highest DNA methylation changes among active promoter and enhancers regions marked with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications. However, when looking at all identified DMPs the highest methylation change was observed around the middle layer, right after the euchromatin-associated histone marks overcame the heterochromatin-associated H3K9me3 histone mark. Additionally, from that point, we started to observe a similar DMP chromosomal frequency pattern, suggesting the higher radiation vulnerability to occur differentially methylated sites as well as higher DNA methylation changes, especially among internally located promoters and enhancers sites. Specifically, this could be associated with higher chromatin accessibility. As previously mentioned, at first, we hypothesized that nucleus periphery absorbs the highest radiation dose. However, despite the highest frequency of DMPs observed, the highest DNA methylation change and corresponding chromosomal frequencies were observed around the middle layer of the nucleus. It could potentially suggest the occurrence of Bragg peak which depicts the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter and after which the after which particles immediately come to rest47. It might be true especially for 28Si and X-rays, since we observed a higher DNA methylation change drop in inner layers for these two types of radiation. However, promising in principle X-rays penetrate the whole nucleus and lose energy in a random manner along the photon path, and not having Bragg peak present due to presence of uncharged photons in X rays. Additionally, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), labeled as gH2AX foci, are distributed “randomly,” without accumulation at the nuclear periphery, but more prevalent in nuclear compartments with low chromatin density48,49. Although, never investigated for 56Fe and 28Si particles, based on similar experiments performed using 1 Gy for 11B and 1.2 Gy for 20Ne (LET 150 keV/µm and 171 keV/µm, respectively; Energy beam 8 MeV/n and 47 MeV/n, respectively), we could suspect that all of investigated particles by Kennedy et al., should penetrate the whole nucleus width, therefore, it is unlikely to observe a Bragg peak in the middle and all other nuclear layers50. Hence, our results could be potentially associated with chromatin accessibility or specific properties of different radiation types used, rather than particular histone modifications occurrence. Previous reports shown that the accumulation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in peripheral heterochromatin does not accumulate more DSBs that euchromatin. Further, the exposure of cells to photonic radiation leads to a higher occurrence of DSBs in decondensed euchromatin. In contrast, exposure to high-LET results in more severe damage to dense heterochromatin. The distinct interaction of various types of radiation with different chromatin domains can be attributed to their diverse mechanisms of action. Photonic (gamma or X-ray) radiation primarily induces DNA damage indirectly through free radicals (ROS) generated by water radiolysis. Conversely, ions with high-LET directly damage DNA. Dense heterochromatin acts as a protective shield against ROS, yet it provides more DNA targets per volume for accelerated particles. Crucially, the extensive induction of DSBs by high-LET ions is not confined to peripheral heterochromatin but extends to the entire nucleus50–52. Hence, specific methylation changes may be generated as part of the systemic response of cells to irradiation. Indeed, post-irradiation epigenetic modifications have been shown not only to occur at sites of DSB damage, but also globally, throughout the cell nucleus53. Such a response can occur because chromatin represents a regulatory network and responses to various stresses as a system54,55. Hence, it seems more probable that these observations may be associated with chromatin accessibility and multidimensional architecture of these sequences rather than the epigenetic modification itself that makes H3K4me3 and H3K27ac-marked sequences more susceptible to radiation. Interestingly, Caron et al., found that most DMPs were located in chromosomes with low gene expression and located more peripherally compared to chromosomes with high gene expression. Thus, the intensity of DNA methylation changes correlates with both the low-expression (heterochromatic) state of chromatin and the peripheral location of chromatin. In our case, several of the few chromosomes with the highest abundance of DMPs are acrocentric chromosomes (12, 14, and 15), which also form a rim of heterochromatin around the whole width of the nucleus. It could indicate that heterochromatin architecture is a more important factor determining the intensity of DNA methylation changes after irradiation than nuclear location. Additionally, among heterochromatin layers, the highest DNA methylation changes were observed among TSS regions, which could mean that gene promoters within heterochromatin regions are highly affected by radiation56. In summary, it seems that epigenetic architecture plays a major role in cell response to irradiation. Specifically, it is architecture of heterochromatin associated domains with lower chromatin accessibility which could also explain the propagation of radiation laterally in nuclear layers, since DNA domains are more packed and in closer relationship to each other. Additionally, there were a few articles highlighting the role of histone marks in the context of GCR or microgravity. Gambacurta et al. discovered that H3K4me3, H3K27me2/3, H3K79me2/3 and H3K9me2/3 are engaged in cellular reprogramming that drives gene expression in blood-derived stem cells during osteoblastic differentiation induced by rapamycin under microgravity57. Furthermore, Singh et al. showed that in human T-lymphocyte cells, simulated-microgravity results in DNA hypomethylation58. However, gene expression analysis showed a decreased expression of histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1 which should have resulted in increased acetylation of histone H3 which in fact was decreased suggesting regulation of other HDAC. Finally, Koaykul et al. investigated neurogenic differentiation potential of passaged human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells under conventional and simulated microgravity59. Researchers discovered that conventional gravity conditions resulted in higher enrichment of H3K27me3 at neuronal promoters (NF-H and MAP2) when compared to simulated conditions. Contrary, there were no enrichment differences among H3K4me3. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic nuclear architecture. We showed that GCR particles induce unique acute and chronic DNA methylation and gene expression patterns. Moreover, for the first time, we highlighted the role of spatial distribution of key epigenetic modification. Specifically, we point out the major role of heterochromatin associated domains in DNA accessibility and radiation response. Finally, we showed which regions of human genome are the most vulnerable to GCR and thus associated with higher DNA methylation changes. To overcome the main limitation of the study resulting from analyzing similar, but not the same cell types (bronchial epithelial cells and bronchial fibroblasts), we run additional analysis using in vivo models and human tissues. Importantly, all key in vitro findings were successfully validated across more advanced models. Further research should focus on extensive analysis using various methods discussed in this manuscript. All this should be performed in the same cell type or organism to minimize potential bias which could occur in our analysis. Additionally, it should further investigate the role of various histone modifications which could potentially limit the negative effects of GCR and other radiation types. If successfully treated, it could contribute to development of epigenetically modified preventing strategies against radiation-induced cell damage.",

Copyright notice ID: 10789781 PMID: 38225252 Abstract Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily 56Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas 28Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage. Subject terms: Computational biology and bioinformatics, Molecular biology, Space physicsIntroduction With a growing interest in space travel1, it is pivotal to better understand how galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) impacts human health and how its detrimental effect can be minimized2. Ionizing radiation damages DNA structure by inducing double-stranded breaks, single-stranded breaks, base damage and changing epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation patterns3,4. During long exposure, these alterations are likely to increase the risk of cancer and degenerative diseases occurrence5. Besides hydrogen and helium, GCR consists of heavier atomic nuclei with high linear energy transfer (high-LET) values which are of great danger for human health. Recently, Kennedy et al.6 investigated an effect of high-LET 56Fe, 28Si ions on DNA methylation patterns in comparison to low-LET X-ray appearing in terrestrial radiation. The researchers found that the methylation status of 56Fe irradiated CpG sites can distinguish normal tissue from lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell lung carcinomas. Additionally, the researchers showed acute radiation-induced methylation changes which persisted over time with heritable imprint across epigenome. These findings where further investigated by Nwanaji-Enwerem et al.7 showing that 56Fe exposure was associated with accelerations in epiTOC2 epigenetic clock suggesting that DNA methylation may be a sensitive biomarker of high-LET 56Fe ion exposure. Chromatin packages the eukaryotic genome through DNA folding ranging from single nucleosome to entire chromosome8. Negatively charged DNA is wrapped around nucleosomes consisting of two copies of four positively charged histone proteins9. In addition to the core chromatin components, histone-modifying enzymes may alter chromatin compaction by changing its accessibility. The accessibility level is connected with chromatin modifications. In particular, H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) were used to profile ‘active’ and ‘repressed’ promoters respectively. Furthermore, histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) was used to profile heterochromatin loci and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) to profile enhancers10. There were a few reports suggesting that high-LET4 and ultraviolet11 induced DNA damage may be affected by chromatin structure. However, until now there are no studies investigating a DNA methylation pattern induced by low-/high-LET and spatial chromosomal conformation capture to explore the effects of chromatin physical properties on irradiation outcome. Importantly, with the recent development of high-throughput capture chromatin confirmation methods (Hi-C)12 and advanced algorithms to simulate the three-dimensional structure of nuclei such as Chrom3D, it is now possible to address the irradiation effects associated with chromatin conformation13. Recently, to access the multi-dimensional chromatin interactions researches were using Hi-C data for compartmentalization dividing chromatin into compartments associated with gene expression regulation14,15. For the purpose of our work, we used Hi-C data to create detailed nuclear division introducing five distinct radial nuclear layers. Additionally, we characterized each layer separately using various of epigenetic and transcriptomic features. Specifically, we explored an effect of high-LET and low-LET ions on methylation DNA patterns in human lung epithelial cells using a previously published dataset of Kennedy et al.6. Further, we tried to understand how the radiation penetrates cell nucleus and influences methylation levels in distinct layers of nucleus, as well as how spatial chromosomal conformation and epigenetic architecture influence DNA alterations triggered by external radiation. To achieve this, we used existing publicly available in-vitro and in-vivo data and performed the following analyses: (1) Hi-C analysis to check how three-dimensional structure of cell nucleus impacts response to irradiation. Additionally, we divided cell nucleus into five laterally distributed layers to identify potential irradiation effects associated with peripheral and internal positioning of chromatin and other epigenetic features; (2) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data to assess the impact of distinct histone modifications on DNA methylation changes and (3) microarrays, and RNA-seq data to assess the impact of gene expression on irradiation response. This research addresses the pressing need to understand the impact of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health, driven by the increasing interest in space travel. Our study builds on existing knowledge, investigating the influence of DNA structure on radiation outcomes. We used the concept of radial nuclear layers to explore how chromatin properties, including histone modifications and spatial conformation, affect DNA methylation alterations induced by low- and high-LET ions. Leveraging recent technological advances, such as high-throughput capture chromatin confirmation, we created a nuanced nuclear division with five nonoverlapping nuclear layers to better understand the spatial distribution of chromatin and its features, as well as its impact on radiation response. Our multiomics approach integrates Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and microarray/RNA-seq data, providing insights into the complex interplay between chromatin architecture, epigenetic modifications, gene expression and the cellular response to GCR. This research aims to contribute valuable information for developing strategies to minimize the adverse effects of cosmic radiation during space travel.Materials and methods Data description The study was conducted based on the publicly available  GEO Methylation450K BeadChip human bronchial epithelial cell dataset published by Kennedy et al. in 2018 (Series GSE108187 on “https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo”; The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GeneLab repository within the Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-317/) (Fig. 1A)6. The dataset was comprised of 102 samples of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3-KT) established by introducing mouse Cdk4 and hTERT into normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs)16. Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C and passaged (1:4) twice per week for three months. Three biological replicate cultures were irradiated independently with 0, 0.1, 0.3 or 1.0 Gy (Gy) 56Fe ions (LET = 170 keV/µm, Beam energy = 600 MeV/u) or with 0.0, 0.3, 1.0 Gy 28Si ions (LET = 70 keV/µm, Beam energy = 300 MeV/u) or 0.0, 1.0 Gy X-ray (LET = 2 keV/µm, Beam energy = 320 kV). Detailed information about the protocol can be found in the original publication6. Figure 1.

Shores are up to 2 kb from the CpG island; Shelves are from 2 to 4 kb from the CpG island; Opensea refers to isolated regions that do not have a specific designation. For the purpose of the analysis, we combined shores and shelves regions.Differential methylation analysis To investigate the overall influence of each radiation type on methylation DNA patterns we established three pair comparisons between 1) 56Fe 0.3 Gy versus 28Si 0.3 Gy; 2) 56Fe 1 Gy versus 28Si 1 Gy; 3) 56Fe 1 Gy versus X 1 Gy. Before the analysis, we transformed provided in the original publication Beta Values (ratio of the methylated probe intensity and the overall intensity) into M Values (log2 ratio of the intensities of methylated probe versus unmethylated probe)17. Afterwards, we performed a differential methylation analysis of 485,061 probes for established comparisons using dmpFinder from Minfi Bioconductor package18. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were filtered based on the q-value (q < 0.05) and the absolute average difference in M Value between compared samples (absolute average difference ≥ 0.58). Additionally, we applied a threshold of M Value change versus control (absolute average difference ≥ 0.58)17. Filtered DMPs were grouped into differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using dmrcate (lambda = 1000, C = 2) from DMRcate Bioconductor package19. The average methylation level for each DMR was calculated by overlapping filtered and ion specific DMPs. Due to the fact that culturing, irradiation, collection time (48-h) and DNA methylation levels were the same for all non-irradiated replicates, control DNA methylation levels were defined as average M Value of combined 56Fe, 28Si, X-ray non-irradiated samples (Fig. S1A). All analysis were performed in R Studio20. Mann–Kendall test was used for trend analysis with at least 4 data points. Chi-squared test was used to check differences between examined groups.Chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) To investigate the influence of chromosomal conformation on the effect of radiation we used the Hi-C data of IMR-90 human lung fibroblast cell line published by Rao et al. in 2014 (Series 4DNFIHM89EGL; 4DNFIMNT2VYL on “https://data.4dnucleome.org/”)12. Based on the provided Hi-C score, the nucleus was divided into five distinct layers named from the most outer “L1” to the deepest “L5”. The nucleus layers were created by overlapping all probes from the primary experiment6 with Hi-C data12. Layers boundaries were assigned quantile 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% values of Hi-C score. Hence, each layer contained the same amount of DNA. Accordingly, to investigate spatial gene expression patterns in Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronauts’ blood tissue21, we used conserved datasets of K562 and HAP-1 human lymphoblasts isolated from chronic myeloid leukemia patient and induced pluripotent stem cells (Series 4DNFI5WH9HQX; 4DNFIHM89EGL; 4DNFIOZT9QGF on “https://data.4dnucleome.org/”, respectively). Genes which were differentially expressed (see methods for details) in all datasets among distinct nucleus layers were further analyzed22–25.Histone modifications To investigate active (H3K27ac, H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) regions of chromatin we assigned different histone modifications to identified DMPs. We used the control datasets of primary human bronchial epithelial cells published by Stolzenburg et al. in 201726 and Mazumdar et al.27 in 2020 (Series GSE94726, GSE132807 on “https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo”, respectively). Each dataset was filtered to include peaks from 300 to 2000 base pairs long. Additionally, GSE132807 was filtered based on the alignment score from Bowtie2 (score > = 10) to asses high signal peaks28. For GSE94726 Series, alignment score of > 0 from Bowtie 1 was used29.Gene expression validation To validate the in vitro model, we used processed RNA-sequencing (Series OD-203, OSD-294, OSD-530) and microarray (Series OSD-80, OSD-109, OSD-117, OSD-159) gene expression data of whole-body irradiated (no direct information provided for OSD-294 and OSD-80) mice and JAXA astronauts provided with courtesy by the NASA GeneLab Data Repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects/). Specifically, a variety of mice tissues irradiated with distinct particles were examined including liver (56Fe 0.2 Gy)30, retina (57Co 0.04 Gy) 31, heart (56Fe 0.15 Gy; 1H 0.9 Gy)32, mammary gland (Si 0.3 Gy, sparsely ionizing gamma rays 1 Gy)33 and blood (137Cs 2.7 Gy)34. Additionally, we examined blood samples of six JAXA astronauts21. Due to the astronauts’ data provided only by mean expression values of all astronauts, there was only one replicate per distinct timepoint. Hence, to perform differential expression analysis, we established five distinct timepoints using two following timepoints as replicates [1) Control—L-112/56(± 14d) day – pre-flight; 2) L + 5(± 1d) day, and L + 30(± 7d) day—in-flight; 3) L + 60/120(± 14d) day or R-8(-14d/ + 0d) day—in-flight; 4) R + 3(± 1d) day, and R + 30(± 7d) day—post-flight; 5) R + 60/120(± 14d) day—post-flight; L-launch; R-rescue]. To establish research models for differential expression analysis, we built the EdgeR object using limma package35. We normalized RNA-sequencing data using weighted trimmed average of the log expression ratios, and performed differential analysis fitting a negative binomial generalized log-linear model. For microarrays, we used already normalized data with median intensity threshold of > = 336 and applied single-channel experimental design for several groups with Bonferroni adjustment. For further gene expression, we included genes with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 in the first time point, and used log fold-change (logFC) score in the following timepoints to assess the gene expression chronic change. Up- or down-regulated genes were defined as increase or decrease of logFC in the first timepoint versus control, respectively. For trend analysis, we performed an anova test on linear regression gradient.Results Ion-specific effects on DNA methylation profile 48 h after irradiation To analyze DNA methylation patterns caused by high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) participles, we used publicly available data set6. The schematic representation of performed analysis is shown in Fig. 1A. By applying differential methylation analysis on 48-h post irradiation samples, we identified 26,751, 31,818 and 24,807 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) for 56Fe 0.3 Gy versus 28Si 0.3 Gy; 56Fe 1 Gy versus 28Si 1 Gy; 56Fe 1 Gy versus X 1 Gy, pair comparisons, respectively (see methods for details). We did not identify any significant DMPs for 28Si 1 Gy versus X 1 Gy pair comparison (adjusted p-value > 0.05), suggesting their similar effect (Fig. 1B). Similarly, to Kennedy et al.6, we observed that regardless of the dose, 56Fe predominantly increases DNA methylation whereas X ray decrease DNA methylation levels when compared to control. However, contrary to primary article where no effect of 28Si was observed, we discovered its activity in decreasing DNA methylation levels (Fig. 1C,D, S1B,C). It could happen due to different hypothesis testing in the original article, where authors were focused on DNA methylation changes caused by an increase in the dose of the same radiation. The opposite methylation effect between 56Fe and 28Si or X-rays was observed nearly among all identified DMPs for all comparisons (Fig. 1E,F, S1D).The distribution of differentially methylated probes indicates a stochastic process To further identify the distinct effect of each particle on DNA methylation patterns, in addition, to direction of methylation change (Fig. 1E,F, S1D) we divided DMPs into distinct subgroups, based on post-exposure and control M value (hypomethylation [M Value < 0] or hypermethylation [M Value > 0]; see methods for details). Specifically, we showed that 56Fe was able to induce, both hypermethylation of primarily hypomethylated sites and hypomethylation of primarily hypermethylated sites whereas 28Si induced only the latter (Fig. S1E,F). Accordingly, X-ray induces hypomethylation of previously hypermethylated sites, however, it does have a minor effect on hypomethylated sites inducing its hypermethylation. In summary, when comparing post-radiation to control DNA methylation levels, 56Fe affects hypomethylated and hypermethylated sites whereas 28Si is more likely to affect hypomethylated sites at control. Further, to check whether DNA methylation changes occur in a close relationship to each other and around the radiation beam, we built differentially methylation regions (DMRs) from previously identified paired DMPs (Fig. S1G). In total, we identified 3805, 4863 and 3631 DMRs for 56Fe 0.3 Gy versus 28Si 0.3 Gy; 56Fe 1 Gy versus 28Si 1 Gy; 56Fe 1 Gy versus X 1 Gy, pair comparisons, respectively. Interestingly, only 41%, 47% and 43% of DMPs built DMRs, respectively, leaving more than 50% of identified DMPs outside of DMRs (Fig. S1H). As such, we applied a larger base pair limit for DMRs building, however, did not observe a relevant change in amount of DMRs (Fig. S1I). Finally, by permutating methylation probe names from primary dataset, we simulated differential DNA methylation analysis in one thousand unique datasets. In all replicates, we observed lower frequencies of DMPs building DMRs when compared to primarily established comparisons (p < 0.001). This observation suggested that the distribution of radiation induced DNA methylation changes seems to be spread across the whole genome rather than being grouped in DMRs.Assignment of differentially methylated probes (DMPs) to genomic location Following previous results, to investigate specific genomic locations of DMPs, we looked at the relation to CpG islands localized in the close relationship of gene promoters18. We found that, regardless of radiation type and dose, grouped DMPs were more likely located inside promoter regions (Fig. 1G; p < 0.001 for all particles and doses; data not shown). It suggests that proximal regulatory regions of human genome are more prone to accumulate radiation induced DNA methylation changes. Additionally, the enrichment in upstream and downstream locations for DMPs outside of DMRs showed that when looking only at DMRs, we would lose an important regulatory information. Next, we checked if this observation could be due to a higher accumulation of CpG rich regions in the corresponding promoters or higher accumulation of primary probes in these locations. However, when comparing fractions (ratio of a component to the total amount) of post-exposure samples to control, we observed distinct patterns, especially in terms of CpG islands and regulatory opensea regions (Fig. 1H,I; p < 0.001 for all comparisons)37. Finally, we observed, that regardless of radiation dose, DMPs inside DMRs were more likely to be located inside CpG islands which are known to be positioned in close relationship of promoters (Fig. S1J–L)38,39. Additionally, when taking into consideration the direction of methylation change, CpG islands were more prevalent among sites which methylation increased after 56Fe or decreased after 28Si and X exposure (Fig. S1J–L). In summary, these observations indicate that 56Fe primary increases DNA methylation, 28Si decreases DNA methylation whereas X-rays induce minor effect in both directions. Moreover, radiation induced DMPs are primary located around active promoter regions and opensea regulatory regions.Radial chromosomal distribution in nucleus affects changes in DNA methylation profiles after irradiation Further, we investigated whether DNA methylation changes are conditioned by the epigenetic state and chromatin physical properties. We studied the induced DNA methylation changes in the context of 3D chromatin structure and histone modification profiles in untreated cells. We overlapped Hi-C compartment coordinates of IMR-90 human lung fibroblast cell line provided by Rao et al.12 with baseline probes analyzed previously6. We identified 430,748 probes to which we assigned a compartment Hi-C score which determines the positioning of certain probes in cell nucleus. The greater the score is, the deeper into nucleus a certain probe should be located (Fig. 2A)40. As such, we drew an approximate radial positioning of each chromosome in the nucleus and later investigated its impact on the frequency of DNA methylation sites (Fig. S2A). First, we normalized the number of DMPs on each chromosome with regard to the total number of probes on each chromosome used in the experiment. This way corrected for bias associated with the design of the microarray. The highest DMPs prevalence was observed on chromosomes 4, 13, 10 for 56Fe (Fig. 2B; Fig. S2B–D); 4, 2, 18, 14 for 28Si (Fig. S2E,F) and 13, 18, 15 for X (Fig. S2G). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Radial nucleus architecture and DNA methylation patterns. (A) The schematic representation of nucleus division based on the high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technique score. Layers boundaries were assigned quantile 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% values of Hi-C score of all raw probes used in the primary experiment. Hence, each layer contains the same amount of DNA, but can vary in width. (B) Chromosome positioning of non-irradiated primary probes among five nucleus layers (dashed red lines). Chromosomes 13, 10 and 4 have the highest 48-h DMPs frequency after Fe 1 Gy exposure. Y axis represents a Hi-C score for individual DMP. (C) The frequency of DMPs and non-irradiated probes among nucleus layers. (D) Chromosomal frequencies of DMPs in each nucleus layer (data shown for Fe 1 Gy exposure). Top three chromosomes with the highest overall DMPs frequency are bolded. Boxplots represent data for whole genome. (E) Absolute mean DNA methylation change in DMPs versus control among nucleus layers.To investigate whether the observed DMP frequencies depend on the 3D chromatin structure we divided the nucleus into five distinct layers as shown on Fig. 2B and S2A (see methods for details). Nucleus layers were created based on the even distribution of all DNA methylation probes in order to include the same amount of DNA within each layer. On the graph, we showed the frequency percentage of all DMPs in each layer separately to visualize where DMPs are the most prevalent. Accordingly, for each radiation type we observed the highest prevalence (% of DMPs in a layer/all DMPs) of DMPs among outer “L1” and “L2” layers with a significant decrease towards the depth of nucleus (p = 0.027; Fig. 2C, S2H). As such, we looked at the chromosomal frequencies in each layer separately. We discovered that chromosomes with the highest DMPs frequency are cumulating DNA methylation sites at the “L2”–“L3” junction and among the following layers (Fig. 2D; S2I–M). Thus, in the outer “L1” layer the effect of radiation seemed to be limited and resulting in a more spread distribution of DMPs. The corresponding chromosomal frequencies patterns were observed in deeper layers of the nucleus starting at “L2”–“L3” junction. Accordingly, we looked at the absolute methylation change across distinct layers. We discovered the highest DNA methylation change being present around the middle “L3” layer (Fig. 2E; S2N). Interestingly, the methylation change induced by 56Fe persisted until the “L5” having the lowest value in “L1” whereas the effect of 28Si and—ray seemed to be limited having the lowest change in “L5”. In summary, these observations could suggest that outer layers of nucleus absorb the highest radiation dose, thus having more differently methylated sites, however, they are randomly distributed across all chromosomes without a particular pattern. Interestingly, despite high frequency of DMPs in outer layers, the average methylation change peaks in the middle “L3” layer which may suggest other factors limiting the effect of GCR radiation in outer layers of nucleus.Irradiation induced DNA methylation patterns are associated with histone modification Next, we explored how chromatin modifications predispose cells to particular irradiation response, and we looked at the distribution of histone modifications. Specifically, we examined four histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3) which are known to have a major role in chromatin organization. We used enrichment profiles published by Stolzenburg et al.26 and Mazumdar et al. 27 (see methods for details). When overlapped filtered histone modifications peaks with primary probes, euchromatin-associated histone modifications were more frequent than heterochromatin-associated ones, however, it may be due to distinct primary datasets used in this study (Fig. 3A). Comparing between nucleus layers, we observed the enrichment of H3K9me3 among external layers with a decreasing towards inner nucleus layers. That distribution was contrary to other histone modifications which level did not depend on the layer (H3K4me3, H3K27me3) or increased (H3K27ac; Fig. 3B). Further, we examined the probability of DMP occurrence ([DMP in regulatory regions/all DMP]/[regulatory regions in layers/all regulatory regions]) in distinct histone marks among nucleus layers. Interestingly, regardless of radiation type and dose, we found a decreasing trend for H3K27ac (p < 0.05), an increasing one for H3K9me3 (p < 0.05) and no trend for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (p > 0.05; Fig. 3C; data shown for 56Fe 1 Gy). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Radial nucleus architecture of histone modifications. (A) The frequency of distinct histone modifications among non-irradiated primary probes. (B) The distribution of distinct histone modifications among non-irradiated primary probes within nucleus radial layers. (C) The probability of DMP overlapping distinct histone modification peak in each nucleus layer. (D–F) Absolute mean DNA methylation change versus control among histone modification peaks overlapped with DMPs within nucleus layers. (G) Absolute mean DNA methylation change versus control among histone modification associated regulatory regions overlapped with DMPs within nucleus layers.Looking at the spatial baseline average methylation level inside histone modifications picks, heterochromatin-associated marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) had higher baseline methylation levels than euchromatin-associated marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me3; Fig. S4A). Specifically, as for H3K27ac and H3K4me3, the methylation level was rather stable (p = 0.22; p = 0.087, respectively) across distinct nucleus layers whereas among H3K9me3, H3K27me3 a methylation increase was observed towards the inner layers (p = 0.027). Next, we checked for absolute methylation changes (vs. control) induced by irradiation in epigenetic modifications. We found that, regardless of radiation type and dose, the average absolute methylation change in each mark was rather stable, without a particular trend observed between nucleus layers (p > 0.05; Fig. 3D–F; S3B–D). However, when compared the mean absolute methylation change to all DMPs, we discovered that the methylation change was higher in all histone marks, regardless of radiation type and dose (except Si 0.3 Gy; Fig. 3D–F; S3B–D). Furthermore, to investigate the DNA methylation patterns in regulatory elements, we overlapped transcription starting sites (TSS) regions with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks using GENCODE annotation41. Additionally, we examined H3K27ac associated gene enhancers outside of TSS and gene bodies. In total, we included five distinct groups of regions in the analysis: (1) H3K4me3-associated promoters; (2) H3K27ac-associated promoters; (3) H3K4me3- and H3K27ac-associated promoters; (4) no histone associated promoters; (5) H3K27ac-associated enhancers. As expected, when looking at the spatial frequency of these regions, we observed higher prevalence of promoters and enhancers in deeper layers of nucleus which was contrary to the no histone associated regions (Fig. S3E). Next, we checked for spatial frequencies of primary probes overlapping them with previously established regions. We observed a strong increasing trend towards inner parts of nucleus for all regulatory regions (p < 0.05; Fig. S3F). Moreover, the baseline methylation levels of histone associated regulatory regions overlapped with primary probes were much lower than those not associated with any histone mark (Fig. S3G). Next, we checked for absolute methylation change in DMPs which were overlapping these regions. Interestingly, the highest observed methylation change was observed in outer nucleus layers among H3K4me3 and/or H3K27ac associated regions (Fig. 3G; S3H–L). Specifically, for most prevalent 56Fe irradiated samples the highest methylation change was observed in “L1” and “L2” layers in both H3K4me3 and H3K27ac associated promoters (Fig. 3G). More importantly, when comparing an absolute mean methylation change between regulatory regions and previously established samples (Fig. 3D–F), we discovered that in general methylation change was higher in histone mark associated sites, especially among regulatory regions. In summary, these findings show that promoters and enhancers are prone to GCR induced DNA methylation changes. Moreover, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks are associated with the highest DNA methylation change, suggesting its vulnerability to irradiation. To summarize, genomic regions prevalent with distinct histone marks, especially regulatory regions are associated with higher methylation changes. Interestingly, the highest changes are observed in outer layers of nucleus. Hence, all these results may highlight the role of histone modifications in response to external radiation, for instance, by protecting inner euchromatin-associated regions. On the other hand, regulatory regions associated with histone marks are more prone to accumulate radiation associated damage with regard to DNA methylation.Chronic (> 48 h) DNA methylation patterns of various radiation types in in-vitro and in vivo models Finally, to further explore the DNA methylation changes induced by the selected irradiation, we looked at the methylation change over time. We discovered that regardless of the dose and the direction of methylation change 56Fe induces persistent DNA methylation changes (Fig. 4A; S4A). On the other side, 28Si and X induce DNA methylation changes which are not durable, hence the post-exposure methylation level steadily comes back towards the baseline level (Fig. 4B; S4A). To check if similar effect is observed on functional level, we used gene expression data of the NASA’s OSDR (see methods for details). We examined heart, breast, liver, retina and blood tissues using in-vivo and RNA-sequencing and microarrays data of whole-body irradiated mice and blood tissue RNA-sequencing of six JAXA astronauts (Fig. 4C). Specifically, we did not juxtapose DNA methylation results, as we looked only at the gene expression patterns of differentially expressed genes over time. Hence, we wanted to verify if the previously observed radiation effect is also observed on the transcriptomic level. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Persistence of DNA methylation and gene expression change over time. (A,B) Mean DNA methylation change versus control over time with inclusion of direction of methylation change. (C) The schematic representation of gene expression data used to check for corresponding chronic patterns. (D,E) The average change of gene expression in mice liver over time among up-regulated and down-regulated genes. (F) The absolute mean gene expression changes among nucleus layers for differentially expressed genes. (G,H) The average change of change expression in astronauts’ blood over time among up-regulated and down-regulated genes.Accordingly, we observed corresponding long-term gene expression patterns in mice liver tissue, irradiated with 56Fe 0.2 Gy particles. For both the sets up-regulated and down-regulated genes the change of average gene expression level was the highest a month after irradiation and later stabilized, and persisted up to 12 months (p = 0.05, p = 0.01, respectively; Fig. 4D,E). On the other side, in microarrays data, we observed corresponding short-term gene expression patterns in mice heart tissue, irradiated with 56Fe 0.15 Gy particles (p = 0.33 and p = 0.17, respectively; Fig. S4B-C). We also examined, long-term gene expression patterns in mice breast tissue, irradiated with 28Si 0.3 Gy particles and observed corresponding, however not significant, pattern to our in vitro analysis. Hence, fluctuating towards baseline level in the last point of observation (Fig. S4D,E). Finally, to check if observed expression patterns are specific for each radiation type, we investigated the chronic effect of protons, gamma rays, 137Cs and 57Co, exposing distinct gene expression patterns over time (Fig. S4F–L; see method for details). Lastly, we checked spatial and long-term gene expression patterns in blood tissue of JAXA astronauts (see methods for details). Specifically, among nucleus layers we checked if we observe a corresponding pattern in gene expression to DNA methylation change right after astronauts were sent to space and exposed to GCR and if it persists during and after their mission in space. Importantly, we observed that the change of gene expression peaks in the middle “L3” nucleus layer for differentially expressed and all identified genes (Fig. 4F; S4M, respectively), which stands in line with previous DNA methylation observations (Fig. 2E). Moreover, we discovered corresponding long-term persistence of gene expression change for up-regulated (p = 0.02) and down-regulated genes (p = 0.07; Fig. 4G,H). Specifically, we observed increase or decrease of gene expression right after launch and during the mission, as well as effect persistence up to 3–4 months (the last timepoint) after earth landing. In summary, despite variety of timepoints used when compared to DNA methylation study, we saw corresponding trends in gene expression patterns in several mice tissues and astronauts’ blood tissue. Hence, we observed a gene expression change right after irradiation exposure, however, the epigenome imprint was persistent for 56Fe or space exposure when compared with 28Si. As such, we confirmed the previous DNA methylation findings on functional level. Lastly, we checked for DNA methylation change persistence over time in histone modification peaks, promoters and enhancers regions overlapped with DMPs and observed corresponding results to previously established patterns (data not shown).Discussion This is the first study exposing influence of chromatin physical properties on DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET and low-LET radiation. Our work shows that each of investigated radiation types induce distinct DNA methylation patterns. Additionally, we exposed the major role of spatial chromosomal positioning and distribution of histone modifications which have undeniable influence on the effect of cosmic radiation on human cells. Finally, we validated our in vitro observations regarding chronic effect of high-LET particles, with in vivo models and astronauts’ data. As such, we supported our primary analysis with gene expression data of radiation exposed mice tissues including liver, heart, mammary gland, blood and retina as well as blood tissue from six JAXA astronauts’. Our findings partially support those reported in the original publication by Kennedy et al.6. Similarly, we showed that each of primarily investigated radiation types induce a unique imprint on the epigenome. However, we observed that methylation changes which occur early, persist over time only when caused by 56Fe particle. Thus, after 28Si and X-rays’ exposure, we found a methylation peak at the beginning and a decrease towards baseline level over time. In line to previous observations a vast majority of identified methylation sites was located in and around CpG islands, and active genic regions (promoters, enhancers). The differences in results when compared to original publication could be of a various reason6. Specifically, we focused on rigorously chosen differentially methylated sites applying several thresholds of significance. To asses this, we established pairs to compare particles between each other. On the other side, in primary publication authors were focused on global DNA methylation status including all probes without DNA methylation change thresholds and later on assessing differences only by comparison of doses within the individual particle. To support our approach, we validated the perseverance of epigenome imprints associated with distinct radiation exposure. To do this, we looked at gene expression of various mice tissues irradiated with different radiation types as well as JAXA astronauts data from blood liquid biopsies21,30–34. Collectively, our analysis confirmed that each of investigated radiation type induces a unique chronic gene expression pattern. Importantly, we found corresponding changes between DNA methylation and gene expression levels in terms of GCR particles as well as astronauts’ exposure to space radiation. Thus, however to properly examine the persistence of these patterns, multiple timepoints with longer period of observation would be preferred. Additionally, all experiments should be performed in the same research model to minimize potential heterogeneity among even similar cell lines or more advanced models. Interestingly, in recent years other researchers investigated both DNA methylome and transcriptome changes in several tissues exposed to spaceflight. In retinas of mice flown to space for 37-days period, Chen et al. found a large number of differentially methylated (DM) genes and fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Majority of DM sites were hypomethylated and located in genes and promoters. The functional analysis of these data revealed that spaceflight had a major effect on extracellular matrix/cell junction and cell proliferation/apoptosis signaling42. On the other side, Acharya et al. demonstrated increased DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus and ultimately impaired cognitive condition of irradiated mice which could be mitigated by 5-iodotubercidin administration43. Finally, in NASA Twins Study, despite observing minor genome-wide DNA methylation changes, the gene enrichment analysis showed that during flight genes involved in the response to platelet-derived growth factor and T cell differentiation, and activation pathways in both CD4 and CF8 cells were enriched. Specifically, for CD4 cells genes involved in platelet aggregation, regulation of ossification, and cellular response to UV-B were enriched, whereas for CD8 cells genes involved in somatostatin signaling pathway and positive regulation of superoxide anion generation were enriched44. To further investigate the methylation data, our analyses focused on the impact of spatial chromosomal positioning on DNA methylation patterns or radiation properties and in vivo validation of induced epigenome imprints45. At first, based on spatial chromosome distribution, we tried to establish features associated with DMPs prevalence. At the beginning, we associated the higher frequency with outer positioning of chromosomal fragments in “L1” layer and its absence in “L5” layer. Hence, suggesting that when penetrating the nucleus, externally exposed DNA fragments are at the highest exposure to radiation beams which effect decreases with nucleus depth4. This observation however seemed promising, was not persistent for the whole genome, proposing the influence of other unknown factors. Recently, Garcia-Nieto et al.11, demonstrated that epigenome architecture in ultra violet (UV) irradiated non-malignant lung fibroblasts cells plays a role of a barrier to cancer development by regulation of carcinogen susceptibility. These findings highlighted the role of H3K9me3 modification in accumulating UV-induced DNA lesions in external heterochromatin regions, thus protecting inner localized euchromatin. As such, we looked at the spatial distribution of epigenetic histone modifications which may also play a role in the context of GCR11,46. Likewise, we observed the highest prevalence of DMPs in the periphery with the highest DNA methylation changes among active promoter and enhancers regions marked with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications. However, when looking at all identified DMPs the highest methylation change was observed around the middle layer, right after the euchromatin-associated histone marks overcame the heterochromatin-associated H3K9me3 histone mark. Additionally, from that point, we started to observe a similar DMP chromosomal frequency pattern, suggesting the higher radiation vulnerability to occur differentially methylated sites as well as higher DNA methylation changes, especially among internally located promoters and enhancers sites. Specifically, this could be associated with higher chromatin accessibility. As previously mentioned, at first, we hypothesized that nucleus periphery absorbs the highest radiation dose. However, despite the highest frequency of DMPs observed, the highest DNA methylation change and corresponding chromosomal frequencies were observed around the middle layer of the nucleus. It could potentially suggest the occurrence of Bragg peak which depicts the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter and after which the after which particles immediately come to rest47. It might be true especially for 28Si and X-rays, since we observed a higher DNA methylation change drop in inner layers for these two types of radiation. However, promising in principle X-rays penetrate the whole nucleus and lose energy in a random manner along the photon path, and not having Bragg peak present due to presence of uncharged photons in X rays. Additionally, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), labeled as gH2AX foci, are distributed “randomly,” without accumulation at the nuclear periphery, but more prevalent in nuclear compartments with low chromatin density48,49. Although, never investigated for 56Fe and 28Si particles, based on similar experiments performed using 1 Gy for 11B and 1.2 Gy for 20Ne (LET 150 keV/µm and 171 keV/µm, respectively; Energy beam 8 MeV/n and 47 MeV/n, respectively), we could suspect that all of investigated particles by Kennedy et al., should penetrate the whole nucleus width, therefore, it is unlikely to observe a Bragg peak in the middle and all other nuclear layers50. Hence, our results could be potentially associated with chromatin accessibility or specific properties of different radiation types used, rather than particular histone modifications occurrence. Previous reports shown that the accumulation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in peripheral heterochromatin does not accumulate more DSBs that euchromatin. Further, the exposure of cells to photonic radiation leads to a higher occurrence of DSBs in decondensed euchromatin. In contrast, exposure to high-LET results in more severe damage to dense heterochromatin. The distinct interaction of various types of radiation with different chromatin domains can be attributed to their diverse mechanisms of action. Photonic (gamma or X-ray) radiation primarily induces DNA damage indirectly through free radicals (ROS) generated by water radiolysis. Conversely, ions with high-LET directly damage DNA. Dense heterochromatin acts as a protective shield against ROS, yet it provides more DNA targets per volume for accelerated particles. Crucially, the extensive induction of DSBs by high-LET ions is not confined to peripheral heterochromatin but extends to the entire nucleus50–52. Hence, specific methylation changes may be generated as part of the systemic response of cells to irradiation. Indeed, post-irradiation epigenetic modifications have been shown not only to occur at sites of DSB damage, but also globally, throughout the cell nucleus53. Such a response can occur because chromatin represents a regulatory network and responses to various stresses as a system54,55. Hence, it seems more probable that these observations may be associated with chromatin accessibility and multidimensional architecture of these sequences rather than the epigenetic modification itself that makes H3K4me3 and H3K27ac-marked sequences more susceptible to radiation. Interestingly, Caron et al., found that most DMPs were located in chromosomes with low gene expression and located more peripherally compared to chromosomes with high gene expression. Thus, the intensity of DNA methylation changes correlates with both the low-expression (heterochromatic) state of chromatin and the peripheral location of chromatin. In our case, several of the few chromosomes with the highest abundance of DMPs are acrocentric chromosomes (12, 14, and 15), which also form a rim of heterochromatin around the whole width of the nucleus. It could indicate that heterochromatin architecture is a more important factor determining the intensity of DNA methylation changes after irradiation than nuclear location. Additionally, among heterochromatin layers, the highest DNA methylation changes were observed among TSS regions, which could mean that gene promoters within heterochromatin regions are highly affected by radiation56. In summary, it seems that epigenetic architecture plays a major role in cell response to irradiation. Specifically, it is architecture of heterochromatin associated domains with lower chromatin accessibility which could also explain the propagation of radiation laterally in nuclear layers, since DNA domains are more packed and in closer relationship to each other. Additionally, there were a few articles highlighting the role of histone marks in the context of GCR or microgravity. Gambacurta et al. discovered that H3K4me3, H3K27me2/3, H3K79me2/3 and H3K9me2/3 are engaged in cellular reprogramming that drives gene expression in blood-derived stem cells during osteoblastic differentiation induced by rapamycin under microgravity57. Furthermore, Singh et al. showed that in human T-lymphocyte cells, simulated-microgravity results in DNA hypomethylation58. However, gene expression analysis showed a decreased expression of histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1 which should have resulted in increased acetylation of histone H3 which in fact was decreased suggesting regulation of other HDAC. Finally, Koaykul et al. investigated neurogenic differentiation potential of passaged human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells under conventional and simulated microgravity59. Researchers discovered that conventional gravity conditions resulted in higher enrichment of H3K27me3 at neuronal promoters (NF-H and MAP2) when compared to simulated conditions. Contrary, there were no enrichment differences among H3K4me3. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic nuclear architecture. We showed that GCR particles induce unique acute and chronic DNA methylation and gene expression patterns. Moreover, for the first time, we highlighted the role of spatial distribution of key epigenetic modification. Specifically, we point out the major role of heterochromatin associated domains in DNA accessibility and radiation response. Finally, we showed which regions of human genome are the most vulnerable to GCR and thus associated with higher DNA methylation changes. To overcome the main limitation of the study resulting from analyzing similar, but not the same cell types (bronchial epithelial cells and bronchial fibroblasts), we run additional analysis using in vivo models and human tissues. Importantly, all key in vitro findings were successfully validated across more advanced models. Further research should focus on extensive analysis using various methods discussed in this manuscript. All this should be performed in the same cell type or organism to minimize potential bias which could occur in our analysis. Additionally, it should further investigate the role of various histone modifications which could potentially limit the negative effects of GCR and other radiation types. If successfully treated, it could contribute to development of epigenetically modified preventing strategies against radiation-induced cell damage.Supplementary Information Supplementary Figures.

    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10772081/",
    "abstract": "Abstract COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases. Subject terms: Viral infection, Diagnostic markers, Pathology, Chronic inflammation",
    "introduction": "Introduction As of January 13, 2023, over 671 million cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide have been reported, and more than 6.71 million lives have been claimed globally. The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The development and administration of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced the local to global impact and burden of COVID-19. However, the global distribution of these resources has been unequal [1], ultimately prolonging viral transmission. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 quickly evolved into variants with increased transmission rates more capable of immune escape [2]. Therefore, we must increase our understanding of this novel virus, its variants, and the resulting short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on human health. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which includes viruses such as OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [3]. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, whose genome is packaged in a helical ribonucleocapsid complex. The outer surface of the virus is studded with Spike (S) proteins that facilitate the infection of host cells by binding to its cognate cellular surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to allow for viral membrane fusion. Fusion leads to viral genome transfer into the host cell cytoplasm where viral replication can commence, leading to its various intracellular impacts. To read in more detail these processes, as well as structural elements of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, see our first review, ref. [3], focusing on intracellular SARS-CoV-2 viral effects [3]. In this second of a three-part comprehensive series of our series of SARS-CoV-2 reviews, we cover the extracellular and circulating signals and physiological effects of the viral disease, including the consequences and remodeling of organs, metabolism, humoral factors, and the immune system. In turn, the aim of this review series is to provide an overview of our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and its biological effects from basic biology to clinical patient outcomes, highlighting also future areas of research given the ever-evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19, and its consequences for healthcare across the world.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 and its resultant acute and chronic diseases, COVID-19 and PASC, have caused significant impacts worldwide. Here we describe and review the latest knowledge about the viral effect on our physiology, as well as the latest research on relevant whole-body metabolism pathways, circulating biological components (e.g., RNA, cytokine, hormones, etc.), and affected organ systems and their physiological adaptations consequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 is a pleiotropic, complex, and dynamic condition (Fig. 4). The viral insults and cellular adaptations differ depending on the context, from cellular to organ systems, and intricate biochemistry ties and integrates these systems together. Herein, we have attempted to capture the prevalent host responses, as well as highlight gaps of knowledge that could be addressed with future research. We have also touched on relevant biochemical targets with potential for mitigating COVID-19 in the human host, and we will describe current and in-development treatment modalities that affect these in Part 3 of our review. Fig. 4. COVID-19 biological adaptations and effects. Open in a new tab The multi-faceted and multiplex physiological adaptations resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the different cells, tissues, and organs that respond to viral infection. The airway milieu refers to the viral factors contained from inhalation and response to these factors in the lungs, while the systemic milieu refers to the viral factors transported through the circulation system and across body, and in turn, the physiological responses to these factors.",

Copyright notice ID: 10772081 PMID: 37938797 Abstract COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases. Subject terms: Viral infection, Diagnostic markers, Pathology, Chronic inflammationIntroduction As of January 13, 2023, over 671 million cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide have been reported, and more than 6.71 million lives have been claimed globally. The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The development and administration of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced the local to global impact and burden of COVID-19. However, the global distribution of these resources has been unequal [1], ultimately prolonging viral transmission. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 quickly evolved into variants with increased transmission rates more capable of immune escape [2]. Therefore, we must increase our understanding of this novel virus, its variants, and the resulting short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on human health. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which includes viruses such as OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [3]. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, whose genome is packaged in a helical ribonucleocapsid complex. The outer surface of the virus is studded with Spike (S) proteins that facilitate the infection of host cells by binding to its cognate cellular surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to allow for viral membrane fusion. Fusion leads to viral genome transfer into the host cell cytoplasm where viral replication can commence, leading to its various intracellular impacts. To read in more detail these processes, as well as structural elements of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, see our first review, ref. [3], focusing on intracellular SARS-CoV-2 viral effects [3]. In this second of a three-part comprehensive series of our series of SARS-CoV-2 reviews, we cover the extracellular and circulating signals and physiological effects of the viral disease, including the consequences and remodeling of organs, metabolism, humoral factors, and the immune system. In turn, the aim of this review series is to provide an overview of our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and its biological effects from basic biology to clinical patient outcomes, highlighting also future areas of research given the ever-evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19, and its consequences for healthcare across the world.Metabolic adaptations caused directly by viral infection of cells We previously described [3] SARS-CoV-2 viral infection intracellular effects and host adaptations. These include major shifts in metabolic and biochemical pathways, including the oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [3]. The immune system is also involved in these adaptations, with a study showing upregulation of Type I interferon (IFN) gene signaling pathways leading to changes with cellular responses to IFN and triggering changes with associated cytokine-mediated signaling pathways [4]. These stimuli lead to cellular adaptations including endoplasmic reticulum stress, upregulated unfolded protein response and downregulation of pathways including spliceosome-mediated RNA processing, mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition, and impairment in the biogenesis and assembly of the electron transport chain complexes and oxidative phosphorylation [5, 6]. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to decreased mitochondrial function, increased glycolysis, and shunting towards the pentose 5 phosphate pathway, resulting in changes in cellular metabolism and bioenergetics that lead to pathophysiological outcomes. These various cellular biochemical adaptations also result in production of circulating metabolites in COVID-19 patients that lead to systemic effects, including tissue remodeling and function, shifts in whole-body metabolism and bioenergetics, changes with immune and endocrine state, etc., resulting in the symptoms and disease outcomes seen with COVID-19 patients. For example, the TCA cycle is the main cellular source of energy and critical for aerobic respiration; serum levels of the TCA metabolites (citrate, fumarate, malate, and aconitate) were significantly lower in the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients as compared with controls, with choline specifically observed to be decreased in patients with severe COVID-19 [7]. Serum metabolites that were increased in these patients included deoxy-thymidine, deoxyuridine, adenine, cystine, and homocysteine. These data provide context as to how specific biochemical and physiological pathways, e.g., the TCA cycle, shift as a result of COVID-19 infection and lead to pathogenesis. For example, elevated homocysteine is associated with endothelial damage [8]. These shifts in metabolites reflect a systemic shift during acute COVID-19 infection, and warrant study of subsequent specific organ adaptations (e.g., bone as a major source of citrate, which is released into the plasma during bone resorption, with soft tissues not generally providing a significant source of citrate into blood plasma). Separate from metabolic pathways (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, etc.) that produce energy from sugars are alternative pathways that utilize compounds such as lipids. Excess energy is stored in the form of lipids, with lipids also used as an immediate energy source or for later use. Lipids also serve as second messengers, activating protein and immune pathways. Indeed, it has been reported SARS-CoV-2 infection causes lipids levels to change and lipid metabolism to alter, with one study using untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approaches observing specific circulating lipids associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including increases in triglycerides and free fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid and oleic acid). These lipids also correlated with disease severity [9]. A specific class of lipids are lipid mediators (LMs), which are bioactive lipids produced locally in response to extracellular stimuli and are involved in immune regulation. Studies have investigated their role in relation to COVID-19 severity as well. One report involving 19 healthy patients, 18 COVID-19 patients who did not need ICU admission (mild), and 20 patients that needed ICU admission (severe) showed an increase of free poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and diminished amounts of PUFA-containing plasmalogens in patients with COVID-19 that also correlated with disease severity [10]. Another study performing metabolomics and lipidomics measurements on patients (49 subjects, 33 were COVID-19–positive subjects and 16 COVID-19–negative subjects) showed alterations in fatty acid metabolism that were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. More specifically, short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines were significantly diminished in all patients with COVID-19, while all Non-Esterified Fatty Acids (except nonanoic acid) were increased in all COVID-19 patients [11, 12]. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 infection affects whole-body metabolism in different ways, with emerging evidence supporting a correlation between these adaptations and COVID-19 disease severity. Moreover, the balance of biochemical components, whether the machinery (e.g., TCA proteins), fuel sources (e.g., lipids), or messenger molecules (e.g., metabolites) appear to shift towards a physiological catabolic state that may be further exacerbated by a patient’s underlying conditions and demographics [7, 9–12]. Metabolic biofactors are also intrinsically tied with the recovery and response to viral infection, with immune-regulating lipids, pro-inflammatory lipids, and lipid mediators plausibly modulating the immune response during COVID-19, as one example. The immune system’s physiology is also reliant on its metabolic function, whether from a development, proliferation, activation, or memory perspective. Immunity is shaped and guided by humoral factors, which we address in the next section, as to the SARS-CoV-2 viral influence on these factors and the effects on the body.Humoral adaptations and changes Humoral factors are compounds that are transported by the circulatory system throughout the body, and include immune factors (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, complement proteins, clotting factors, etc.), hormones, RNAs, lipids, metabolites, etc. These play a role in steady-state physiology as well as pathophysiological adaptations, with changes in humoral factors occurring from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One example is bradykinin, a peptide that is involved with physiological effects, including dilation of arterioles through release of prostacyclin, nitric oxide, and EDHF, constriction of veins by prostaglandin F2, as well as various biochemical effects including upregulation of intracellular Ca2+, regulation of cAMP/cGMP, arachidonic acid release, promotion of VEGF expression and angiogenesis, and activation of TGF-B, JAK/STAT pathways [13]. Additionally, bradykinin is degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and enhanced by angiotensin produced by ACE2. Bradykinin, angiotensin, ACE, and ACE2, are all part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which serves a role within the endocrine system in regulation of renal, cardiac, and vascular physiology, and in turn, systemic physiology [14]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell through receptors such as ACE2 and NRP-1, in a process requiring the transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) protein [3, 15]; thus, SARS-CoV-2 directly interacts with the RAS system and influences its activity. Indeed, gene analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from COVID-19 patients showed a critical imbalance of RAS-related factors, including decreased expression of ACE, while increases in ACE2, renin, angiotensin, and bradykinin, which were suggestive of elevated bradykinin levels systemically that lead to the cardiovascular symptoms seen with patients [16]. Another study of the bradykinin cascade of COVID-19 patients correlated changes in this pathway with disease severity, showing accumulated bradykinin levels were related with patient disease severity, as well as with levels of inflammation, coagulation, and lymphopenia [17]. In addition to the RAS axis, the endocrine system is also vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection [14, 15]. For example, the ACE2 receptor is expressed in endocrine glands, including the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adrenals, pancreas, thyroid glands, ovaries, and testes [15]. Studies have shown reduced thyroid (e.g., subacute thyroiditis, thyrotoxicosis), adrenal (e.g., hypocortisolism, hyponatremia), hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (e.g., HPA dysfunction, hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism), and pancreatic islet function (e.g., hyperglycemia, pancreatic injury based from elevated amylase and lipase), as well as damage to the testes and changes with menstrual cycle being described in COVID-19 patients [14, 15]. SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been suggested to affect glycemic control, with an international registry having been organized to investigate the interaction between diabetes and COVID-19 [14]. Moreover, clinical studies show more severe outcomes in patients with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension; however, there is a lack of data in humans on ACE2 expression in pathological conditions with endocrine tissues, an area which needs future investigation [15]. Various mouse studies have enabled us to investigate organ-specific adaptations, including examining the effects of ACE2 deletion in endocrine organs and observing the beneficial effects of ACE2 gene therapy [15]. The details of these studies are outside the scope of this review, but are elaborated in ref. [14, 15]. As with bradykinin, the remodeling of endocrine factors results in changes with the factors that endocrine organs produce and secrete, though this is an area warrants more investigation. Indeed, these include the non-coding transcriptome, genes which are not involved with protein synthesis, but are transcribed and often secreted into the circulation, in turn providing information on the genetic state of their originating cells, but also controlling and regulating biological adaptations due to the ability of the non-coding RNAs to interact with other macromolecules, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. We elaborate on the changes with the non-coding RNA transcriptome seen in COVID-19 patients in the next section.Exosomes influence on SARS-CoV-2 infection Exosomes are extracellular vesicles generated by all cells that carry cellular components, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites. They are carried and transported in blood and lymph, and serve near- and long-distance intercellular communication and biological effects. They also serve as a biomarker based on their contents, which may be altered in different conditions and physiological states. It is known that during viral infection, extracellular vesicles become vectors of viral material. More recent reports have also highlighted this occurs with SARS-CoV-2 infection [18]. One study investigated and compared exosomes from mild or severe COVID-19 patients. The exosomes from both groups contained SARS-CoV-2 spike-derived peptides and immunomodulatory molecules, though only those from mild patients could stimulate an antigen-specific CD4 T-cell response [19]. This study also observed that the proteome of exosomes of mild patients correlated with a normally functioning immune system, while that of severe patients was associated with increased and chronic inflammation. As mentioned above, exosomes may affect distant cells, and one study explored this connection in the context of COVID-19 by evaluating exosome effects on endothelial cells from exosomes derived from plasma [19]. Exosomes affected the endothelial cells by inducing inflammation-related pathways (e.g., NRLP3, caspase-1, and interleukin-1-beta) through mRNA expression, compared with plasma from mild disease or healthy donors. The study showed that these adaptations were tied with exosomes containing tenascin-C and fibrinogen-beta, which triggered the inflammatory pathways by inducing NF-kB mediated pathways. While this study focused on endothelial cell responses, it was noted that these effects may promote inflammation in other cell types systemically. Exosomes can also be involved with the inflammatory response. A subset of exosomes, called defensosomes, mediate host defense by binding and inhibiting pathogenic responses. A study showed that exosomes in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients can also be involved in this capacity by interfering with surface protein interactions [20]. Exosomes containing high levels of the viral receptor, ACE2, were induced from SARS-CoV-2 infection and activation of viral sensors in cell culture utilizing the autophagy protein, ATG16L1, and were shown to be able to bind and block viral entry. These findings support that exosomes may also be involved with the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral response, with more research of this area increasing our understanding of exosomes and their role in host defense mechanisms. Finally, exosomes may provide insight into organ adaptations based on exosomes from the source organ, in general as well as in specific circumstances such as from viral infection. The exosomes produced from specific cells will communicate their cellular phenotypic state, with each exosome sharing the identity of its source cell. In turn, organ-specific adaptations from SARS-CoV-2 infection may be able to be delineated through measurement of exosomes. One study explored this by investigating how SARS-CoV-2 is known to invade neural cell mitochondria, with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mitochondrial proteins contained within neuron- and astrocyte-derived exosomes quantified in post COVID-19 infection. Indeed, these exosomes contained SARS-CoV-2 N and S1 proteins and varied depending on the context of the disease severity and timeline of COVID-19 [21]. This study is one example of the utility exosomes may provide for complex, multi-organ conditions like COVID-19, in studying and determining physiological alterations resulting from the disease condition.Roles of the non-coding transcriptome in SARS-CoV-2 infection RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are flexible in their ability to circumvent cellular defenses through a variety of mechanisms that often involve specific interactions with cellular components. Additionally, some viral genomes can also be processed by cellular machinery to generate non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that could have regulatory functions. Among them, specific elements of the host ncRNA transcriptome include microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have been described as important players in the regulation of the viral replicative cycle and the cellular antiviral responses (Fig. 1). To summarize the current knowledge about ncRNAs and SARS-CoV-2, we share the latest details of the different ncRNA families and their regulatory roles during infection and disease progression. Fig. 1. Different RNA and their role in COVID-19. Open in a new tab Structure and description of different categories of RNA involved in COVID-19.miRNAs We begin with highlighting microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short regulatory non-coding RNAs generated by the enzymatic processing of specific RNA transcripts. Their regulatory functions at the cellular level are exerted by recruiting regulatory proteins (RNA-induced silencing complex, or RISC) which are further targeted to the 3′-UTR of mRNAs by base complementarity, causing a repressive effect on gene expression [22]. Considering the possible involvement of dysregulated miRNAs upon infection on the systemic manifestations of COVID-19, multiple research groups profiled circulating miRNA levels in SARS-CoV-2 patients. One study of a stratified cohort of COVID-19 patients showed a molecular signature composed of three blood-circulating miRNAs (hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-23a-3p and hsa-miR-195-5p), independently classified COVID-19 cases, distinguishing them from other viral infections such as H1N1 influenza and healthy controls [23]. Recently a circulating miRNA, hsa-miR-2392, was shown and suggested to be one of the main drivers of a suppressive effect of mitochondrial gene expression and inflammation effectors, promoting many of the described symptoms associated with COVID-19. This miRNA was also detected in SARS-CoV-2-infected patient serum and urine, opening the possibility of its use as a prognostic biomarker for the disease [24]. Mitochondrial analysis showed miR-2392 targets were OXPHOS, mitochondrial translation, and mitochondrial metabolism related transcripts. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 elevates miRNAs, such as miR-2392, which can result in affecting biochemical pathways (e.g., downregulation of OXPHOS), and treatment with anti-miR-2393 therapeutics potentially blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters and hACE2-A549 cells [24]. Several additional miRNA’s have also been observed to be involved with COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., level of viral load, biomarkers, etc.), as well as having various biochemical roles (e.g., viral entry, cytokine storm development, activation of signaling pathways, etc.). These include miRNA interaction with cell death processes, regulating pathways such as p53 by miR-101, miR-100, miR-7, miR-107, etc., as well with the viral entry process (e.g., hsa-miR-98-5p binding to TMPRSS2 transcript). Additionally, cellular inflammation processes in COVID-19 infected individuals are affected by miRNA’s (e.g., miR-146a, miR-21, and miR-142), by promoting MAPK and NF-kB signaling causing cellular pro-inflammatory phenotypic adaptations, which has additional consequences such as mitochondrial stress from production of inflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species. These highlight the significant and diverse roles miRNA’s play in steady-state physiology and viral infection induced pathophysiology in COVID-19, which here we briefly describe, but are covered in more detail in the following review [25].lncRNAs Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a wide family of non-coding transcripts characterized by their lack of coding potential, their larger sizes when compared to other ncRNAs (more than 200 nucleotides), and their origin from devoted transcriptional units. Functionally, lncRNAs can regulate the dynamics of the genomic output from chromatin to the cytoplasm, mainly by acting as molecular scaffolds of biological complexes that establish interactions with proteins, DNA, and other RNA molecules. Early transcriptomic studies using cell models show SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a transcriptional pattern that produces several differentially expressed lncRNAs [26]. Through co-expression network analysis, another study identified four differentially expressed lncRNAs correlating with genes involved in various immune-related pathways, suggesting that the aberrant expression of these four lncRNAs can be associated with SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storms and antiviral responses [27]. A different study using nasopharyngeal swabs from infected patients characterized an lncRNA, LASI, that is antisense to the ICAM-1 gene and had an expression profile strongly correlating with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. LASI’s mechanism of action was shown to be through its interaction with the viral genome and subsequent knock-down of viral replication processes, which also resulted in the presence of inflammation markers [28]. In another study, a pattern of lncRNAs (NRIR, BISPR, and MIR155HG) was observed from nasopharyngeal COVID-19 patient samples that correlated with viral loads [29]. Interestingly, NRIR and BISPR lncRNAs were also upregulated in the blood of COVID-19 patients as reported in the COVIDOME project [30], suggesting possible involvement in the systemic manifestations of the viral infection.circRNAs Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules generated by non-canonical back-splicing events from coding and non-coding transcripts. Several studies on the role of circRNAs in viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, have been published recently; however reports showing the involvement and function of circRNAs with SARS-CoV-2 infection are few and need to be considered with caution due to the limited number of samples and the intrinsic characteristics of the infection models. In one example, a lung epithelial cell model infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed differential circRNA expression upon infection. Analyzing these circRNA parental genes revealed they were involved with inflammation and immune responses [31]. CircRNAs related to SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been shown to be detectable in the peripheral blood circulation, highlighting their potential as COVID-19 biomarkers [32]. In this section, we describe humoral factors (and in the previous, metabolism related components) involved in steady-state physiology and responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients, with these intrinsically affecting organ structure and function, and extrinsically affecting systemic physiology based on their production, secretion, and distribution through the circulatory system (Fig. 2). The circulatory system, part of the cardiovascular system, in of itself adapts to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which we will describe in the next section. Fig. 2. SARS-CoV-2 Intracellular Replication and Extracellular Release of Circulating Factors. Open in a new tab An overview of the processes involved with SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication that lead to cellular adaptations (see ref. [3] for more details) and extracellular release of various biological factors into the circulation causing systemic physiological effects.Cardiovascular adaptations and changes The cardiovascular system includes the heart, arteries, veins, capillaries, and lymphatics, which are the organ systems responsible for the transport of blood, lymph, and their constituents to every organ in the body. Blood and lymph transport multiple components, including water, red blood cells, white blood cells, macromolecules (e.g., lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, macromolecule, etc.), micromolecules (e.g., nutrients, ions, etc.), of which are circulated systemically and transported to and from all organs of the body. Included in the transport of these components by blood and lymph are pathogens, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which benefits from the cardiovascular system not only by binding to a cell-type expressing its cognate receptor (e.g., endothelial cells and ACE2 receptor), but also from the cardiovascular system’s function in transporting the virus and its replicants away from the host infected cell, tissue, and organ. In turn, the COVID-19 cardiovascular-related symptoms vary greatly, ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe life-threatening respiratory and cardiac failure [33]. Early reports have described common symptoms of COVID-19 to include fever (88%), fatigue (38%), chills (11%), headache (14%), nasal congestion (5%), sore throat (14%), dry cough (68%), dyspnea (19%), nausea/emesis (5%), diarrhea (4–14%), and myalgias (15%). A meta-analysis of eight studies showed a higher prevalence of hypertension (17 ± 7%) and diabetes mellitus (8 ± 6%) followed by cardiovascular disease (5 ± 4%) in COVID-19 patients [33, 34]. Moreover, concomitant cardiovascular (CV) conditions may be occurring in 8–25% of COVID-19 infected population and an even greater proportion of those who die from the disease [33]. Indeed, evidence suggests that among the primary causes of death and overall mortality from COVID-19 infection are cardiac issues and respiratory failure [34]. These symptoms result from changes occurring at the molecular level from SARS-CoV-2 infection. A large autopsy study investigating multiple organs (heart, lung, kidney, liver, and lymph nodes) showed that the cellular and functional gene signatures from each organ’s major cell types (e.g., cardiomyocytes in the heart) decrease as a function of the viral load. More specifically in the heart (n = 41 from patient autopsy samples), despite no histological change, many heart functional markers (e.g., TNNI3, TNNT2, MYBPC3, PLN, and HAND1) showed decreased levels resulting from COVID-19 infection [35]. Another study showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the myocardial heart tissue from autopsy cases, suggested to be tied to myocardial injury [36]. Indeed, these cellular adaptations extend into the vascular system (e.g., arteries, veins, etc.), with histopathological evidence from autopsy studies showing direct viral infection of endothelial cells and micro- and macrovascular thrombosis occurring in both the arterial and venous circulations. An autopsy study investigating COVID-19 in three patients showed SARS-CoV-2 viral components present in the endothelial cells from different autopsied organs, including the kidney, lung, heart, and liver were each infected with SARS-CoV-2 [37]. Inflammation of the endothelium was also observed, along with recruitment of neutrophils and mononuclear cells to the site of damage. In vitro studies also support SARS-CoV-2 being able to directly infect cardiovascular cells as seen from experiments showing viral infection of engineered human blood vessel organoids [38]. Severe COVID-19 has also been associated with endothelial specific changes and effects such as elevated endothelial activation, hypercoagulability, and increased presence of von Willebrand Factor [39, 40]. Endotheliitis from COVID-19 can occur, leading to a loss of cell–cell junctions, loss of endothelial cells, exposure of the basement membrane, abnormal cytokine release, abnormal reactive oxygen species release, and intussusceptive angiogenesis. Endothelin-1 has been suggested as a possible biomarker for those at risk with COVID-19 [34]. These cardiovascular adaptations from SARS-CoV-2 infection lead to a number of pathophysiological consequences including hypoxia, with prolonged ischemia leading to formation of hypoxanthine as an ATP breakdown product [36]. These effects may be from tissue remodeling caused by viral infection, as well as changes in blood viscosity, clotting, or inflammation, though more research of these areas would benefit our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiovascular system and organ remodeling [33, 34, 36]. For example, a meta-analysis showed there are diverse cardiovascular complications including cardiac injury (e.g., myocardial injury, microinfarcts), heart failure, microembolic infarcts, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, hypertension, and atrial and ventricular complications (e.g., fibrosis) [33, 34]. Autopsy and case reports from COVID-19 patients are also varied in their observations of cardiac tissue changes, highlighting the complexity of the disease and individual differences influencing pathophysiological progression and outcomes. Identifying cardiovascular specific biomarkers would help evaluate, as well as measure progression of disease, with troponin I as one example of a clinical marker evaluating myocardial injury is troponin I. Troponin I has been shown to be elevated in >10% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, increasing with disease severity [41]. Identifying more markers with cardiovascular specific outcomes (i.e. metabolites, lipids, humoral factors, etc., mentioned in the above sections) would help evaluate, correlate, and triage patients and improve their outcomes, as well as facilitate identification of specific biochemical pathways that may mechanistically explain disease symptoms. Indeed, with the metabolic and physiological adaptations seen with COVID-19 patients, understanding mitochondrial adaptations in these contexts is relevant, given mitochondrial function in bioenergetics. As discussed in our first review, the mitochondria is heavily dysregulated and suppressed in the host during SARS-CoV-2 infection [3]. One study specifically analyzed transcriptomic data on heart samples collected from deceased COVID-19 patients [6]. This analysis showed heavy suppression at the transcript level of the majority of mitochondrial pathways and genes [6]. The non-coding transcriptome response to SARS-CoV-2 may also play a significant response and regulatory role with the cardiovascular adaptations developing from COVID-19 disease. Whether miRNA’s (e.g., hsa-miR-2392), lncRNA’s (e.g., NRIR and BISPR), or circRNA’s that are involved in suppressing mitochondrial gene expression, changing oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial structure (e.g., translation, metabolism, etc.), and causing inflammatory effects, may be involved with local cardiac adaptations or systemic vascular adaptations is unknown, but warrants future investigations to explore the specific roles of the transcriptome with cardiovascular adaptations. Furthermore, given the changes in cardiovascular structure, function, biochemical adaptations, that occur from SARS-CoV-2 infection, further study of cardiovascular mitochondrial adaptations is of relevance, and would help elucidate the underlying mechanisms impacting the cardiovascular system resultant from SARS-CoV-2 infection.Immune adaptations and changes The immune system includes the innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate system involves nonspecific responses to injury, and includes cell populations such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, etc. The adaptive immune system involves specific response to pathogen infection, and includes cell populations such as T and B cells. The two arms of the immune system communicate, interact, and support each other in responding to injury, aided by humoral, circulating factors such as cytokines and chemokines, that provide information and context to immune cells as to how, where, and what to respond to, as well as the magnitude of the response. In turn, there are various feedback loops that provide guidance and direction to the immune system, both innate and adaptive, with SARS-CoV-2 activating both the innate and adaptive immune systems. For the innate immune system, activation appears to be guided by neutrophils, which display increased levels of ROS and activated NETosis [42]. Additionally, the loss of ACE2 and DABK in the lungs of patients encourages neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 has also been suggested to dysregulate type 1 interferon signaling, which contributes to immune evasion early in infection. Consistent with this finding, bulk analysis of whole blood cell transcriptomes of severe COVID-19 patients compared with non-critically ill COVID-19 patients showed upregulation of Interferon alpha as the primary contributor to severe COVID-19. Activated monocytes and macrophages also migrate to the lungs (chemotaxis), further exacerbating lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis [43]. Several studies have reported disordered structure of the infected lung, along with extensive immune infiltration [35, 44]. For example, the lung alveoli in COVID-19 patients develop additional hyaluronan, forming a coating that can reduce oxygen exchange, as well as leading to pulmonary edema. Another study of COVID-19 patients showed chronic lung impairment accompanied by persistent respiratory immune alterations, showing specific memory T and B cells enriched at the site of infection [45]. With the significant neutrophil, macrophage, T and B cell infiltration and activation observed, and localized hyperinflammatory states of these immune cells around alveolar epithelial cells, this develops into more lung damage and loss of compartmental identity. When a timeline and pattern of the cytokine storm in tracheal aspirate samples was organized and reported, divergences in the systemic versus airway cytokine production during COVID-19 were observed [46]. Indeed, a study assessing lung function of critical COVID-19 patients showed 55% of them experienced persistent impairment three months after ICU discharge, including declines in patient lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life [47]. This suggests respiratory failure is another significant factor involved with patient mortality with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an investigation of single-nuclei RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patient lung samples identified substantial alterations in cellular composition, transcriptional cell states, and cell-to-cell interactions, with the data showing COVID-19 patient lungs were highly inflamed, with dense infiltration of aberrantly activated macrophages, though with impaired T-cell responses and suggestions of impaired lung regeneration, based on alveolar type 1 cell phenotypes [48]. With regard to adaptive immune cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, these include lymphopenia (lowered CD4 and CD8 T-cell number) in COVID-19 patients, also seen in autopsy reports [49, 50]. There are case by case variations; for example, an influx of T cells and myeloid cells occurs into the myocardium. In response to this event, COVID-19’s pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) are activated, as well as cytokines released by alveolar macrophages [51, 52]. These pathways are thought to contribute to the dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 [53] and the subsequent dysfunction of T cells. Changes also occur within the heart, as seen with gene expression analysis of cardiac tissue for TNF-ɑ, interferon-γ, chemokine ligand 5, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 (CXCL8), and interleukin-18. Severe COVID-19 is also associated with elevated endothelial activation, hypercoagulability, and the presence of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) [53, 54]. Indeed, COVID-19 induces a complex pattern of cytokine release as part of an overall dysregulated immune response that, in severe cases, injures the parenchyma of vital organs and leads to viremia and sepsis [55, 56]. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by an inflammatory profile that involves initial immune evasion by downregulation of Type I Interferon pathways along with significant upregulation of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in the lungs that coincides with increased NF-κB activity [57, 58]. In one study of COVID-19 patients, a notable increase in multiple serum cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) was seen [59], while another study showed high plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, bFGF, GCSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, PDGF, TNF-α, and VEGF. A different study showed increased levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients [60]. These results suggest an overproduction of cytokines in response to lung damage, or as a compensatory response to attempt to re-direct, accelerate, or shutdown the immune response. These cytokine fluctuations also coincide with systemic inflammation and myocardial injury; in 137 patients admitted for COVID-19 disease in Hubei province, heart palpitations were noted as one of the presenting symptoms in 7.3% of patients [61]. Moreover, there have been reports of complete heart blockage and atrial fibrillation in patients with COVID-19 infection [62]. In patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (e.g., soluble IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) have been observed, with these cytokines disrupting endothelial cells antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory functions, leading to coagulation dysregulation, complement and platelet activation, and leukocyte recruitment in the microvasculature [63, 64]. While increased levels of circulating chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, regulatory cytokines, and growth factors were observed in severe COVID patients who died as compared to surviving patients, a more restricted and selective increase of cytokines such as IL-10 was observed in the airway samples with actual decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-5, and IL-2 as compared to uninfected controls [46]. These results demonstrate that inflammation is also highly modulated in the airways as an attempt to decrease exacerbated inflammation. Figure 1 illustrates a snapshot of extracellular factors involved with immune adaptations during COVID-19 and the uniqueness of systemic versus airway inflammatory milieu.Organ alterations from SARS-CoV-2 infection In addition to the cardiovascular system, SARS-CoV-2 infects and has an effect on many organ systems (e.g., cardiovascular, immune, and endocrine systems, as described above), including the lungs, lymph nodes, brain, liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, testis (Fig. 3) [65–67]. COVID-19 is known to cause multi-organ dysfunction, though the burden of infection outside the respiratory tract and time to viral clearance is not well understood. A recent postmortem study of 44 patients quantified and mapped the distribution, replication, and cell-type specificity of SARS-CoV-2 across the body, specifically the brain but other organs as well, from acute infection to more than seven months following symptom onset. It was seen that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the body was widely spread across respiratory and non-respiratory tissues (e.g., the brain) [68]. This spread of infection provides context for the different symptoms patients experience. Fig. 3. COVID-19 organ adaptations and symptoms. Open in a new tab An overview of the systemic organ adaptations resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as symptoms that develop.Neurological and psychiatric symptoms have been reported for acute, post-acute, and longer-term SARS-CoV-2 infection in human patients across the human lifespan [69]. Although neurological manifestations remain incompletely characterized in terms of etiology, severity, and incidence, they present signs of nonspecific (e.g., headache, dizziness, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, insomnia, etc.) and specific (e.g., encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, status epilepticus, ataxia, anosmia, ageusia, demyelinating syndromes, etc.) deficits of the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, or both, with new-onset or relapsed associated prodromal, subthreshold, or fully expressed (i.e., suprathreshold) psychiatric conditions. The spectrum of presumed virogenic psychiatric disorders across age cohorts and other demographic classifications is broad and includes anxiety, depression, confusion or disordered thought (e.g., brain fogor psychosis). Structural and functional changes in brain anatomy, such as brief to protracted alterations in gray and white matter volume, blood perfusion and oxygenation, and metabolic activity [70], often parallel and are consistent with onset and duration of mental health diagnoses in infected populations. Areas caudal to the neocortex tend to be most affected, with olfactory cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and brain stem abnormalities occurring in greater frequency and magnitude in COVID-19 patients. Uncertainty regarding the cause of COVID-19-related neuropathology centers on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, with the olfactory epithelium as a plausible entry point with subsequent retrograde transsynaptic propagation to other brain areas. Astrocytes and Schwann cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 may also be negatively impacted with their neurotransmission, synapse modulation, reinnervation, metabolite and electrolyte homeostasis, and cell signaling functions. This may cause, contribute, or lead to observed central and peripheral nervous system trauma and dysfunction [70]. There is data that also supports hematogenous mechanisms enabling viral access to nervous tissue through infection of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) endothelial cells or epithelial cells of the choroid plexus blood–CSF barrier. Indeed, a study examining SARS-CoV-2 interaction with brain organoids suggests a compromised blood-brain-barrier (BBB) as manifested by injured endothelial cells and increased BBB permeability [71]. Multisystem hyperinflammatory immunoreactions most appropriately describe for the diverse set of pathologies observed in post mortem autopsy analyses, as well as in live in vivo or in vitro tissue, the result of hemorrhagic, ischemic, and hypoxic injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal damage and apoptosis, and microglial and astrocytic activation. With regard to gastrointestinal (GI) effects of SARS-CoV-2, an autopsy study of 29 cases showed the GI to be one of the primary organs infected by the virus, as well as being supported by the literature of postmortem organ analysis [65]. GI involvement and symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, etc.) is associated with long hospital stays and severity of disease, with the rates of GI symptoms of the percent of individuals ranging from 11% to 53%. ACE2 is frequently found in human intestinal epithelial cells, with SARS-CoV-2 being detected in patient GI samples [72]. Indeed, while there is a paucity of data of SARS-CoV-2 effects on GI physiology, GI symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, though and should be considered when evaluating patient conditions as well as treatment options. Here we summarize a few examples of organ adaptations resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. These highlight the virus’s diverse biological targets and outcomes, though more studies are warranted given our comprehensive lack of understanding of these, and other, organ alterations, as well in particular, the biochemical pathways that are affected by viral infection. In addressing these knowledge gaps, patient care will improve as well as new treatment modalities will be identified. Moreover, these adaptations are related with long-term implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which we describe in the next section.Impact of circulating factors on post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC, long COVID-19) In addition to COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients may experience long-term symptoms as a result of organ or tissue damage due to SARS-CoV-2. This condition is referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), or long COVID-19 [73, 74]. PASC patients are burdened with multiple symptoms, including more than a third of PASC patients continuing to experience lung fibrotic abnormalities following hospital discharge [75]. Many are also at risk of developing microemboli due to maladaptations with clotting physiology (e.g., massively increased levels of vWF which leads to increased platelet activation, etc.) [76]. Indeed, virus-driven cellular alterations have been suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of PASC patients [3, 77]. Persistent viral presence and inflammation within the olfactory epithelium has been evident from histological analysis, as well as long-term impairments in taste and smell in the cells of the tongue’s taste buds [78]. PASC is also characterized by chronic fatigue, which has numerous underlying causes. As a comparison, the post-flu or fever fatigue that occurs (e.g., Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)) may have some similarities to the persistent fatigue in PASC. PASC symptoms may also be influenced by abnormalities of the central nervous system, such as brain hypometabolism [79]. A recent postmortem study also quantified and mapped the SARS-CoV-2 organ tropism, finding long-term signs of infection in the brain, as well as across the body within the tissue (e.g., respiratory, cardiovascular, lymphoid, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, endocrine, skin, and peripheral nervous systems) seven months following infection onset, confirmed through in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analyses of the tissue, isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from tissue by cell culture, and detection of the spike sequence variants in non-respiratory sites [71]. While psychological and environmental factors are likely to be involved, long-term biochemical adaptations, including increased oxidative stress and muscle mitochondrial failure, may contribute to the chronic fatigue syndrome found in PASC patients [80]. In addition, due to the activation of the fibrosis pathway from persistent virus-induced inflammation, the heart may subsequently undergo structural remodeling that may also explain the PASC symptoms [81]. There are also long-term immune changes, with PASC patients having elevated expression of type I IFN (IFN-) and type III IFN (IFN-1), highly activated innate immune cells, while lacking naive T and B cells [82], which may also be related with the symptoms PASC patients experience, but also increase their risk of infection, etc. Indeed, while many individuals recover from SARS-CoV-2, a significant number of patients continue to suffer with long-term disease symptoms (e.g., PASC) long term after recovery from the primary infection [73, 74]. The severity of the primary infection appears to be independent from the possibility and severity of long-term symptoms, though this requires further research. Indeed, it is critical to understand the systemic effects of PASC, its biological mechanism and symptoms, and to develop treatments that promote functional recovery in symptomatic individuals, given the negative health-effects of PASC, as well as the socioeconomic and healthcare burden this condition will impose. Further research on PASC will improve our knowledge and understanding of the condition, as well as enable identification of relevant treatments and interventions to improve patient outcomes.Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 and its resultant acute and chronic diseases, COVID-19 and PASC, have caused significant impacts worldwide. Here we describe and review the latest knowledge about the viral effect on our physiology, as well as the latest research on relevant whole-body metabolism pathways, circulating biological components (e.g., RNA, cytokine, hormones, etc.), and affected organ systems and their physiological adaptations consequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 is a pleiotropic, complex, and dynamic condition (Fig. 4). The viral insults and cellular adaptations differ depending on the context, from cellular to organ systems, and intricate biochemistry ties and integrates these systems together. Herein, we have attempted to capture the prevalent host responses, as well as highlight gaps of knowledge that could be addressed with future research. We have also touched on relevant biochemical targets with potential for mitigating COVID-19 in the human host, and we will describe current and in-development treatment modalities that affect these in Part 3 of our review.

    "abstract": "Abstract Human space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts’ health, leading to molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted. Subject terms: Genetics, Medical research",
    "introduction": "Introduction Missions beyond low Earth orbit are the new frontier of crewed space exploration. Future missions to Mars as well as long-duration missions to the Moon will be significantly more sustained than any previous deep space mission. During transit, the space environment presents key challenges for astronauts’ safety1. Previous literature describes microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation and confinement as major stressors that are able to induce pathophysiological changes in the heart, skeletal muscle, and immune system, as well as bone loss, central nervous system alterations, and increased cancer risk2–4. Thus, there is increasing interest to identify the molecular mechanisms driving those health risks, including changes in mitochondrial function, genetic and epigenetic regulation, telomere-length dynamics, DNA damage, and oxidative stress3,5 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-related stressors share similarities with the hallmarks of aging: mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and telomere length changes (including brief elongation in flight and increased shorter telomeres post-flight), cellular senescence, and dysbiosis, among others6. As a defined set of aging-related molecular changes, the hallmarks of aging may be specifically studied to assess spaceflight impact on human physiology, which could induce a condition similar to premature or pathological aging3. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Effects of spaceflight and a model of aging. Human spaceflight presents five major challenges: space radiation, altered gravity, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, and hostile/closed environments are hazards for crewed spaceflight. These stressors support pathophysiological alterations and cellular and molecular changes which could be involved in the development of biological aging and frailty in astronauts. Muscle loss in astronauts has a similar pathophysiology as sarcopenia in the elderly. Created using BioRender. Aging is a state of depleted biological resilience resulting in an increased vulnerability to stressors. It leads to a systemic loss of the body’s capacity to maintain homeostasis and health3. The aging phenotype manifests in metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurological deterioration, and cancer7. Old age is also marked by immune dysregulation, which can result in a chronic low-grade inflammation state called inflammaging, a status associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers in blood and tissues8. The deterioration in muscle quality and quantity is another feature of aging, characterized by altered myofiber metabolism and impaired satellite cell activity9. Loss of muscle mass increases the risk of developing other comorbidities, in a vicious cycle that leads to unhealthy aging. These traits are often associated with a multifactorial geriatric syndrome known as “frailty”10. Frailty, a recent concept in aging science, can be defined as a syndrome caused by the combined effect of numerous age-related alterations. These alterations lead to a depletion of physiological reserve and/or deterioration of cognitive functions, resulting in an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Frailty can be clinically diagnosed by the presence of three or more of the following components: unintentional weight loss over the last year, weakness, exhaustion, slow gait, and low physical activity level11. Other criteria for diagnosing and assessing frailty are functional factors such as grip strength and gait speed12,13. More holistic definitions of frailty also consider the presence of comorbidities, cognitive impairment, psychosocial risk factors and other common geriatric syndromes14. The use of clinical scores to quantify frailty has been attempted, but it is undermined by encountered limitations in terms of ethnicity, risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis. However, advancements in the understanding of the biological processes related to frailty and aging, along with the development of high-throughput techniques, allowed the development of novel assessment models based on “omics” biomarkers15. Part of the deconditioning of human physiology caused by spaceflight resembles the features of frail patients, for instance the physical component related to muscle loss. Sarcopenia is generally defined as a progressive age-related condition characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle quality, performance, strength, and mass16. When this condition is driven by aging, it is defined as primary sarcopenia9. Interestingly, muscle loss in astronauts shares similarities with sarcopenia in the elderly, especially during long duration spaceflight, and could be interpreted as a sarcopenia-like syndrome17,18. The study of frailty traits in astronauts involves the investigation of aging’s biological pathways, which could be elicited by the space environment. Yet, despite the reported similarities between the features of frailty and consequence of spaceflight, it remains unclear whether the space environment can influence the onset of age-related dysfunctions in astronauts. Getting insights about the signatures of frailty and sarcopenia in spaceflight data is a key step towards the development of countermeasures to achieve safer crewed space missions and translate therapy to patients on Earth. Here, we hypothesize the emergence of aging, frailty and sarcopenia related transcriptomic signatures during and after spaceflight in astronauts, murine and cellular models. We investigate this occurrence using multi-omics and systems-informatic approaches. We analyzed transcriptomic data from rodent research missions flown to the International Space Station (ISS) (available from NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), previously known as GeneLab18), astronaut data from a recent JAXA study, and data from the first civilian commercial spaceflight mission, Inspiration4 (i4). We identified altered expression in genes related to frailty and muscle loss, that may lead to an early frailty phenotype. Our results raise the possibility that exposure to the space environment leads to changes consistent with frailty, including inflammation, muscle wasting and other age-related features. Our findings propose a method to study the development of frailty-related health risks, which astronauts may develop during spaceflight, in the perspective of achieving adequate preventative measures.",

The Differential Expression (DE) analysis of RNA-Seq datasets (OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, OSD-105) is performed using DESeq2 version 1.26.082, in R software version 4.1.2. Expected counts from the RSEM step were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. The Differential Expression (DE) analysis of microarray datasets (OSD-21, OSD-52, OSD-195) is performed using the package limma, in R version 4.1.274. The Ensembl IDs of the genes in the DE datasets were annotated to their corresponding gene symbols using the R package biomaRt83,84. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the differentially expressed datasets using fGSEA package to determine to what extent aging and putative frailty pathways were impacted in spaceflight85. Tentative aging and frailty gene pathways were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)—a joint project of UC San Diego and Broad Institute23,86. MSigDB is a multicollection of databases among which are databases of curated gene sets, and databases of ontology gene sets that are used in pathway analysis. The latest version MSigDB v2022.1 was used in the pathway search. In search of pathways that are potentially related to frailty, in MSigDB, we entered keywords of processes that are common denominators to aging in different organisms66. The processes of interest are: changes in genomic and genetic material; cellular processes; nutrient signaling; and responses at the tissue level with bone and muscle as the tissues of interest. Changes in genomic and genetic material that are deemed to potentially associate with frailty include genome instability, epigenetic alterations, histone modifications, DNA methylation, DNA damage, and changes in chromatin structure. Cellular processes that are of interest to frailty pathways include: (1) processes that are key to maintaining the cell cycle—cell senescence, stem-cell generation, and the pathways that involve p53, the protein tumor suppressor; (2) mechanisms involved in proteostasis (protein regulation); (3) mitochondrial processes involving dysfunction and disease; and (4) intercellular processes that involve inflammation and intercellular communication. The actions of the protein complexes—proteasome, lysosome, and chaperone—are considered in the network of pathways that regulate proteins. Putative pathways of nutrient sensing and signaling include pathways mediated by insulin signaling and mTor signaling, and the role of Ampk. The downloaded pathways were identified as putative frailty pathways when at least two (2) putative frailty biomarker genes were present among the genes that are involved in the pathway. This is applied from the following reasoning: if multiple genes that can possibly interact to express a phenotype are present in a pathway, then that pathway can be associated with that phenotype. The outcome of the fGSEA analysis is the normalized enrichment score (NES) of any given pathway, alongside valuable information on the analysis, such as the adjusted p-value, and the leading-edge genes of the pathway. The NES is the enrichment score normalized based on the number of genes in the gene set. It indicates the representation of the pathway genes in the dataset gene list, which is priorly ranked according to the values of the t-score of the genes. A positive NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the top of the gene list, while a negative NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the bottom of the gene list. The plots of the NES of the different pathways for a given dataset are produced using ggplot2, and the heatmaps across different datasets or different genes are obtained using a complex heatmap R package87,88. Analysis on frailty biomarker genes and pathways A list of Frailty Biomarkers was generated from a survey of literature that was produced from studies that were inspired by the FRAILOMICS Initiative. The biomarker genes for mouse (Mus musculus) were obtained as a literal translation from human biomarker genes using biomaRt. Historically, frailty was assessed based on measuring functional phenotypic parameters. The Fried phenotype regards frailty as a biological syndrome that comprises five components, i.e., shrinking, weakness, fatigue, slowness, and a low physical activity level20; frailty is diagnosed when poor performance in three or more components are present. The Rockwood frailty index identifies frailty based on the accumulation of age-related deficits, including various symptoms, signs, functional impairments, and laboratory abnormalities; it is calculated as the ratio of the number of accumulated deficits divided by the total number of deficits measured20. The FRAILOMICS Initiative was introduced with the aim of developing validated measures comprising both classic and omics-based laboratory biomarkers. Since the inception of initiatives such as the FRAILOMICS70,89, a number of approaches have been utilized to identify molecular biomarkers of frailty, among which are: the identification of differentially expressed biomarkers based on the risk of frailty89; the identification of genes regulated in “hallmarks of aging” pathways19; and the identification of molecular biomarkers that closely associate inflammatory mediators with frailty35. In the publication by Durinck et al.89, subjects are stratified as frail or non-frail based on Fried’s definition, and frailty biomarkers are identified as those that are upregulated in frail subjects. In the publication by Berrios et al.19, gene expression databases were searched to identify genes regulated in “hallmark of aging” pathways, namely (1) inflammation, (2) mitochondria and apoptosis, (3) calcium homeostasis, (4) fibrosis, (5) neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and neurons, (6) cytoskeleton and hormones. A total of 44 biomarkers were evaluated based on differential expression. The markers were categorized by priority scores, with a higher priority score reflecting an upregulation of the biomarker in several pathways. In the publication by Lebrasseur et al.22, a meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of showing whether inflammatory mediators are overproduced in frail older adults. Forty-nine studies, published between 2002 and 2018 analyzing frailty and inflammation parameters, were selected for the meta-analysis. Among them, 35 studies (70%) associated frailty to CRP, 33 studies (66%) evaluated IL6, 13 studies (26%) reported data for TNFα, and 12 (24%) analyzed other different inflammation biomarkers, including IL10, soluble TNF receptors I (sTNF-RI) and II (sTNF-RII), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IL6 receptor (IL6-R). Regarding frailty identification, 92% of the studies employed Fried’s frailty criteria, 6% of the studies used the frailty index developed by Rockwood and Mitnitski, and the remaining small percentage of studies employed tools and indicators recently described in the literature. In the work described in this paper, the authors have used the biomarker genes identified in the named studies as putative biomarker genes of frailty to conduct their analyses. The differential expression (log2foldchange and padj < 0.5) of frailty biomarker genes were determined from the following two human datasets (OSD-52 and 195) and six mice datasets (OSD-21, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105). Subsequently, to generate the Venn diagram, R language v4.1.085 was used, through the library ggplot2 v3.4.087. It was extracted from the table of frailty genes (Table 2), with genes unique to mice and humans, and with genes common for both (the intersections). After generating the diagram, a list of genes was extracted and manually added to the diagram. To generate the two upset plot graphs (for mice genes and human genes), the R language85 was also used, using the library ggplot2 v3.4.083 and ComplexUpset v1.3.590. Finally, to generate the heatmap, the python 3 v3.10.0 language was used, through the Seaborn v0.12.1 and Clustermap v0.11.12 libraries. Two heatmaps were generated (one for the mice genes and the other for the human genes), relating the genes to the respective OSD datasets. To complement the heatmap analyses, a dendrogram has also been added for each graph. Table 2. List of the frailty genes.

Four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in low-Earth orbit (LEO) at 585 km above Earth. The mission launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on September 15th, 2021, and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral on September 18th, 2021. Several human related experiments were carried out to study the effects of spaceflight on human health and performance in collaboration with SpaceX, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), and Weill Cornell Medicine. The experiments conducted on the Inspiration4 crew members were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and experimental protocols were approved at the principal investigators’ institutions at Weill Cornell Medicine. All I4 crew members have given informed consent to participate in these studies. The i4 crews’ physiological changes were monitored with ultrasound scanning, molecular diagnostics devices, smartwatch wearables devices, and etc.91. Infection or inflammation are the most prevalent clinical symptoms found during the long-term (around 6 months) spaceflight92. However, there were no clinical reports of infection or inflammation. Although two astronauts presented with space motion sickness, most metrics (e.g., internal jugular vein size, heart rate, complete blood count, gene expression, and cytokines) were either stable, or quickly reverted back to baseline after landing. The experiments conducted by the Inspiration4 crew members were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at the principal investigators’ institutions. Moreover, the different study designs and the corresponding methods to collect and analyze the biological samples were approved by the corresponding institutional IRB. All biological data derived from the Inspiration4 mission were collected pre and post flights. For this study, only data from blood samples were used. Pre-flight samples were collected at L-92, L-44, and L-3 days prior to launch to space. Upon return, post-flight samples were collected at R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 days. i4 PBMC Single cell sequencing and analysis Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10 × Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference93. Dot plots are generated by the Seurat R package. JAXA cell-free epigenome (CFE) study RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA’s Open Science Data Repository with accession number: OSD-53039. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. Heatmaps were made for the frailty genes on the normalized values per time point using R package pheatmap version 1.0.12. Quantification of genes associated with sarcopenia The curated short gene list of predictors of sarcopenia was obtained by analyzing a population of age matched individuals with and without sarcopenia using the expression superserie GSE111017. This list contains 21 genes that can predict sarcopenia in patients with an accuracy > 75%. The method for obtaining the gene list was performed as previously described29. Here, we used GOstat 2022-11-03 on R version 4.2 to find enriched Biological Process and Molecular Function terms (Fig A and C). Using the obtained GO terms we found that some of the Frailty linked genes from JAXA CFE were also part of some of the same processes (Fig B and D). The figure was created using the GOplot package 1.0.2 and modified to display the MAS for each gene. Finally, to determine the relevance of the shared 21 genes between all gene lists (Fig E), we assessed their expression in the mice datasets OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, and OSD-105. Finally, the heatmap was generated as before using python 3 v3.10.0 language, through the Seaborn v0.12.1 and Clustermap v0.11.12 libraries and a dendrogram has also been added for each graph. Metabolic flux simulation analysis We ran metabolic flux simulation on all available metabolic reactions for each RNA sequencing sample while applying our custom-made context-specific constraint-based metabolic modeling approach significantly updated from23,94,95. This updated simulation model was constructed based on the RECON3D metabolic model57 whose metabolic reactions were subsetted through CORDA96 and Cobrapy97 with gene-reaction-rule, where enzyme expression levels are linked to their corresponding metabolic reactions. For CORDA, flux confidence parameters ranging from 3 to 1 were decided as; (i) 55%, 25%, and 20% for OSD-91; (ii) 45%, 40%, and 15% for OSD-127, in order to minimize standard deviation of flux-levels across samples from each group for all groups. Also, several essential pathways such as ‘Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis’, ‘CoA Synthesis’, ‘CoA Catabolism’, ‘NAD Metabolism’, ‘Fatty Acid Synthesis’, ‘Fatty Acid Oxidation’, and ‘Biomass and Maintenance Functions’ were manually activated for the simulation model stability. Note that ‘Oxidative Phosphorylation’ and ‘Citric Acid Cycle’ were not included in the essential pathways to take into account mitochondrial dysregulation. Our metabolic model initially optimized for NAD biosynthesis whose capacity through all pathways of human was computed by estimating optimized ‘NAD sink’ reaction flux level where the sink was defined as large pools of metabolites importing metabolites from/to the system. Subsequently, optimization for all available reactions was conducted iteratively to compute flux levels of their corresponding reactions by Gurobi solver as LP whose reference manual can be found in https://www.gurobi.com98. While gene expression levels were applied into the model by each sample, the other parameters were maintained identically for all simulation, where an environment i.e., Jupyter notebook 6.1.5 on Python 3.7.7 was utilized. The simulation reported outcomes as flux levels of all available reactions through the custom-made flux balance analysis (FBA) analyses and the levels were analyzed as grouped variables for comparison between ‘Flight’ and ‘Ground’ groups. Since it is hard to presume variance or normality between ‘Flight’ and ‘Ground’, a non-parametric Van der Waerden (VdW) test was applied to properly compare their flux levels using the R matrixTests package (v. 0.1.9). The comparison is illustrated as heatmaps with row-wise Z-scores on flux levels per each reaction in Fig. 8. Tabular data of metabolic flux analysis is shown in supplement 6.",
    "results": "Results Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in rodent muscles during spaceflight To determine the impact of frailty during spaceflight, we constructed, based on previous literature19–22, a list of putative frailty biomarker genes for humans and mice (Supplementary Data 1). Mouse (OSD-21, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105) datasets from OSDR were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in flight versus control condition with a statistical cut-off of adjusted p-value < 0.5. In mice, altered expression of frailty-related genes in the following tissues were identified: gastrocnemius (34 genes in OSD-21 and 8 genes in OSD-101); extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (45 genes in OSD-99); quadriceps (26 genes in OSD-101); soleus (36 genes in OSD-104); tibialis anterior (32 genes in OSD-105) (Fig. 2A). A maximum number of four frailty-related genes was also found to be unique to each tissue type and a maximum number of 4 was common between the different datasets (Supplementary Data 2). Hierarchical clustering of the overlapping gene expression across muscle types revealed a bias towards the up-regulation of frailty-related genes (Fig. 2B). As an example, the extensor digitorum longus had several upregulated genes (EGLN3, PTGS2, VDR, FREM2, KRT18, BCL2L1, LGALS3, CXCL10, CX3CL1, FNDC5, TGFB1, CAN, and PPARGC1A). Whereas the soleus (OSD-104) had relatively few downregulated genes (GDF15, PTGS2, BDNF, PAX5, CX3CL1, FNDC5, VCAN, CALU, and SESN2). Figure 2.

Rodent samples comprise spaceflight skeletal muscle. Heatmap considers only DEG with adjusted p-value < 0.5. Black color indicates no value. Interferon inflammatory response and muscle tissue development pathways are enriched in rodent muscles during spaceflight To determine overall frailty impact of spaceflight on tissues Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)23 analysis was performed on specific aging-related pathways (selected from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)23 (Supplementary Data 3). Rodent datasets showed a general enrichment of the pathways with an overall upregulation in EDL and tibialis anterior, downregulation in quadriceps, and a mixed regulation in gastrocnemius soleus (Fig. 3A,B). Summary themes of each functional cluster are displayed by the external color panel at the right side of sub-figure B and C. Despite a mixed direction of regulation, a clear enrichment of these pathways in the spaceflight group when compared to the control was evident across the datasets. The soleus muscle revealed an increase in the innate immune response inflammatory signature and concomitant downregulation of the IGF-1 pathway (Fig. 3B). Previous literature showed that the soleus muscle is the first to be impacted by spaceflight and also known to experience a significant dysregulation of mitochondrial and immune functions in space24. Immune response can downregulate IGF-1 anabolic activity, promoting muscle wasting16. Of note, this muscle shows the largest decline in mass in the RR1 mission and IGF-1 pathway might be involved25. Several putative aging-related pathways were enriched in human datasets (Fig. 3C), showing up-regulation in the majority of cases. Of note, interferon alpha and gamma response pathways are upregulated in all the datasets investigated. The increase in immune and inflammatory signatures we identified is consistent with various reports that associate chronic inflammation with frailty, although causality has yet to be established8,26. Nonetheless, our results could be useful for biomarkers related to spaceflight risk and consistent with clinical correlations of increased low-grade inflammation and muscle wasting16. Figure 3.

The dark gray locations in the heatmap indicate missing values for the NES, resulting from off-range adjusted p-values (padj) of the analysis. The assumed range is padj < 0.3. Novel sarcopenia-related genes are differentially expressed during spaceflight Sarcopenia is a condition associated with frailty. In our analysis, the best predictors of sarcopenia were genes that are part of autophagic and protein degradation processes. After studying databases from 118 people with and without sarcopenia (GSE111006, GSE111010, and GSE111016)27, 6,892 DEGs were identified by performing Mann–Whitney U tests28 on gene expression data for every single gene (i.e., 65,217 genes) in a pair-wise manner across samples from both sets of patients (Supplementary Data 4). A simple classifier (i.e., k-nearest neighbors) was then used to estimate individual predictive power for that condition29. Next, via co-expression network analysis upon these DEGs, the most highly correlated module (i.e., BROWN = 0.93) to sarcopenia was found. We used a pathway and gene ontology analysis upon BROWN to curate a list of 21 genes that were significantly enriched in biological processes related to sarcopenia30. Here, we found that the frailty biomarkers list was enriched in Biological Processes Gene Ontology (BP GO) terms in a very similar manner to those found with sarcopenic biomarkers alone (Fig. 4A)29. In addition to BP GO, the same was true for molecular functions (MF) GO term enrichment (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, we found that eight of the biomarkers identified for frailty had the ability to predict sarcopenia in GSE111006, GSE111010, and GSE111016 with a Mean Accuracy Score (MAS) of > 0.65 (RP1L1, SH3GL3, HIF1A, FGF23, FASLG, MAS1, PAX5, and REV1) (Fig. 4B,D). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Evidence of shared catabolic pathways between sarcopenia and frailty markers and their differential expression in space-flown mice.

(E) Schematic of the data utilized for the heatmap showing the four genes out of the 21 sarcopenia frailty genes that were present in the murine data sets. Heatmap considers only DEG with p < 0.05.Using the sarcopenia gene expression classifier we had established above, we re-examined the existing datasets for alterations in the 21 genes. To do so, we took the expression data from the murine datasets (EDL (ODS-99), left gastrocnemius (ODS-101), quadriceps (ODS-103), soleus (ODS-104), and tibialis anterior (ODS-105)) and evaluated the expression of our sarcopenia classifier (Fig. 4E). We found that only GJB4, HNRNPCL1, GOLGA2 and POMC were DEGs in at least one of the datasets. GJB4 is a connexin (Cx) gene encoding the gap junction protein CX30.331. HNRNPCL1 plays a role in consolidating the nucleosome and neutralizing core hnRNPs proteins32. GOLGA2 encodes the GM130 protein necessary for the assembly of the Golgi apparatus. Interestingly, mutations in GOLGA2 lead to neuromuscular disorders and muscular dystrophy33. POMC codes for the precursor protein proopiomelanocortin producing active peptides generating melanocyte stimulating hormones (MSHs), corticotropin (ACTH) and β-endorphin. POMC deficiency leads to adrenal failure and obesity34. Of note, the dataset from the soleus muscle in mice (OSD-104), demonstrated to have a significant overexpression of GJB4, POMC and significant downregulation of HNRNPC (p < 0.05). Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in human muscles during spaceflight We applied the same list of putative frailty biomarker genes (Supplementary Data 1) to investigate differentially expressed genes in Open Science Dataset’s human samples as in Fig. 2. OSD-52 and 195 were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in flight, on random positioning machine or in bed rest versus control condition with a statistical cut-off of adjusted p-value < 0.5. Vastus lateralis muscle (OSD-52), cardiac progenitors (OSD-127) and endothelial cells (OSD-195) showed 22, 2 and 4 frailty-related genes, respectively (Fig. 5A). Figure 5.

The transcriptomic signature of spaceflight is investigated with differential expression analysis in multiple tissues.

(C) Heatmap of differential expression analysis for the frailty gene in human samples. Human samples comprise spaceflight human umbilical vein endothelial cells, bed rest skeletal muscle cells and cardiac progenitors differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture under simulated microgravity. Heatmap considers only DEG with adjusted p-value < 0.5. Black color indicates no value.We compared the differential expression profiles between mice and human dataset. Approximately a third of the frailty genes were conserved between humans and mice, which suggests that the murine models can provide good translation to human biology (Fig. 5B). Out of 73 differentially expressed frailty-related genes, 22 (32%) were common in humans and mice (Fig. 5B). Forty-three (62%) were unique to mice and 4 (6%) were unique to only humans. In humans, 9 frailty genes were upregulated and 13 were downregulated in the vastus lateralis muscle (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Data 2). Several downregulated genes were associated with immunity-related pathways, while most upregulated genes were associated with metabolism and Vitamin K or D pathways. In endothelial cells, two genes were downregulated, and two were upregulated. The downregulated genes, TMEM245 and PPARGC1A, are associated with the cell-membrane and gluconeogenesis, while the upregulated genes, MSTN and PTGS2, are associated with regulation of skeletal muscle growth and prostaglandin biosynthesis (Supplementary Data 5)35. While there is no direct link between gluconeogenesis and frailty, both are related to the body's response to stress and maintaining homeostasis. Diabetes, a condition that affects glucose metabolism, has been linked to frailty36,37. In diabetes, the body's ability to regulate blood glucose levels is impaired, potentially impacting gluconeogenesis. Frail individuals, who have a diminished ability to resist stressors, may be more susceptible to the effects of these metabolic imbalances38. Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in astronauts Having confirmed altered aging and frailty signatures in largely rodent transcriptomic data, we wanted to test if frailty biomarkers were also altered in astronauts. To enable this analysis, we used two recent studies39. First, using astronaut data from JAXA plasma cell-free RNA profiling study, we examined the changes occurring in RNAs from the frailty biomarker genes between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight (i.e., after return to Earth) (Fig. 6). Our RNA analysis reveals a global response of frailty-related gene expression to the space environment, which is characterized by in-flight and post-flight expression changes. Most of the genes investigated were subject to changes when compared to pre-flight conditions, either during spaceflight or later after return to Earth. A large number of genes that were reduced during spaceflight showed an increase after re-entry (e.g., AKT1, NOS2, FGF23, and HIF3A). Conversely, several genes show an opposite behavior and tended to be reduced during spaceflight, and underwent reduction after re-entry (e.g., TGFB1, B2M, NOS1, AOC1, SOD2, SOD3, and OAZ1). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Frailty-related biomarkers are differentially expressed in astronauts exposed to 120-days of Low Earth Orbit Spaceflight. Putative frailty linked genes from JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE). Heatmap of the normalized plasma cell-free RNA expression values for the frailty genes over time for the six astronauts over 120 days in space from JAXA study. The values shown are the averaged normalized expression values for all six astronauts for each time point during flight and post-flight. The three pre-flight time points were averaged together, since the changes for genes in the time leading up to flight are considered to be the same and part of the baseline values. For the time, L = Launch (i.e., meaning time after launch from Earth and the number indicates length in space) and R = Return to Earth.Interestingly, cell-free RNAs from several genes (e.g,. FGF23, KRT18, AKT1, B2M, NOS1, AOC1, SOD2 and SOD3) did not return to the pre-flight baseline levels, even after 120 days. The data suggest that space conditions alter the HIF1 pathway which stimulates the various molecular or cellular processes related to hypoxia-responsive genes such as HIF1A, HIF1AN, ARNT, ARNT2, NOS1, NOS2, NOTCH1 and RBX1, that are known to regulate a wide variety of cellular physiology including metabolic reprogramming, anti-apoptosis, migration, proliferation, amyloid β production and prion stabilization40,41. An interesting observation emerging from the data is the increased cell-free RNA signature of HIF1A and HIF3A post-flight. Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) is a key regulator of immune cell function42, and its dysregulation could alter immune response. We also observe an increase of RNAs derived from several nitric oxide (NO) related genes, which are biologic mediators in multiple processes, such as in neurotransmission and microbial and antitumoral activities. It is understood that nitric oxide (NO) is a key vasodilator in the cardiovascular system and its synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme family nitric oxide synthases (NOS), neuronal (NOS1), inducible (NOS2) and endothelial synthases (NOS3)43. NOS1 and NOS2 are constitutively expressed by tubules of the human kidney, while NOS3 is expressed by endothelial cells and is implicated with the formation and maintenance of vascularized tissues. Furthermore, AKT1 plays a role in the signal transduction of growth factors, as well as in cell survival, cellular senescence, and aging. There is evidence that AKT signaling is associated with an imbalance of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases that is altering the aged brain44. Chronic AKT activation intensified aging-induced cardiac hypertrophy in murine heart tissues45. In connection to phosphate intake, FGF23 is known to be secreted from the skeletal system and influence the kidneys through the klotho gene receptor36. The upregulation of HIF-related genes could be interpreted through findings from earlier studies which have implicated the HIF pathway with the impairment of energy-dependent cellular processes, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA which accelerate aging processes41,46. Next, we used data from the first civilian commercial 3-day space mission (referred to as Inspiration4 (I4), to examine the impact of short-duration spaceflight on putative frailty biomarker transcriptomic signature47. From the I4 mission, single-cell gene expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were generated and compared across multiple timepoints (Fig. 7A). Frailty genes were increased in PBMCs and subpopulations post-flight compared to pre-flight timepoints, and the percentage of the increased genes were higher than the percentage of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Fig. 7B). The percentage of increased frailty genes was the highest in PBMCs, lowest in dendritic cells (DCs), and similar in the remaining subpopulations (Fig. 7B). Generally, the average expression and percentage of expression of the increased genes were increased at R + 1 compared to pre-flights (L-92, L-44, L-3) and returned to baseline over time (Fig. 7C). For example, several genes were upregulated in various pathways at R + 1 compared to pre-flight and reverted to baseline over time. Implicated pathways include: immunity (ARG2, PPARD), EGFR trafficking (ATXN2), regulators of apoptosis (BCL2L1, FAS), survival factor for neuronal cell types (CNTF), cell–cell signaling (JAG1), metabolism (PPARD), DNA repair (REV1), neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission (SNX14), structural component of sarcomeric Z-line (TMEM245) and cell cycle regulation (TP53) (Fig. 7C).

The image shows the differential expression values for each cell type in analysis. The values are based on expression for each time point before-flight and post-flight. However, data from samples collected just after reentry (R + 1) is considered spaceflight condition. For the time, L = Launch, R = Return to Earth, the number + n is the time (in days) after L or R. Metabolic flux simulations of gene expression changes reveal dysregulation of metabolic functions related to frailty Having found alterations in gene expression associated with aging and frailty and knowing that biologic systems are dynamic, we used a subset of the gene expression to examine dynamic changes in metabolism. We applied our updated, context-specific, metabolic models that performed custom-made flux balance analysis (FBA) simulations. Here, we used two different transcriptional changes (RNA-seq) between flight and ground (OSD-91 (GSE65943) for cultured human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells; and OSD-127 (E-GEOD-84582) for cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells) (Fig. 8).

The leftmost bar represents differential testing results between Flight and Ground in p values < 0.05 (black) or p values between 0.05 and 0.1 (gray) through the Van Der Waerden test. Genes in the boxes are enzymes showing significantly different expressions for their corresponding reactions.In TK6 lymphoblastoid cells, microgravity led to transcriptional changes through altered methylation patterns. These transcriptional changes, in turn, altered the oxidative stress and carbohydrate metabolism pathways48. However, the flux simulation analysis showed that other pathways associated with lipid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and bile acid synthesis, are downregulated during flight. While chondroitin sulfate degradation, nucleotide interconversion, and peroxisomal transport are upregulated. Considering the carbohydrate metabolism aspect of the flux simulation analysis, only pyruvate metabolism (end product of glycolysis) showed significantly altered expression in microgravity (Figs. 8A,C). By contrast, the other metabolic flux simulation displayed marked up-regulation during flight in lipid metabolism associated pathways: fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism (Figs. 8B,D). The cells also exhibited increased galactose metabolism, nucleotide interconversion, Coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis, glutathione metabolism, as well as pentose phosphate pathway in carbohydrate metabolism. The only significant downregulation in microgravity was detected in folate metabolism. This cardiomyocyte study (using 3D tissue engineering of cardiac progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells) found increased gene expression levels associated with growth, development, and survival for cardiac progenitors in microgravity49.",
    "discussion": "Discussion To our knowledge, no prior links to frailty-like signatures have been observed in the context of spaceflight, and these markers represent an important direction for future research, especially as mission durations increase to years. In recent years, human space research has benefitted from collecting and integrating diverse types of biological data, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, and storing them in biobanks for future analysis19,50. These multi-omics data and biobanks continue to provide valuable insights into the aging-like processes in astronauts during long-term space missions and help identify potential biomarkers and interventions to counteract them25,51–53. In our manuscript, we include data from NASA’s OSDR, the SpaceX Inspiration4 and the JAXA astronaut study. These initiatives are hallmarks in the development of data banking strategies such as the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)54. The NASA Twins study along with the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome and Inspiration4 data reported here and elsewhere (Figs. 6 and 7) highlight the emerging ability to conduct omic analyses on astronaut samples 27,39,55. We propose the use of omics data to investigate the development of aging-like phenomena in spaceflight, which can also help improve our understanding of aging metrics like clonal hematopoiesis56, and also link to a wide array of new data from the SOMA package of data and papers 48,53,55,55,57–65. Space medicine research has been mostly focused on the acute and medium-term effects of spaceflight on human physiology. However, some attributes related to the exposure to the space environment resemble aging-like pathophysiology: DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction3. Because of these similarities, observations from the aging field can be useful to understand the biological changes driven by spaceflight. In contrast with aging on Earth, it is unclear whether those molecular modifications last after reentry, and for this reason we refer to them as aging-like phenomena. Nevertheless, despite acute events such as space motion sickness and autonomic imbalance resolving after astronaut’s return to ground, the effects of these aging-like alterations might be clinically manifest in a chronic exposure scenario, like a long-duration mission to Mars, and could potentially trigger chronic disease development. Studies in genetic/genomic aging models such as C. elegans and clinical evidence have demonstrated that the control of lifespan and health span are not identical49,53; therefore, there is an increasing need to identify markers able to determine the biological age of an individual. One proposed marker is the frailty index, which can serve as a better health indicator than chronological age, translating what is suggested by previous biological and clinical literature7. Here, we examined if aging and putative frailty biomarkers change during spaceflight. Our results from both rodent and human samples suggest that alterations indeed occurred in aging-related pathways to a different extent depending on the tissue. Importantly, we also found changes in expression of putative frailty genes, raising the possibility that these could be used as indicators of physiological changes during spaceflight much as they are being examined for utility in clinical assessment of physiological changes with age on Earth. Beyond health assessment, the ability to conduct -omic studies on astronauts allows for combining astronaut and model organism datasets in order to conduct truly translational research in space. Such studies would expand our understanding of molecular control of (patho)physiological changes in response to spaceflight. The expression of putative frailty related biomarkers in JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome samples is altered during spaceflight, compared to ground control, as shown in Fig. 6; interestingly, several gene expression levels do not return to baseline after reentry. Although their expression could revert to normal after a longer period, this altered expression could hint to the presence of spaceflight-induced modifications that persist for longer than expected. For example, AKT1 is upregulated at all timepoints after reentry. A persisted upregulation of the gene is linked to age related cardiac disease and dementia in animal models45,46. The presence of biomarker gene expression that does not revert to normal challenges the concept that every physiological change induced by spaceflight is reverted after astronauts’ return to Earth. This notion is not novel, for example, a recent report showed the development of distinct mutational profiles in astronauts66; on these bases, it would be worth monitoring these biomarkers for longer timepoints after reentry, and to exclude the possibility that they underlie any sub-clinical disease development. Permanent modifications after exposure to important stressors happen in patients as well. For instance, admission to Intensive Care Unit and severe COVID-19 have been associated with epigenetic changes that might alter aging-related gene expression45,46. In addition to long-term spaceflight exposure, short-duration spaceflight data such as those provided by the i4 mission are also relevant to detect early signs of frailty development. In fact, frailty is not only associated to long term chronic disease pathways: clinical research hints that short term exposure to stressors such as COVID-19 hyperinflammatory response are capable of developing frailty-associated traits56. Regardless, longer spaceflight duration might be required to detect wider alterations in putative frailty biomarkers and clinically manifested phenotypes in astronauts; this highlights the need for further studies and validation. Differential expression of frailty genes in astronauts’ cell-free DNA and PBMCs (Figs. 6 and 7) is not inherently the same as what is observed in the Open Science Dataset’s (OSDs) human samples (Fig. 5). Despite frailty signals potentially being detected in astronaut’s blood, it is not feasible to directly pair this result with the differential expression of frailty-related genes in muscle biopsies, due to the absence of matched data. As previously suggested, this represents an opportunity to apply cutting-edge clinical research tools for monitoring and researching astronaut health. Indeed, genome sequencing onboard the ISS is currently used in the microbiological monitoring program67, paving the way for use in astronaut studies on the ISS. Previous studies of astronaut health have largely been conducted using standard clinical markers such as blood panels. While there is an emerging blood panel for assessment of frailty68, these would need to be processed on Earth. By contrast, the assessment of a future clinically validated transcriptomic panel for frailty could be conducted on ISS or other spacecrafts. Regardless of which panel or where such a panel is assessed, our findings suggest that future studies aimed at establishing such a validated model for astronauts could be fruitful areas of investigation for monitoring and improving astronaut health in- and post-flight. The establishment and validation of such a panel could either be done by correlating with physiological measures already captured by NASA’s standard measures program or correlating with physiological measures adapted from the emerging frailty indexes. One of the most pronounced findings in both rodent and human datasets is the induction of interferon alpha and gamma responsive pathways. Interferons are cytokines associated with modulation of the immune response which is a known consequence of spaceflight69. Our observation of the activation of interferon pathways (Fig. 3) suggests that the activation of the innate immune system is a conserved mammalian response to spaceflight and aging. In the aging field, the concept of inflammaging suggests that the chronic low-grade dysregulation of the immune system that happens with aging underpins the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, and sarcopenia7. Indeed, at least ten clinical biomarkers of inflammation correlate well with the frailty index70. Making the inflammaging parallel to spaceflight, it could be that an increased low-grade inflammatory response during spaceflight drives and/or worsens frailty and/or related processes (for example muscle wasting)67,71. Low grade inflammation contributes to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis on Earth7,72. In addition, radiation exposure can also lead to the development of cardiovascular disease in case of occupational exposure, as well as in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy69,71,73. In astronauts, atherosclerosis could be promoted by an increased inflammatory status promoted by different stressors of the space environment (Fig. 1), and radiation exposure would play a primary role for it. Moon and Mars missions have a different radiation environment compared with the ISS, as astronauts traveling beyond Low Earth Orbit are potentially exposed to higher doses of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle event radiation69. Elevated radiation exposure promotes multiple dysregulations, causing cellular senescence in the endothelium, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, driving endothelial dysfunction71. Exposure to higher doses of space radiation beyond low Earth orbit could also have a different, and perhaps increased, impact on frailty-related hallmarks and genes. Concerning endothelial dysfunction, an interplay between nitric oxide metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species and radiation exposure could play a role in the development of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease, as well as other disease pathways, in space74,75. Moreover, a pro-inflammatory and oxidative environment might facilitate the development of the spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)76; this condition would also increase the disability status of the crew. Across species, altered metabolism is one of the most consistently reported responses to spaceflight. Unsurprisingly, these changes vary from organism to organism among microbes and tissue to tissue in animals (Fig. 8). A recent rodent transcriptomic study confirmed that the typical mammalian coordination of metabolism between the liver and muscles on Earth continues to function similarly in flight77. This metabolic axis is a key determinator of health with age, whose disruption is associated with obesity, diabetes, and frailty. Emerging techniques such as metabolomics are beginning to address the role and mechanisms of metabolic alteration in human muscle with age73. Here we have employed another emerging analytical approach, metabolic flux modeling from transcriptomic data (Fig. 8). Our results confirm that metabolic flux analysis successfully demonstrated metabolic alterations as expected, dependent on tissue type. Importantly, while our results confirm past observations that mitochondrial and metabolic changes are conserved features of space flown tissues and organisms3, they also demonstrate that the functional changes via metabolic flux are more important than the simple global up versus down changes often employed with reductionist approaches. The effect of microgravity exposure may cause specific mitochondrial protein adaptations that affect skeletal muscle tissue, namely 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, palmitate oxidation and cytochrome c oxidase enzymatic activity75,78,79. It is noteworthy that tissues might respond differently to microgravity and the mitochondrial bioenergetics adaptations seen in skeletal muscle may be different from the ones seen in cardiac muscle; however new sequencing data may provide an insight into these differences18,75. Thus, using data from multiple tissues and time points begins to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of frailty in response to spaceflight. Importantly, our results demonstrate that these approaches can be employed directly in astronauts and/or in combination with model systems. Muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging. It is also thought to contribute to frailty. Recently, functional measures of muscle decline with age have been well correlated with evolutionarily conserved gene expression changes with age27,74. In humans, changes in metabolic gene expression appear to occur prior to changes in inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that aging human muscle undergoes metabolic remodeling prior to becoming inflamed and sarcopenic—also highlighting the importance of temporal/dynamic data71. Similarly, in humans subjected to bedrest, an analogue for spaceflight, changes in metabolic gene expression and metabolic activity are an early event tied to altered intramuscular calcium levels80. The recent study of muscle-liver metabolic cross talk in mice used the same mouse muscle datasets we used for this manuscript (Fig. 8) and found altered glucose and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight, consistent with past literature on space flown mammalian muscle77. Combining this past analysis with our new analysis of sarcopenic gene expression changes, it is noteworthy that few sarcopenic gene expression changes are noted in the space flown muscles with more observed changes in the soleus, which was the muscle displaying the largest decline in mass25. Together, these results raise the possibility that metabolic changes may indeed precede the loss of muscle mass in spaceflight, as observed with age and bedrest on Earth. It remains an open question if, like sarcopenia, metabolic alterations occur earlier than the inflammatory alterations in flight and whether inflammation or an altered metabolism is the key driver for a frailty-like phenotype in space. Lastly, given the similarities between transcriptomic changes with age and spaceflight, the facts that estrogen receptor has recently been proposed to be a key regulator of muscle gene expression changes with age and that estrogen receptor pathways have recently been shown to display differences in flight, raise the possibility that estrogen receptor pathways are key modulators of muscle health in space27,77,81. The restriction of available sources poses a frequent challenge in the field of space medical and biological research. In order to adequately tackle our research inquiry with comprehensive information, we adopted a diverse range of data from various public sources. It is essential to note that each individual experimental model incorporated does not entirely encapsulate the complete biology of astronauts exposed to space conditions. Therefore, caution is advised when extending conclusions from one model system to another or from cellular and tissue-level observations to the overall phenotypes of organisms. Nonetheless, a noteworthy aspect of our findings is the utilization of a weight-of-evidence approach, wherein data across multiple models are analyzed. This method reveals conserved pathways that consistently emerge in independent datasets, likely indicating fundamental biological responses akin to frailty in the context of spaceflight. Pursuing the development of biobanks for multi-omics data will deeply benefit space medicine and biology research. Yet, concurrently, bridging the gap between molecular changes, pathophysiological processes and phenotype development requires multi-omics biological data to be associated with individual physical metrics. This is crucial to investigate complex syndromes such as frailty. Future studies will be conducted to observe global and systemic impact on how the frailty index will change during spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166946 PMID: 38862573 Abstract Human space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts’ health, leading to molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted. Subject terms: Genetics, Medical researchIntroduction Missions beyond low Earth orbit are the new frontier of crewed space exploration. Future missions to Mars as well as long-duration missions to the Moon will be significantly more sustained than any previous deep space mission. During transit, the space environment presents key challenges for astronauts’ safety1. Previous literature describes microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation and confinement as major stressors that are able to induce pathophysiological changes in the heart, skeletal muscle, and immune system, as well as bone loss, central nervous system alterations, and increased cancer risk2–4. Thus, there is increasing interest to identify the molecular mechanisms driving those health risks, including changes in mitochondrial function, genetic and epigenetic regulation, telomere-length dynamics, DNA damage, and oxidative stress3,5 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-related stressors share similarities with the hallmarks of aging: mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and telomere length changes (including brief elongation in flight and increased shorter telomeres post-flight), cellular senescence, and dysbiosis, among others6. As a defined set of aging-related molecular changes, the hallmarks of aging may be specifically studied to assess spaceflight impact on human physiology, which could induce a condition similar to premature or pathological aging3. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Effects of spaceflight and a model of aging. Human spaceflight presents five major challenges: space radiation, altered gravity, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, and hostile/closed environments are hazards for crewed spaceflight. These stressors support pathophysiological alterations and cellular and molecular changes which could be involved in the development of biological aging and frailty in astronauts. Muscle loss in astronauts has a similar pathophysiology as sarcopenia in the elderly. Created using BioRender.Aging is a state of depleted biological resilience resulting in an increased vulnerability to stressors. It leads to a systemic loss of the body’s capacity to maintain homeostasis and health3. The aging phenotype manifests in metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurological deterioration, and cancer7. Old age is also marked by immune dysregulation, which can result in a chronic low-grade inflammation state called inflammaging, a status associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers in blood and tissues8. The deterioration in muscle quality and quantity is another feature of aging, characterized by altered myofiber metabolism and impaired satellite cell activity9. Loss of muscle mass increases the risk of developing other comorbidities, in a vicious cycle that leads to unhealthy aging. These traits are often associated with a multifactorial geriatric syndrome known as “frailty”10. Frailty, a recent concept in aging science, can be defined as a syndrome caused by the combined effect of numerous age-related alterations. These alterations lead to a depletion of physiological reserve and/or deterioration of cognitive functions, resulting in an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Frailty can be clinically diagnosed by the presence of three or more of the following components: unintentional weight loss over the last year, weakness, exhaustion, slow gait, and low physical activity level11. Other criteria for diagnosing and assessing frailty are functional factors such as grip strength and gait speed12,13. More holistic definitions of frailty also consider the presence of comorbidities, cognitive impairment, psychosocial risk factors and other common geriatric syndromes14. The use of clinical scores to quantify frailty has been attempted, but it is undermined by encountered limitations in terms of ethnicity, risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis. However, advancements in the understanding of the biological processes related to frailty and aging, along with the development of high-throughput techniques, allowed the development of novel assessment models based on “omics” biomarkers15. Part of the deconditioning of human physiology caused by spaceflight resembles the features of frail patients, for instance the physical component related to muscle loss. Sarcopenia is generally defined as a progressive age-related condition characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle quality, performance, strength, and mass16. When this condition is driven by aging, it is defined as primary sarcopenia9. Interestingly, muscle loss in astronauts shares similarities with sarcopenia in the elderly, especially during long duration spaceflight, and could be interpreted as a sarcopenia-like syndrome17,18. The study of frailty traits in astronauts involves the investigation of aging’s biological pathways, which could be elicited by the space environment. Yet, despite the reported similarities between the features of frailty and consequence of spaceflight, it remains unclear whether the space environment can influence the onset of age-related dysfunctions in astronauts. Getting insights about the signatures of frailty and sarcopenia in spaceflight data is a key step towards the development of countermeasures to achieve safer crewed space missions and translate therapy to patients on Earth. Here, we hypothesize the emergence of aging, frailty and sarcopenia related transcriptomic signatures during and after spaceflight in astronauts, murine and cellular models. We investigate this occurrence using multi-omics and systems-informatic approaches. We analyzed transcriptomic data from rodent research missions flown to the International Space Station (ISS) (available from NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), previously known as GeneLab18), astronaut data from a recent JAXA study, and data from the first civilian commercial spaceflight mission, Inspiration4 (i4). We identified altered expression in genes related to frailty and muscle loss, that may lead to an early frailty phenotype. Our results raise the possibility that exposure to the space environment leads to changes consistent with frailty, including inflammation, muscle wasting and other age-related features. Our findings propose a method to study the development of frailty-related health risks, which astronauts may develop during spaceflight, in the perspective of achieving adequate preventative measures.Results Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in rodent muscles during spaceflight To determine the impact of frailty during spaceflight, we constructed, based on previous literature19–22, a list of putative frailty biomarker genes for humans and mice (Supplementary Data 1). Mouse (OSD-21, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105) datasets from OSDR were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in flight versus control condition with a statistical cut-off of adjusted p-value < 0.5. In mice, altered expression of frailty-related genes in the following tissues were identified: gastrocnemius (34 genes in OSD-21 and 8 genes in OSD-101); extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (45 genes in OSD-99); quadriceps (26 genes in OSD-101); soleus (36 genes in OSD-104); tibialis anterior (32 genes in OSD-105) (Fig. 2A). A maximum number of four frailty-related genes was also found to be unique to each tissue type and a maximum number of 4 was common between the different datasets (Supplementary Data 2). Hierarchical clustering of the overlapping gene expression across muscle types revealed a bias towards the up-regulation of frailty-related genes (Fig. 2B). As an example, the extensor digitorum longus had several upregulated genes (EGLN3, PTGS2, VDR, FREM2, KRT18, BCL2L1, LGALS3, CXCL10, CX3CL1, FNDC5, TGFB1, CAN, and PPARGC1A). Whereas the soleus (OSD-104) had relatively few downregulated genes (GDF15, PTGS2, BDNF, PAX5, CX3CL1, FNDC5, VCAN, CALU, and SESN2). Figure 2.

Rodent samples comprise spaceflight skeletal muscle. Heatmap considers only DEG with adjusted p-value < 0.5. Black color indicates no value.Interferon inflammatory response and muscle tissue development pathways are enriched in rodent muscles during spaceflight To determine overall frailty impact of spaceflight on tissues Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)23 analysis was performed on specific aging-related pathways (selected from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)23 (Supplementary Data 3). Rodent datasets showed a general enrichment of the pathways with an overall upregulation in EDL and tibialis anterior, downregulation in quadriceps, and a mixed regulation in gastrocnemius soleus (Fig. 3A,B). Summary themes of each functional cluster are displayed by the external color panel at the right side of sub-figure B and C. Despite a mixed direction of regulation, a clear enrichment of these pathways in the spaceflight group when compared to the control was evident across the datasets. The soleus muscle revealed an increase in the innate immune response inflammatory signature and concomitant downregulation of the IGF-1 pathway (Fig. 3B). Previous literature showed that the soleus muscle is the first to be impacted by spaceflight and also known to experience a significant dysregulation of mitochondrial and immune functions in space24. Immune response can downregulate IGF-1 anabolic activity, promoting muscle wasting16. Of note, this muscle shows the largest decline in mass in the RR1 mission and IGF-1 pathway might be involved25. Several putative aging-related pathways were enriched in human datasets (Fig. 3C), showing up-regulation in the majority of cases. Of note, interferon alpha and gamma response pathways are upregulated in all the datasets investigated. The increase in immune and inflammatory signatures we identified is consistent with various reports that associate chronic inflammation with frailty, although causality has yet to be established8,26. Nonetheless, our results could be useful for biomarkers related to spaceflight risk and consistent with clinical correlations of increased low-grade inflammation and muscle wasting16. Figure 3.

The dark gray locations in the heatmap indicate missing values for the NES, resulting from off-range adjusted p-values (padj) of the analysis. The assumed range is padj < 0.3.Novel sarcopenia-related genes are differentially expressed during spaceflight Sarcopenia is a condition associated with frailty. In our analysis, the best predictors of sarcopenia were genes that are part of autophagic and protein degradation processes. After studying databases from 118 people with and without sarcopenia (GSE111006, GSE111010, and GSE111016)27, 6,892 DEGs were identified by performing Mann–Whitney U tests28 on gene expression data for every single gene (i.e., 65,217 genes) in a pair-wise manner across samples from both sets of patients (Supplementary Data 4). A simple classifier (i.e., k-nearest neighbors) was then used to estimate individual predictive power for that condition29. Next, via co-expression network analysis upon these DEGs, the most highly correlated module (i.e., BROWN = 0.93) to sarcopenia was found. We used a pathway and gene ontology analysis upon BROWN to curate a list of 21 genes that were significantly enriched in biological processes related to sarcopenia30. Here, we found that the frailty biomarkers list was enriched in Biological Processes Gene Ontology (BP GO) terms in a very similar manner to those found with sarcopenic biomarkers alone (Fig. 4A)29. In addition to BP GO, the same was true for molecular functions (MF) GO term enrichment (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, we found that eight of the biomarkers identified for frailty had the ability to predict sarcopenia in GSE111006, GSE111010, and GSE111016 with a Mean Accuracy Score (MAS) of > 0.65 (RP1L1, SH3GL3, HIF1A, FGF23, FASLG, MAS1, PAX5, and REV1) (Fig. 4B,D).

(A) Significantly enriched Biological Processes using a curated biomarker gene list obtained by the overlap of three gene sets studying sarcopenia (superseries GSE111017: GSE111006, GSE111010, and GSE111016) defined through a Mann- Whitney analysis. (B) The frailty biomarkers found to be part of ten GO Biological Processes terms, from which R1PL1 had the highest Mean Accuracy Score (MAS) score.

(D) Similarly, three GO Molecular Function terms were found to be a shared pathway with the defined frailty biomarkers from which SH3GL3 had the highest MAS score. (E) Schematic of the data utilized for the heatmap showing the four genes out of the 21 sarcopenia frailty genes that were present in the murine data sets. Heatmap considers only DEG with p < 0.05.Using the sarcopenia gene expression classifier we had established above, we re-examined the existing datasets for alterations in the 21 genes. To do so, we took the expression data from the murine datasets (EDL (ODS-99), left gastrocnemius (ODS-101), quadriceps (ODS-103), soleus (ODS-104), and tibialis anterior (ODS-105)) and evaluated the expression of our sarcopenia classifier (Fig. 4E). We found that only GJB4, HNRNPCL1, GOLGA2 and POMC were DEGs in at least one of the datasets. GJB4 is a connexin (Cx) gene encoding the gap junction protein CX30.331. HNRNPCL1 plays a role in consolidating the nucleosome and neutralizing core hnRNPs proteins32. GOLGA2 encodes the GM130 protein necessary for the assembly of the Golgi apparatus. Interestingly, mutations in GOLGA2 lead to neuromuscular disorders and muscular dystrophy33. POMC codes for the precursor protein proopiomelanocortin producing active peptides generating melanocyte stimulating hormones (MSHs), corticotropin (ACTH) and β-endorphin. POMC deficiency leads to adrenal failure and obesity34. Of note, the dataset from the soleus muscle in mice (OSD-104), demonstrated to have a significant overexpression of GJB4, POMC and significant downregulation of HNRNPC (p < 0.05).Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in human muscles during spaceflight We applied the same list of putative frailty biomarker genes (Supplementary Data 1) to investigate differentially expressed genes in Open Science Dataset’s human samples as in Fig. 2. OSD-52 and 195 were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in flight, on random positioning machine or in bed rest versus control condition with a statistical cut-off of adjusted p-value < 0.5. Vastus lateralis muscle (OSD-52), cardiac progenitors (OSD-127) and endothelial cells (OSD-195) showed 22, 2 and 4 frailty-related genes, respectively (Fig. 5A). Figure 5.

(C) Heatmap of differential expression analysis for the frailty gene in human samples. Human samples comprise spaceflight human umbilical vein endothelial cells, bed rest skeletal muscle cells and cardiac progenitors differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture under simulated microgravity. Heatmap considers only DEG with adjusted p-value < 0.5. Black color indicates no value.We compared the differential expression profiles between mice and human dataset. Approximately a third of the frailty genes were conserved between humans and mice, which suggests that the murine models can provide good translation to human biology (Fig. 5B). Out of 73 differentially expressed frailty-related genes, 22 (32%) were common in humans and mice (Fig. 5B). Forty-three (62%) were unique to mice and 4 (6%) were unique to only humans. In humans, 9 frailty genes were upregulated and 13 were downregulated in the vastus lateralis muscle (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Data 2). Several downregulated genes were associated with immunity-related pathways, while most upregulated genes were associated with metabolism and Vitamin K or D pathways. In endothelial cells, two genes were downregulated, and two were upregulated. The downregulated genes, TMEM245 and PPARGC1A, are associated with the cell-membrane and gluconeogenesis, while the upregulated genes, MSTN and PTGS2, are associated with regulation of skeletal muscle growth and prostaglandin biosynthesis (Supplementary Data 5)35. While there is no direct link between gluconeogenesis and frailty, both are related to the body's response to stress and maintaining homeostasis. Diabetes, a condition that affects glucose metabolism, has been linked to frailty36,37. In diabetes, the body's ability to regulate blood glucose levels is impaired, potentially impacting gluconeogenesis. Frail individuals, who have a diminished ability to resist stressors, may be more susceptible to the effects of these metabolic imbalances38.Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in astronauts Having confirmed altered aging and frailty signatures in largely rodent transcriptomic data, we wanted to test if frailty biomarkers were also altered in astronauts. To enable this analysis, we used two recent studies39. First, using astronaut data from JAXA plasma cell-free RNA profiling study, we examined the changes occurring in RNAs from the frailty biomarker genes between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight (i.e., after return to Earth) (Fig. 6). Our RNA analysis reveals a global response of frailty-related gene expression to the space environment, which is characterized by in-flight and post-flight expression changes. Most of the genes investigated were subject to changes when compared to pre-flight conditions, either during spaceflight or later after return to Earth. A large number of genes that were reduced during spaceflight showed an increase after re-entry (e.g., AKT1, NOS2, FGF23, and HIF3A). Conversely, several genes show an opposite behavior and tended to be reduced during spaceflight, and underwent reduction after re-entry (e.g., TGFB1, B2M, NOS1, AOC1, SOD2, SOD3, and OAZ1). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Frailty-related biomarkers are differentially expressed in astronauts exposed to 120-days of Low Earth Orbit Spaceflight. Putative frailty linked genes from JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE). Heatmap of the normalized plasma cell-free RNA expression values for the frailty genes over time for the six astronauts over 120 days in space from JAXA study. The values shown are the averaged normalized expression values for all six astronauts for each time point during flight and post-flight. The three pre-flight time points were averaged together, since the changes for genes in the time leading up to flight are considered to be the same and part of the baseline values. For the time, L = Launch (i.e., meaning time after launch from Earth and the number indicates length in space) and R = Return to Earth.Interestingly, cell-free RNAs from several genes (e.g,. FGF23, KRT18, AKT1, B2M, NOS1, AOC1, SOD2 and SOD3) did not return to the pre-flight baseline levels, even after 120 days. The data suggest that space conditions alter the HIF1 pathway which stimulates the various molecular or cellular processes related to hypoxia-responsive genes such as HIF1A, HIF1AN, ARNT, ARNT2, NOS1, NOS2, NOTCH1 and RBX1, that are known to regulate a wide variety of cellular physiology including metabolic reprogramming, anti-apoptosis, migration, proliferation, amyloid β production and prion stabilization40,41. An interesting observation emerging from the data is the increased cell-free RNA signature of HIF1A and HIF3A post-flight. Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) is a key regulator of immune cell function42, and its dysregulation could alter immune response. We also observe an increase of RNAs derived from several nitric oxide (NO) related genes, which are biologic mediators in multiple processes, such as in neurotransmission and microbial and antitumoral activities. It is understood that nitric oxide (NO) is a key vasodilator in the cardiovascular system and its synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme family nitric oxide synthases (NOS), neuronal (NOS1), inducible (NOS2) and endothelial synthases (NOS3)43. NOS1 and NOS2 are constitutively expressed by tubules of the human kidney, while NOS3 is expressed by endothelial cells and is implicated with the formation and maintenance of vascularized tissues. Furthermore, AKT1 plays a role in the signal transduction of growth factors, as well as in cell survival, cellular senescence, and aging. There is evidence that AKT signaling is associated with an imbalance of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases that is altering the aged brain44. Chronic AKT activation intensified aging-induced cardiac hypertrophy in murine heart tissues45. In connection to phosphate intake, FGF23 is known to be secreted from the skeletal system and influence the kidneys through the klotho gene receptor36. The upregulation of HIF-related genes could be interpreted through findings from earlier studies which have implicated the HIF pathway with the impairment of energy-dependent cellular processes, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA which accelerate aging processes41,46. Next, we used data from the first civilian commercial 3-day space mission (referred to as Inspiration4 (I4), to examine the impact of short-duration spaceflight on putative frailty biomarker transcriptomic signature47. From the I4 mission, single-cell gene expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were generated and compared across multiple timepoints (Fig. 7A). Frailty genes were increased in PBMCs and subpopulations post-flight compared to pre-flight timepoints, and the percentage of the increased genes were higher than the percentage of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Fig. 7B). The percentage of increased frailty genes was the highest in PBMCs, lowest in dendritic cells (DCs), and similar in the remaining subpopulations (Fig. 7B). Generally, the average expression and percentage of expression of the increased genes were increased at R + 1 compared to pre-flights (L-92, L-44, L-3) and returned to baseline over time (Fig. 7C). For example, several genes were upregulated in various pathways at R + 1 compared to pre-flight and reverted to baseline over time. Implicated pathways include: immunity (ARG2, PPARD), EGFR trafficking (ATXN2), regulators of apoptosis (BCL2L1, FAS), survival factor for neuronal cell types (CNTF), cell–cell signaling (JAG1), metabolism (PPARD), DNA repair (REV1), neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission (SNX14), structural component of sarcomeric Z-line (TMEM245) and cell cycle regulation (TP53) (Fig. 7C).

The image shows the differential expression values for each cell type in analysis. The values are based on expression for each time point before-flight and post-flight. However, data from samples collected just after reentry (R + 1) is considered spaceflight condition. For the time, L = Launch, R = Return to Earth, the number + n is the time (in days) after L or R.Metabolic flux simulations of gene expression changes reveal dysregulation of metabolic functions related to frailty Having found alterations in gene expression associated with aging and frailty and knowing that biologic systems are dynamic, we used a subset of the gene expression to examine dynamic changes in metabolism. We applied our updated, context-specific, metabolic models that performed custom-made flux balance analysis (FBA) simulations. Here, we used two different transcriptional changes (RNA-seq) between flight and ground (OSD-91 (GSE65943) for cultured human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells; and OSD-127 (E-GEOD-84582) for cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells) (Fig. 8).

The leftmost bar represents differential testing results between Flight and Ground in p values < 0.05 (black) or p values between 0.05 and 0.1 (gray) through the Van Der Waerden test. Genes in the boxes are enzymes showing significantly different expressions for their corresponding reactions.In TK6 lymphoblastoid cells, microgravity led to transcriptional changes through altered methylation patterns. These transcriptional changes, in turn, altered the oxidative stress and carbohydrate metabolism pathways48. However, the flux simulation analysis showed that other pathways associated with lipid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and bile acid synthesis, are downregulated during flight. While chondroitin sulfate degradation, nucleotide interconversion, and peroxisomal transport are upregulated. Considering the carbohydrate metabolism aspect of the flux simulation analysis, only pyruvate metabolism (end product of glycolysis) showed significantly altered expression in microgravity (Figs. 8A,C). By contrast, the other metabolic flux simulation displayed marked up-regulation during flight in lipid metabolism associated pathways: fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism (Figs. 8B,D). The cells also exhibited increased galactose metabolism, nucleotide interconversion, Coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis, glutathione metabolism, as well as pentose phosphate pathway in carbohydrate metabolism. The only significant downregulation in microgravity was detected in folate metabolism. This cardiomyocyte study (using 3D tissue engineering of cardiac progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells) found increased gene expression levels associated with growth, development, and survival for cardiac progenitors in microgravity49.Discussion To our knowledge, no prior links to frailty-like signatures have been observed in the context of spaceflight, and these markers represent an important direction for future research, especially as mission durations increase to years. In recent years, human space research has benefitted from collecting and integrating diverse types of biological data, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, and storing them in biobanks for future analysis19,50. These multi-omics data and biobanks continue to provide valuable insights into the aging-like processes in astronauts during long-term space missions and help identify potential biomarkers and interventions to counteract them25,51–53. In our manuscript, we include data from NASA’s OSDR, the SpaceX Inspiration4 and the JAXA astronaut study. These initiatives are hallmarks in the development of data banking strategies such as the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)54. The NASA Twins study along with the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome and Inspiration4 data reported here and elsewhere (Figs. 6 and 7) highlight the emerging ability to conduct omic analyses on astronaut samples 27,39,55. We propose the use of omics data to investigate the development of aging-like phenomena in spaceflight, which can also help improve our understanding of aging metrics like clonal hematopoiesis56, and also link to a wide array of new data from the SOMA package of data and papers 48,53,55,55,57–65. Space medicine research has been mostly focused on the acute and medium-term effects of spaceflight on human physiology. However, some attributes related to the exposure to the space environment resemble aging-like pathophysiology: DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction3. Because of these similarities, observations from the aging field can be useful to understand the biological changes driven by spaceflight. In contrast with aging on Earth, it is unclear whether those molecular modifications last after reentry, and for this reason we refer to them as aging-like phenomena. Nevertheless, despite acute events such as space motion sickness and autonomic imbalance resolving after astronaut’s return to ground, the effects of these aging-like alterations might be clinically manifest in a chronic exposure scenario, like a long-duration mission to Mars, and could potentially trigger chronic disease development. Studies in genetic/genomic aging models such as C. elegans and clinical evidence have demonstrated that the control of lifespan and health span are not identical49,53; therefore, there is an increasing need to identify markers able to determine the biological age of an individual. One proposed marker is the frailty index, which can serve as a better health indicator than chronological age, translating what is suggested by previous biological and clinical literature7. Here, we examined if aging and putative frailty biomarkers change during spaceflight. Our results from both rodent and human samples suggest that alterations indeed occurred in aging-related pathways to a different extent depending on the tissue. Importantly, we also found changes in expression of putative frailty genes, raising the possibility that these could be used as indicators of physiological changes during spaceflight much as they are being examined for utility in clinical assessment of physiological changes with age on Earth. Beyond health assessment, the ability to conduct -omic studies on astronauts allows for combining astronaut and model organism datasets in order to conduct truly translational research in space. Such studies would expand our understanding of molecular control of (patho)physiological changes in response to spaceflight. The expression of putative frailty related biomarkers in JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome samples is altered during spaceflight, compared to ground control, as shown in Fig. 6; interestingly, several gene expression levels do not return to baseline after reentry. Although their expression could revert to normal after a longer period, this altered expression could hint to the presence of spaceflight-induced modifications that persist for longer than expected. For example, AKT1 is upregulated at all timepoints after reentry. A persisted upregulation of the gene is linked to age related cardiac disease and dementia in animal models45,46. The presence of biomarker gene expression that does not revert to normal challenges the concept that every physiological change induced by spaceflight is reverted after astronauts’ return to Earth. This notion is not novel, for example, a recent report showed the development of distinct mutational profiles in astronauts66; on these bases, it would be worth monitoring these biomarkers for longer timepoints after reentry, and to exclude the possibility that they underlie any sub-clinical disease development. Permanent modifications after exposure to important stressors happen in patients as well. For instance, admission to Intensive Care Unit and severe COVID-19 have been associated with epigenetic changes that might alter aging-related gene expression45,46. In addition to long-term spaceflight exposure, short-duration spaceflight data such as those provided by the i4 mission are also relevant to detect early signs of frailty development. In fact, frailty is not only associated to long term chronic disease pathways: clinical research hints that short term exposure to stressors such as COVID-19 hyperinflammatory response are capable of developing frailty-associated traits56. Regardless, longer spaceflight duration might be required to detect wider alterations in putative frailty biomarkers and clinically manifested phenotypes in astronauts; this highlights the need for further studies and validation. Differential expression of frailty genes in astronauts’ cell-free DNA and PBMCs (Figs. 6 and 7) is not inherently the same as what is observed in the Open Science Dataset’s (OSDs) human samples (Fig. 5). Despite frailty signals potentially being detected in astronaut’s blood, it is not feasible to directly pair this result with the differential expression of frailty-related genes in muscle biopsies, due to the absence of matched data. As previously suggested, this represents an opportunity to apply cutting-edge clinical research tools for monitoring and researching astronaut health. Indeed, genome sequencing onboard the ISS is currently used in the microbiological monitoring program67, paving the way for use in astronaut studies on the ISS. Previous studies of astronaut health have largely been conducted using standard clinical markers such as blood panels. While there is an emerging blood panel for assessment of frailty68, these would need to be processed on Earth. By contrast, the assessment of a future clinically validated transcriptomic panel for frailty could be conducted on ISS or other spacecrafts. Regardless of which panel or where such a panel is assessed, our findings suggest that future studies aimed at establishing such a validated model for astronauts could be fruitful areas of investigation for monitoring and improving astronaut health in- and post-flight. The establishment and validation of such a panel could either be done by correlating with physiological measures already captured by NASA’s standard measures program or correlating with physiological measures adapted from the emerging frailty indexes. One of the most pronounced findings in both rodent and human datasets is the induction of interferon alpha and gamma responsive pathways. Interferons are cytokines associated with modulation of the immune response which is a known consequence of spaceflight69. Our observation of the activation of interferon pathways (Fig. 3) suggests that the activation of the innate immune system is a conserved mammalian response to spaceflight and aging. In the aging field, the concept of inflammaging suggests that the chronic low-grade dysregulation of the immune system that happens with aging underpins the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, and sarcopenia7. Indeed, at least ten clinical biomarkers of inflammation correlate well with the frailty index70. Making the inflammaging parallel to spaceflight, it could be that an increased low-grade inflammatory response during spaceflight drives and/or worsens frailty and/or related processes (for example muscle wasting)67,71. Low grade inflammation contributes to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis on Earth7,72. In addition, radiation exposure can also lead to the development of cardiovascular disease in case of occupational exposure, as well as in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy69,71,73. In astronauts, atherosclerosis could be promoted by an increased inflammatory status promoted by different stressors of the space environment (Fig. 1), and radiation exposure would play a primary role for it. Moon and Mars missions have a different radiation environment compared with the ISS, as astronauts traveling beyond Low Earth Orbit are potentially exposed to higher doses of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle event radiation69. Elevated radiation exposure promotes multiple dysregulations, causing cellular senescence in the endothelium, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, driving endothelial dysfunction71. Exposure to higher doses of space radiation beyond low Earth orbit could also have a different, and perhaps increased, impact on frailty-related hallmarks and genes. Concerning endothelial dysfunction, an interplay between nitric oxide metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species and radiation exposure could play a role in the development of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease, as well as other disease pathways, in space74,75. Moreover, a pro-inflammatory and oxidative environment might facilitate the development of the spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)76; this condition would also increase the disability status of the crew. Across species, altered metabolism is one of the most consistently reported responses to spaceflight. Unsurprisingly, these changes vary from organism to organism among microbes and tissue to tissue in animals (Fig. 8). A recent rodent transcriptomic study confirmed that the typical mammalian coordination of metabolism between the liver and muscles on Earth continues to function similarly in flight77. This metabolic axis is a key determinator of health with age, whose disruption is associated with obesity, diabetes, and frailty. Emerging techniques such as metabolomics are beginning to address the role and mechanisms of metabolic alteration in human muscle with age73. Here we have employed another emerging analytical approach, metabolic flux modeling from transcriptomic data (Fig. 8). Our results confirm that metabolic flux analysis successfully demonstrated metabolic alterations as expected, dependent on tissue type. Importantly, while our results confirm past observations that mitochondrial and metabolic changes are conserved features of space flown tissues and organisms3, they also demonstrate that the functional changes via metabolic flux are more important than the simple global up versus down changes often employed with reductionist approaches. The effect of microgravity exposure may cause specific mitochondrial protein adaptations that affect skeletal muscle tissue, namely 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, palmitate oxidation and cytochrome c oxidase enzymatic activity75,78,79. It is noteworthy that tissues might respond differently to microgravity and the mitochondrial bioenergetics adaptations seen in skeletal muscle may be different from the ones seen in cardiac muscle; however new sequencing data may provide an insight into these differences18,75. Thus, using data from multiple tissues and time points begins to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of frailty in response to spaceflight. Importantly, our results demonstrate that these approaches can be employed directly in astronauts and/or in combination with model systems. Muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging. It is also thought to contribute to frailty. Recently, functional measures of muscle decline with age have been well correlated with evolutionarily conserved gene expression changes with age27,74. In humans, changes in metabolic gene expression appear to occur prior to changes in inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that aging human muscle undergoes metabolic remodeling prior to becoming inflamed and sarcopenic—also highlighting the importance of temporal/dynamic data71. Similarly, in humans subjected to bedrest, an analogue for spaceflight, changes in metabolic gene expression and metabolic activity are an early event tied to altered intramuscular calcium levels80. The recent study of muscle-liver metabolic cross talk in mice used the same mouse muscle datasets we used for this manuscript (Fig. 8) and found altered glucose and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight, consistent with past literature on space flown mammalian muscle77. Combining this past analysis with our new analysis of sarcopenic gene expression changes, it is noteworthy that few sarcopenic gene expression changes are noted in the space flown muscles with more observed changes in the soleus, which was the muscle displaying the largest decline in mass25. Together, these results raise the possibility that metabolic changes may indeed precede the loss of muscle mass in spaceflight, as observed with age and bedrest on Earth. It remains an open question if, like sarcopenia, metabolic alterations occur earlier than the inflammatory alterations in flight and whether inflammation or an altered metabolism is the key driver for a frailty-like phenotype in space. Lastly, given the similarities between transcriptomic changes with age and spaceflight, the facts that estrogen receptor has recently been proposed to be a key regulator of muscle gene expression changes with age and that estrogen receptor pathways have recently been shown to display differences in flight, raise the possibility that estrogen receptor pathways are key modulators of muscle health in space27,77,81. The restriction of available sources poses a frequent challenge in the field of space medical and biological research. In order to adequately tackle our research inquiry with comprehensive information, we adopted a diverse range of data from various public sources. It is essential to note that each individual experimental model incorporated does not entirely encapsulate the complete biology of astronauts exposed to space conditions. Therefore, caution is advised when extending conclusions from one model system to another or from cellular and tissue-level observations to the overall phenotypes of organisms. Nonetheless, a noteworthy aspect of our findings is the utilization of a weight-of-evidence approach, wherein data across multiple models are analyzed. This method reveals conserved pathways that consistently emerge in independent datasets, likely indicating fundamental biological responses akin to frailty in the context of spaceflight. Pursuing the development of biobanks for multi-omics data will deeply benefit space medicine and biology research. Yet, concurrently, bridging the gap between molecular changes, pathophysiological processes and phenotype development requires multi-omics biological data to be associated with individual physical metrics. This is crucial to investigate complex syndromes such as frailty. Future studies will be conducted to observe global and systemic impact on how the frailty index will change during spaceflight.Methods Ethical statement All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs at Weill Cornell Medicine.

The Differential Expression (DE) analysis of RNA-Seq datasets (OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, OSD-105) is performed using DESeq2 version 1.26.082, in R software version 4.1.2. Expected counts from the RSEM step were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. The Differential Expression (DE) analysis of microarray datasets (OSD-21, OSD-52, OSD-195) is performed using the package limma, in R version 4.1.274. The Ensembl IDs of the genes in the DE datasets were annotated to their corresponding gene symbols using the R package biomaRt83,84. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the differentially expressed datasets using fGSEA package to determine to what extent aging and putative frailty pathways were impacted in spaceflight85. Tentative aging and frailty gene pathways were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)—a joint project of UC San Diego and Broad Institute23,86. MSigDB is a multicollection of databases among which are databases of curated gene sets, and databases of ontology gene sets that are used in pathway analysis. The latest version MSigDB v2022.1 was used in the pathway search. In search of pathways that are potentially related to frailty, in MSigDB, we entered keywords of processes that are common denominators to aging in different organisms66. The processes of interest are: changes in genomic and genetic material; cellular processes; nutrient signaling; and responses at the tissue level with bone and muscle as the tissues of interest. Changes in genomic and genetic material that are deemed to potentially associate with frailty include genome instability, epigenetic alterations, histone modifications, DNA methylation, DNA damage, and changes in chromatin structure. Cellular processes that are of interest to frailty pathways include: (1) processes that are key to maintaining the cell cycle—cell senescence, stem-cell generation, and the pathways that involve p53, the protein tumor suppressor; (2) mechanisms involved in proteostasis (protein regulation); (3) mitochondrial processes involving dysfunction and disease; and (4) intercellular processes that involve inflammation and intercellular communication. The actions of the protein complexes—proteasome, lysosome, and chaperone—are considered in the network of pathways that regulate proteins. Putative pathways of nutrient sensing and signaling include pathways mediated by insulin signaling and mTor signaling, and the role of Ampk. The downloaded pathways were identified as putative frailty pathways when at least two (2) putative frailty biomarker genes were present among the genes that are involved in the pathway. This is applied from the following reasoning: if multiple genes that can possibly interact to express a phenotype are present in a pathway, then that pathway can be associated with that phenotype. The outcome of the fGSEA analysis is the normalized enrichment score (NES) of any given pathway, alongside valuable information on the analysis, such as the adjusted p-value, and the leading-edge genes of the pathway. The NES is the enrichment score normalized based on the number of genes in the gene set. It indicates the representation of the pathway genes in the dataset gene list, which is priorly ranked according to the values of the t-score of the genes. A positive NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the top of the gene list, while a negative NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the bottom of the gene list. The plots of the NES of the different pathways for a given dataset are produced using ggplot2, and the heatmaps across different datasets or different genes are obtained using a complex heatmap R package87,88.Analysis on frailty biomarker genes and pathways A list of Frailty Biomarkers was generated from a survey of literature that was produced from studies that were inspired by the FRAILOMICS Initiative. The biomarker genes for mouse (Mus musculus) were obtained as a literal translation from human biomarker genes using biomaRt. Historically, frailty was assessed based on measuring functional phenotypic parameters. The Fried phenotype regards frailty as a biological syndrome that comprises five components, i.e., shrinking, weakness, fatigue, slowness, and a low physical activity level20; frailty is diagnosed when poor performance in three or more components are present. The Rockwood frailty index identifies frailty based on the accumulation of age-related deficits, including various symptoms, signs, functional impairments, and laboratory abnormalities; it is calculated as the ratio of the number of accumulated deficits divided by the total number of deficits measured20. The FRAILOMICS Initiative was introduced with the aim of developing validated measures comprising both classic and omics-based laboratory biomarkers. Since the inception of initiatives such as the FRAILOMICS70,89, a number of approaches have been utilized to identify molecular biomarkers of frailty, among which are: the identification of differentially expressed biomarkers based on the risk of frailty89; the identification of genes regulated in “hallmarks of aging” pathways19; and the identification of molecular biomarkers that closely associate inflammatory mediators with frailty35. In the publication by Durinck et al.89, subjects are stratified as frail or non-frail based on Fried’s definition, and frailty biomarkers are identified as those that are upregulated in frail subjects. In the publication by Berrios et al.19, gene expression databases were searched to identify genes regulated in “hallmark of aging” pathways, namely (1) inflammation, (2) mitochondria and apoptosis, (3) calcium homeostasis, (4) fibrosis, (5) neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and neurons, (6) cytoskeleton and hormones. A total of 44 biomarkers were evaluated based on differential expression. The markers were categorized by priority scores, with a higher priority score reflecting an upregulation of the biomarker in several pathways. In the publication by Lebrasseur et al.22, a meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of showing whether inflammatory mediators are overproduced in frail older adults. Forty-nine studies, published between 2002 and 2018 analyzing frailty and inflammation parameters, were selected for the meta-analysis. Among them, 35 studies (70%) associated frailty to CRP, 33 studies (66%) evaluated IL6, 13 studies (26%) reported data for TNFα, and 12 (24%) analyzed other different inflammation biomarkers, including IL10, soluble TNF receptors I (sTNF-RI) and II (sTNF-RII), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IL6 receptor (IL6-R). Regarding frailty identification, 92% of the studies employed Fried’s frailty criteria, 6% of the studies used the frailty index developed by Rockwood and Mitnitski, and the remaining small percentage of studies employed tools and indicators recently described in the literature. In the work described in this paper, the authors have used the biomarker genes identified in the named studies as putative biomarker genes of frailty to conduct their analyses. The differential expression (log2foldchange and padj < 0.5) of frailty biomarker genes were determined from the following two human datasets (OSD-52 and 195) and six mice datasets (OSD-21, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105). Subsequently, to generate the Venn diagram, R language v4.1.085 was used, through the library ggplot2 v3.4.087. It was extracted from the table of frailty genes (Table 2), with genes unique to mice and humans, and with genes common for both (the intersections). After generating the diagram, a list of genes was extracted and manually added to the diagram. To generate the two upset plot graphs (for mice genes and human genes), the R language85 was also used, using the library ggplot2 v3.4.083 and ComplexUpset v1.3.590. Finally, to generate the heatmap, the python 3 v3.10.0 language was used, through the Seaborn v0.12.1 and Clustermap v0.11.12 libraries. Two heatmaps were generated (one for the mice genes and the other for the human genes), relating the genes to the respective OSD datasets. To complement the heatmap analyses, a dendrogram has also been added for each graph. Table 2. List of the frailty genes.

Four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in low-Earth orbit (LEO) at 585 km above Earth. The mission launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on September 15th, 2021, and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral on September 18th, 2021. Several human related experiments were carried out to study the effects of spaceflight on human health and performance in collaboration with SpaceX, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), and Weill Cornell Medicine. The experiments conducted on the Inspiration4 crew members were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and experimental protocols were approved at the principal investigators’ institutions at Weill Cornell Medicine. All I4 crew members have given informed consent to participate in these studies. The i4 crews’ physiological changes were monitored with ultrasound scanning, molecular diagnostics devices, smartwatch wearables devices, and etc.91. Infection or inflammation are the most prevalent clinical symptoms found during the long-term (around 6 months) spaceflight92. However, there were no clinical reports of infection or inflammation. Although two astronauts presented with space motion sickness, most metrics (e.g., internal jugular vein size, heart rate, complete blood count, gene expression, and cytokines) were either stable, or quickly reverted back to baseline after landing. The experiments conducted by the Inspiration4 crew members were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at the principal investigators’ institutions. Moreover, the different study designs and the corresponding methods to collect and analyze the biological samples were approved by the corresponding institutional IRB. All biological data derived from the Inspiration4 mission were collected pre and post flights. For this study, only data from blood samples were used. Pre-flight samples were collected at L-92, L-44, and L-3 days prior to launch to space. Upon return, post-flight samples were collected at R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 days.i4 PBMC Single cell sequencing and analysis Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10 × Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference93. Dot plots are generated by the Seurat R package.JAXA cell-free epigenome (CFE) study RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA’s Open Science Data Repository with accession number: OSD-53039. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. Heatmaps were made for the frailty genes on the normalized values per time point using R package pheatmap version 1.0.12.Quantification of genes associated with sarcopenia The curated short gene list of predictors of sarcopenia was obtained by analyzing a population of age matched individuals with and without sarcopenia using the expression superserie GSE111017. This list contains 21 genes that can predict sarcopenia in patients with an accuracy > 75%. The method for obtaining the gene list was performed as previously described29. Here, we used GOstat 2022-11-03 on R version 4.2 to find enriched Biological Process and Molecular Function terms (Fig A and C). Using the obtained GO terms we found that some of the Frailty linked genes from JAXA CFE were also part of some of the same processes (Fig B and D). The figure was created using the GOplot package 1.0.2 and modified to display the MAS for each gene. Finally, to determine the relevance of the shared 21 genes between all gene lists (Fig E), we assessed their expression in the mice datasets OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, and OSD-105. Finally, the heatmap was generated as before using python 3 v3.10.0 language, through the Seaborn v0.12.1 and Clustermap v0.11.12 libraries and a dendrogram has also been added for each graph.Metabolic flux simulation analysis We ran metabolic flux simulation on all available metabolic reactions for each RNA sequencing sample while applying our custom-made context-specific constraint-based metabolic modeling approach significantly updated from23,94,95. This updated simulation model was constructed based on the RECON3D metabolic model57 whose metabolic reactions were subsetted through CORDA96 and Cobrapy97 with gene-reaction-rule, where enzyme expression levels are linked to their corresponding metabolic reactions. For CORDA, flux confidence parameters ranging from 3 to 1 were decided as; (i) 55%, 25%, and 20% for OSD-91; (ii) 45%, 40%, and 15% for OSD-127, in order to minimize standard deviation of flux-levels across samples from each group for all groups. Also, several essential pathways such as ‘Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis’, ‘CoA Synthesis’, ‘CoA Catabolism’, ‘NAD Metabolism’, ‘Fatty Acid Synthesis’, ‘Fatty Acid Oxidation’, and ‘Biomass and Maintenance Functions’ were manually activated for the simulation model stability. Note that ‘Oxidative Phosphorylation’ and ‘Citric Acid Cycle’ were not included in the essential pathways to take into account mitochondrial dysregulation. Our metabolic model initially optimized for NAD biosynthesis whose capacity through all pathways of human was computed by estimating optimized ‘NAD sink’ reaction flux level where the sink was defined as large pools of metabolites importing metabolites from/to the system. Subsequently, optimization for all available reactions was conducted iteratively to compute flux levels of their corresponding reactions by Gurobi solver as LP whose reference manual can be found in https://www.gurobi.com98. While gene expression levels were applied into the model by each sample, the other parameters were maintained identically for all simulation, where an environment i.e., Jupyter notebook 6.1.5 on Python 3.7.7 was utilized. The simulation reported outcomes as flux levels of all available reactions through the custom-made flux balance analysis (FBA) analyses and the levels were analyzed as grouped variables for comparison between ‘Flight’ and ‘Ground’ groups. Since it is hard to presume variance or normality between ‘Flight’ and ‘Ground’, a non-parametric Van der Waerden (VdW) test was applied to properly compare their flux levels using the R matrixTests package (v. 0.1.9). The comparison is illustrated as heatmaps with row-wise Z-scores on flux levels per each reaction in Fig. 8. Tabular data of metabolic flux analysis is shown in supplement 6.Supplementary Information Dataset S1. (30.5KB, docx) Dataset S2. (21.4KB, xlsx) Dataset S3. (17.4KB, xlsx) Dataset S4.
