    "abstract": "Abstract Ovarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes of most tissues within the body, including muscle, bone, neural, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the ovary and estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of all spaceflight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice (n = 10) were exposed to and sacrificed on-orbit after 37 days of spaceflight in microgravity. Contemporary control (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacrifice and similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial carcass thaw. Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was fixed for estrous cycle stage determinations. The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and flight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while progesterone levels were lower (p < 0.05) in habitat and flight compared to baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed across groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall estrous cycle classification of all female mice flown in space. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile.

    "introduction": "Introduction Spaceflight microgravity is known to impact numerous physiological systems. These include cardiovascular changes, decreased bone mineral density, loss of muscle tone, adipogenesis, insulin resistance, vision and vestibular disturbances, altered fluid and electrolyte balance, and altered kidney function to name a few1. Many, if not all, normal homeostatic processes occurring within mammals, both male and female, are dramatically impacted by gonadal hormones. Indeed, the reproductive system is often considered one of the best markers of overall health and fitness of an animal2. However, research is limited regarding the effects of spaceflight on the reproductive system and its consequences on normal physiology3,4. The ovarian steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone, play a significant role in regulating a myriad of physiological functions, and are subject to cyclic changes based on the hypothalamic/pituitary regulation of ovarian folliculogenesis5. Moreover, ovarian steroidogenic output can be dramatically impacted by stress as well as other internal homeostatic processes6. In cycling rodents, the antral follicle is the primary steroidogenic tissue within the ovary, unless mating occurs at which time the corpus luteum becomes the major producer of progesterone. The mural granulosa cells and the vascularized theca cells within the antral ovarian follicles are responsible for the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to its ultimate endpoint product estradiol. In addition to steroidogenesis, these follicular cells also carry out the critical missions of nurturing the enclosed growing oocyte, as well as facilitating the process of ovulation, or expulsion of oocyte, and subsequent formation of the ephemeral corpus luteum. Cyclic and temporal changes in expression of steroidogenic pathway proteins and other critically important ovarian genes known to play critical roles in ovulation, oocyte development and corpus luteum development and function are well known and may be evaluated to provide information regarding ovarian function. Understanding these molecular changes is vital for informing female reproductive health during and after spaceflight. To date, studies of ovarian function and fertility in mice exposed to microgravity during NASA Space Shuttle flights were of short duration (<12 days) and, importantly, all included the effects of live reentry prior to collection of tissues and analysis of animal behavior3,7. Similarly, pregnant female rats flown on Cosmos 1514 (1982), NASA- Rodent (R)1 (STS-66 in 1994), and NASA- R2 (STS-70 in 1995) were of short duration (4.5–11 days) and had live animal return8–10. Notably, in the pregnant rats no effects of spaceflight on healthy and atretic ovarian antral follicle populations, fetal wastage in utero, plasma concentrations of progesterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) or pituitary content of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were noted8. Spaceflight, however, significantly increased plasma concentrations of FSH and decreased pituitary content of LH analyzed postpartum (day 22–23;8). In these prior studies, it is not possible to separate the effects of microgravity from that of reentry with the associated hypergravity, turbulence, and the likely ensuing stress responses linked to these events. Moreover, these studies while evaluating maintenance of pregnancy, provide no information regarding the fertility of these animals and their ability to exhibit normal estrous cycles and ovarian function. The current investigation provides insights into the endocrine status and ovarian cyclicity of female mice following an extended period of exposure to microgravity in the absence of reentry effects. Addressing the effects of extended duration spaceflight on endocrine status are significant and of high impact to long-term female astronaut health before and after flight, interpretation of spaceflight findings derived from female mice, and for long-term plans for multigenerational mammalian studies in spaceflight.",
    "methods": "Methods Animals Forty 12-week old C57BI/6J female mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) were selected based on similar body weights for 4 experimental groups (16-week old at launch, n = 10/group): baseline control, vivarium control, habitat control, and flight. Flight mice were launched on SpaceX-4 (Rodent Research 1) on September 21, 2014, as part of NASA’s Validation study. Details of RR1 mission timeline (i.e., mouse pre-adaptation to cages, food) as well as mouse spaceflight hardware details are available11,12,31. Briefly, vivarium control mice were maintained in standard mouse cages (5 mice/cage) for the duration of spaceflight at Kennedy Space Center. Habitat control mice were housed in a Rodent Research Transporter and Habitat Hardware on Earth for durations consistent with flight times at the same density of mice as those in flight (n = 10/habitat). The habitat control was placed in the ISS Environmental Simulator at KSC on a 4-day delay to mimic flight temperature, CO2, and humidity conditions on the ISS for the duration of spaceflight. Baseline control mice were euthanized one day after launch and then partially dissected prior to freezing of the animal carcasses mimicking the procedures to be conducted on flight and for all other animals at the conclusion of experiment. Flight mice were exposed to microgravity for a total of 37 days (33 days on ISS and 4 days in the Dragon Capsule). Mice were euthanized by injection of Euthasol followed by cervical dislocation and immediately fast frozen intact (n = 8) or partially dissected (n = 2) prior to carcasses being frozen. Mice carcasses were frozen using pre-chilled Ice Bricks prior to transfer to the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) aboard the ISS. All ground mice were processed similarly. Flight mice carcasses returned to Earth February 2015 aboard the SpaceX CRS-5 and were then maintained along with the control mice frozen at the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) at the Ames Research Center until dissection11. All animal procedures performed were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and the methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations11. Tissue collection Female reproductive tissues (ovary and uterus) were collected from all carcasses at about 35–45 min after removal from the −80 °C freezer. One ovary was placed into RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the other was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN). Similarly, the right and left uterine horns were placed in RNAlater or snap-frozen in LN; uterine tissues are part of an independent study by another investigator and will not be further described here. Tissues preserved in RNAlater were kept at 4 °C for 2 days then frozen and stored at −80 °C, tissues snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen were also stored at −80 °C. Following primary tissue dissections in April of 2015, the remaining carcass was refrozen and stored at −80 °C. In March of 2016, carcasses were thawed again for a secondary tissue dissection. At this time the combined cervix and vaginal wall were dissected free of the pelvic cavity, and these tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Following overnight fixation these tissues were transferred to 70% EtOH, in preparation for shipping to the University of Kansas Medical Center. RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis Ovaries tissues were transferred directly from RNAlater to tubes containing 1 ml of Trizol (Sigma) or 1 ml of Trizol was added directly to ovarian tissue snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were briefly dissociated on ice (3 bursts, 62 W) in a PowerGen 700 homogenizer (Fisher Scientific). RNA was isolated from Trizol as per manufacturer protocol. To facilitate precipitation 1 μL of glycogen (20ug/ul; Invitrogen) was added to aqueous fraction and the resulting pellet was then resuspended in 15 μL of RNase free water (ThermoFisher 18064022). An aliquot (1 μL) of this resuspended RNA was used to determine RNA concentration and RNA integrity number (RIN) values using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA (400 ng) from each sample was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen/ThermoFisher) with random hexamer primers (IDT). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using a 1:5 dilution of cDNA on an Applied Biosystems HT7900 sequence detector. Genes interrogated included 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b1), P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (Cyp11a1), 17α-hydroxylase (Cyp17a1), P450 aromatase (Cyp19a1), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star), liver receptor homolog-1 (Nr5a2), estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1), estrogen receptor 2 (Esr2), scavenger receptor class B member 1 (Scarb1), luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr), zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (Zp3), and growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9). Primers were designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems) and purchased from IDT (see Supplementary Table 1). qPCR was performed for Hsd3b1, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Cyp19a1, Nr5a2, Esr1, Esr2, Scarb1, Zp3, Lhcgr, and Gdf9 using PowerSYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). qPCR on Star, and 18 S rRNA levels were determined using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) protocol and Applied Biosystems (Eukaryotic 18S rRNA Endogenous Control [VIC® ⁄ MGB Probe, Primer Limited]) probes and primers. Samples were run in triplicate, and the ΔΔCt method was used to calculate the relative expression between the samples after normalization with 18S levels. All SYBR Green reactions were evaluated for the presence of a single dissociation curve, to confirm the amplification of a single transcript and lack of primer dimers. Histological analysis Upon receipt of tissues from the BSP, the vaginal walls samples were transferred to tissue embedding cassettes, and processed through a standard series of dehydration steps prior to being embedded in paraffin. Tissue blocks were then sectioned on a Leica microtome at a thickness of 6 μm and mounted on microscope slides (Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientific). Tissue sections were then deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin prior to histological examination. Slides were randomized and sample (animal and treatment) labels were blinded prior to examination by three independent reviewers for estrous cycle staging (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, diestrus or not determinable). Non-determinable samples were the result of tissues not containing sufficient vaginal wall tissue to yield reliable results. Following independent reviews, those samples (~10%) without a consensus stage call were reevaluated by the reviewers and a consensus stage agreed upon. Radioimmunoassay The steroid content (estrogen/progesterone) content of the ovary, as determined by RIA, was used as a surrogate for serum analyses for establishing the functional ovarian status of the RR1 females at the time of their sacrifice. Flash frozen ovaries were halved and homogenized using a sonicator in 200 μL of PBS. Homogenate was spun down at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Approximately 150 μL of supernatant was collected. 100 μL of undiluted supernatant was shipped to the Ligand Assay and Analysis Core (UVA School of Medicine) on dry ice and the rest were stored as 50 μL aliquots at −80 °C. Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) were determined by commercial ELISAs (E2: Calbiotech, El Cajon, CA. Cat # ES180S-100; P4: IBL, Minneapolis, MN, Cat # IB79105). E2 assay characteristics were as follows: sensitivity = 3 pg/ml; intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) = 7.5%; inter-assay CV = 10.1%. For P4, sensitivity = 0.15 ng/ml; intra-assay CV = 6.5%; inter-assay CV = 10.3%. Statistical analysis One-way ANOVA was used to determine differences amongst treatment groups (flight status) or estrous cycle stage. Tukey’s mean separation tests were used to determine differences between mean once a significant F-test was observed. All statistical analyses and graphs for the RIA were performed using GraphPad Prism v6 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

    "results": "Results Estrous cycle staging Estrous cycle stage for each mouse was determined by three independent investigators blinded to treatment group categories. Figure 1 shows representative H&E stained cross sections of vaginal wall tissue from the individual flight and habitat control animals following collection after the second carcass thaw during March of 2016. Each stage of the estrous cycle is depicted in Fig. 1. Proestrus is characterized by the presence of a thick layer of stratified squamous epithelium, with an absence of luminal cells and any cornified epithelial cells (Fig. 1a). Estrous stage animals exhibit a stratified squamous epithelium with a layer of cornified epithelial [red eosin stained cells above the nucleated stratified squamous epithelial cells (Fig. 1b)]. Often, this cornified layer is delaminated from the underlying epithelial cells. In metestrus, leukocytes appear and traverse the nucleated epithelial layer to reach the delaminated mass of cornified stratified squamous epithelium in the lumen (Fig. 1c). During diestrus, the vaginal wall is characterized by columnar mucified cells next to a thin layer of nucleated epithelium (Fig. 1d). Staging of the mice indicated that the majority of the animals in the baseline control group (6/9), the vivarium control group (5/8), and the flight group (6/10) were in estrus (Table 1). In comparison, habitat control mice presented at all stages of the cycle in approximately equal amounts (n = 2 or 3/stage). Flight group mice presented at estrus (n = 6) and metestrus (n = 4; Table 1). Fig. 1. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of vaginal walls used for estrous cycle staging.

Ovarian RNA quality and tissue steroid levels Ovarian RNA quality varied appreciably depending upon whether it was flash-frozen in LN or placed in RNAlater (Fig. 2). Representative electropherograms from the Agilent 2100 are shown for 2 mice collected in either RNAlater or LN. Overall, RNA quality as determined by Agilent RNA integrity numbers (RIN values) from tissues frozen in LN were greater (p < 0.05) in every animal, and overall averaged around 5.71 ± 0.12 compared to 4.08 ± 0.11 for RNAlater preserved ovarian tissue (Fig. 2b). To evaluate ovarian hormone production without access to serum, whole ovarian tissue steroid levels were determined. Ovarian tissue E2 levels were not significantly different across experimental groups (Fig. 3a). In contrast, whole ovarian tissue P4 levels were significantly lower in the habitat control (p = 0.005) and flight mice (p = 0.013) in comparison to baseline control mice (Fig. 3b). Due to insufficient animal numbers at individual stages within treatment groups, we were unable to evaluate stage effects alone and stage-treatment interactions. Fig. 2.

Ovarian tissue gene expression analyses Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of critical proteins involved in ovarian function and steroidogenesis were compared across treatment groups irrespective of stage of the cycle (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 2). Spaceflight had no demonstrable effect on gene expression of any of the key enzymatic steps of steroidogenesis or mitochondrial cholesterol uptake expression. Ovarian Cyp17a1 mRNA levels were elevated (p ≤ 0.05) in mice housed in the habitat maintained on the ground (HC) when compared to baseline and vivarium controls but were not different from flight animals that were housed in the habitat on the ISS (Fig. 4). Analysis of other critically important ovarian genes involved in steroidogenic production and action, including estrogen receptors (Esr1 and Esr2), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (Scarb1), luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr) as well as oocyte-specific proteins, growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9), zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (Zp3) showed no differences across the treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Lastly, as each group of animals had at least three animals staged at estrus, we compared the gene expression across the four treatment groups at this stage (Fig. 6). Levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star), P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (Cyp11a1), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b1), Cyp19a1, and liver receptor homolog-1 (Nr5a2) expression did not change appreciably across experimental conditions. Expression of Cyp17a1 under baseline and vivarium control conditions were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) compared to habitat control conditions (p < 0.05). Ovarian Cyp17a1 levels in flight animals in estrus were not notably different from estrus stage animals in the other experimental conditions (Fig. 6). Examination of other critical ovarian genes during estrus showed no significant changes in expression levels across control and flight conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2). Fig. 5.

    "discussion": "Discussion Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), a Validation mission launched aboard SpaceX’s fourth cargo resupply mission, was the first to transport rodents to the International Space Station (ISS) in an unmanned commercial vehicle. Lasting 37 days in microgravity, RR-1 was, at the time, the longest space rodent study conducted by NASA. In-flight studies of RR1 mouse behavior and post-flight physiology revealed the Validation mice showed no overt physiological signs of chronic stress or compromised health or welfare11. Moreover, mice remained highly active and mobile throughout the experiment, engaging in feeding, drinking, self-grooming, huddling, and social interactions12. Our results provide detailed consequences of long-term spaceflight microgravity on rodent estrous cycle, ovarian steroidogenesis, and gene expression. Notably, previous observations examining the potential impacts of microgravity on ovarian function and its target tissue the uterus were of a short-term nature and had the confounding effects of reentry prior to tissue collection3,9,13. It is well known that estrous cycle staging in female rodents can be influenced by a variety of factors such as age, light, temperature, humidity, ambient noise, nutrition, and social relationships14. Indeed, mice that are group housed exhibit greater estrous cycle irregularities, than those individually housed15,16. Nonetheless, many labs using contemporary strains of mice are able to stage mice in group housing conditions, albeit it may not be as ideal as single housed mice17–19. Again, group housing was necessitated by animal husbandry concerns and limitations of the NASA’s flight hardware. Our results point to an ability of female mice to exhibit estrous cycles after an extended duration in space, as evidenced by our observation that flight animals exhibited two different stages of the cycle (estrus and metestrus). Typically, under conditions of exogenous treatments/stress, mice may exhibit constant vaginal estrus or an extended or constant diestrus14,20, but not metestrus. In contrast to mice, rats exhibit a greater synchrony when group housed, making it difficult to extrapolate finding across these two species21. While measuring true estrous cyclicity in space is logistically daunting due to the intensive daily monitoring required, we posit that the analysis of the vaginal wall provides a robust methodology that can indicate the estrous stage, and thus the endocrine status of the animal at the moment of sacrifice. Indeed the morphology of these twice frozen and thawed vaginal wall tissues rivaled that of freshly isolated and fixed tissues from contemporary animals collected in our laboratory (data not shown) and in those laboratories who pioneered the use of vaginal wall histology as a mechanism to track cyclicity20,22,23. Ovarian tissue steroid levels are also not commonly measured, as most investigators use serum levels of estrogen and progesterone as a measure of ovarian steroidogenic activity. Again, in animals exposed to microgravity, the ability to collect serum at the time of sacrifice or longitudinally over time is severely restricted logistically. We, therefore, analyzed whole ovarian tissue levels of estrogen and progesterone. We detected no striking difference in tissue estrogen concentrations across the four treatment groups, and it should be noted that serum estrogen levels in rodents also do not exhibit wide variations across the cycle, often ranging from ND to 8–50 pg/ml in total24–27. In contrast, we did observe that flight and habitat control animals had lower overall P4 levels in ovarian tissue. One might predict this as these two groups had greater numbers of mice in metestrus and diestrus, in total 4 and 5 for flight and habitat groups, respectively. During both of these stages of estrous cycle the ovary has reduced steroidogenic activity26–28. This was in contrast to the vivarium and baseline control groups, which both had 8 animals each in proestrus and estrus in total, stages associated with increased ovarian follicular steroidogenesis. We recognize that it would have been ideal to examine the interaction of estrous cycle stage on ovarian steroidogenesis as well as ovarian gene expression, but due to the insufficient numbers of animals at individual stages, we were unable to do so. It is worth noting the experimental design for RR1 as a hardware demonstration flight determined how tissues were preserved as well as group sizes and thus were beyond our control. Whole ovarian gene expression analyses were also dictated by the RR1 design. This type of analysis is highly confounded as whole ovarian tissue contains an abundance of stromal tissue and smaller follicles, which predominate over the few selected follicles that become highly steroidogenic. Thus, when whole ovarian RNA is used, it was not surprising to see no major differences in ovarian gene expression across the treatment groups or even during different stages of the cycle. Future studies need to take into consideration this limitation, and collect and fix tissues for analysis, so they can be properly analyzed using in situ hybridization/RNAscope and immunohistochemistry. Cyp17a1, the enzyme located in the theca cell compartment of the ovarian follicle and responsible for androgen production was elevated in the habitat control animals. This difference was however, manifested primarily in two of the three HC animals in estrus. Safeguarding RNA tissue quality is acutely dependent on tissue storage methods, which ideally would minimize RNase activity throughout the process. Tissue collection and preservation during spaceflight presents a unique challenge in the analysis of these valuable specimens. Our current analyses of the right and left ovaries processed in RNALater or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN) indicated that LN preserved tissues always had greater RIN values when compared to those of RNALater. Previous studies utilizing RR1 RNAlater preserved spleen tissues showed higher RIN values than those observed here29. This may be due to a time of collection aspect with respect to spleen vs ovary following thawing of the carcass, or just to tissue differences in RNA susceptibility to the freeze/thaw. We note that freshly isolated ovarian tissues that were snap-frozen in LN and then simultaneously processed with the RR1 samples yielded RIN values >9. In conclusion, our analyses of ovarian tissues and vaginal wall tissues of mice exposed to extended periods of microgravity and sacrificed in space indicate that these female mice were exhibiting estrous cyclic activity. These studies point positively to the ability of these animals to either continue or regain estrous cycle activity during extended microgravity exposure. We posit that vaginal wall estrous cycle activity be collected and provided to investigators to include as covariate on all female mice used in future space missions, much the same as weight and age. The current studies also provide critical logistical information regarding tissue collection, particularly for organs such as the ovary and uterus, which are composed of highly dynamic tissues (follicles, corpora lutea, endometrium), we recommend that they be preserved primarily in fixatives or in a manner where tissue/cell specific aspects can be determined afterward. Lastly, the ability of these females to exhibit estrous cycle activity provides a tractable mammalian model system to test whether fertility is actually impacted by microgravity. Reproductive cycles characterized by alterations in hormone levels can exert significant effects on experimental outcomes, including emotion and the response to environmental stressors30. Determining the effects of spaceflight on estrous cyclicity is thus critical to making accurate interpretations of experimental endpoints for all spaceflight experiments using female mice.",

Determining the effects of spaceflight on the ovary and estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of all spaceflight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice (n = 10) were exposed to and sacrificed on-orbit after 37 days of spaceflight in microgravity. Contemporary control (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacrifice and similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial carcass thaw. Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was fixed for estrous cycle stage determinations. The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and flight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while progesterone levels were lower (p < 0.05) in habitat and flight compared to baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed across groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall estrous cycle classification of all female mice flown in space. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile. Subject terms: Physiology, Developmental biologyIntroduction Spaceflight microgravity is known to impact numerous physiological systems. These include cardiovascular changes, decreased bone mineral density, loss of muscle tone, adipogenesis, insulin resistance, vision and vestibular disturbances, altered fluid and electrolyte balance, and altered kidney function to name a few1. Many, if not all, normal homeostatic processes occurring within mammals, both male and female, are dramatically impacted by gonadal hormones. Indeed, the reproductive system is often considered one of the best markers of overall health and fitness of an animal2. However, research is limited regarding the effects of spaceflight on the reproductive system and its consequences on normal physiology3,4. The ovarian steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone, play a significant role in regulating a myriad of physiological functions, and are subject to cyclic changes based on the hypothalamic/pituitary regulation of ovarian folliculogenesis5. Moreover, ovarian steroidogenic output can be dramatically impacted by stress as well as other internal homeostatic processes6. In cycling rodents, the antral follicle is the primary steroidogenic tissue within the ovary, unless mating occurs at which time the corpus luteum becomes the major producer of progesterone. The mural granulosa cells and the vascularized theca cells within the antral ovarian follicles are responsible for the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to its ultimate endpoint product estradiol. In addition to steroidogenesis, these follicular cells also carry out the critical missions of nurturing the enclosed growing oocyte, as well as facilitating the process of ovulation, or expulsion of oocyte, and subsequent formation of the ephemeral corpus luteum. Cyclic and temporal changes in expression of steroidogenic pathway proteins and other critically important ovarian genes known to play critical roles in ovulation, oocyte development and corpus luteum development and function are well known and may be evaluated to provide information regarding ovarian function. Understanding these molecular changes is vital for informing female reproductive health during and after spaceflight. To date, studies of ovarian function and fertility in mice exposed to microgravity during NASA Space Shuttle flights were of short duration (<12 days) and, importantly, all included the effects of live reentry prior to collection of tissues and analysis of animal behavior3,7. Similarly, pregnant female rats flown on Cosmos 1514 (1982), NASA- Rodent (R)1 (STS-66 in 1994), and NASA- R2 (STS-70 in 1995) were of short duration (4.5–11 days) and had live animal return8–10. Notably, in the pregnant rats no effects of spaceflight on healthy and atretic ovarian antral follicle populations, fetal wastage in utero, plasma concentrations of progesterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) or pituitary content of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were noted8. Spaceflight, however, significantly increased plasma concentrations of FSH and decreased pituitary content of LH analyzed postpartum (day 22–23;8). In these prior studies, it is not possible to separate the effects of microgravity from that of reentry with the associated hypergravity, turbulence, and the likely ensuing stress responses linked to these events. Moreover, these studies while evaluating maintenance of pregnancy, provide no information regarding the fertility of these animals and their ability to exhibit normal estrous cycles and ovarian function. The current investigation provides insights into the endocrine status and ovarian cyclicity of female mice following an extended period of exposure to microgravity in the absence of reentry effects. Addressing the effects of extended duration spaceflight on endocrine status are significant and of high impact to long-term female astronaut health before and after flight, interpretation of spaceflight findings derived from female mice, and for long-term plans for multigenerational mammalian studies in spaceflight.Results Estrous cycle staging Estrous cycle stage for each mouse was determined by three independent investigators blinded to treatment group categories. Figure 1 shows representative H&E stained cross sections of vaginal wall tissue from the individual flight and habitat control animals following collection after the second carcass thaw during March of 2016. Each stage of the estrous cycle is depicted in Fig. 1. Proestrus is characterized by the presence of a thick layer of stratified squamous epithelium, with an absence of luminal cells and any cornified epithelial cells (Fig. 1a). Estrous stage animals exhibit a stratified squamous epithelium with a layer of cornified epithelial [red eosin stained cells above the nucleated stratified squamous epithelial cells (Fig. 1b)]. Often, this cornified layer is delaminated from the underlying epithelial cells. In metestrus, leukocytes appear and traverse the nucleated epithelial layer to reach the delaminated mass of cornified stratified squamous epithelium in the lumen (Fig. 1c). During diestrus, the vaginal wall is characterized by columnar mucified cells next to a thin layer of nucleated epithelium (Fig. 1d). Staging of the mice indicated that the majority of the animals in the baseline control group (6/9), the vivarium control group (5/8), and the flight group (6/10) were in estrus (Table 1). In comparison, habitat control mice presented at all stages of the cycle in approximately equal amounts (n = 2 or 3/stage). Flight group mice presented at estrus (n = 6) and metestrus (n = 4; Table 1). Fig. 1. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of vaginal walls used for estrous cycle staging.

Representative electropherograms from the Agilent 2100 are shown for 2 mice collected in either RNAlater or LN. Overall, RNA quality as determined by Agilent RNA integrity numbers (RIN values) from tissues frozen in LN were greater (p < 0.05) in every animal, and overall averaged around 5.71 ± 0.12 compared to 4.08 ± 0.11 for RNAlater preserved ovarian tissue (Fig. 2b). To evaluate ovarian hormone production without access to serum, whole ovarian tissue steroid levels were determined. Ovarian tissue E2 levels were not significantly different across experimental groups (Fig. 3a). In contrast, whole ovarian tissue P4 levels were significantly lower in the habitat control (p = 0.005) and flight mice (p = 0.013) in comparison to baseline control mice (Fig. 3b). Due to insufficient animal numbers at individual stages within treatment groups, we were unable to evaluate stage effects alone and stage-treatment interactions. Fig. 2.

Spaceflight had no demonstrable effect on gene expression of any of the key enzymatic steps of steroidogenesis or mitochondrial cholesterol uptake expression. Ovarian Cyp17a1 mRNA levels were elevated (p ≤ 0.05) in mice housed in the habitat maintained on the ground (HC) when compared to baseline and vivarium controls but were not different from flight animals that were housed in the habitat on the ISS (Fig. 4). Analysis of other critically important ovarian genes involved in steroidogenic production and action, including estrogen receptors (Esr1 and Esr2), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (Scarb1), luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr) as well as oocyte-specific proteins, growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9), zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (Zp3) showed no differences across the treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Lastly, as each group of animals had at least three animals staged at estrus, we compared the gene expression across the four treatment groups at this stage (Fig. 6). Levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star), P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (Cyp11a1), 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b1), Cyp19a1, and liver receptor homolog-1 (Nr5a2) expression did not change appreciably across experimental conditions. Expression of Cyp17a1 under baseline and vivarium control conditions were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) compared to habitat control conditions (p < 0.05). Ovarian Cyp17a1 levels in flight animals in estrus were not notably different from estrus stage animals in the other experimental conditions (Fig. 6). Examination of other critical ovarian genes during estrus showed no significant changes in expression levels across control and flight conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2). Fig. 5.

Lasting 37 days in microgravity, RR-1 was, at the time, the longest space rodent study conducted by NASA. In-flight studies of RR1 mouse behavior and post-flight physiology revealed the Validation mice showed no overt physiological signs of chronic stress or compromised health or welfare11. Moreover, mice remained highly active and mobile throughout the experiment, engaging in feeding, drinking, self-grooming, huddling, and social interactions12. Our results provide detailed consequences of long-term spaceflight microgravity on rodent estrous cycle, ovarian steroidogenesis, and gene expression. Notably, previous observations examining the potential impacts of microgravity on ovarian function and its target tissue the uterus were of a short-term nature and had the confounding effects of reentry prior to tissue collection3,9,13. It is well known that estrous cycle staging in female rodents can be influenced by a variety of factors such as age, light, temperature, humidity, ambient noise, nutrition, and social relationships14. Indeed, mice that are group housed exhibit greater estrous cycle irregularities, than those individually housed15,16. Nonetheless, many labs using contemporary strains of mice are able to stage mice in group housing conditions, albeit it may not be as ideal as single housed mice17–19. Again, group housing was necessitated by animal husbandry concerns and limitations of the NASA’s flight hardware. Our results point to an ability of female mice to exhibit estrous cycles after an extended duration in space, as evidenced by our observation that flight animals exhibited two different stages of the cycle (estrus and metestrus). Typically, under conditions of exogenous treatments/stress, mice may exhibit constant vaginal estrus or an extended or constant diestrus14,20, but not metestrus. In contrast to mice, rats exhibit a greater synchrony when group housed, making it difficult to extrapolate finding across these two species21. While measuring true estrous cyclicity in space is logistically daunting due to the intensive daily monitoring required, we posit that the analysis of the vaginal wall provides a robust methodology that can indicate the estrous stage, and thus the endocrine status of the animal at the moment of sacrifice. Indeed the morphology of these twice frozen and thawed vaginal wall tissues rivaled that of freshly isolated and fixed tissues from contemporary animals collected in our laboratory (data not shown) and in those laboratories who pioneered the use of vaginal wall histology as a mechanism to track cyclicity20,22,23. Ovarian tissue steroid levels are also not commonly measured, as most investigators use serum levels of estrogen and progesterone as a measure of ovarian steroidogenic activity. Again, in animals exposed to microgravity, the ability to collect serum at the time of sacrifice or longitudinally over time is severely restricted logistically. We, therefore, analyzed whole ovarian tissue levels of estrogen and progesterone. We detected no striking difference in tissue estrogen concentrations across the four treatment groups, and it should be noted that serum estrogen levels in rodents also do not exhibit wide variations across the cycle, often ranging from ND to 8–50 pg/ml in total24–27. In contrast, we did observe that flight and habitat control animals had lower overall P4 levels in ovarian tissue. One might predict this as these two groups had greater numbers of mice in metestrus and diestrus, in total 4 and 5 for flight and habitat groups, respectively. During both of these stages of estrous cycle the ovary has reduced steroidogenic activity26–28. This was in contrast to the vivarium and baseline control groups, which both had 8 animals each in proestrus and estrus in total, stages associated with increased ovarian follicular steroidogenesis. We recognize that it would have been ideal to examine the interaction of estrous cycle stage on ovarian steroidogenesis as well as ovarian gene expression, but due to the insufficient numbers of animals at individual stages, we were unable to do so. It is worth noting the experimental design for RR1 as a hardware demonstration flight determined how tissues were preserved as well as group sizes and thus were beyond our control. Whole ovarian gene expression analyses were also dictated by the RR1 design. This type of analysis is highly confounded as whole ovarian tissue contains an abundance of stromal tissue and smaller follicles, which predominate over the few selected follicles that become highly steroidogenic. Thus, when whole ovarian RNA is used, it was not surprising to see no major differences in ovarian gene expression across the treatment groups or even during different stages of the cycle. Future studies need to take into consideration this limitation, and collect and fix tissues for analysis, so they can be properly analyzed using in situ hybridization/RNAscope and immunohistochemistry. Cyp17a1, the enzyme located in the theca cell compartment of the ovarian follicle and responsible for androgen production was elevated in the habitat control animals. This difference was however, manifested primarily in two of the three HC animals in estrus. Safeguarding RNA tissue quality is acutely dependent on tissue storage methods, which ideally would minimize RNase activity throughout the process. Tissue collection and preservation during spaceflight presents a unique challenge in the analysis of these valuable specimens. Our current analyses of the right and left ovaries processed in RNALater or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN) indicated that LN preserved tissues always had greater RIN values when compared to those of RNALater. Previous studies utilizing RR1 RNAlater preserved spleen tissues showed higher RIN values than those observed here29. This may be due to a time of collection aspect with respect to spleen vs ovary following thawing of the carcass, or just to tissue differences in RNA susceptibility to the freeze/thaw. We note that freshly isolated ovarian tissues that were snap-frozen in LN and then simultaneously processed with the RR1 samples yielded RIN values >9. In conclusion, our analyses of ovarian tissues and vaginal wall tissues of mice exposed to extended periods of microgravity and sacrificed in space indicate that these female mice were exhibiting estrous cyclic activity. These studies point positively to the ability of these animals to either continue or regain estrous cycle activity during extended microgravity exposure. We posit that vaginal wall estrous cycle activity be collected and provided to investigators to include as covariate on all female mice used in future space missions, much the same as weight and age. The current studies also provide critical logistical information regarding tissue collection, particularly for organs such as the ovary and uterus, which are composed of highly dynamic tissues (follicles, corpora lutea, endometrium), we recommend that they be preserved primarily in fixatives or in a manner where tissue/cell specific aspects can be determined afterward. Lastly, the ability of these females to exhibit estrous cycle activity provides a tractable mammalian model system to test whether fertility is actually impacted by microgravity. Reproductive cycles characterized by alterations in hormone levels can exert significant effects on experimental outcomes, including emotion and the response to environmental stressors30. Determining the effects of spaceflight on estrous cyclicity is thus critical to making accurate interpretations of experimental endpoints for all spaceflight experiments using female mice.Methods Animals Forty 12-week old C57BI/6J female mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) were selected based on similar body weights for 4 experimental groups (16-week old at launch, n = 10/group): baseline control, vivarium control, habitat control, and flight. Flight mice were launched on SpaceX-4 (Rodent Research 1) on September 21, 2014, as part of NASA’s Validation study. Details of RR1 mission timeline (i.e., mouse pre-adaptation to cages, food) as well as mouse spaceflight hardware details are available11,12,31. Briefly, vivarium control mice were maintained in standard mouse cages (5 mice/cage) for the duration of spaceflight at Kennedy Space Center. Habitat control mice were housed in a Rodent Research Transporter and Habitat Hardware on Earth for durations consistent with flight times at the same density of mice as those in flight (n = 10/habitat). The habitat control was placed in the ISS Environmental Simulator at KSC on a 4-day delay to mimic flight temperature, CO2, and humidity conditions on the ISS for the duration of spaceflight. Baseline control mice were euthanized one day after launch and then partially dissected prior to freezing of the animal carcasses mimicking the procedures to be conducted on flight and for all other animals at the conclusion of experiment. Flight mice were exposed to microgravity for a total of 37 days (33 days on ISS and 4 days in the Dragon Capsule). Mice were euthanized by injection of Euthasol followed by cervical dislocation and immediately fast frozen intact (n = 8) or partially dissected (n = 2) prior to carcasses being frozen. Mice carcasses were frozen using pre-chilled Ice Bricks prior to transfer to the Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) aboard the ISS. All ground mice were processed similarly. Flight mice carcasses returned to Earth February 2015 aboard the SpaceX CRS-5 and were then maintained along with the control mice frozen at the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) at the Ames Research Center until dissection11. All animal procedures performed were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and the methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations11.Tissue collection Female reproductive tissues (ovary and uterus) were collected from all carcasses at about 35–45 min after removal from the −80 °C freezer. One ovary was placed into RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the other was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN). Similarly, the right and left uterine horns were placed in RNAlater or snap-frozen in LN; uterine tissues are part of an independent study by another investigator and will not be further described here. Tissues preserved in RNAlater were kept at 4 °C for 2 days then frozen and stored at −80 °C, tissues snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen were also stored at −80 °C. Following primary tissue dissections in April of 2015, the remaining carcass was refrozen and stored at −80 °C. In March of 2016, carcasses were thawed again for a secondary tissue dissection. At this time the combined cervix and vaginal wall were dissected free of the pelvic cavity, and these tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Following overnight fixation these tissues were transferred to 70% EtOH, in preparation for shipping to the University of Kansas Medical Center.RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis Ovaries tissues were transferred directly from RNAlater to tubes containing 1 ml of Trizol (Sigma) or 1 ml of Trizol was added directly to ovarian tissue snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were briefly dissociated on ice (3 bursts, 62 W) in a PowerGen 700 homogenizer (Fisher Scientific). RNA was isolated from Trizol as per manufacturer protocol. To facilitate precipitation 1 μL of glycogen (20ug/ul; Invitrogen) was added to aqueous fraction and the resulting pellet was then resuspended in 15 μL of RNase free water (ThermoFisher 18064022). An aliquot (1 μL) of this resuspended RNA was used to determine RNA concentration and RNA integrity number (RIN) values using the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Total RNA (400 ng) from each sample was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen/ThermoFisher) with random hexamer primers (IDT). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using a 1:5 dilution of cDNA on an Applied Biosystems HT7900 sequence detector. Genes interrogated included 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b1), P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (Cyp11a1), 17α-hydroxylase (Cyp17a1), P450 aromatase (Cyp19a1), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star), liver receptor homolog-1 (Nr5a2), estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1), estrogen receptor 2 (Esr2), scavenger receptor class B member 1 (Scarb1), luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr), zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (Zp3), and growth differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9). Primers were designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems) and purchased from IDT (see Supplementary Table 1). qPCR was performed for Hsd3b1, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Cyp19a1, Nr5a2, Esr1, Esr2, Scarb1, Zp3, Lhcgr, and Gdf9 using PowerSYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). qPCR on Star, and 18 S rRNA levels were determined using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) protocol and Applied Biosystems (Eukaryotic 18S rRNA Endogenous Control [VIC® ⁄ MGB Probe, Primer Limited]) probes and primers. Samples were run in triplicate, and the ΔΔCt method was used to calculate the relative expression between the samples after normalization with 18S levels. All SYBR Green reactions were evaluated for the presence of a single dissociation curve, to confirm the amplification of a single transcript and lack of primer dimers.Histological analysis Upon receipt of tissues from the BSP, the vaginal walls samples were transferred to tissue embedding cassettes, and processed through a standard series of dehydration steps prior to being embedded in paraffin. Tissue blocks were then sectioned on a Leica microtome at a thickness of 6 μm and mounted on microscope slides (Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientific). Tissue sections were then deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin prior to histological examination. Slides were randomized and sample (animal and treatment) labels were blinded prior to examination by three independent reviewers for estrous cycle staging (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, diestrus or not determinable). Non-determinable samples were the result of tissues not containing sufficient vaginal wall tissue to yield reliable results. Following independent reviews, those samples (~10%) without a consensus stage call were reevaluated by the reviewers and a consensus stage agreed upon.Radioimmunoassay The steroid content (estrogen/progesterone) content of the ovary, as determined by RIA, was used as a surrogate for serum analyses for establishing the functional ovarian status of the RR1 females at the time of their sacrifice. Flash frozen ovaries were halved and homogenized using a sonicator in 200 μL of PBS. Homogenate was spun down at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Approximately 150 μL of supernatant was collected. 100 μL of undiluted supernatant was shipped to the Ligand Assay and Analysis Core (UVA School of Medicine) on dry ice and the rest were stored as 50 μL aliquots at −80 °C. Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) were determined by commercial ELISAs (E2: Calbiotech, El Cajon, CA. Cat # ES180S-100; P4: IBL, Minneapolis, MN, Cat # IB79105). E2 assay characteristics were as follows: sensitivity = 3 pg/ml; intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) = 7.5%; inter-assay CV = 10.1%. For P4, sensitivity = 0.15 ng/ml; intra-assay CV = 6.5%; inter-assay CV = 10.3%.Statistical analysis One-way ANOVA was used to determine differences amongst treatment groups (flight status) or estrous cycle stage. Tukey’s mean separation tests were used to determine differences between mean once a significant F-test was observed. All statistical analyses and graphs for the RIA were performed using GraphPad Prism v6 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).Reporting summary Further information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.Supplementary information Supplementary Figures and Tables (335.7KB, pdf) Reporting Summary Checklist (69.1KB, pdf) Acknowledgements Rodent Research 1 was a joint operation between NASA and the ISS National Lab.

    "title": "Effect of spaceflight on Pseudomonas aeruginosa final cell density is modulated by nutrient and oxygen availability.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228280/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Abundant populations of bacteria have been observed on Mir and the International Space Station. While some experiments have shown that bacteria cultured during spaceflight exhibit a range of potentially troublesome characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic resistance and virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were cultured during spaceflight or on Earth. Although the final cell density of bacteria grown during spaceflight has been reported for several species, we are not yet able to predict how different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity environment. In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental conditions, or organism specific responses.Results Here, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-type P. aeruginosa to a ΔmotABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested.Conclusions These results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.Keywords: Spaceflight, Microgravity, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Flow cytometry, Motility",

    "methods": "Methods Bacterial strains and culture media Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 [23] and its isogenic motility mutant, ΔmotABCD[40], were used for the current experiment. All strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm in nutrient broth (NB) (Difco BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of ~6 x 106 CFU/mL. The modified artificial urine medium (mAUM) used in the present study is based on the medium previously described by Brooks et al.,[31]. To ensure reproducibility in media composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution (50x; Sigma, cat #: R7131) and L-glutamine solution (200 mM; Sigma, cat #: G7513) were substituted for peptone and yeast extract. The concentration of calcium chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5 mM to 0.25 mM to minimize precipitation during storage at 8°C. Sodium nitrate, 6 mM, was added to serve as a terminal electron acceptor and enable some growth under oxygen limiting conditions. Higher concentrations of sodium nitrate were avoided to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and limit the accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. To test the effects of carbon source, 2 mM citric acid was substituted by 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). To assess the role of phosphate availability, we used either 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate, where mAUM and mAUMg include 5 mM phosphate and mAUM-high Pi and mAUMg-high Pi contain 50 mM phosphate. The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.0. Spaceflight and ground control cultures Spaceflight and ground control cultures of P. aeruginosa were prepared and grown in a fluid processing apparatus (FPA) as described previously [24]. To load the FPA, a 13-mm diameter mixed cellulose ester membrane disc (Millipore) was first attached to a solid or a gas exchange (GE) insert with autoclavable double-sided tape (3 M). Next, 2.5 mL of media and 0.5 mL of inoculum were sequentially loaded into two compartments separated by a rubber stopper. Due to constraints imposed by the dimensions of the bevel, approximately 0.6 mL of air remained in the compartment containing the media after loading. A third compartment, for FCM samples only, was filled with 2.4 mL of 9% w/v paraformaldehyde in PBS. Three biological replicates were prepared for each experimental condition. Eight FPAs were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP), which enables simultaneous plunging of the rubber stoppers in each FPA, and were incubated in a Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) as described previously [30]. Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline shown in Figure 1. Before shuttle launch, all FPAs were loaded and stored at ambient temperature for at least 48 h to check for contamination. Samples were subsequently stored at 8°C (L-1) until activation. Five days before shuttle landing, the media and inoculum were combined and incubated at 37°C for 72 h (activation). Two days before shuttle landing, the temperature was decreased to 8°C and the FCM samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde (termination). Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after shuttle landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples. The attached membranes were separated from the liquid phase, planktonic fractions. Characterization and analysis of biofilm growth on the membranes have been reported separately [24]. Plate counting One mL of the planktonic fraction was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2510) for 8 min to disperse any clumps of cells. The planktonic fraction was serially diluted with PBS. Samples were spot-plated on NB agar and incubated at 37°C for 18 h prior to counting. Sample preparation and flow cytometric analysis Bacterial cells fixed with paraformaldehyde were washed with PBS and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies) for 2 h at room temperature according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stained samples were diluted to approximately 5 x 105 – 9 x 106 CFU/mL with PBS. Cell numbers were measured using a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 407 nm laser. To calculate the concentration of cells from FCM recorded events, liquid counting beads (BD Biosciences) were used following the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 50 μL of the liquid counting beads was added to 1 mL of each diluted sample. The beads were detected by FCM in a separate region that does not overlap with the cells. The number of events in the cell region was recorded until one thousand events in the bead region were detected. The concentration of cells in each sample was calculated using the following equation. Conc.ofcells=#ofeventsincellregion#ofeventsinbeadregionx#ofbeads/testtestvolumexdilutionfactor Effects of post-growth storage on viable cell counts and FCM data The experiments were performed using FPAs following the same timeline and temperature profile as described in Figure 1. FPAs were incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Samples were either processed immediately or stored at 8°C for 48 h. To process samples, 1 mL of culture was enumerated by plate counting and a second 1 mL fraction was fixed with paraformaldehyde and enumerated by FCM. Light microscopy For differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, P. aeruginosa stains fixed with paraformaldehyde after experimental termination. The fixed P. aeruginosa stains were observed using Olympus IX-81 inverted microscope equipped with DIC optics, 60x/1.35 oil Zeiss. Statistical analysis and numerical interpretation All data were represented as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of three biological replicates. Statistical comparison of the number of cells between normal gravity and spaceflight for each different condition was conducted using a one-tailed Student’s t-test. When assessing combinations of two factors (post-growth storage and the microgravity environment, or phosphate concentration in media and microgravity) or three factors (motility, phosphate concentration in media, and microgravity), the effects of each factor and their interaction were assessed by two or three-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey tests using PASW Statistics18 (SPSS Inc.). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.",
    "results": "Results Two assays of final cell density show inconsistent measurements of spaceflight and normal gravity cultures grown in specialized hardware To examine how spaceflight affects final cell density, P. aeruginosa PA14 was grown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS-135 in specialized hardware, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA). FPAs have been used extensively to culture microbes during spaceflight [8,13,15,17,24,30]. As shown (Additional file 1: Figure S1), FPAs are glass barrels with a bevel on the side. Rubber stoppers are added to form compartments and the bevel enables mixing of the fluids from the different compartments via a plunging action. The first compartment was loaded with modified artificial urine media (mAUM), which was used because it provides a physiologically relevant environment for the study of bacterial growth [31,32]. Understanding how microbes grow in urine aboard a spacecraft or space station may be important for minimizing the potential for both future infections and microbial-based failures of the essential water and waste purification systems. Further, because mAUM is a chemically defined medium, it can be easily manipulated to test effects of specific compounds on final cell density. The second compartment was loaded with cells used for inoculation stored in PBS. For fixed samples, a third compartment was filled with a 9% w/v paraformaldehyde solution in PBS. Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline shown in Figure 1. Prior to inoculation, the FPAs were stored at 8°C. Following inoculation, cells were cultured at 37°C for 72 h. A subset of the cultures were fixed with paraformaldehyde immediately following the 72 h culture period and all cultures were subsequently incubated at 8°C for approximately 48 h. This 48 h period corresponds to the time required for the shuttle to return to Earth, and storage at 8°C during this period minimized additional cell growth of viable cultures and increased the stability of the fixed samples [6,33]. Plate counting was conducted immediately following shuttle landing to determine the number of viable cells in the live samples. The paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were stained with DAPI and cell numbers were determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Timeline of spaceflight experiments. Four days before Shuttle launch (L-4): Media were loaded into FPAs. L-3: Inocula were loaded. L-2: After checking for contamination, 9% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixative was loaded for FCM samples only. Samples were stored at ambient temperature (AT) from L-4 to L-1. L-1: After a final contamination check, samples were loaded into the CGBA and stored at 8°C. F0: Space Shuttle Atlantis launched. F8: Samples were activated by mixing the media with the inocula. The temperature in the CGBA was increased to 37°C. F11: Samples were terminated by the addition of fixative (FCM samples only) 72 h after activation. The temperature in the CGBA was reduced to 8°C. F13: Space Shuttle Atlantis landed. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples.While we anticipated data from plate counting and FCM measurements of final cell concentration would yield similar results and reinforce each other, our analysis showed very different results from the two methods under a number of conditions. This discrepancy between the two methods was most pronounced when cells were cultured in mAUM containing 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). In mAUMg, FCM data indicated that growth during spaceflight led to increased cell numbers compared to normal gravity, while plate counting data showed no difference in the final cell density between spaceflight and normal gravity (Figure 2). However, when the phosphate concentration was increased from 5 to 50 mM (mAUMg-high Pi), FCM and plate counting data exhibited similar trends (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Comparison of plate counting and FCM measurements of microbial growth during spaceflight. Wild-type P. aeruginosa was cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight (gray bars) conditions in mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate. (a) The number of viable cells in unfixed samples was measured by plate counting. (b) The number of cells in fixed samples was measured by flow cytometry (FCM). Statistical differences between normal gravity and spaceflight for each experimental condition were analyzed by one-tailed t-test: *p < 0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N = 3.In order to resolve the discrepancies between plate counting data and FCM data, we conducted additional ground-based experiments where we focused on the effects of storing cells at 8°C following cell growth. Post-growth storage was targeted because bacterial storage at low temperatures is known to affect bacterial physiology and viability [34,35]. Although the FCM samples were also stored at 8°C for 48 h following cell growth, we note that the paraformaldehyde fixative was added prior to lowering the incubator temperature. To test the role of post-growth storage conditions on cell viability, we compared final cell concentrations obtained when cells were plated immediately following growth, or after post-growth storage at 48 h at 8°C. The same timeline and temperature profile from the spaceflight experiments (Figure 1) was followed. As shown in Figure 3, results from both plate counting and FCM showed that P. aeruginosa cultured in mAUMg exhibited a 7- to 9-fold decrease in cell numbers following storage at 8°C for 48 h (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA). Our results indicate that measurements of cell numbers following storage at low temperatures post-growth may not accurately represent the amount of growth that occurred in the FPAs, and differences in final cell densities observed between spaceflight samples and ground controls may be confounded by differences in death rates. Because it is not currently feasible to plate count directly following the growth period during spaceflight, FCM measurements of cells fixed immediately following growth provide more reliable information with respect to how much biomass was formed during the growth period. Hereafter, we will describe only the results obtained by FCM of samples fixed immediately after the growth period. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Post-growth storage of samples at 8°C for 48 h decreases final cell density. Wild-type P. aeruginosa was cultured in mAUMg containing 5 mM phosphate at 37°C for 72 h. Final cell density was measured immediately following growth (-) or following post-growth storage at 8°C for 48 h (+) by plate counting (black bars) or FCM (gray bars). For FCM samples, fixative was added immediately following growth (-) or after post-growth storage at 8°C for 48 h (+), and cells were stored at 4°C prior to staining and assessing cell numbers. Diamonds indicate results from two-way ANOVA: ♦♦p < 0.01. Error bars, SD; N = 3. Phosphate availability modulates the effect of spaceflight on final cell density P. aeruginosa grown in mAUM during spaceflight exhibited a modest, but significant, 1.5-fold increase in final cell density compared to normal gravity controls (p < 0.01, one-tailed t-test) (Figure 4(a)). We also measured final cell densities in mAUM where the concentration of phosphate was increased from 5 mM, which is the concentration found in normal human urine [32], to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi). In the case of mAUM-high Pi, no difference in the final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity (Figure 4(a)). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effect of spaceflight on final cell density of P. aeruginosa. Wild-type P. aeruginosa and a motility mutant (ΔmotABCD) were cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight conditions (gray bars) in FPAs with (a) solid inserts or (b) GE inserts. Cells were cultured in mAUM or mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate. Final cell density was measured by FCM. Effect of phosphate on final cell density is significant in FPAs with solid inserts [two-way ANOVA, ♦♦p < 0.01]. Effect of gravity on final cell density is significant in 5 mM phosphate conditions in FPAs with solid inserts [two-way ANOVA, p < 0.01]. Statistical differences between spaceflight and normal gravity for each experimental condition was analyzed by one-tailed t-test: **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N = 3.In addition to phosphate, we also examined the effect of carbon source on the response of P. aeruginosa to the spaceflight environment. Changing carbon source is known to affect P. aeruginosa metabolism and growth rate [36-38]. To assess the effect of carbon source on P. aeruginosa growth during spaceflight, we substituted the 2 mM citrate found in mAUM with 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). As shown in Figure 4(a), P. aeruginosa grown in mAUMg during spaceflight showed a 4-fold increase in final cell density compared to normal gravity controls (p < 0.05, one-tailed t-test). Similar to mAUM-high Pi, no difference between final cell densities in spaceflight and normal gravity cultures was observed when the phosphate concentration was increased to 50 mM (mAUMg-high Pi) (Figure 4(a)). These results show that while substituting citrate with glucose does not affect the final cell density of P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight, altering phosphate concentration does affect final cell density (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA), and that there is an interaction between the microgravity environment and phosphate concentration, as factors affecting final cell density, that is statistically significant (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA). This finding indicates that increasing phosphate availability can minimize the effect of spaceflight on final cell density of P. aeruginosa. Oxygen availability modulates the effect of spaceflight on final cell density We hypothesized that the effects of spaceflight on final cell density might differ between anaerobic and aerobic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we substituted the solid inserts used in the experiments described above with gas exchange (GE) inserts that allow the movement of gases via a gas-permeable membrane. GE inserts have been used previously to increase the oxygen availability and promote aerobic growth in FPAs [13,15,17,39]. Unlike cultures grown with solid inserts (Figure 4(a)), P. aeruginosa cultured in mAUM with GE inserts showed no difference in final cell density between normal gravity and spaceflight regardless of phosphate concentration (Figure 4(b)). Similar results were obtained for samples with GE inserts cultured in mAUMg and either 5 or 50 mM phosphate (Figure 4(b)). These results indicate that, similar to phosphate, increased oxygen availability can reduce the effects of spaceflight on final cell density. Role of swimming motility on spaceflight final cell density We also examined the effects of spaceflight on a motility mutant, ΔmotABCD, which lacks the motor proteins required for flagella-mediated swimming [40]. In mAUMg, ΔmotABCD cultured during spaceflight showed a 3-fold increase in final cell density compared to its normal gravity counterpart (p < 0.05, one-tailed t-test), while in mAUMg-high Pi there was no difference in final cell density (Figure 4(a)). We also cultured ΔmotABCD with GE inserts and observed no difference in the final cell density between spaceflight and normal gravity controls, regardless of phosphate availability (Figure 4(b)). Overall, we did not observe any significant differences between the final cell density of wild-type P. aeruginosa and the non-motile mutant under any of our experimental conditions (p > 0.05, three-way ANOVA; factors: gravity, phosphate, motility). Microscopy of planktonic cells does not show aggregation of P. aeruginosa PA14 Increases in aggregation and clumping of planktonic cells have been observed for Salmonella grown during spaceflight [13] and P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in LSMMG [41]. To assess whether spaceflight conditions induced cellular aggregation in our spaceflight experiments, we observed the fixed P. aeruginosa PA14 planktonic cells by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Interestingly, no clumps or aggregates with more than ~3 cells were observed following growth in mAUM with 5 or 50 mM phosphate during spaceflight or on Earth (Figure 5), or under any of the other media conditions tested (data not shown). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Absence of aggregation by planktonic cells grown in FPAs. Representative images obtained by DIC microscopy of paraformaldehyde-fixed P. aeruginosa cells grown in mAUM containing 5 mM phosphate (top) or 50 mM phosphate (bottom) during normal gravity and spaceflight. Scale bar is 10 μm.",
    "discussion": "Discussion We have shown that, within the constraints of our spaceflight experiments, FCM of fixed cells provides more reliable measurements of final cell numbers of planktonic cells grown in FPAs during spaceflight and on Earth. Although fixing the cells prevents one from distinguishing between live and dead populations, the effects of post-growth storage at 8°C on cell viability indicate that the viability of cells during post-growth storage should be assessed on Earth prior to spaceflight studies, and suggest that the use of viable cell measurements should be avoided when possible. Further, a recent study has shown that changes in growth rate that occur when Micrococcus luteus is cultured in simulated microgravity conditions can be lost within 7 h of exposure to normal gravity [42]. Changes in resistance to oxidative stress were similarly lost within 2 h after Staphylococcus aureus cells were removed from LSMMG conditions [43]. Of course, for certain spaceflight studies, such as those assessing changes in virulence or antibiotic resistance, the use of viable cells is essential. Interestingly, the observation that Salmonella virulence is increased following growth during spaceflight [13], which has been confirmed by both additional spaceflight and simulated microgravity experiments [15], indicates that at least some of the physiological changes that occur during spaceflight are maintained when the samples are returned to Earth and assayed or used immediately. In the Salmonella virulence studies, Wilson and co-workers stored cells in fresh media at ambient temperature following growth during spaceflight [13,15]. In our experiments we did not use this approach in order to avoid increases in cell number due to the additional media. Together these results highlight the careful, nuanced approach that must be taken in order to conduct spaceflight experiments that provide results that truly reflect how the cells grow and adapt to the spaceflight environment. We have systematically studied the effects of spaceflight on the final cell density of P. aeruginosa, assessing factors known to affect bacterial growth such as phosphate and oxygen availability, carbon source and motility. We have demonstrated that differences between final cell density of P. aeruginosa cultured during spaceflight and on Earth are dependent on nutrient and oxygen availability. Specifically, spaceflight increased the final cell density of P. aeruginosa when it was grown with low phosphate and low oxygen availability. When either phosphate or oxygen availability was increased, no difference between normal gravity and spaceflight was observed. Similar to previous observations that increasing phosphate concentration or supplementing media with the inorganic ion components of M9 media, which includes phosphate, can minimize the effects of spaceflight or LSMMG on virulence and acid tolerance of Salmonella[15], we observed that increasing the phosphate concentration from 5 to 50 mM in the artificial urine media minimized the differences between spaceflight and normal gravity final cell densities of P. aeruginosa. Berry et al., have also shown that phosphate uptake by Saccharomyces cerevisiae increased when cultured during spaceflight [44]. Taken together, these findings may indicate that phosphate plays a key role in microbial responses to spaceflight conditions. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether phosphate is acting simply as a growth-limiting nutrient, or if the effect is more specific. While cells grown with 5 mM phosphate are not likely to be starved for this essential nutrient, increasing phosphate concentration has been shown to increase the growth rate of P. aeruginosa[45]. We also observed that using GE inserts minimized differences between final cell concentrations following growth under normal and microgravity. Similarly, Wilson et al., did not observe any difference in final cell concentration between spaceflight and normal gravity when Salmonella was cultured in FPAs with GE inserts, as measured by FCM [13,15,17]. While we observed that the use of GE inserts was advantageous for bacteria grown in normal gravity, no additional increases were observed for spaceflight cultures when the solid inserts were replaced with the GE inserts. This may be attributed to a lower oxygen transfer rate in microgravity, as described previously for LSMMG [16]. Indeed, studies of P. aeruginosa PAO1 gene expression have indicated that growth in FPAs is likely microaerophilic or anaerobic even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradients within the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight conditions [17]. We have recently observed that the use of GE inserts also minimized differences in P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm growth between normal and spaceflight conditions [24]. In that case, we did see increases in biofilm biomass in spaceflight samples with GE inserts. However, the proximity of the biofilm substrate to the GE inserts ensured that any additional oxygen was delivered directly to the growing biofilm cells. Overall, these findings highlight the role that environmental conditions and nutrient availability have on modulating how microbes respond to the spaceflight environment. While motile bacteria have been predicted to be less affected by the indirect effects of gravity on Earth, such as cell settling, due to their ability to self-propel [14], we did not observe any difference between the final cell densities of motile and non-motile P. aeruginosa. This is likely due to the fact that even motile P. aeruginosa do not swim constantly. Indeed, bacterial motility has been shown to vary during growth [46], where the proportion of cells actively swimming decrease as bacteria approach stationary phase [47]. As such, the difference between our results and earlier experiments with E. coli[9] may be attributed to differences in the regulation of swimming motility between the two organisms under the conditions tested. Together, this suggests that while a constantly swimming population of cells may mitigate the role of gravity, the regulation of motility can lead even cells that are capable of swimming motility to be affected by gravity and to exploit the advantages of the microgravity environment. Unlike P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultured under LSMMG, P. aeruginosa PA14 cultured during spaceflight did not form cellular aggregates in planktonic cultures. This observation is likely due to differences in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are responsible for cellular aggregation [48]. Production of EPS in P. aeruginosa is known to be modulated by various environmental factors, including shear stress [49]. The difference between the LSMMG results and our spaceflight results may be due to the fact that the spaceflight environment has far lower shear than LSMMG [17]. It may also be due to differences in EPS composition between P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14, where P. aeruginosa PA14 has Pel as a primary polysaccharide, P. aeruginosa PAO1 has Psl [50]. Because similar aggregation has been observed with Salmonella grown during spaceflight [13] and S. aureus grown in LSMMG [43], further studies of how shear, nutrient availability and genetics affect this behavior may provide additional insights into how different microbes respond to the spaceflight environment.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions Our findings indicate that differences in P. aeruginosa final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between changes in mixing and transport that occur under microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. These results may improve our ability to predict how different microbes will respond to microgravity and how combinations of environmental and genetic factors affect important behaviors, such as growth and virulence, both during spaceflight and on Earth. Here, we have shown that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight appears to allow cells to grow better with limited resources when compared to similar conditions on Earth. Considering the majority of bacteria, including those that are found on spacecrafts and space stations, live in nutrient-limited environments, this finding highlights the need for ongoing studies of how these effects may affect crew health during long-term spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 4228280 PMID: 24192060 Abstract Background Abundant populations of bacteria have been observed on Mir and the International Space Station. While some experiments have shown that bacteria cultured during spaceflight exhibit a range of potentially troublesome characteristics, including increases in growth, antibiotic resistance and virulence, other studies have shown minimal differences when cells were cultured during spaceflight or on Earth. Although the final cell density of bacteria grown during spaceflight has been reported for several species, we are not yet able to predict how different microorganisms will respond to the microgravity environment. In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental conditions, or organism specific responses.Results Here, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-type P. aeruginosa to a ΔmotABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested.Conclusions These results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.Keywords: Spaceflight, Microgravity, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Flow cytometry, MotilityBackground Bacteria can sense changes in their surroundings and modulate their gene expression and physiology to adapt to a range of environmental conditions. A unique condition that bacteria encounter during spaceflight is significantly reduced gravity, known as microgravity [1,2]. Many studies have shown that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight can alter bacterial physiology, including increased growth rate, antibiotic resistance, and virulence [3]. The effects of microgravity on final cell density have been described for several bacterial species, including Escherichia coli[4-9], Bacillus subtilis[10,11], and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred to as Salmonella) [12,13]. A number of these studies have shown increased final cell density during spaceflight, while others have not observed significant differences between spaceflight and normal gravity conditions [14]. Interestingly, independent studies of the same species have also yielded differing results, where some examining E. coli during spaceflight have reported increased final cell density [5,8], and others have reported no differences relative to normal gravity controls [4,6]. Some studies have been repeated on multiple shuttle missions and yielded consistent results [13,15], suggesting that these differences are likely not due to issues with experimental design or reproducibility. As such, we hypothesize that these discrepancies may be attributed to differences in media and culture conditions, in addition to differences in how individual species respond to the microgravity environment. Benoit and Klaus have suggested that differences in motility may be responsible for some of these inconsistent observations [14]. They hypothesize non-motile bacteria have an advantage under spaceflight conditions due to a lack of cell settling and the resulting increases in local nutrient availability in the well-mixed environment, while motile cells are able to move actively towards nutrients under both normal and microgravity conditions [14]. Indeed, a previous spaceflight experiment, conducted by Thévenet et al., found that growth in microgravity increased the final cell density of a non-motile E. coli mutant lacking motB relative to normal gravity, while no differences were observed with the motile parent [9]. However, further studies are needed to examine whether motility plays a universal role in affecting microbial growth in microgravity. Recent studies have also indicated that media conditions can modulate how microgravity affects bacterial physiology [15-17]. Salmonella cultured in Lennox broth (LB) during spaceflight exhibited increased virulence in a murine model of infection compared to controls where Salmonella was grown on Earth. However, the use of M9 media or the addition of the inorganic ion components of M9 to LB was observed to mitigate the enhanced virulence of Salmonella induced during spaceflight [15]. A set of follow-up experiments tested the individual components of M9 and showed that the addition of phosphate alone to LB could prevent the increase in acid tolerance observed when Salmonella is grown in low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) [15]. In addition to phosphate, oxygen availability may also influence how bacteria grow and respond to the spaceflight environment. For example, oxygen is known to affect many aspects of the growth and physiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a facultative anaerobe, including growth, motility, and biofilm formation [18-20]. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen and was attributed to the spaceflight infection of an astronaut during Apollo 13 [21,22]. We recently examined biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa PA14, a virulent clinical isolate [23], and shown that differences in biofilm biomass observed between spaceflight and normal gravity can be minimized when oxygen availability is increased [24]. Modeling efforts have suggested that oxygen transfer rates may be decreased under LSMMG conditions compared to normal gravity conditions [16], and a number of genes involved in anaerobic metabolism were found to be up-regulated when P. aeruginosa PAO1, a less virulent laboratory reference strain [25,26], was grown during spaceflight [17]. These findings indicate that oxygen availability may influence bacterial responses to spaceflight, and highlight the interplay between changes in the environment due to the direct or indirect effects of microgravity, such as reduced oxygen transport, and changes in microbial physiology. However, previous studies have not examined changes in the response of planktonic cells to the spaceflight environment when oxygen availability is varied. The methods used to investigate microbial growth during spaceflight may also be responsible for some of the differences. To date, the measurement of bacterial cell density has most often been conducted after samples were returned to Earth due to constraints imposed by the nature of such spaceflight experiments [27]. The two methods of storing planktonic samples of bacteria grown during spaceflight prior to analysis used most frequently are the addition of a fixative to the culture [6,9,28] and the storage of live samples at low temperatures [4,5]. In the present study, we assess the use of two methods for measuring microbial cell concentrations following growth during spaceflight: plate counting of live samples and flow cytometry (FCM) of fixed samples. Plate counting has the advantage of allowing the measurement of viable cell numbers. FCM is a fast and precise method to count cells [29]. Furthermore, this method is able to directly count hundreds of thousands of cells in a single sample, thereby facilitating the generation of statistically meaningful results. We have investigated the effects of phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability and swimming motility on the final cell density of P. aeruginosa PA14 grown during spaceflight. Here, we demonstrate that the final cell density of P. aeruginosa is increased during spaceflight when culture conditions limit the availability of substrates required for growth. Specifically, growth during spaceflight led to an increase in final cell density when P. aeruginosa was cultured under low phosphate and low oxygen conditions. Increased availability of either phosphate or oxygen was observed to minimize the effects of spaceflight on the final cell density. These findings indicate that effects of gravity on final cell density can be modulated by the availability of growth-limiting substrates.Results Two assays of final cell density show inconsistent measurements of spaceflight and normal gravity cultures grown in specialized hardware To examine how spaceflight affects final cell density, P. aeruginosa PA14 was grown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis during STS-135 in specialized hardware, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA). FPAs have been used extensively to culture microbes during spaceflight [8,13,15,17,24,30]. As shown (Additional file 1: Figure S1), FPAs are glass barrels with a bevel on the side. Rubber stoppers are added to form compartments and the bevel enables mixing of the fluids from the different compartments via a plunging action. The first compartment was loaded with modified artificial urine media (mAUM), which was used because it provides a physiologically relevant environment for the study of bacterial growth [31,32]. Understanding how microbes grow in urine aboard a spacecraft or space station may be important for minimizing the potential for both future infections and microbial-based failures of the essential water and waste purification systems. Further, because mAUM is a chemically defined medium, it can be easily manipulated to test effects of specific compounds on final cell density. The second compartment was loaded with cells used for inoculation stored in PBS. For fixed samples, a third compartment was filled with a 9% w/v paraformaldehyde solution in PBS. Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline shown in Figure 1. Prior to inoculation, the FPAs were stored at 8°C. Following inoculation, cells were cultured at 37°C for 72 h. A subset of the cultures were fixed with paraformaldehyde immediately following the 72 h culture period and all cultures were subsequently incubated at 8°C for approximately 48 h. This 48 h period corresponds to the time required for the shuttle to return to Earth, and storage at 8°C during this period minimized additional cell growth of viable cultures and increased the stability of the fixed samples [6,33]. Plate counting was conducted immediately following shuttle landing to determine the number of viable cells in the live samples. The paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were stained with DAPI and cell numbers were determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Timeline of spaceflight experiments. Four days before Shuttle launch (L-4): Media were loaded into FPAs. L-3: Inocula were loaded. L-2: After checking for contamination, 9% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixative was loaded for FCM samples only. Samples were stored at ambient temperature (AT) from L-4 to L-1. L-1: After a final contamination check, samples were loaded into the CGBA and stored at 8°C. F0: Space Shuttle Atlantis launched. F8: Samples were activated by mixing the media with the inocula. The temperature in the CGBA was increased to 37°C. F11: Samples were terminated by the addition of fixative (FCM samples only) 72 h after activation. The temperature in the CGBA was reduced to 8°C. F13: Space Shuttle Atlantis landed. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples.While we anticipated data from plate counting and FCM measurements of final cell concentration would yield similar results and reinforce each other, our analysis showed very different results from the two methods under a number of conditions. This discrepancy between the two methods was most pronounced when cells were cultured in mAUM containing 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). In mAUMg, FCM data indicated that growth during spaceflight led to increased cell numbers compared to normal gravity, while plate counting data showed no difference in the final cell density between spaceflight and normal gravity (Figure 2). However, when the phosphate concentration was increased from 5 to 50 mM (mAUMg-high Pi), FCM and plate counting data exhibited similar trends (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Comparison of plate counting and FCM measurements of microbial growth during spaceflight. Wild-type P. aeruginosa was cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight (gray bars) conditions in mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate. (a) The number of viable cells in unfixed samples was measured by plate counting. (b) The number of cells in fixed samples was measured by flow cytometry (FCM). Statistical differences between normal gravity and spaceflight for each experimental condition were analyzed by one-tailed t-test: *p < 0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N = 3.In order to resolve the discrepancies between plate counting data and FCM data, we conducted additional ground-based experiments where we focused on the effects of storing cells at 8°C following cell growth. Post-growth storage was targeted because bacterial storage at low temperatures is known to affect bacterial physiology and viability [34,35]. Although the FCM samples were also stored at 8°C for 48 h following cell growth, we note that the paraformaldehyde fixative was added prior to lowering the incubator temperature. To test the role of post-growth storage conditions on cell viability, we compared final cell concentrations obtained when cells were plated immediately following growth, or after post-growth storage at 48 h at 8°C. The same timeline and temperature profile from the spaceflight experiments (Figure 1) was followed. As shown in Figure 3, results from both plate counting and FCM showed that P. aeruginosa cultured in mAUMg exhibited a 7- to 9-fold decrease in cell numbers following storage at 8°C for 48 h (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA). Our results indicate that measurements of cell numbers following storage at low temperatures post-growth may not accurately represent the amount of growth that occurred in the FPAs, and differences in final cell densities observed between spaceflight samples and ground controls may be confounded by differences in death rates. Because it is not currently feasible to plate count directly following the growth period during spaceflight, FCM measurements of cells fixed immediately following growth provide more reliable information with respect to how much biomass was formed during the growth period. Hereafter, we will describe only the results obtained by FCM of samples fixed immediately after the growth period. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Post-growth storage of samples at 8°C for 48 h decreases final cell density. Wild-type P. aeruginosa was cultured in mAUMg containing 5 mM phosphate at 37°C for 72 h. Final cell density was measured immediately following growth (-) or following post-growth storage at 8°C for 48 h (+) by plate counting (black bars) or FCM (gray bars). For FCM samples, fixative was added immediately following growth (-) or after post-growth storage at 8°C for 48 h (+), and cells were stored at 4°C prior to staining and assessing cell numbers. Diamonds indicate results from two-way ANOVA: ♦♦p < 0.01. Error bars, SD; N = 3.Phosphate availability modulates the effect of spaceflight on final cell density P. aeruginosa grown in mAUM during spaceflight exhibited a modest, but significant, 1.5-fold increase in final cell density compared to normal gravity controls (p < 0.01, one-tailed t-test) (Figure 4(a)). We also measured final cell densities in mAUM where the concentration of phosphate was increased from 5 mM, which is the concentration found in normal human urine [32], to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi). In the case of mAUM-high Pi, no difference in the final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity (Figure 4(a)). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effect of spaceflight on final cell density of P. aeruginosa. Wild-type P. aeruginosa and a motility mutant (ΔmotABCD) were cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight conditions (gray bars) in FPAs with (a) solid inserts or (b) GE inserts. Cells were cultured in mAUM or mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate. Final cell density was measured by FCM. Effect of phosphate on final cell density is significant in FPAs with solid inserts [two-way ANOVA, ♦♦p < 0.01]. Effect of gravity on final cell density is significant in 5 mM phosphate conditions in FPAs with solid inserts [two-way ANOVA, p < 0.01]. Statistical differences between spaceflight and normal gravity for each experimental condition was analyzed by one-tailed t-test: **p < 0.01; *p < 0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N = 3.In addition to phosphate, we also examined the effect of carbon source on the response of P. aeruginosa to the spaceflight environment. Changing carbon source is known to affect P. aeruginosa metabolism and growth rate [36-38]. To assess the effect of carbon source on P. aeruginosa growth during spaceflight, we substituted the 2 mM citrate found in mAUM with 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). As shown in Figure 4(a), P. aeruginosa grown in mAUMg during spaceflight showed a 4-fold increase in final cell density compared to normal gravity controls (p < 0.05, one-tailed t-test). Similar to mAUM-high Pi, no difference between final cell densities in spaceflight and normal gravity cultures was observed when the phosphate concentration was increased to 50 mM (mAUMg-high Pi) (Figure 4(a)). These results show that while substituting citrate with glucose does not affect the final cell density of P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight, altering phosphate concentration does affect final cell density (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA), and that there is an interaction between the microgravity environment and phosphate concentration, as factors affecting final cell density, that is statistically significant (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA). This finding indicates that increasing phosphate availability can minimize the effect of spaceflight on final cell density of P. aeruginosa.Oxygen availability modulates the effect of spaceflight on final cell density We hypothesized that the effects of spaceflight on final cell density might differ between anaerobic and aerobic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we substituted the solid inserts used in the experiments described above with gas exchange (GE) inserts that allow the movement of gases via a gas-permeable membrane. GE inserts have been used previously to increase the oxygen availability and promote aerobic growth in FPAs [13,15,17,39]. Unlike cultures grown with solid inserts (Figure 4(a)), P. aeruginosa cultured in mAUM with GE inserts showed no difference in final cell density between normal gravity and spaceflight regardless of phosphate concentration (Figure 4(b)). Similar results were obtained for samples with GE inserts cultured in mAUMg and either 5 or 50 mM phosphate (Figure 4(b)). These results indicate that, similar to phosphate, increased oxygen availability can reduce the effects of spaceflight on final cell density.Role of swimming motility on spaceflight final cell density We also examined the effects of spaceflight on a motility mutant, ΔmotABCD, which lacks the motor proteins required for flagella-mediated swimming [40]. In mAUMg, ΔmotABCD cultured during spaceflight showed a 3-fold increase in final cell density compared to its normal gravity counterpart (p < 0.05, one-tailed t-test), while in mAUMg-high Pi there was no difference in final cell density (Figure 4(a)). We also cultured ΔmotABCD with GE inserts and observed no difference in the final cell density between spaceflight and normal gravity controls, regardless of phosphate availability (Figure 4(b)). Overall, we did not observe any significant differences between the final cell density of wild-type P. aeruginosa and the non-motile mutant under any of our experimental conditions (p > 0.05, three-way ANOVA; factors: gravity, phosphate, motility).Microscopy of planktonic cells does not show aggregation of P. aeruginosa PA14 Increases in aggregation and clumping of planktonic cells have been observed for Salmonella grown during spaceflight [13] and P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in LSMMG [41]. To assess whether spaceflight conditions induced cellular aggregation in our spaceflight experiments, we observed the fixed P. aeruginosa PA14 planktonic cells by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Interestingly, no clumps or aggregates with more than ~3 cells were observed following growth in mAUM with 5 or 50 mM phosphate during spaceflight or on Earth (Figure 5), or under any of the other media conditions tested (data not shown). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Absence of aggregation by planktonic cells grown in FPAs. Representative images obtained by DIC microscopy of paraformaldehyde-fixed P. aeruginosa cells grown in mAUM containing 5 mM phosphate (top) or 50 mM phosphate (bottom) during normal gravity and spaceflight. Scale bar is 10 μm.Discussion We have shown that, within the constraints of our spaceflight experiments, FCM of fixed cells provides more reliable measurements of final cell numbers of planktonic cells grown in FPAs during spaceflight and on Earth. Although fixing the cells prevents one from distinguishing between live and dead populations, the effects of post-growth storage at 8°C on cell viability indicate that the viability of cells during post-growth storage should be assessed on Earth prior to spaceflight studies, and suggest that the use of viable cell measurements should be avoided when possible. Further, a recent study has shown that changes in growth rate that occur when Micrococcus luteus is cultured in simulated microgravity conditions can be lost within 7 h of exposure to normal gravity [42]. Changes in resistance to oxidative stress were similarly lost within 2 h after Staphylococcus aureus cells were removed from LSMMG conditions [43]. Of course, for certain spaceflight studies, such as those assessing changes in virulence or antibiotic resistance, the use of viable cells is essential. Interestingly, the observation that Salmonella virulence is increased following growth during spaceflight [13], which has been confirmed by both additional spaceflight and simulated microgravity experiments [15], indicates that at least some of the physiological changes that occur during spaceflight are maintained when the samples are returned to Earth and assayed or used immediately. In the Salmonella virulence studies, Wilson and co-workers stored cells in fresh media at ambient temperature following growth during spaceflight [13,15]. In our experiments we did not use this approach in order to avoid increases in cell number due to the additional media. Together these results highlight the careful, nuanced approach that must be taken in order to conduct spaceflight experiments that provide results that truly reflect how the cells grow and adapt to the spaceflight environment. We have systematically studied the effects of spaceflight on the final cell density of P. aeruginosa, assessing factors known to affect bacterial growth such as phosphate and oxygen availability, carbon source and motility. We have demonstrated that differences between final cell density of P. aeruginosa cultured during spaceflight and on Earth are dependent on nutrient and oxygen availability. Specifically, spaceflight increased the final cell density of P. aeruginosa when it was grown with low phosphate and low oxygen availability. When either phosphate or oxygen availability was increased, no difference between normal gravity and spaceflight was observed. Similar to previous observations that increasing phosphate concentration or supplementing media with the inorganic ion components of M9 media, which includes phosphate, can minimize the effects of spaceflight or LSMMG on virulence and acid tolerance of Salmonella[15], we observed that increasing the phosphate concentration from 5 to 50 mM in the artificial urine media minimized the differences between spaceflight and normal gravity final cell densities of P. aeruginosa. Berry et al., have also shown that phosphate uptake by Saccharomyces cerevisiae increased when cultured during spaceflight [44]. Taken together, these findings may indicate that phosphate plays a key role in microbial responses to spaceflight conditions. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether phosphate is acting simply as a growth-limiting nutrient, or if the effect is more specific. While cells grown with 5 mM phosphate are not likely to be starved for this essential nutrient, increasing phosphate concentration has been shown to increase the growth rate of P. aeruginosa[45]. We also observed that using GE inserts minimized differences between final cell concentrations following growth under normal and microgravity. Similarly, Wilson et al., did not observe any difference in final cell concentration between spaceflight and normal gravity when Salmonella was cultured in FPAs with GE inserts, as measured by FCM [13,15,17]. While we observed that the use of GE inserts was advantageous for bacteria grown in normal gravity, no additional increases were observed for spaceflight cultures when the solid inserts were replaced with the GE inserts. This may be attributed to a lower oxygen transfer rate in microgravity, as described previously for LSMMG [16]. Indeed, studies of P. aeruginosa PAO1 gene expression have indicated that growth in FPAs is likely microaerophilic or anaerobic even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradients within the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight conditions [17]. We have recently observed that the use of GE inserts also minimized differences in P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm growth between normal and spaceflight conditions [24]. In that case, we did see increases in biofilm biomass in spaceflight samples with GE inserts. However, the proximity of the biofilm substrate to the GE inserts ensured that any additional oxygen was delivered directly to the growing biofilm cells. Overall, these findings highlight the role that environmental conditions and nutrient availability have on modulating how microbes respond to the spaceflight environment. While motile bacteria have been predicted to be less affected by the indirect effects of gravity on Earth, such as cell settling, due to their ability to self-propel [14], we did not observe any difference between the final cell densities of motile and non-motile P. aeruginosa. This is likely due to the fact that even motile P. aeruginosa do not swim constantly. Indeed, bacterial motility has been shown to vary during growth [46], where the proportion of cells actively swimming decrease as bacteria approach stationary phase [47]. As such, the difference between our results and earlier experiments with E. coli[9] may be attributed to differences in the regulation of swimming motility between the two organisms under the conditions tested. Together, this suggests that while a constantly swimming population of cells may mitigate the role of gravity, the regulation of motility can lead even cells that are capable of swimming motility to be affected by gravity and to exploit the advantages of the microgravity environment. Unlike P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultured under LSMMG, P. aeruginosa PA14 cultured during spaceflight did not form cellular aggregates in planktonic cultures. This observation is likely due to differences in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are responsible for cellular aggregation [48]. Production of EPS in P. aeruginosa is known to be modulated by various environmental factors, including shear stress [49]. The difference between the LSMMG results and our spaceflight results may be due to the fact that the spaceflight environment has far lower shear than LSMMG [17]. It may also be due to differences in EPS composition between P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14, where P. aeruginosa PA14 has Pel as a primary polysaccharide, P. aeruginosa PAO1 has Psl [50]. Because similar aggregation has been observed with Salmonella grown during spaceflight [13] and S. aureus grown in LSMMG [43], further studies of how shear, nutrient availability and genetics affect this behavior may provide additional insights into how different microbes respond to the spaceflight environment.Conclusions Our findings indicate that differences in P. aeruginosa final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between changes in mixing and transport that occur under microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. These results may improve our ability to predict how different microbes will respond to microgravity and how combinations of environmental and genetic factors affect important behaviors, such as growth and virulence, both during spaceflight and on Earth. Here, we have shown that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight appears to allow cells to grow better with limited resources when compared to similar conditions on Earth. Considering the majority of bacteria, including those that are found on spacecrafts and space stations, live in nutrient-limited environments, this finding highlights the need for ongoing studies of how these effects may affect crew health during long-term spaceflight.Methods Bacterial strains and culture media Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 [23] and its isogenic motility mutant, ΔmotABCD[40], were used for the current experiment. All strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm in nutrient broth (NB) (Difco BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of ~6 x 106 CFU/mL. The modified artificial urine medium (mAUM) used in the present study is based on the medium previously described by Brooks et al.,[31]. To ensure reproducibility in media composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution (50x; Sigma, cat #: R7131) and L-glutamine solution (200 mM; Sigma, cat #: G7513) were substituted for peptone and yeast extract. The concentration of calcium chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5 mM to 0.25 mM to minimize precipitation during storage at 8°C. Sodium nitrate, 6 mM, was added to serve as a terminal electron acceptor and enable some growth under oxygen limiting conditions. Higher concentrations of sodium nitrate were avoided to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and limit the accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. To test the effects of carbon source, 2 mM citric acid was substituted by 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). To assess the role of phosphate availability, we used either 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate, where mAUM and mAUMg include 5 mM phosphate and mAUM-high Pi and mAUMg-high Pi contain 50 mM phosphate. The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.0.Spaceflight and ground control cultures Spaceflight and ground control cultures of P. aeruginosa were prepared and grown in a fluid processing apparatus (FPA) as described previously [24]. To load the FPA, a 13-mm diameter mixed cellulose ester membrane disc (Millipore) was first attached to a solid or a gas exchange (GE) insert with autoclavable double-sided tape (3 M). Next, 2.5 mL of media and 0.5 mL of inoculum were sequentially loaded into two compartments separated by a rubber stopper. Due to constraints imposed by the dimensions of the bevel, approximately 0.6 mL of air remained in the compartment containing the media after loading. A third compartment, for FCM samples only, was filled with 2.4 mL of 9% w/v paraformaldehyde in PBS. Three biological replicates were prepared for each experimental condition. Eight FPAs were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP), which enables simultaneous plunging of the rubber stoppers in each FPA, and were incubated in a Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) as described previously [30]. Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline shown in Figure 1. Before shuttle launch, all FPAs were loaded and stored at ambient temperature for at least 48 h to check for contamination. Samples were subsequently stored at 8°C (L-1) until activation. Five days before shuttle landing, the media and inoculum were combined and incubated at 37°C for 72 h (activation). Two days before shuttle landing, the temperature was decreased to 8°C and the FCM samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde (termination). Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after shuttle landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples. The attached membranes were separated from the liquid phase, planktonic fractions. Characterization and analysis of biofilm growth on the membranes have been reported separately [24].Plate counting One mL of the planktonic fraction was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2510) for 8 min to disperse any clumps of cells. The planktonic fraction was serially diluted with PBS. Samples were spot-plated on NB agar and incubated at 37°C for 18 h prior to counting.Sample preparation and flow cytometric analysis Bacterial cells fixed with paraformaldehyde were washed with PBS and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies) for 2 h at room temperature according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stained samples were diluted to approximately 5 x 105 – 9 x 106 CFU/mL with PBS. Cell numbers were measured using a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 407 nm laser. To calculate the concentration of cells from FCM recorded events, liquid counting beads (BD Biosciences) were used following the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 50 μL of the liquid counting beads was added to 1 mL of each diluted sample. The beads were detected by FCM in a separate region that does not overlap with the cells. The number of events in the cell region was recorded until one thousand events in the bead region were detected. The concentration of cells in each sample was calculated using the following equation. Conc.ofcells=#ofeventsincellregion#ofeventsinbeadregionx#ofbeads/testtestvolumexdilutionfactorEffects of post-growth storage on viable cell counts and FCM data The experiments were performed using FPAs following the same timeline and temperature profile as described in Figure 1. FPAs were incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Samples were either processed immediately or stored at 8°C for 48 h. To process samples, 1 mL of culture was enumerated by plate counting and a second 1 mL fraction was fixed with paraformaldehyde and enumerated by FCM.Light microscopy For differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, P. aeruginosa stains fixed with paraformaldehyde after experimental termination. The fixed P. aeruginosa stains were observed using Olympus IX-81 inverted microscope equipped with DIC optics, 60x/1.35 oil Zeiss.Statistical analysis and numerical interpretation All data were represented as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of three biological replicates. Statistical comparison of the number of cells between normal gravity and spaceflight for each different condition was conducted using a one-tailed Student’s t-test. When assessing combinations of two factors (post-growth storage and the microgravity environment, or phosphate concentration in media and microgravity) or three factors (motility, phosphate concentration in media, and microgravity), the effects of each factor and their interaction were assessed by two or three-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey tests using PASW Statistics18 (SPSS Inc.). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributions WK, FKT, JSD, JLP and CHC designed the study and prepared this manuscript.

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Manned space missions conducted over the past 50 years have expanded our knowledge of the universe, and have led to the identification of a range of challenges that must be addressed as we move towards the next phase of human space exploration. A key concern is how microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment affect bacterial growth, physiology and virulence. Several in-flight studies have reported that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight can alter bacterial growth and physiology, including increased final cell density, antibiotic resistance, and virulence (reviewed by Horneck et al. [1]). However, the effects of spaceflight on microbial community behaviors, such as biofilm formation, have not been systematically addressed. Furthermore, spaceflight has been shown to have harmful effects on astronauts including decreased immune system function [2]. Recent in-flight studies using Drosophila and mouse models have also shown that spaceflight can suppress the innate immune system [3], [4]. The combined microgravitational effects of decreased immune function in space travelers and increased resistance and virulence in bacteria may be detrimental to the health of the crew during long-term space exploration. To date, spaceflight studies on bacterial behavior have been conducted using suspension cultures. However, such cultures do not typically represent real-world situations because the majority of bacteria in nature exist in surface-associated microbial communities known as biofilms. Bacteria in biofilms often exhibit increased resistance to environmental stress, antibiotics, and host defense systems [5]. Thus, many problems caused by biofilms such as biofouling, corrosion, and infectious diseases are difficult to control using conventional antimicrobial treatments [5], [6]. Indeed, abundant biofilms were found in the Russian Mir space station and were responsible for increased corrosion and a blocked water purification system [7]. Ground-based studies have indicated that corrosion caused by biofilms can be detrimental to materials that were used on the International Space Station and other spacecrafts [8]. An experiment using simulated microgravity showed that Escherichia coli grown in simulated microgravity form thicker biofilms and exhibit increased resistance to stress compared to normal gravity controls [9]. In experiments conducted aboard STS-95, McLean et al. observed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is able to form biofilms during spaceflight [10]. However, their experimental system did not enable quantitative comparisons of biofilms formed during spaceflight and normal gravity. More recently, Wilson et al. observed that Salmonella cultured during spaceflight exhibited increases in cellular aggregation and clumping, processes that are associated with biofilm formation [11]. Despite such evidence that biofilm formation may be altered in a low gravity environment, systematic studies comparing biofilm formation during spaceflight and normal gravity have not been reported. To examine the role of microgravity on microbial biofilm formation, we conducted two sets of experiments aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-132 and STS-135) where we examined the growth of P. aeruginosa PA14, an opportunistic human pathogen and a model organism for biofilm studies. Previous studies have examined how planktonic P. aeruginosa cells respond to simulated microgravity and the spaceflight environment [12]–[16]. Crabbé et al., identified 167 genes and 28 proteins that were differentially regulated during spaceflight, and showed that the global regulator Hfq plays a key role in how P. aeruginosa responds to microgravity [16]. To study P. aeruginosa biofilm formation during spaceflight, we used specialized hardware designed for growing cells during spaceflight, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA; Figure S1). FPAs have been used in several recent studies of bacterial growth and physiology during spaceflight [11], [16], [17]. Briefly, an FPA is a glass barrel that can be divided into compartments by rubber stoppers. During spaceflight, a plunging motion can be used to mix the components loaded into the different compartments via a bevel on the side of the glass barrel. For our experiments, a mixed cellulose ester membrane disc was used as a biofilm substrate. A modified artificial urine media (mAUM, Table S1) was loaded into the first compartment containing the membrane. mAUM was used because it provides a physiologically relevant environment for the study of biofilms formed both inside and outside the human body [18]. The second compartment was filled with inoculum stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). For microscopy samples only, a third compartment was filled with a paraformaldehyde solution. As illustrated in the timeline shown in Figure S2, biofilms were formed under static conditions in FPAs at 37°C for 72 h. Subsequently, the temperature was decreased to 8°C to minimize further growth, and fixative was added to the microscopy samples. Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples. Here, we report the first evidence that spaceflight affects biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa, with increased numbers of viable cells, increased biomass, and increased thickness observed in spaceflight biofilms compared to normal gravity controls. Biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa during spaceflight also exhibited a column-and-canopy-shaped architecture that has not been observed previously. We show that flagella-driven motility plays a key role in formation of this novel architecture, and relate the mechanism to structured biofilm formation on Earth.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains and Culture Media Strains used in this study are shown in Table S2. Overnight shaking cultures of all strains were cultured at 37°C in nutrient broth (NB) (Difco BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed and resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of ∼6×106 CFU/mL. Modified artificial urine media (mAUM) was used as the growth media (Table S1) [18]. To ensure reproducibility in media composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution (50×; Sigma, MO, cat #: R7131,) and L-glutamine solution (200 mM; Sigma, MO, cat #: G7513) were substituted for peptone and yeast extract. The concentration of calcium chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5 mM to 0.25 mM to minimize precipitation during storage at 8°C. Sodium nitrate, 6 mM, was added to serve as a terminal electron acceptor and enable cell growth when the conditions in the FPAs become anaerobic. Higher concentrations of sodium nitrate were avoided to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and limit the accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. Phosphate concentration was lowered to 5 mM to decrease phosphate availability. mAUM includes 2 mM citric acid and 5 mM phosphate. To test the effects of phosphate availability on biofilms, the phosphate concentration was increased to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi). To test the effects of carbon source, 2 mM citric acid was substituted by 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.0. Spaceflight and Ground Control Cultures Spaceflight and ground control cultures were grown in specialized hardware, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA), designed by Bioserve Space Technologies (University of Colorado). FPAs consist of a glass barrel, rubber stoppers, and a solid or gas exchange (GE) insert (Figure S1). Glass barrels and rubber stoppers were lubricated by coating with Sigmacote (Sigma, MO) and autoclaved before use. First, a 13 mm diameter Millipore mixed cellulose ester membrane disc (catalog #: GSWP01300) was attached to a solid or GE insert with 3 M autoclavable double-sided tape. Second, a solid or GE insert was inserted to the edge of the bevel in the glass barrel. Next, 2.5 mL of media and 0.5 mL of inoculum were added to the FPA and separated by a rubber stopper. A third compartment, for microscopy samples only, was filled with 2.4 mL of 9% paraformaldehyde. Three biological replicates were prepared for each experimental condition. To facilitate group activation during spaceflight, eight FPAs were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP) that enables the simultaneous plunging of rubber stoppers to mix contents of the compartments in all eight FPAs. GAPs were stored in a Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) that accommodates 16 GAPs and enables temperature control. Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline (Figure S2). Three or five days before shuttle launch, all FPAs and GAPs were loaded. Samples were stored at 8°C. Four or five days before shuttle landing, the media and inoculum were combined and subsequently incubated at 37°C for 72 h. One or two days before shuttle landing, the temperature was decreased to 8°C and the microscopy samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde. An astronaut aboard the shuttle manually changed the incubator temperature and conducted the activation and termination mixing steps. Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after shuttle landing and were processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples. Viable Cell Counting Mixed cellulose ester membranes were detached from the insert and washed gently three-times with PBS to remove planktonic cells and loosely associated cells. The membrane was placed in 1 mL PBS and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2510) for 8 min. The sonicated samples were serially diluted with PBS in 96-well plate. The diluted samples were spot-plated on NB agar and incubated at 37°C for 18 h. Preparation of Biofilm Samples and Microscopic Observation Mixed cellulose ester membranes were detached and washed as described for viable cell counting. Biofilms were stained with a solution containing 1 µg/mL propidium iodide, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The staining procedure was adapted from Castaneda et al. [19], where the propidium iodide dye was substituted for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The use of a 1 µg/mL propidium iodide solution to stain fixed P. aeruginosa biofilms has been described previously [20]. Biofilm images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with detectors and filter sets for propidium iodide (excitation, 543 nm: emission, 565 nm). Images were obtained using a 40×/1.3 oil objective. Five image stacks (center and 1 mm right, left, up, and down from center) were obtained from each membrane. Simulated three-dimensional images and sections were generated using IMARIS 7.1 software (Bitplane AG, Switzerland). Analysis of confocal images was performed using COMSTAT software [21]. Void fraction was calculated using the following equation:",
    "results": "Results Spaceflight Increases Biofilm Formation To assess the effects of spaceflight on biofilm formation, we cultured P. aeruginosa biofilms and quantitatively compared biofilm formation between spaceflight and normal gravity. The number of viable cells within the biofilms was determined by plate counting. In addition, the biomass (µm3 biofilm/µm2 membrane) and mean thickness (µm) of the biofilms were determined from images obtained from confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with the aid of COMSTAT software [21]. The number of viable cells in P. aeruginosa biofilms formed in mAUM during spaceflight increased three-fold compared to those formed in normal gravity (p<0.01) (Figure 1A). Results from quantitative image analysis also indicated that spaceflight promotes biofilm production by P. aeruginosa, where both biomass (p<0.05) and mean thickness (p<0.01) increased significantly (Figures 1B and 1C). Figure 1. Spaceflight increases biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa.

Error bars, SD; N = 3. *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01.We tested the role of phosphate availability and carbon source on biofilm formation during spaceflight because previous reports have shown that spaceflight-dependent responses in planktonic cultures of Salmonella were modulated by nutrient availability [22]. When the concentration of phosphate in mAUM was increased from 5 mM to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi), biofilms cultured during spaceflight showed a 5-fold increase in viable cells (p<0.01), increased biomass volume (p<0.01), and increased mean thickness (p<0.01) (Figures 1A–C and Table S4). To assess whether the effect of spaceflight on biofilm formation is dependent on carbon source, we substituted 2 mM citric acid in mAUM with 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). As with mAUM, P. aeruginosa biofilms cultured in mAUMg and mAUMg-high Pi during spaceflight exhibited a 6- to 12-fold increase in viable cell counts (p<0.01), along with corresponding increases in biomass (p<0.01) and mean thickness (p<0.01), compared to normal gravity controls (Figure 1, Tables 1 and S4). Overall, we have observed that spaceflight induced an increase in the number of viable cells, biomass, and mean thickness of biofilms regardless of phosphate concentration or carbon source. The experiments with mAUM and mAUM-high Pi were conducted both on STS-132 and aboard STS-135. The results from STS-135 (Figure 1) were consistent with those from STS-132 (Figure S3). Planktonic growth was also observed to increase during spaceflight only under the low phosphate conditions found in mAUM and mAUMg (manuscript in preparation). However, no differences between spaceflight and normal gravity planktonic cell growth were observed when the concentration of phosphate in the media was increased to 50 mM, indicating that the observed increases in biofilm biomass are not solely due to increases in bacterial growth.

Spaceflight Alters Biofilm Architecture On Earth, P. aeruginosa forms mushroom-shaped, structured biofilms under hydrodynamic conditions, such as those found in flow-cell systems, in media containing glucose as a carbon source and flat biofilms in media with citrate [23]–[25]. Under static conditions, structured biofilms are generally not observed because of limited nutrient availability and aeration [5], [26]. To assess whether spaceflight causes any structural differences in P. aeruginosa biofilms, we compared CLSM images obtained from samples grown in spaceflight and normal gravity. The increased thickness of the biofilms formed in mAUMg during spaceflight is readily apparent from side view images (Figure 2A). Moreover, P. aeruginosa biofilms grown during spaceflight exhibited a structure consisting of columns overlaid with a canopy, while biofilms cultured in normal gravity showed flat structures. As shown in Figure 2B, the column-and-canopy structure can be seen clearly when slices of the biofilm, approximately 5.8 µm thick, were prepared from partial z stacks. The slice closest to the substratum clearly shows cell aggregates that have formed column-like structures with significant unoccupied space. Farther away from the membrane, biofilms grown in spaceflight showed dense, mat-like structures that form a canopy over the columns. In contrast, the normal gravity samples showed uniformly dense structures. Comparisons of the z stack slices showed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight formed column-and-canopy structured biofilms in mAUM (Figure S4), as well as mAUM-high Pi and mAUMg-high Pi (Table S4). To the best of our knowledge, such structures have not been reported previously. Further, the presence of three-dimensionally structured, as opposed to flat, biofilms was especially surprising due to the static environment in our biofilm culture system. Figure 2. P.aeruginosa biofilms cultured during spaceflight display column-and-canopy structures. Open in a new tab Confocal laser scanning micrographs of 3-day-old biofilms formed by wild type, ΔmotABCD, and ΔpilB comparing normal gravity and spaceflight culture conditions. All strains were grown in mAUMg with 5 mM phosphate. No significant differences in structure or thickness were observed with mAUMg containing 5 or 50 mM phosphate. (A) Representative side-view images. (B) Representative 5.8 µm thick slices generated from partial z stacks. Maximum thickness is indicated in the upper right corner of the top slice for each condition.Quantitative image analysis comparing the amount of unoccupied space within the biofilm structure also indicated a significant structural difference between biofilms formed in normal gravity and those formed during spaceflight. Specifically, we compared the void fraction of biofilms using the biomass and mean thickness values obtained from CLSM image analysis. Biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a 1.8-fold increase in void fraction compared to normal gravity controls (Tables 1 and S3). This observation is consistent with the large volume of empty space observed “underneath” the biofilm canopies formed under microgravity. Motility Affects Spaceflight Biofilm Formation Flagella-driven motility and type IV pili-driven motility have been shown to affect P. aeruginosa biofilm development [25], [27]. Furthermore, flagella-driven motility plays a key role in the development of structured biofilms under hydrodynamic conditions [28]. To examine whether motility plays a role in the formation of the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms during spaceflight we compared CLSM images obtained with wild-type P. aeruginosa with those formed by mutants deficient in flagella-driven motility, ΔmotABCD [29], and type IV pili-driven motility, ΔpilB [27]. As shown in Figure 2, the structure of ΔmotABCD biofilms cultured during spaceflight showed uniformly dense biofilms with no apparent structural difference from those cultured in normal gravity (Figures 2 and S4). In contrast, ΔpilB behaved similarly to wild type, where biofilms formed during spaceflight showed column-and-canopy structures and those formed in normal gravity showed dense, uniform biofilms (Figure 2). These findings indicate that, like the mushroom-shaped structured biofilms formed on Earth, flagella-driven motility plays a key role in formation of column-and-canopy structured biofilms. We also assessed the role of motility on biofilm production. Like wild-type P. aeruginosa, ΔmotABCD grown during spaceflight showed an 8-fold increase in number of viable cells in biofilms compared to those grown in normal gravity regardless of carbon source (Tables 1 and S3). From COMSTAT image analysis, however, no significant difference in biomass or mean thickness was observed in ΔmotABCD biofilms cultured in mAUM or mAUMg between spaceflight and normal gravity (Tables 1 and S3). The discrepancy between viable cell counting and COMSTAT analysis in ΔmotABCD biofilms indicates a difference in relative numbers of viable cells per volume of biomass, where spaceflight may increase either the amount of cells per volume of extracellular matrix or the viability of cells within the matrix. Like wild-type P. aeruginosa, ΔpilB biofilms grown during spaceflight showed increased viable cell numbers in biofilms (p<0.01), biomass (p<0.05), and mean thickness (p<0.01) compared to normal gravity controls (Table 1). Effects of Oxygen Availability on Biofilm Formation To assess the effect of oxygen availability on biofilm formation during spaceflight, we substituted the solid inserts used in the experiments described above with gas exchange (GE) inserts that allow the movement of gases via a gas permeable membrane (Figure S1). A significant increase in biofilm formation was observed with GE inserts compared to solid inserts under both normal gravity and microgravity conditions (Figure 3 and Table 1). Further, no differences between biofilms grown under normal and microgravity conditions were observed with the GE inserts for both wild type and ΔmotABCD. The structures of biofilms grown with GE inserts were flat and dense (Figure 3 and Table 1), similar to those observed under static conditions on Earth [26]. We also observed that the difference between the amount of planktonic biomass formed in normal gravity and spaceflight was minimized with the GE inserts (manuscript in preparation). Figure 3. Increased oxygen availability minimizes gravitational effects on biofilm formation by P.aeruginosa.

    "discussion": "Discussion We have shown that P. aeruginosa forms column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms during spaceflight and that flagella-driven motility plays a key role in the formation of this unique structure. Figure 4 summarizes how biofilms formed under the spaceflight culture conditions compare with those formed under two common laboratory culture conditions, static and hydrodynamic [26], [30]. Under hydrodynamic conditions, P. aeruginosa can form mushroom-shaped structured biofilms, while flat biofilms are generally observed under static conditions [23]. Under static conditions during spaceflight, however, biofilms with column-and-canopy structures were observed. Flagella-driven motility plays a key role the formation of column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms formed during spaceflight and the mushroom-shaped biofilms formed in hydrodynamic conditions on Earth. However, the formation of mushroom-shaped biofilms is dependent on a carbon source [31], while we have observed that the formation of column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms is independent of carbon source (Figures 2 and S4). Both the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms and the mushroom-shaped biofilms have two-layered structures, and the mushroom “stalks\" and columns are likely formed using the same mechanism, further evidenced by the fact that flagella-driven motility is required for both. While the top layer of the mushroom-shaped biofilms is an isolated cap structure, the top layer of the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms is a flat mat-like structure. The canopy is likely an extension and connection of the isolated “caps” observed in mushroom-shaped structures (Figure 4). While still an active area of research, the size of mushroom “cap” has been observed to be limited under hydrodynamic conditions in normal gravity by a combination of flow [32], gravity or natural dispersal mechanisms [5]. In contrast, the fluid dynamics surrounding cells in microgravity are extremely quiescent because of diminished gravity (∼10−6 g) [33], [34]. Under microgravity conditions, the virtual absence of flow and gravity may promote the unlimited expansion of the mushroom “caps” resulting in the formation of the intact canopy on top of the relatively widely spaced columns. The formation of flat biofilms with the GE inserts may be due an increase in biofilm growth rate, either by preventing the formation of the stratified structure or expanding into the space available under the canopy. However, it is possible that increased oxygen availability inhibits the formation of the column-and-canopy structure. Figure 4. Illustration summarizing the influence of gravity, flow, and motility on P.aeruginosa biofilm architecture. Open in a new tab We speculate that the increases in biofilm formation observed with the GE inserts are primarily due to increased oxygen availability. With the solid inserts, the conditions in the FPA are most likely microaerophilic to anaerobic as the cells consume the oxygen available in the liquid and air bubble present in the closed system. While the GE inserts were designed to provide an aerobic environment in the FPAs, results from P. aeruginosa gene expression studies have indicated that growth is likely oxygen limited even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradients within the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight conditions [16]. In the present study, the direct attachment of the biofilm substrate to the GE inserts maximized the oxygen available for surface-associated cells and minimized the differences in oxygen availability between spaceflight and normal gravity conditions. Overall, in the samples grown with the solid inserts, oxygen is likely a limiting substrate for growth. When the GE inserts were used to increase the oxygen availability, an increase in biofilm was observed and the difference between normal gravity and microgravity diminished. Therefore, the advantage conferred by microgravity is dependent upon resource availability, where changes in mixing, diffusion, sedimentation and other environmental factors play a more significant role under such limiting conditions. This observation is similar to results from Wilson et al., who showed that an increase in nutrient availability minimized the differences in virulence observed with Salmonella between normal and microgravity [22]. We anticipate that these data will lead to the development of mathematical models describing the physico-chemical environment experienced by the cells under microgravity and normal gravity conditions and insights into the nature of the differences that cause the observed changes in growth and dependence on nutrient availability. We have demonstrated that spaceflight can trigger changes in P. aeruginosa biofilm growth and architecture. To the best of our knowledge, these findings are the first evidence that spaceflight influences community-level behaviors of bacteria. Our findings indicate that altered biofilm formation during spaceflight may have detrimental impacts on long-term spaceflight missions, where increases in biofouling and microbially-induced corrosion could have profound impacts on mission success. Furthermore, it will be important to explore the effects of such changes on human health through pathogenic and beneficial interactions between humans and microbes during spaceflight. While further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the formation of the unique biofilm architecture observed during spaceflight, this work provides a set of data exploring conditions and parameters that are not possible on Earth. Thus, furthering our understanding of how environmental parameters alter biofilm formation by this key opportunistic pathogen. The unique morphology of the P. aeruginosa biofilms formed in microgravity suggests that nature is capable of adapting to non-terrestrial environments in ways that deserve further studies, including those exploring long-term growth and adaptation to a low gravity environment.",

Copyright notice ID: 3639165 PMID: 23658630 Abstract Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.Introduction Manned space missions conducted over the past 50 years have expanded our knowledge of the universe, and have led to the identification of a range of challenges that must be addressed as we move towards the next phase of human space exploration. A key concern is how microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment affect bacterial growth, physiology and virulence. Several in-flight studies have reported that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight can alter bacterial growth and physiology, including increased final cell density, antibiotic resistance, and virulence (reviewed by Horneck et al. [1]). However, the effects of spaceflight on microbial community behaviors, such as biofilm formation, have not been systematically addressed. Furthermore, spaceflight has been shown to have harmful effects on astronauts including decreased immune system function [2]. Recent in-flight studies using Drosophila and mouse models have also shown that spaceflight can suppress the innate immune system [3], [4]. The combined microgravitational effects of decreased immune function in space travelers and increased resistance and virulence in bacteria may be detrimental to the health of the crew during long-term space exploration. To date, spaceflight studies on bacterial behavior have been conducted using suspension cultures. However, such cultures do not typically represent real-world situations because the majority of bacteria in nature exist in surface-associated microbial communities known as biofilms. Bacteria in biofilms often exhibit increased resistance to environmental stress, antibiotics, and host defense systems [5]. Thus, many problems caused by biofilms such as biofouling, corrosion, and infectious diseases are difficult to control using conventional antimicrobial treatments [5], [6]. Indeed, abundant biofilms were found in the Russian Mir space station and were responsible for increased corrosion and a blocked water purification system [7]. Ground-based studies have indicated that corrosion caused by biofilms can be detrimental to materials that were used on the International Space Station and other spacecrafts [8]. An experiment using simulated microgravity showed that Escherichia coli grown in simulated microgravity form thicker biofilms and exhibit increased resistance to stress compared to normal gravity controls [9]. In experiments conducted aboard STS-95, McLean et al. observed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is able to form biofilms during spaceflight [10]. However, their experimental system did not enable quantitative comparisons of biofilms formed during spaceflight and normal gravity. More recently, Wilson et al. observed that Salmonella cultured during spaceflight exhibited increases in cellular aggregation and clumping, processes that are associated with biofilm formation [11]. Despite such evidence that biofilm formation may be altered in a low gravity environment, systematic studies comparing biofilm formation during spaceflight and normal gravity have not been reported. To examine the role of microgravity on microbial biofilm formation, we conducted two sets of experiments aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-132 and STS-135) where we examined the growth of P. aeruginosa PA14, an opportunistic human pathogen and a model organism for biofilm studies. Previous studies have examined how planktonic P. aeruginosa cells respond to simulated microgravity and the spaceflight environment [12]–[16]. Crabbé et al., identified 167 genes and 28 proteins that were differentially regulated during spaceflight, and showed that the global regulator Hfq plays a key role in how P. aeruginosa responds to microgravity [16]. To study P. aeruginosa biofilm formation during spaceflight, we used specialized hardware designed for growing cells during spaceflight, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA; Figure S1). FPAs have been used in several recent studies of bacterial growth and physiology during spaceflight [11], [16], [17]. Briefly, an FPA is a glass barrel that can be divided into compartments by rubber stoppers. During spaceflight, a plunging motion can be used to mix the components loaded into the different compartments via a bevel on the side of the glass barrel. For our experiments, a mixed cellulose ester membrane disc was used as a biofilm substrate. A modified artificial urine media (mAUM, Table S1) was loaded into the first compartment containing the membrane. mAUM was used because it provides a physiologically relevant environment for the study of biofilms formed both inside and outside the human body [18]. The second compartment was filled with inoculum stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). For microscopy samples only, a third compartment was filled with a paraformaldehyde solution. As illustrated in the timeline shown in Figure S2, biofilms were formed under static conditions in FPAs at 37°C for 72 h. Subsequently, the temperature was decreased to 8°C to minimize further growth, and fixative was added to the microscopy samples. Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples. Here, we report the first evidence that spaceflight affects biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa, with increased numbers of viable cells, increased biomass, and increased thickness observed in spaceflight biofilms compared to normal gravity controls. Biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa during spaceflight also exhibited a column-and-canopy-shaped architecture that has not been observed previously. We show that flagella-driven motility plays a key role in formation of this novel architecture, and relate the mechanism to structured biofilm formation on Earth.Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains and Culture Media Strains used in this study are shown in Table S2. Overnight shaking cultures of all strains were cultured at 37°C in nutrient broth (NB) (Difco BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed and resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of ∼6×106 CFU/mL. Modified artificial urine media (mAUM) was used as the growth media (Table S1) [18]. To ensure reproducibility in media composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution (50×; Sigma, MO, cat #: R7131,) and L-glutamine solution (200 mM; Sigma, MO, cat #: G7513) were substituted for peptone and yeast extract. The concentration of calcium chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5 mM to 0.25 mM to minimize precipitation during storage at 8°C. Sodium nitrate, 6 mM, was added to serve as a terminal electron acceptor and enable cell growth when the conditions in the FPAs become anaerobic. Higher concentrations of sodium nitrate were avoided to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and limit the accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. Phosphate concentration was lowered to 5 mM to decrease phosphate availability. mAUM includes 2 mM citric acid and 5 mM phosphate. To test the effects of phosphate availability on biofilms, the phosphate concentration was increased to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi). To test the effects of carbon source, 2 mM citric acid was substituted by 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.0.Spaceflight and Ground Control Cultures Spaceflight and ground control cultures were grown in specialized hardware, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA), designed by Bioserve Space Technologies (University of Colorado). FPAs consist of a glass barrel, rubber stoppers, and a solid or gas exchange (GE) insert (Figure S1). Glass barrels and rubber stoppers were lubricated by coating with Sigmacote (Sigma, MO) and autoclaved before use. First, a 13 mm diameter Millipore mixed cellulose ester membrane disc (catalog #: GSWP01300) was attached to a solid or GE insert with 3 M autoclavable double-sided tape. Second, a solid or GE insert was inserted to the edge of the bevel in the glass barrel. Next, 2.5 mL of media and 0.5 mL of inoculum were added to the FPA and separated by a rubber stopper. A third compartment, for microscopy samples only, was filled with 2.4 mL of 9% paraformaldehyde. Three biological replicates were prepared for each experimental condition. To facilitate group activation during spaceflight, eight FPAs were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP) that enables the simultaneous plunging of rubber stoppers to mix contents of the compartments in all eight FPAs. GAPs were stored in a Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) that accommodates 16 GAPs and enables temperature control. Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline (Figure S2). Three or five days before shuttle launch, all FPAs and GAPs were loaded. Samples were stored at 8°C. Four or five days before shuttle landing, the media and inoculum were combined and subsequently incubated at 37°C for 72 h. One or two days before shuttle landing, the temperature was decreased to 8°C and the microscopy samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde. An astronaut aboard the shuttle manually changed the incubator temperature and conducted the activation and termination mixing steps. Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after shuttle landing and were processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples.Viable Cell Counting Mixed cellulose ester membranes were detached from the insert and washed gently three-times with PBS to remove planktonic cells and loosely associated cells. The membrane was placed in 1 mL PBS and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2510) for 8 min. The sonicated samples were serially diluted with PBS in 96-well plate. The diluted samples were spot-plated on NB agar and incubated at 37°C for 18 h.Preparation of Biofilm Samples and Microscopic Observation Mixed cellulose ester membranes were detached and washed as described for viable cell counting. Biofilms were stained with a solution containing 1 µg/mL propidium iodide, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The staining procedure was adapted from Castaneda et al. [19], where the propidium iodide dye was substituted for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The use of a 1 µg/mL propidium iodide solution to stain fixed P. aeruginosa biofilms has been described previously [20]. Biofilm images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with detectors and filter sets for propidium iodide (excitation, 543 nm: emission, 565 nm). Images were obtained using a 40×/1.3 oil objective. Five image stacks (center and 1 mm right, left, up, and down from center) were obtained from each membrane. Simulated three-dimensional images and sections were generated using IMARIS 7.1 software (Bitplane AG, Switzerland). Analysis of confocal images was performed using COMSTAT software [21]. Void fraction was calculated using the following equation: Results Spaceflight Increases Biofilm Formation To assess the effects of spaceflight on biofilm formation, we cultured P. aeruginosa biofilms and quantitatively compared biofilm formation between spaceflight and normal gravity. The number of viable cells within the biofilms was determined by plate counting. In addition, the biomass (µm3 biofilm/µm2 membrane) and mean thickness (µm) of the biofilms were determined from images obtained from confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with the aid of COMSTAT software [21]. The number of viable cells in P. aeruginosa biofilms formed in mAUM during spaceflight increased three-fold compared to those formed in normal gravity (p<0.01) (Figure 1A). Results from quantitative image analysis also indicated that spaceflight promotes biofilm production by P. aeruginosa, where both biomass (p<0.05) and mean thickness (p<0.01) increased significantly (Figures 1B and 1C). Figure 1. Spaceflight increases biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa.

Error bars, SD; N = 3. *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01.We tested the role of phosphate availability and carbon source on biofilm formation during spaceflight because previous reports have shown that spaceflight-dependent responses in planktonic cultures of Salmonella were modulated by nutrient availability [22]. When the concentration of phosphate in mAUM was increased from 5 mM to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi), biofilms cultured during spaceflight showed a 5-fold increase in viable cells (p<0.01), increased biomass volume (p<0.01), and increased mean thickness (p<0.01) (Figures 1A–C and Table S4). To assess whether the effect of spaceflight on biofilm formation is dependent on carbon source, we substituted 2 mM citric acid in mAUM with 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). As with mAUM, P. aeruginosa biofilms cultured in mAUMg and mAUMg-high Pi during spaceflight exhibited a 6- to 12-fold increase in viable cell counts (p<0.01), along with corresponding increases in biomass (p<0.01) and mean thickness (p<0.01), compared to normal gravity controls (Figure 1, Tables 1 and S4). Overall, we have observed that spaceflight induced an increase in the number of viable cells, biomass, and mean thickness of biofilms regardless of phosphate concentration or carbon source. The experiments with mAUM and mAUM-high Pi were conducted both on STS-132 and aboard STS-135. The results from STS-135 (Figure 1) were consistent with those from STS-132 (Figure S3). Planktonic growth was also observed to increase during spaceflight only under the low phosphate conditions found in mAUM and mAUMg (manuscript in preparation). However, no differences between spaceflight and normal gravity planktonic cell growth were observed when the concentration of phosphate in the media was increased to 50 mM, indicating that the observed increases in biofilm biomass are not solely due to increases in bacterial growth.

ND, not determined.Spaceflight Alters Biofilm Architecture On Earth, P. aeruginosa forms mushroom-shaped, structured biofilms under hydrodynamic conditions, such as those found in flow-cell systems, in media containing glucose as a carbon source and flat biofilms in media with citrate [23]–[25]. Under static conditions, structured biofilms are generally not observed because of limited nutrient availability and aeration [5], [26]. To assess whether spaceflight causes any structural differences in P. aeruginosa biofilms, we compared CLSM images obtained from samples grown in spaceflight and normal gravity. The increased thickness of the biofilms formed in mAUMg during spaceflight is readily apparent from side view images (Figure 2A). Moreover, P. aeruginosa biofilms grown during spaceflight exhibited a structure consisting of columns overlaid with a canopy, while biofilms cultured in normal gravity showed flat structures. As shown in Figure 2B, the column-and-canopy structure can be seen clearly when slices of the biofilm, approximately 5.8 µm thick, were prepared from partial z stacks. The slice closest to the substratum clearly shows cell aggregates that have formed column-like structures with significant unoccupied space. Farther away from the membrane, biofilms grown in spaceflight showed dense, mat-like structures that form a canopy over the columns. In contrast, the normal gravity samples showed uniformly dense structures. Comparisons of the z stack slices showed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight formed column-and-canopy structured biofilms in mAUM (Figure S4), as well as mAUM-high Pi and mAUMg-high Pi (Table S4). To the best of our knowledge, such structures have not been reported previously. Further, the presence of three-dimensionally structured, as opposed to flat, biofilms was especially surprising due to the static environment in our biofilm culture system. Figure 2. P.aeruginosa biofilms cultured during spaceflight display column-and-canopy structures. Open in a new tab Confocal laser scanning micrographs of 3-day-old biofilms formed by wild type, ΔmotABCD, and ΔpilB comparing normal gravity and spaceflight culture conditions. All strains were grown in mAUMg with 5 mM phosphate. No significant differences in structure or thickness were observed with mAUMg containing 5 or 50 mM phosphate. (A) Representative side-view images. (B) Representative 5.8 µm thick slices generated from partial z stacks. Maximum thickness is indicated in the upper right corner of the top slice for each condition.Quantitative image analysis comparing the amount of unoccupied space within the biofilm structure also indicated a significant structural difference between biofilms formed in normal gravity and those formed during spaceflight. Specifically, we compared the void fraction of biofilms using the biomass and mean thickness values obtained from CLSM image analysis. Biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a 1.8-fold increase in void fraction compared to normal gravity controls (Tables 1 and S3). This observation is consistent with the large volume of empty space observed “underneath” the biofilm canopies formed under microgravity.Motility Affects Spaceflight Biofilm Formation Flagella-driven motility and type IV pili-driven motility have been shown to affect P. aeruginosa biofilm development [25], [27]. Furthermore, flagella-driven motility plays a key role in the development of structured biofilms under hydrodynamic conditions [28]. To examine whether motility plays a role in the formation of the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms during spaceflight we compared CLSM images obtained with wild-type P. aeruginosa with those formed by mutants deficient in flagella-driven motility, ΔmotABCD [29], and type IV pili-driven motility, ΔpilB [27]. As shown in Figure 2, the structure of ΔmotABCD biofilms cultured during spaceflight showed uniformly dense biofilms with no apparent structural difference from those cultured in normal gravity (Figures 2 and S4). In contrast, ΔpilB behaved similarly to wild type, where biofilms formed during spaceflight showed column-and-canopy structures and those formed in normal gravity showed dense, uniform biofilms (Figure 2). These findings indicate that, like the mushroom-shaped structured biofilms formed on Earth, flagella-driven motility plays a key role in formation of column-and-canopy structured biofilms. We also assessed the role of motility on biofilm production. Like wild-type P. aeruginosa, ΔmotABCD grown during spaceflight showed an 8-fold increase in number of viable cells in biofilms compared to those grown in normal gravity regardless of carbon source (Tables 1 and S3). From COMSTAT image analysis, however, no significant difference in biomass or mean thickness was observed in ΔmotABCD biofilms cultured in mAUM or mAUMg between spaceflight and normal gravity (Tables 1 and S3). The discrepancy between viable cell counting and COMSTAT analysis in ΔmotABCD biofilms indicates a difference in relative numbers of viable cells per volume of biomass, where spaceflight may increase either the amount of cells per volume of extracellular matrix or the viability of cells within the matrix. Like wild-type P. aeruginosa, ΔpilB biofilms grown during spaceflight showed increased viable cell numbers in biofilms (p<0.01), biomass (p<0.05), and mean thickness (p<0.01) compared to normal gravity controls (Table 1).Effects of Oxygen Availability on Biofilm Formation To assess the effect of oxygen availability on biofilm formation during spaceflight, we substituted the solid inserts used in the experiments described above with gas exchange (GE) inserts that allow the movement of gases via a gas permeable membrane (Figure S1). A significant increase in biofilm formation was observed with GE inserts compared to solid inserts under both normal gravity and microgravity conditions (Figure 3 and Table 1). Further, no differences between biofilms grown under normal and microgravity conditions were observed with the GE inserts for both wild type and ΔmotABCD. The structures of biofilms grown with GE inserts were flat and dense (Figure 3 and Table 1), similar to those observed under static conditions on Earth [26]. We also observed that the difference between the amount of planktonic biomass formed in normal gravity and spaceflight was minimized with the GE inserts (manuscript in preparation). Figure 3. Increased oxygen availability minimizes gravitational effects on biofilm formation by P.aeruginosa. Open in a new tab Representative side view confocal laser scanning micrographs of 3-day-old biofilms formed by wild-type P. aeruginosa and ΔmotABCD grown in mAUMg with gas exchange (GE) inserts comparing normal gravity and spaceflight culture conditions.Discussion We have shown that P. aeruginosa forms column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms during spaceflight and that flagella-driven motility plays a key role in the formation of this unique structure. Figure 4 summarizes how biofilms formed under the spaceflight culture conditions compare with those formed under two common laboratory culture conditions, static and hydrodynamic [26], [30]. Under hydrodynamic conditions, P. aeruginosa can form mushroom-shaped structured biofilms, while flat biofilms are generally observed under static conditions [23]. Under static conditions during spaceflight, however, biofilms with column-and-canopy structures were observed. Flagella-driven motility plays a key role the formation of column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms formed during spaceflight and the mushroom-shaped biofilms formed in hydrodynamic conditions on Earth. However, the formation of mushroom-shaped biofilms is dependent on a carbon source [31], while we have observed that the formation of column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms is independent of carbon source (Figures 2 and S4). Both the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms and the mushroom-shaped biofilms have two-layered structures, and the mushroom “stalks\" and columns are likely formed using the same mechanism, further evidenced by the fact that flagella-driven motility is required for both. While the top layer of the mushroom-shaped biofilms is an isolated cap structure, the top layer of the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms is a flat mat-like structure. The canopy is likely an extension and connection of the isolated “caps” observed in mushroom-shaped structures (Figure 4). While still an active area of research, the size of mushroom “cap” has been observed to be limited under hydrodynamic conditions in normal gravity by a combination of flow [32], gravity or natural dispersal mechanisms [5]. In contrast, the fluid dynamics surrounding cells in microgravity are extremely quiescent because of diminished gravity (∼10−6 g) [33], [34]. Under microgravity conditions, the virtual absence of flow and gravity may promote the unlimited expansion of the mushroom “caps” resulting in the formation of the intact canopy on top of the relatively widely spaced columns. The formation of flat biofilms with the GE inserts may be due an increase in biofilm growth rate, either by preventing the formation of the stratified structure or expanding into the space available under the canopy. However, it is possible that increased oxygen availability inhibits the formation of the column-and-canopy structure. Figure 4. Illustration summarizing the influence of gravity, flow, and motility on P.aeruginosa biofilm architecture. Open in a new tabWe speculate that the increases in biofilm formation observed with the GE inserts are primarily due to increased oxygen availability. With the solid inserts, the conditions in the FPA are most likely microaerophilic to anaerobic as the cells consume the oxygen available in the liquid and air bubble present in the closed system. While the GE inserts were designed to provide an aerobic environment in the FPAs, results from P. aeruginosa gene expression studies have indicated that growth is likely oxygen limited even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradients within the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight conditions [16]. In the present study, the direct attachment of the biofilm substrate to the GE inserts maximized the oxygen available for surface-associated cells and minimized the differences in oxygen availability between spaceflight and normal gravity conditions. Overall, in the samples grown with the solid inserts, oxygen is likely a limiting substrate for growth. When the GE inserts were used to increase the oxygen availability, an increase in biofilm was observed and the difference between normal gravity and microgravity diminished. Therefore, the advantage conferred by microgravity is dependent upon resource availability, where changes in mixing, diffusion, sedimentation and other environmental factors play a more significant role under such limiting conditions. This observation is similar to results from Wilson et al., who showed that an increase in nutrient availability minimized the differences in virulence observed with Salmonella between normal and microgravity [22]. We anticipate that these data will lead to the development of mathematical models describing the physico-chemical environment experienced by the cells under microgravity and normal gravity conditions and insights into the nature of the differences that cause the observed changes in growth and dependence on nutrient availability. We have demonstrated that spaceflight can trigger changes in P. aeruginosa biofilm growth and architecture. To the best of our knowledge, these findings are the first evidence that spaceflight influences community-level behaviors of bacteria. Our findings indicate that altered biofilm formation during spaceflight may have detrimental impacts on long-term spaceflight missions, where increases in biofouling and microbially-induced corrosion could have profound impacts on mission success. Furthermore, it will be important to explore the effects of such changes on human health through pathogenic and beneficial interactions between humans and microbes during spaceflight. While further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the formation of the unique biofilm architecture observed during spaceflight, this work provides a set of data exploring conditions and parameters that are not possible on Earth. Thus, furthering our understanding of how environmental parameters alter biofilm formation by this key opportunistic pathogen. The unique morphology of the P. aeruginosa biofilms formed in microgravity suggests that nature is capable of adapting to non-terrestrial environments in ways that deserve further studies, including those exploring long-term growth and adaptation to a low gravity environment.Supporting Information Figure S1 Specialized hardware for spaceflight experiments.

Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with the data available in GeneLab.

    "introduction": "Introduction Opportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized. There is presently no consensus on how best to analyze RNA-seq data, and the impact of analysis tool selection on results is an active field of research. Indeed, selections of trimming parameters (Williams et al., 2016), read aligner (Yang et al., 2015), quantification tool (Teng et al., 2016), and differential expression detection algorithm (Costa-Silva et al. 2017) all affect results. Because of such challenges, groups such as ENCODE and MINSEQE have developed standardized analysis pipelines for better comparison of RNA-seq datasets (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020; Functional Genomics Data Society, 2012). The NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) was created as a central repository for spaceflight-related omics-data. The repository includes data from experiments that profile transcription (RNA-seq, microarray), DNA/RNA methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. The most prevalent data type in this repository is RNA-seq from organisms exposed to spaceflight conditions. As of August 2020, the NASA GeneLab database has over eighty datasets with RNA-sequencing data (Table S1). These datasets include Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Arabidopsis thaliana (model higher plant), Oryzias latipes (Japanese rice fish), Helix lucorum (land snail), Brassica rapa (Fast Plant), Eruca vesicaria (arugula/edible plant), Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid), Ceratopteris richardii (aquatic fern), and the bacterium, Bacillus subtilis from experiments performed during true spaceflight on various orbital platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), as well as spaceflight-analog studies, such as hindlimb unloading and bed rest studies (Berrios et al., 2020). NASA's GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) projects have put forward an ambitious strategy focused on integrating data, metadata, and biospecimens to fully utilize the 40+ years of archived NASA Life Sciences data (Scott et al., 2020). One of the first steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets impact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data are harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientific community and held its first Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceflight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most common types of spaceflight datasets: transcription profiling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic software tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools. The main driver for developing the consensus pipeline was to present consistently processed data to the public, therefore making space-relevant multi-omics data more accessible and reusable. The overall goals were (1) to get more consistently processed data to the public; (2) to provide output data from every step of the consensus pipeline so users can download and use these “intermediate” data; (3) to support easier and more consistent analysis of space-relevant data by users including those in the NASA AWGs; and (4) to allow easier cross-analysis of experiments to identify effects that result from the spaceflight environment, independent of confounding factors. In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent. Therefore, providing new and processed datasets to the public allows biologists and others to more easily interpret these data and contributes significantly to our collective knowledge of the effects of spaceflight on terrestrial organisms. Here we present the RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) developed by the GeneLab AWG along with the rationale behind the tool settings and options selected. The RCP includes three distinct steps: data pre-processing, data processing, and differential gene expression computation/annotation (Figure 1A). These steps use tools for quality control (FastQC, MultiQC) (Andrews, 2010; Ewels et al., 2016), read trimming (TrimGalore) (Krueger 2019), mapping (STAR) (Dobin et al., 2013), quantification (RSEM) (Li and Dewey 2011), and differential gene expression calculation/annotation (DESeq2) (Love et al. 2014) (Figure 1B). The RCP has been integrated into the GeneLab database, and files produced by the RCP for each RNA-seq dataset hosted in GeneLab are and will continue to be publicly available for download. Figure 1. Open in a new tab GeneLab RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP) (A) The three broad steps of the RCP. The RCP handles (1) data preprocessing to trim sequencing adapters and to provide quality control metrics; (2) data processing to map reads to the reference genome and quantify the number of read counts per gene; and (3) differential gene expression calculation, which will provide a list of differentially expressed genes that can be sorted by adjusted p value and log fold-change. (B) The full RCP annotated with tools, input files, and output files.",
    "methods": "Methods All methods can be found in the accompanying transparent methods supplemental file.",
    "results": "Results Data pre-processing: quality control and trimming There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the first of which is data preprocessing (Figure 2A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ files from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) (Figure 2B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Data preprocessing (pipeline step 1): quality control and trimming (A) Data preprocessing pipeline. FastQ files from Illumina base-calling software are quality checked using FastQC and MultiQC. Data are then trimmed using TrimGalore and are re-checked for quality; (B) flags used for FastQC program; (C) flags used for MultiQC program; (D) flags used for TrimGalore program; trimmed reads (∗fastq.gz) are then used as input data for FastQC (B) followed by MultiQC (C) to generate trimmed read quality metrics. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The FastQC program is run on each individual sample file. However, reviewing the FastQC results for each sample file can be tedious and time consuming. Experiments typically have many sample files (biological and/or technical replicates) for multiple experimental conditions (spaceflight, ground control, etc.). For this reason, we also use the MultiQC package (Ewels et al., 2016) (Figure 2C) to create a summary statistics report that includes the same quality control result categories from FastQC across all experiment samples. After performing quality control on the raw FASTQ data, reads are trimmed using TrimGalore (Krueger 2019) to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality bases that would disrupt read mapping during the data processing pipeline step (Figure 2D). TrimGalore is a wrapper program that uses the cutadapt program (Martin 2011) for read trimming. TrimGalore was selected for the RCP due to its simplified command line interface, thorough output of trimming metrics, and ability to automatically detect adapters. In this step, bases that are part of a sequencing adapter or of low quality are removed from each read, and reads that become too short are subsequently removed. After trimming, the quality control programs, FastQC and MultiQC, are again run on the trimmed FASTQ files for viewing the quality control metrics of the reads that will be used for data processing. Once the data have been preprocessed, the sequenced reads are ready for mapping and quantification. Data processing: read mapping and sample quantification In the data processing step (Figure 1; Step 2A), the trimmed reads are first aligned to the reference genome (Figure 3A) with STAR, a splice-aware aligner (Dobin et al., 2013). STAR must be run in two steps. The first step is to create indexed genome files (Figure 3B). These files are used to assist read mapping and only need to be generated once for each reference genome file. This step requires reference FASTA and GTF files (Table S2). Some datasets include the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in control—a pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths and GC content covering a 220 concentration range (Jiang et al., 2011). If ERCC spike-ins were included, the spike-in FASTA and GTF files are appended to the reference FASTA and GTF files, respectively. The second step of STAR mapping is to use the indexed reference genome and the trimmed reads from the preprocessing step in order to map the reads to the genome and the transcriptome (Figure 3C). STAR will also produce genome mapped data, which can optionally be used to find reads that map outside of annotated reference transcripts. STAR mapping output data are in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format, which has a separate entry for each mapped read and states which transcript each read is mapped to. In order to improve the detection and quantification of splice sites, STAR is run in “two-pass mode.” Here, splice sites are detected in the initial mapping to the reference and used to build a new reference that includes these splice sites. Reads are then re-mapped to this dynamically generated reference to improve the quantification of splice isoforms (Dobin et al., 2013). Users are provided with these results (as per sample SJ.out files) for further analysis of differential splicing. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2A): read mapping (A) Data processing pipeline. Trimmed reads are mapped to their reference genome and transcriptome with STAR. Gene counts are then quantified with RSEM; (B) flags used for generating the indexed STAR reference files; (C) flags used for mapping reads with STAR. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The second part of processing is quantifying the number of reads mapped to each annotated transcript and gene (Figure 1A; Step 2B, Figure 4A). For this task, the RCP uses RSEM (Li and Dewey 2011). The main reasons for using RSEM are its ability to account for reads that map to multiple transcripts and distinguish gene isoforms. In short-read sequencing experiments it is likely that some number of reads will map to multiple regions in the genome. RSEM computes maximum likelihood abundance estimates to split the read count across multiple genes. Similar to STAR, RSEM is run in two distinct phases (Figure 4A). The first phase uses the reference genome and GTF files (with or without ERCC as appropriate) (Table S2) to prepare indexed genome files (Figure 4B). The second phase uses the indexed files and the mapped reads from STAR to assign counts to each gene (Figure 4C). There are two output files generated for each sample: counts assigned to genes and counts assigned to isoforms. Gene counts are used to calculate differential gene expression. Isoform counts are also generated as an option to look at differential isoform expression but are not used during differential gene expression calculation in the RCP. Once the RSEM count files are generated, the data are used to compute differentially expressed genes. A list of the reference genomes used in the GeneLab pipeline is available in Table S2 . These reference genomes were the most recent releases at the time each STAR and RSEM indexed references were created. Although it is possible to run STAR mapping through the RSEM toolkit, we elected not to do this because the alignment parameters used in this case are from ENCODE's STAR-RSEM pipeline and are not customizable. Thus, we would have been precluded from using the precise mapping parameters agreed to by the GeneLab AWG. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2B): gene quantification (A) Data processing pipeline. Mapping results from STAR are quantified by RSEM; (B) parameters for RSEM indexed reference files generation; (C) parameters for quantifying gene and isoform counts with RSEM. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS repository.We elected to adopt a mapping-based approach rather than rapidly quantifying the reads via a k-mer-based counting algorithm, pseudo-aligners, or a quasi-mapping method that utilizes RNA-seq inference procedures such as Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) or Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) despite their speed advantages. This is because alignment-free quantification tools do not accurately quantify low-abundant and small RNAs especially when biological variation is present (Wu et al., 2018). Furthermore, alignment of reads allows for additional analyses beyond transcript and gene quantification such as measurement of gene body coverage and detection of novel transcripts. There are several alignment-based mapping tools available and each has advantages and disadvantages. An alignment tool that is sensitive to splice-isoforms is critical to accurately identify how expression of splice-isoforms is affected by the spaceflight environment. DNA-specific aligners such as BWA (Li and Durbin 2009) and Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) cannot handle intron-sized gaps and thus an RNA-seq-specific aligner is needed (Baruzzo et al., 2017). In addition to splice-awareness, when selecting an aligner the following criteria were also considered: ability to input both single- and paired-end reads, handle strand-specific data, applicability to a variety of different model organisms with both low- and high-complexity genomic regions, efficient runtime and memory usage, ability to identify chimeric reads, high sensitivity, low rate of false discovery, and ability to output both genome and transcriptome alignments. Several studies have been conducted to compare the wide variety of available RNA-seq specific alignment tools, and of these, the STAR aligner consistently performs better than or on par with the tools tested for the indicated criteria (Baruzzo et al., 2017; Schaarschmidt et al., 2020; Raplee et al. 2019). Differential gene expression calculations and addition of gene annotations Once reads have been mapped and quantified, differential expression analysis is performed using the DESeq2 R package (Figure 1; Step 3, Figure 5A). Unlike the previous steps, a custom R script (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R or GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R) (Data S1and S2) is used to run DESeq2; to create both unnormalized and normalized counts tables; and to generate a differential gene expression (DGE) output table containing normalized counts for each sample, DGE results, and gene annotations (Figure 5B). The GeneLab DGE R script also creates computer-readable tables that are used by the GeneLab visualization portal to generate various plots so users can easily view and begin interpreting the processed data. These scripts are provided in the NASA GeneLab_Data_Processing Github repository (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). In the following sections we describe each step of these scripts in order. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differential gene expression calculation (pipeline step 3) (A) Data processing pipeline. The R program DESeq2 is run in order to determine which genes are differentially expressed between experimental conditions using gene count files from RSEM. (B) Output files generated. The table columns distinguish which script produces each output. The columns distinguish how those output files are used.The GeneLab DGE R script requires three inputs: the quantified count data from the previous (RSEM) step; sample metadata from the Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) tables in the ISA.zip file (provided in the GeneLab repository with each dataset) (Sansone et al., 2012; Rocca-Serra et al., 2010); and the organisms.csv file (Table S3), which is used to specify the organism used in the study and relevant gene annotations to load. Because samples from some GeneLab RNA-seq datasets contain ERCC spike-in and others do not, there are two versions of the GeneLab DGE R script, one for datasets with ERCC spike-in (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R, Data S1) and one for those without (GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, Data S2). Prior to running either script, paths to directories containing the input data and the output data location must be defined. Each script starts by defining the organism used in the study, which should be consistent with the name in the organisms.csv file so that it matches the abbreviations used in the PANTHER database (Mi et al. 2013; Thomas 2003) for that organism. Next, the metadata from the ISA.zip file are imported and formatted for use with the DESeq2 package. During metadata formatting, groups for comparison are defined based on experimental factors, and a sample table is created to specify the group to which each sample belongs. Next, a contrasts matrix is generated, which specifies the groups that will be compared during DGE analysis; each group is compared with every other group in a pairwise manner in both directions (i.e. spaceflight versus ground and ground versus spaceflight). This approach provides the user with the results for all possible group comparisons, allowing each user to select the most relevant comparisons for their particular scientific questions. After metadata formatting, the RSEM gene count data files from each sample are listed and re-ordered (to match the order the samples appear in the metadata), then imported with the R package, tximport (Soneson et al., 2015), and sample names are assigned. Prior to running DESeq2, a value of 1 is added to genes with lengths of zero, which is necessary to make a DESeqDataSet object. A DESeqDataSet object is then created using the formatted metadata and the count data that was imported with tximport. For datasets that contain samples with ERCC spike-in, we use the GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R script (Data S1). To reduce the possibility of skewing the data during DESeq2 normalization (McIntyre et al., 2011; Risso et al., 2011; Conesa et al., 2016; Law et al., 2016), all genes that have a sum of less than 10 counts across all samples are removed. The cutoff value of 10 is a best practice recommended by the DESeq2 tutorial on Bioconductor. These filtered data are then prepared for normalization and DGE analysis with DESeq2. Because there is no consensus for whether or not ERCC-normalization improves the accuracy of the results (Risso et al., 2014), the GeneLab project and its AWG members decided to perform the DGE analysis both with and without ERCC-normalization (for datasets with samples containing ERCC spike-in). To enable DESeq2 analysis with and without considering ERCC reads, the DESeqDataSet object is used to create a DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads. Because all samples must contain ERCC spike-in for ERCC-normalization, the DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads is used to identify and remove any samples that do not contain ERCC reads. Next, a DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads is created by removing rows containing ERCC reads. These data are then used for DESeq2 analysis. For DESeq2 analysis with ERCC-normalization (Data S2), the size factor object of the non-ERCC data is replaced with group B ERCC size factors for re-scaling in the first DESeq2 step. Group B ERCC genes contain the same concentration in both mix1 and mix 2. Therefore, only group B ERCC genes are used for generating the size factors for re-scaling duirng ERCC-normalization. For DESeq2 analysis without ERCC-normalization, the DESeq2 default algorithm is applied to the DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads. The unnormalized and DESeq2-normalized count data as well as the sample table are then outputted as CSV files. The “Unnormalized_Counts.csv,” “Normalized_Counts.csv,” and “ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv” files for each RNA-seq dataset are available in the GeneLab Data Repository; the “SampleTable.csv” file is used internally for verifying and validating the processed data prior to publication. There are two types of hypothesis tests that can be run with DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which is similar to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculation in linear regression and allows for comparison across all groups, and the Wald test, in which the estimated standard error of a log2 fold change is used to compare differences between two groups. The DGE step of the RCP performs both of these analyses. After normalization, the DESeq2 likelihood ratio test design is applied to the normalized data (both ERCC- and nonERCC-normalized data) to generate the F statistic p value, which is similar to an ANOVA p value and reveals genes that are changed in any number of combinations of all factors defined in the experiment. To prepare for building a gene/pathway annotation database, the STRINGdb (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) and PANTHER.db (Thomas 2003) libraries are loaded, and the organisms.csv file is read and used to indicate the Bioconductor AnnotationData Package needed (Huber et al., 2015; Gentleman et al., 2004). The current gene annotation database for the organism specified at the beginning of the R script is then loaded. Next, DGE tables containing normalized counts for each sample, pairwise DGE results, and current gene annotations as well as computer-readable DGE tables (that will be used for visualization) are created first with nonERCC-normalized data and then with ERCC-normalized data. For pairwise DGE analysis, first normalized count data are used to create two output tables: one that is used to create the human-readable DGE output table provided to users with processed data for each dataset and the other respective computer-readable DGE output table that contains additional columns and is used to visualize the data. Next, normalized count data are iterated through Wald Tests to generate pairwise comparisons of all groups based on the contrasts matrix that was generated during metadata formatting. The pairwise DGE analysis results are then added as columns to both DGE output tables. Then an annotation database is built by first defining the “keytype,” which indicates the primary type of annotation used (for most GeneLab datasets this is ENSEMBL). The keytype is then used to map to annotations in the organism-specific Bioconductor AnnotationData Package, and the following annotation columns are added to the annotation database: SYMBOL, GENENAME, ENSEMBL (if not the primary), REFSEQ, and ENTREZID. STRING and GOSLIM annotation columns are also added to the annotation database using the STRINGdb and PANTHER.db R packages, respectively. All of the aforementioned annotation columns are added to the annotation database to enable users to perform downstream analyses without having to map gene IDs themselves. Once the annotation database is complete, additional calculations are performed on the normalized count data before assembling the final DGE output tables. Means and standard deviations of normalized count data for each gene across all samples, and for samples within each respective group, are calculated and added as columns to the DGE output tables. A column containing the F statistic p value, calculated previously, is also added to the DGE output tables. The following columns are added only to the computer-readable DGE output table (used for visualization): a column to indicate whether each gene (or pathway) is up- or downregulated for each pairwise comparison, a column to indicate genes that are differentially expressed using a p value cutoff of ≤0.1 and another column using a p value cutoff of ≤0.05, a column indicating the log2 of the p value for each pairwise comparison and another column indicating the log2 of the adjusted p value, both of which are used to create Volcano plots. After all columns are added to the DGE tables, both the human- and computer-readable DGE tables are combined with the current annotation database to create the complete human- and computer-readable DGE tables. An example of the complete human readable DGE tables provided with processed RNAseq datasets in the GeneLab Data Repository is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Principal component analysis (PCA) is also performed on the normalized count data and used to create PCA plots for the GeneLab data visualization portal. DGE analysis of datasets without ERCC spike-in is performed exactly the same way as the nonERCC-normalized approach described above, except that no ERCC reads have to be removed from the DESeqDataSet object prior to DESeq analysis.

To showcase the value of using a consensus pipeline and publishing the processed data from each step of the pipeline, downstream analyses were performed using processed data from select samples from RNAseq datasets hosted on GeneLab. One of the advantages of providing expression data of all samples in each dataset as well as all possible pairwise DGE comparisons is to allow users the flexibility to pick and choose which samples and which comparisons they would like to focus on. Thus, when selecting samples for downstream analysis, we exercised this flexibility and searched the GeneLab Data Repository for datasets/samples that met a specific set of criteria. These criteria were as follows: (1) datasets that evaluated the same tissue (liver) from the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) and sex (female), (2) only samples derived from animals flown in space and respective ground control samples, (3) studies that used the same preservation protocol (liver samples extracted from frozen carcasses post-mission) and library preparation method (ribo-depletion), and (4) samples that contained ERCC spike-in to evaluate outputs with and without ERCC normalization. Select samples from two GeneLab datasets, GLDS-168 and GLDS-245, met these criteria, and processed data including the Normalized_Counts.csv, differential_expression.csv, ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv, and the ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files from these two datasets were used for downstream analyses. Prior to downstream analysis, the processed data files were filtered so that only samples that met the criteria listed above were included. Because GLDS-168 contains samples from both the Rodent Research 1 (RR-1) and RR-3 missions and only the RR-1 mission met our first criteria of using the C57BL/6 mouse strain, RR-3 samples were removed from the process data files. GLDS-168 processed data files were subsequently filtered to remove all samples, except spaceflight (FLT) and respective ground control (GC) samples, to meet the second criteria listed above. Lastly, because GLDS-168 contains a set of FLT and GC samples that were spiked with ERCC and another set in which ERCC was not added, the later set of samples were removed to meet the fourth criteria. GLDS-245 contains liver samples from the RR-6 mission, which included a set of animals that were returned to earth alive after ∼30 days of spaceflight and another set of animals that remained in space (aboard the ISS) for a total of ∼60 days before being sacrificed aboard the ISS (note that there were respective control samples for each set of spaceflight animals described). The former set of animals had their livers dissected immediately after euthanasia, whereas livers from the latter set of animals were frozen in situ and dissected from frozen carcasses after return to earth. Thus, only the later (ISS-terminal) set of FLT and respective GC samples met criteria 2 and 3, so the GLDS-245 processed data files were filtered to remove all other samples. In addition, because the downstream analyses focused on the differences between FLT and GC samples in these two datasets, all other comparisons were removed from the differential_expression.csv and ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files prior to analysis. The filtered processed data files (available in Mendeley Data, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/fv3kd6h7k4.1) were then used to create Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots (Figures 6A, 6B, S1A, and S1B), heatmaps containing the top 30 most significant FLT versus GC differentially expressed (and annotated) genes (adj. p value <0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) (Figures 6C, 6D, S1C, and S1D), and to evaluate FLT versus GC gene ontology (GO) differences using Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA) analysis (Tables 3 and S5). These results can then be further evaluated to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between these two studies and draw novel conclusions about the effects of spaceflight that are consistent across spaceflight experiments.

    "discussion": "Discussion The differentially expressed genes calculated by the RCP can be further explored with a variety of tools designed for higher-order analysis. For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and/or metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab working group members include WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), PIANO (Väremo et al. 2013), Reactome (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), and ToppFun (Chen et al., 2009). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives. The RCP has been designed to handle sequencing experiments that either lack or include the ERCC RNA spike-in mix—a set of 96 polyadenylated RNAs that can be used during differential gene expression calculation to normalize read counts across samples (Munro et al., 2014). However, the use of normalization according to ERCC spike-ins remains controversial among AWG members, and Munro et al. suggested its usage only for determining limit of detection of ratio (LODR), expression ratio variability, and measurement bias (Munro et al., 2014). For this reason, ERCC normalization remains optional in the GeneLab pipeline, and both kinds of DGE outputs are provided in the GeneLab database. In addition, ERCC spike-in could have two other usages. First, it allows us to evaluate whether normalization succeeded in removing systemic bias between libraries by using methods such as Rlog and VST when normalizing the spike-in RNAs along with all other genes. Second, most normalization methods of RNA-seq data assume that most genes are not differentially expressed toward one direction. Comparing spike-in measurements between libraries will help us to estimate the validity of this assumption. A high number of biological replicates can increase certainty in the differentially expressed genes determined by the RCP. However, conducting experiments in spaceflight often limits the number of biological replicates that a researcher can include. Therefore, it is important to note that at least three biological replicates are required for the pipeline, specifically for DESeq2, to perform its statistical methods. However, at least six replicates are suggested in order to minimize the false discovery rate (FDR) (Schurch et al., 2016). Finally, RNA-seq datasets hosted on GeneLab that do not contain biological replicates are only processed up until unnormalized (raw) counts are obtained, the step right before DESeq2 is used for DGE calculation. More advanced RCP users might have additional data inquiries that fall beyond the scope of this pipeline. For this reason, there are two parts of the pipeline that include additional output that are not used in our differential gene expression computation. The first is in the output from STAR, mapping output is also provided in genomic coordinates. This is useful for obtaining reads that are mapped outside of the reference transcriptome. For example, this may be used to find novel genes, transcripts, or exons that have not yet been annotated by consortiums. The second part of the pipeline with alternative output files is RSEM. This also provides transcript-level counts that can be used to investigate differential isoform expression. Moreover, intermediate files are provided as outputs to allow users to use components of the pipeline that they find useful. The GeneLab database also includes other types of transcriptomic data. As discussed in this article, the RCP is not used for microarray data that are fundamentally different, and the AWG is still debating the best approach for cross-dataset comparisons between microarrays. GeneLab also accepts data from long read experiments, such as those produced by Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Roberts et al. 2013) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing (Jain et al., 2016). Long-read data would be processed with similar steps to the RCP but will require tools specifically designed for the intricacies of long-read data, such as reads that contain multiple splice junctions and reads that currently have a higher base-calling error rate. Currently, long-reads are typically used for DNA sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the ISS using ONT for de novo assembly of the Escherichia coli genome from raw reads (Castro-Wallace et al., 2017). However, even though throughput and accuracy remain far inferior to short-reads, long-reads offer some advantages for RNA-seq as well, with less ambiguity for genes and isoforms detection, much faster mapping, potential identification of genes not yet known from reference genomes, and eventually less bias in DGE. To conclude, the RCP is specifically designed for RNA-seq data from short-read sequencers and has been developed in order to encourage and facilitate analysis of spaceflight multi-omic data. The creation of the RCP by a large community of scientists (GeneLab AWG: https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg) and the sharing of pipeline details in a peer-reviewed article provide analysis transparency and enable data reproducibility. Limitations of the study The results of this study are limited to short-read RNA-seq and are not applicable to other transcriptomic profiling methods (e.g. microarray, long-read RNA-seq). In addition, the pipeline cannot compensate for poor library preparation technique or inadequate sample size. Sample preservation protocols between datasets need to also be evaluated, because variations in sample preservation protocol could lead to poor correlation between studies that are otherwise identical (Lai Polo et al., 2020). The number of sequenced reads may also be a limiting factor in the usefulness and accuracy of the differentially expressed genes calculated by DESeq2 and, similarly, during splice isoform analysis. Note that this article does not discuss strategies and pipelines regarding older transcriptomics data in GeneLab (i.e. more than 100 microarray datasets), as it is much more challenging to provide meta-analysis with microarrays, which are prone to strong batch effects and gene lists that are platform dependent. Future efforts of GeneLab and the AWG will address microarray pipelines. In the future, we will add functionality to process unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that can identify PCR duplicates using tools such as UMI tools (Smith et al. 2017). This will allow PCR duplicates to be removed after mapping and before quantification. In addition, transcriptomic data will be integrated with proteomic and metabolomics data; this will help further understand the significance of gene expression changes to metabolic “fitness” in the spaceflight environment.

Copyright notice ID: 8044432 PMID: 33870146 Summary With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with the data available in GeneLab. Subject areas: Omics, Space SciencesGraphical abstract Open in a new tabHighlights •Analysis of omics data from different spaceflight studies presents unique challenges •A standardized pipeline for RNA-seq analysis eliminates data processing variation •The GeneLab RNA-seq pipeline includes QC, trimming, mapping, quantification, and DGE •Space-relevant data processed with this pipeline are available at genelab.nasa.gov Omics; Space SciencesIntroduction Opportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized. There is presently no consensus on how best to analyze RNA-seq data, and the impact of analysis tool selection on results is an active field of research. Indeed, selections of trimming parameters (Williams et al., 2016), read aligner (Yang et al., 2015), quantification tool (Teng et al., 2016), and differential expression detection algorithm (Costa-Silva et al. 2017) all affect results. Because of such challenges, groups such as ENCODE and MINSEQE have developed standardized analysis pipelines for better comparison of RNA-seq datasets (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020; Functional Genomics Data Society, 2012). The NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) was created as a central repository for spaceflight-related omics-data. The repository includes data from experiments that profile transcription (RNA-seq, microarray), DNA/RNA methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. The most prevalent data type in this repository is RNA-seq from organisms exposed to spaceflight conditions. As of August 2020, the NASA GeneLab database has over eighty datasets with RNA-sequencing data (Table S1). These datasets include Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Arabidopsis thaliana (model higher plant), Oryzias latipes (Japanese rice fish), Helix lucorum (land snail), Brassica rapa (Fast Plant), Eruca vesicaria (arugula/edible plant), Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid), Ceratopteris richardii (aquatic fern), and the bacterium, Bacillus subtilis from experiments performed during true spaceflight on various orbital platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), as well as spaceflight-analog studies, such as hindlimb unloading and bed rest studies (Berrios et al., 2020). NASA's GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) projects have put forward an ambitious strategy focused on integrating data, metadata, and biospecimens to fully utilize the 40+ years of archived NASA Life Sciences data (Scott et al., 2020). One of the first steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets impact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data are harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientific community and held its first Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceflight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most common types of spaceflight datasets: transcription profiling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic software tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools. The main driver for developing the consensus pipeline was to present consistently processed data to the public, therefore making space-relevant multi-omics data more accessible and reusable. The overall goals were (1) to get more consistently processed data to the public; (2) to provide output data from every step of the consensus pipeline so users can download and use these “intermediate” data; (3) to support easier and more consistent analysis of space-relevant data by users including those in the NASA AWGs; and (4) to allow easier cross-analysis of experiments to identify effects that result from the spaceflight environment, independent of confounding factors. In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent. Therefore, providing new and processed datasets to the public allows biologists and others to more easily interpret these data and contributes significantly to our collective knowledge of the effects of spaceflight on terrestrial organisms. Here we present the RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) developed by the GeneLab AWG along with the rationale behind the tool settings and options selected. The RCP includes three distinct steps: data pre-processing, data processing, and differential gene expression computation/annotation (Figure 1A). These steps use tools for quality control (FastQC, MultiQC) (Andrews, 2010; Ewels et al., 2016), read trimming (TrimGalore) (Krueger 2019), mapping (STAR) (Dobin et al., 2013), quantification (RSEM) (Li and Dewey 2011), and differential gene expression calculation/annotation (DESeq2) (Love et al. 2014) (Figure 1B). The RCP has been integrated into the GeneLab database, and files produced by the RCP for each RNA-seq dataset hosted in GeneLab are and will continue to be publicly available for download. Figure 1. Open in a new tab GeneLab RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP) (A) The three broad steps of the RCP. The RCP handles (1) data preprocessing to trim sequencing adapters and to provide quality control metrics; (2) data processing to map reads to the reference genome and quantify the number of read counts per gene; and (3) differential gene expression calculation, which will provide a list of differentially expressed genes that can be sorted by adjusted p value and log fold-change. (B) The full RCP annotated with tools, input files, and output files.Results Data pre-processing: quality control and trimming There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the first of which is data preprocessing (Figure 2A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ files from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) (Figure 2B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Data preprocessing (pipeline step 1): quality control and trimming (A) Data preprocessing pipeline. FastQ files from Illumina base-calling software are quality checked using FastQC and MultiQC. Data are then trimmed using TrimGalore and are re-checked for quality; (B) flags used for FastQC program; (C) flags used for MultiQC program; (D) flags used for TrimGalore program; trimmed reads (∗fastq.gz) are then used as input data for FastQC (B) followed by MultiQC (C) to generate trimmed read quality metrics. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The FastQC program is run on each individual sample file. However, reviewing the FastQC results for each sample file can be tedious and time consuming. Experiments typically have many sample files (biological and/or technical replicates) for multiple experimental conditions (spaceflight, ground control, etc.). For this reason, we also use the MultiQC package (Ewels et al., 2016) (Figure 2C) to create a summary statistics report that includes the same quality control result categories from FastQC across all experiment samples. After performing quality control on the raw FASTQ data, reads are trimmed using TrimGalore (Krueger 2019) to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality bases that would disrupt read mapping during the data processing pipeline step (Figure 2D). TrimGalore is a wrapper program that uses the cutadapt program (Martin 2011) for read trimming. TrimGalore was selected for the RCP due to its simplified command line interface, thorough output of trimming metrics, and ability to automatically detect adapters. In this step, bases that are part of a sequencing adapter or of low quality are removed from each read, and reads that become too short are subsequently removed. After trimming, the quality control programs, FastQC and MultiQC, are again run on the trimmed FASTQ files for viewing the quality control metrics of the reads that will be used for data processing. Once the data have been preprocessed, the sequenced reads are ready for mapping and quantification.Data processing: read mapping and sample quantification In the data processing step (Figure 1; Step 2A), the trimmed reads are first aligned to the reference genome (Figure 3A) with STAR, a splice-aware aligner (Dobin et al., 2013). STAR must be run in two steps. The first step is to create indexed genome files (Figure 3B). These files are used to assist read mapping and only need to be generated once for each reference genome file. This step requires reference FASTA and GTF files (Table S2). Some datasets include the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in control—a pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths and GC content covering a 220 concentration range (Jiang et al., 2011). If ERCC spike-ins were included, the spike-in FASTA and GTF files are appended to the reference FASTA and GTF files, respectively. The second step of STAR mapping is to use the indexed reference genome and the trimmed reads from the preprocessing step in order to map the reads to the genome and the transcriptome (Figure 3C). STAR will also produce genome mapped data, which can optionally be used to find reads that map outside of annotated reference transcripts. STAR mapping output data are in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format, which has a separate entry for each mapped read and states which transcript each read is mapped to. In order to improve the detection and quantification of splice sites, STAR is run in “two-pass mode.” Here, splice sites are detected in the initial mapping to the reference and used to build a new reference that includes these splice sites. Reads are then re-mapped to this dynamically generated reference to improve the quantification of splice isoforms (Dobin et al., 2013). Users are provided with these results (as per sample SJ.out files) for further analysis of differential splicing. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2A): read mapping (A) Data processing pipeline. Trimmed reads are mapped to their reference genome and transcriptome with STAR. Gene counts are then quantified with RSEM; (B) flags used for generating the indexed STAR reference files; (C) flags used for mapping reads with STAR. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The second part of processing is quantifying the number of reads mapped to each annotated transcript and gene (Figure 1A; Step 2B, Figure 4A). For this task, the RCP uses RSEM (Li and Dewey 2011). The main reasons for using RSEM are its ability to account for reads that map to multiple transcripts and distinguish gene isoforms. In short-read sequencing experiments it is likely that some number of reads will map to multiple regions in the genome. RSEM computes maximum likelihood abundance estimates to split the read count across multiple genes. Similar to STAR, RSEM is run in two distinct phases (Figure 4A). The first phase uses the reference genome and GTF files (with or without ERCC as appropriate) (Table S2) to prepare indexed genome files (Figure 4B). The second phase uses the indexed files and the mapped reads from STAR to assign counts to each gene (Figure 4C). There are two output files generated for each sample: counts assigned to genes and counts assigned to isoforms. Gene counts are used to calculate differential gene expression. Isoform counts are also generated as an option to look at differential isoform expression but are not used during differential gene expression calculation in the RCP. Once the RSEM count files are generated, the data are used to compute differentially expressed genes. A list of the reference genomes used in the GeneLab pipeline is available in Table S2 . These reference genomes were the most recent releases at the time each STAR and RSEM indexed references were created. Although it is possible to run STAR mapping through the RSEM toolkit, we elected not to do this because the alignment parameters used in this case are from ENCODE's STAR-RSEM pipeline and are not customizable. Thus, we would have been precluded from using the precise mapping parameters agreed to by the GeneLab AWG. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2B): gene quantification (A) Data processing pipeline. Mapping results from STAR are quantified by RSEM; (B) parameters for RSEM indexed reference files generation; (C) parameters for quantifying gene and isoform counts with RSEM. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS repository.We elected to adopt a mapping-based approach rather than rapidly quantifying the reads via a k-mer-based counting algorithm, pseudo-aligners, or a quasi-mapping method that utilizes RNA-seq inference procedures such as Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) or Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) despite their speed advantages. This is because alignment-free quantification tools do not accurately quantify low-abundant and small RNAs especially when biological variation is present (Wu et al., 2018). Furthermore, alignment of reads allows for additional analyses beyond transcript and gene quantification such as measurement of gene body coverage and detection of novel transcripts. There are several alignment-based mapping tools available and each has advantages and disadvantages. An alignment tool that is sensitive to splice-isoforms is critical to accurately identify how expression of splice-isoforms is affected by the spaceflight environment. DNA-specific aligners such as BWA (Li and Durbin 2009) and Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) cannot handle intron-sized gaps and thus an RNA-seq-specific aligner is needed (Baruzzo et al., 2017). In addition to splice-awareness, when selecting an aligner the following criteria were also considered: ability to input both single- and paired-end reads, handle strand-specific data, applicability to a variety of different model organisms with both low- and high-complexity genomic regions, efficient runtime and memory usage, ability to identify chimeric reads, high sensitivity, low rate of false discovery, and ability to output both genome and transcriptome alignments. Several studies have been conducted to compare the wide variety of available RNA-seq specific alignment tools, and of these, the STAR aligner consistently performs better than or on par with the tools tested for the indicated criteria (Baruzzo et al., 2017; Schaarschmidt et al., 2020; Raplee et al. 2019).Differential gene expression calculations and addition of gene annotations Once reads have been mapped and quantified, differential expression analysis is performed using the DESeq2 R package (Figure 1; Step 3, Figure 5A). Unlike the previous steps, a custom R script (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R or GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R) (Data S1and S2) is used to run DESeq2; to create both unnormalized and normalized counts tables; and to generate a differential gene expression (DGE) output table containing normalized counts for each sample, DGE results, and gene annotations (Figure 5B). The GeneLab DGE R script also creates computer-readable tables that are used by the GeneLab visualization portal to generate various plots so users can easily view and begin interpreting the processed data. These scripts are provided in the NASA GeneLab_Data_Processing Github repository (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). In the following sections we describe each step of these scripts in order. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differential gene expression calculation (pipeline step 3) (A) Data processing pipeline. The R program DESeq2 is run in order to determine which genes are differentially expressed between experimental conditions using gene count files from RSEM. (B) Output files generated. The table columns distinguish which script produces each output. The columns distinguish how those output files are used.The GeneLab DGE R script requires three inputs: the quantified count data from the previous (RSEM) step; sample metadata from the Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) tables in the ISA.zip file (provided in the GeneLab repository with each dataset) (Sansone et al., 2012; Rocca-Serra et al., 2010); and the organisms.csv file (Table S3), which is used to specify the organism used in the study and relevant gene annotations to load. Because samples from some GeneLab RNA-seq datasets contain ERCC spike-in and others do not, there are two versions of the GeneLab DGE R script, one for datasets with ERCC spike-in (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R, Data S1) and one for those without (GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, Data S2). Prior to running either script, paths to directories containing the input data and the output data location must be defined. Each script starts by defining the organism used in the study, which should be consistent with the name in the organisms.csv file so that it matches the abbreviations used in the PANTHER database (Mi et al. 2013; Thomas 2003) for that organism. Next, the metadata from the ISA.zip file are imported and formatted for use with the DESeq2 package. During metadata formatting, groups for comparison are defined based on experimental factors, and a sample table is created to specify the group to which each sample belongs. Next, a contrasts matrix is generated, which specifies the groups that will be compared during DGE analysis; each group is compared with every other group in a pairwise manner in both directions (i.e. spaceflight versus ground and ground versus spaceflight). This approach provides the user with the results for all possible group comparisons, allowing each user to select the most relevant comparisons for their particular scientific questions. After metadata formatting, the RSEM gene count data files from each sample are listed and re-ordered (to match the order the samples appear in the metadata), then imported with the R package, tximport (Soneson et al., 2015), and sample names are assigned. Prior to running DESeq2, a value of 1 is added to genes with lengths of zero, which is necessary to make a DESeqDataSet object. A DESeqDataSet object is then created using the formatted metadata and the count data that was imported with tximport. For datasets that contain samples with ERCC spike-in, we use the GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R script (Data S1). To reduce the possibility of skewing the data during DESeq2 normalization (McIntyre et al., 2011; Risso et al., 2011; Conesa et al., 2016; Law et al., 2016), all genes that have a sum of less than 10 counts across all samples are removed. The cutoff value of 10 is a best practice recommended by the DESeq2 tutorial on Bioconductor. These filtered data are then prepared for normalization and DGE analysis with DESeq2. Because there is no consensus for whether or not ERCC-normalization improves the accuracy of the results (Risso et al., 2014), the GeneLab project and its AWG members decided to perform the DGE analysis both with and without ERCC-normalization (for datasets with samples containing ERCC spike-in). To enable DESeq2 analysis with and without considering ERCC reads, the DESeqDataSet object is used to create a DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads. Because all samples must contain ERCC spike-in for ERCC-normalization, the DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads is used to identify and remove any samples that do not contain ERCC reads. Next, a DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads is created by removing rows containing ERCC reads. These data are then used for DESeq2 analysis. For DESeq2 analysis with ERCC-normalization (Data S2), the size factor object of the non-ERCC data is replaced with group B ERCC size factors for re-scaling in the first DESeq2 step. Group B ERCC genes contain the same concentration in both mix1 and mix 2. Therefore, only group B ERCC genes are used for generating the size factors for re-scaling duirng ERCC-normalization. For DESeq2 analysis without ERCC-normalization, the DESeq2 default algorithm is applied to the DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads. The unnormalized and DESeq2-normalized count data as well as the sample table are then outputted as CSV files. The “Unnormalized_Counts.csv,” “Normalized_Counts.csv,” and “ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv” files for each RNA-seq dataset are available in the GeneLab Data Repository; the “SampleTable.csv” file is used internally for verifying and validating the processed data prior to publication. There are two types of hypothesis tests that can be run with DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which is similar to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculation in linear regression and allows for comparison across all groups, and the Wald test, in which the estimated standard error of a log2 fold change is used to compare differences between two groups. The DGE step of the RCP performs both of these analyses. After normalization, the DESeq2 likelihood ratio test design is applied to the normalized data (both ERCC- and nonERCC-normalized data) to generate the F statistic p value, which is similar to an ANOVA p value and reveals genes that are changed in any number of combinations of all factors defined in the experiment. To prepare for building a gene/pathway annotation database, the STRINGdb (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) and PANTHER.db (Thomas 2003) libraries are loaded, and the organisms.csv file is read and used to indicate the Bioconductor AnnotationData Package needed (Huber et al., 2015; Gentleman et al., 2004). The current gene annotation database for the organism specified at the beginning of the R script is then loaded. Next, DGE tables containing normalized counts for each sample, pairwise DGE results, and current gene annotations as well as computer-readable DGE tables (that will be used for visualization) are created first with nonERCC-normalized data and then with ERCC-normalized data. For pairwise DGE analysis, first normalized count data are used to create two output tables: one that is used to create the human-readable DGE output table provided to users with processed data for each dataset and the other respective computer-readable DGE output table that contains additional columns and is used to visualize the data. Next, normalized count data are iterated through Wald Tests to generate pairwise comparisons of all groups based on the contrasts matrix that was generated during metadata formatting. The pairwise DGE analysis results are then added as columns to both DGE output tables. Then an annotation database is built by first defining the “keytype,” which indicates the primary type of annotation used (for most GeneLab datasets this is ENSEMBL). The keytype is then used to map to annotations in the organism-specific Bioconductor AnnotationData Package, and the following annotation columns are added to the annotation database: SYMBOL, GENENAME, ENSEMBL (if not the primary), REFSEQ, and ENTREZID. STRING and GOSLIM annotation columns are also added to the annotation database using the STRINGdb and PANTHER.db R packages, respectively. All of the aforementioned annotation columns are added to the annotation database to enable users to perform downstream analyses without having to map gene IDs themselves. Once the annotation database is complete, additional calculations are performed on the normalized count data before assembling the final DGE output tables. Means and standard deviations of normalized count data for each gene across all samples, and for samples within each respective group, are calculated and added as columns to the DGE output tables. A column containing the F statistic p value, calculated previously, is also added to the DGE output tables. The following columns are added only to the computer-readable DGE output table (used for visualization): a column to indicate whether each gene (or pathway) is up- or downregulated for each pairwise comparison, a column to indicate genes that are differentially expressed using a p value cutoff of ≤0.1 and another column using a p value cutoff of ≤0.05, a column indicating the log2 of the p value for each pairwise comparison and another column indicating the log2 of the adjusted p value, both of which are used to create Volcano plots. After all columns are added to the DGE tables, both the human- and computer-readable DGE tables are combined with the current annotation database to create the complete human- and computer-readable DGE tables. An example of the complete human readable DGE tables provided with processed RNAseq datasets in the GeneLab Data Repository is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Principal component analysis (PCA) is also performed on the normalized count data and used to create PCA plots for the GeneLab data visualization portal. DGE analysis of datasets without ERCC spike-in is performed exactly the same way as the nonERCC-normalized approach described above, except that no ERCC reads have to be removed from the DESeqDataSet object prior to DESeq analysis.

To showcase the value of using a consensus pipeline and publishing the processed data from each step of the pipeline, downstream analyses were performed using processed data from select samples from RNAseq datasets hosted on GeneLab. One of the advantages of providing expression data of all samples in each dataset as well as all possible pairwise DGE comparisons is to allow users the flexibility to pick and choose which samples and which comparisons they would like to focus on. Thus, when selecting samples for downstream analysis, we exercised this flexibility and searched the GeneLab Data Repository for datasets/samples that met a specific set of criteria. These criteria were as follows: (1) datasets that evaluated the same tissue (liver) from the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) and sex (female), (2) only samples derived from animals flown in space and respective ground control samples, (3) studies that used the same preservation protocol (liver samples extracted from frozen carcasses post-mission) and library preparation method (ribo-depletion), and (4) samples that contained ERCC spike-in to evaluate outputs with and without ERCC normalization. Select samples from two GeneLab datasets, GLDS-168 and GLDS-245, met these criteria, and processed data including the Normalized_Counts.csv, differential_expression.csv, ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv, and the ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files from these two datasets were used for downstream analyses. Prior to downstream analysis, the processed data files were filtered so that only samples that met the criteria listed above were included. Because GLDS-168 contains samples from both the Rodent Research 1 (RR-1) and RR-3 missions and only the RR-1 mission met our first criteria of using the C57BL/6 mouse strain, RR-3 samples were removed from the process data files. GLDS-168 processed data files were subsequently filtered to remove all samples, except spaceflight (FLT) and respective ground control (GC) samples, to meet the second criteria listed above. Lastly, because GLDS-168 contains a set of FLT and GC samples that were spiked with ERCC and another set in which ERCC was not added, the later set of samples were removed to meet the fourth criteria. GLDS-245 contains liver samples from the RR-6 mission, which included a set of animals that were returned to earth alive after ∼30 days of spaceflight and another set of animals that remained in space (aboard the ISS) for a total of ∼60 days before being sacrificed aboard the ISS (note that there were respective control samples for each set of spaceflight animals described). The former set of animals had their livers dissected immediately after euthanasia, whereas livers from the latter set of animals were frozen in situ and dissected from frozen carcasses after return to earth. Thus, only the later (ISS-terminal) set of FLT and respective GC samples met criteria 2 and 3, so the GLDS-245 processed data files were filtered to remove all other samples. In addition, because the downstream analyses focused on the differences between FLT and GC samples in these two datasets, all other comparisons were removed from the differential_expression.csv and ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files prior to analysis. The filtered processed data files (available in Mendeley Data, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/fv3kd6h7k4.1) were then used to create Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots (Figures 6A, 6B, S1A, and S1B), heatmaps containing the top 30 most significant FLT versus GC differentially expressed (and annotated) genes (adj. p value <0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) (Figures 6C, 6D, S1C, and S1D), and to evaluate FLT versus GC gene ontology (GO) differences using Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA) analysis (Tables 3 and S5). These results can then be further evaluated to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between these two studies and draw novel conclusions about the effects of spaceflight that are consistent across spaceflight experiments.

For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and/or metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab working group members include WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), PIANO (Väremo et al. 2013), Reactome (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), and ToppFun (Chen et al., 2009). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives. The RCP has been designed to handle sequencing experiments that either lack or include the ERCC RNA spike-in mix—a set of 96 polyadenylated RNAs that can be used during differential gene expression calculation to normalize read counts across samples (Munro et al., 2014). However, the use of normalization according to ERCC spike-ins remains controversial among AWG members, and Munro et al. suggested its usage only for determining limit of detection of ratio (LODR), expression ratio variability, and measurement bias (Munro et al., 2014). For this reason, ERCC normalization remains optional in the GeneLab pipeline, and both kinds of DGE outputs are provided in the GeneLab database. In addition, ERCC spike-in could have two other usages. First, it allows us to evaluate whether normalization succeeded in removing systemic bias between libraries by using methods such as Rlog and VST when normalizing the spike-in RNAs along with all other genes. Second, most normalization methods of RNA-seq data assume that most genes are not differentially expressed toward one direction. Comparing spike-in measurements between libraries will help us to estimate the validity of this assumption. A high number of biological replicates can increase certainty in the differentially expressed genes determined by the RCP. However, conducting experiments in spaceflight often limits the number of biological replicates that a researcher can include. Therefore, it is important to note that at least three biological replicates are required for the pipeline, specifically for DESeq2, to perform its statistical methods. However, at least six replicates are suggested in order to minimize the false discovery rate (FDR) (Schurch et al., 2016). Finally, RNA-seq datasets hosted on GeneLab that do not contain biological replicates are only processed up until unnormalized (raw) counts are obtained, the step right before DESeq2 is used for DGE calculation. More advanced RCP users might have additional data inquiries that fall beyond the scope of this pipeline. For this reason, there are two parts of the pipeline that include additional output that are not used in our differential gene expression computation. The first is in the output from STAR, mapping output is also provided in genomic coordinates. This is useful for obtaining reads that are mapped outside of the reference transcriptome. For example, this may be used to find novel genes, transcripts, or exons that have not yet been annotated by consortiums. The second part of the pipeline with alternative output files is RSEM. This also provides transcript-level counts that can be used to investigate differential isoform expression. Moreover, intermediate files are provided as outputs to allow users to use components of the pipeline that they find useful. The GeneLab database also includes other types of transcriptomic data. As discussed in this article, the RCP is not used for microarray data that are fundamentally different, and the AWG is still debating the best approach for cross-dataset comparisons between microarrays. GeneLab also accepts data from long read experiments, such as those produced by Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Roberts et al. 2013) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing (Jain et al., 2016). Long-read data would be processed with similar steps to the RCP but will require tools specifically designed for the intricacies of long-read data, such as reads that contain multiple splice junctions and reads that currently have a higher base-calling error rate. Currently, long-reads are typically used for DNA sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the ISS using ONT for de novo assembly of the Escherichia coli genome from raw reads (Castro-Wallace et al., 2017). However, even though throughput and accuracy remain far inferior to short-reads, long-reads offer some advantages for RNA-seq as well, with less ambiguity for genes and isoforms detection, much faster mapping, potential identification of genes not yet known from reference genomes, and eventually less bias in DGE. To conclude, the RCP is specifically designed for RNA-seq data from short-read sequencers and has been developed in order to encourage and facilitate analysis of spaceflight multi-omic data. The creation of the RCP by a large community of scientists (GeneLab AWG: https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg) and the sharing of pipeline details in a peer-reviewed article provide analysis transparency and enable data reproducibility. Limitations of the study The results of this study are limited to short-read RNA-seq and are not applicable to other transcriptomic profiling methods (e.g. microarray, long-read RNA-seq). In addition, the pipeline cannot compensate for poor library preparation technique or inadequate sample size. Sample preservation protocols between datasets need to also be evaluated, because variations in sample preservation protocol could lead to poor correlation between studies that are otherwise identical (Lai Polo et al., 2020). The number of sequenced reads may also be a limiting factor in the usefulness and accuracy of the differentially expressed genes calculated by DESeq2 and, similarly, during splice isoform analysis. Note that this article does not discuss strategies and pipelines regarding older transcriptomics data in GeneLab (i.e. more than 100 microarray datasets), as it is much more challenging to provide meta-analysis with microarrays, which are prone to strong batch effects and gene lists that are platform dependent. Future efforts of GeneLab and the AWG will address microarray pipelines. In the future, we will add functionality to process unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that can identify PCR duplicates using tools such as UMI tools (Smith et al. 2017). This will allow PCR duplicates to be removed after mapping and before quantification. In addition, transcriptomic data will be integrated with proteomic and metabolomics data; this will help further understand the significance of gene expression changes to metabolic “fitness” in the spaceflight environment.Resource availability Lead contact Jonathan M.

We discuss our design for GEODE, particularly how it promotes investigators providing more accurate metadata, reducing the curation effort required of GeneLab staff.

We review the outreach efforts by GeneLab to utilize the spaceflight data in the repository to generate novel discoveries and develop new hypotheses, including spearheading data analysis working groups, and a high school student training program. All these efforts are aimed ultimately at supporting precision risk management for human space exploration.INTRODUCTION Scientists are leveraging space-based platforms such as the International Space Station (ISS) and earth-based laboratories such as the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory to study the effects of space on biological organisms, generating nucleic acid, protein, and metabolite profiling data at an unprecedented rate. The 2011 National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey presaged this ‘wave of change’ almost a decade ago, and called for the development of more powerful informatics technologies to meet the growing needs of these researchers (1). The Survey also promulgated the use of a systems biology approach by space biosciences investigators, which led to the formation of the GeneLab project (https://genelab.nasa.gov/), a science initiative at NASA to maximize omics data collected from spaceflight and ground simulation experiments, and including the creation in 2014 of the NASA GeneLab data repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/ ) (1). The mission of GeneLab is to maximize the utilization of valuable biospecimens flown in space or exposed to simulated space stressors through the collection and curation of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic (so-called ‘omics’) data, in order to enable the exploration of molecular network responses to space environments using a systems biology approach. Our designs for the data repository continue to be guided by the FAIR principles (2,3). To foster open science in space biology research and to stimulate research opportunities based on an integrated multi-omics analysis approach, investigators who generate omics data are encouraged to contact GeneLab for the latest information concerning data submission requirements and procedures. All GeneLab repository data are open-access. We review here the various components (Figure 1) of the database, then describe its new data repository web interface and the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE) web portal, which provides ‘self-service’ data curation, and will support the expansion of the database in the future to include companion non-omics assay data. We discuss our design strategies for GEODE, emphasizing how they promote investigators providing more accurate metadata using controlled vocabularies, reducing the curation effort required of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here a new GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) specifically designed to support tools for the visualization of processed omics data. Such visualization tools are essential to fulfil an ‘Open Science’ mandate, democratizing the access to data and allowing the scientific community at large to gain new knowledge on how spaceflight affects life, from humans and mice, to plants and microbes. Figure 1. Open in a new tab The GeneLab database and its connections to intramural and extramural systems. The database API is leveraged extensively by components of the GeneLab Data Systems: the database web browser interface (A), the GeneLab Online Data Entry tool (B), a workspace tool for private data sharing (C), and the GeneLab data visualization server (D). The database API is also being used to power various extramural data analytics and visualization tools (E, F). The GeneLab Public Analytics platform (G) and Data Processing systems (H) access the repository data files directly.GENELAB DATABASE HOLDINGS As of August 2020, GeneLab houses data from 271 studies representing investigations of many kinds of spaceflight experimental factors: gravity level (microgravity, hypergravity), ionizing radiation, circadian disruption, and atmospheric pressure, together with information on confounding variables such as organism diet, age, and sample preservation methods, for a variety of biological organisms (Figure 2). Approximately half the studies in the GeneLab repository are from experiments conducted in space, and the other half from ground-based (space analogue) environments (4). Mammalian (primarily rodent and human cell line) investigations account for a majority the studies. Other organisms studied include various flowering plants, (e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana), microbes, nematodes (primarily Caenorhabditis elegans), insects (Drosophila melanogaster), and bony fish. Although, the most prevalent study assay type is transcription profiling, the database also includes studies of protein expression, whole genome sequencing, metabolite profiling, metagenomics, epigenomics and epitranscriptomics. Investigators continue to submit data from new kinds of assays at an ever-increasing rate, particularly new kinds of RNA sequencing assays, such as spatial transcription profiling (5) data (6). Accommodating these new kinds of assays have not required GeneLab data systems software development, only minor changes to systems configuration files. Figure 2. Open in a new tab GeneLab database content by study experiment environment (A), study assay type by year of data publication (B), and organism studied by year of data publication (C).DATA PROCESSING STANDARDIZATION Since its inception GeneLab has focused on adopting best practices regarding the use of community-derived standards for metadata and data processing. For submitted metadata, GeneLab curators encourage the use of domain ontologies, and meticulously, manually harmonize submitted metadata with those of existing studies (1). To support consistent interpretation of submitted data, GeneLab curators augment submitted metadata for spaceflight studies with spacecraft environmental metadata. For example, for experiments conducted on board the U.S. Space Transportation System (the ‘Space Shuttle’), on the ISS, and on board various other spacecraft, GeneLab has gathered, summarized, and attached radiation exposure metadata to the other experiment metadata submitted by investigators (4). Ambient CO2, temperature, and humidity data are also gathered, summarized, and associated with each sample for metadata submitted for ISS experiments. GeneLab has also begun to process submitted transcriptomic data using consensus pipelines developed by representatives of the space biology community (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). This yields gene expression analysis data that are then made available in the database together with the raw data, and all intermediate data processing files. At the time of this writing, 103 GeneLab transcription profiling studies in the database have processed data available.KEY DATABASE FEATURES When originally designed, the GeneLab data systems sought merely to replicate features of existing, publicly-available life sciences data repositories that have long been recognized as valuable to end-users. These included the use of persistent, immutable accession numbers for submitted data, completely open access, and an API to allow for data file and metadata retrieval. Since this original design several years ago, GeneLab has sought to improve on this set of features, and implement new ones in line with advancing end-user needs and new, community-derived design principles for data repositories. User interface The initial user interface for the data repository organized study metadata using a series of tabs, one each for administrative, protocol, sample, and assay metadata. However, this layout makes it difficult for users to see more than one active tab's content at the same time. We have since revised the layout to use navigable, movable, and collapsible sections for each kind of metadata (Figure 3) so that users can create custom displays to organize and view the exact kind of metadata they want. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Redesigned ‘individual study page’ of the GeneLab data repository. Users can click on the section links (A) to navigate to each panel of metadata, open/close (collapse) each panel of metadata using the arrow on the panel header (B), and/or drag panels to re-order metadata displays (C). For each study dataset, a DOI is generated (D), and every submitted version of the dataset can be displayed using a drop-down menu (E).Increased FAIRness Digital object identifiers From its inception, GeneLab has sought to implement community-derived (i.e. open) standards for the data and metadata it curates, and for the operation of the database (end-user interactions, curation by GeneLab, etc.). Largely concurrent with the design of the GeneLab Data Repository, the global scientific community converged on a set of optimal design features for data repositories, now termed the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles. In the area of Findability, the data repository now provides Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for all submitted datasets. DOIs have guaranteed persistence, and resolution control mechanisms that are centralized (independent of the data source), and provide users of the GeneLab datasets with a way to cite them easily and uniformly. In addition, each version of a dataset (distinguished by changes in data files or in metadata) is tracked in the data repository, and users can opt to see previous versions through the web interface (Figure 3). This ensures persistence of the specific version of data as cited by others. Finally, NASA is currently developing processes for the automated submission to other databases of data submitted first to GeneLab, with the twin goals of making the data more findable from extramural database systems, and reducing the burden to data providers of generating multiple data submissions.Accessibility All data in the GeneLab data repository continues to be accessible to all users without user authentications. To provide the greatest accessibility to its data analysis tools and collaborative workspace, the GeneLab analysis and collaboration platforms have integrated the widely-available Google credentialing system into its authentication systems. Users can opt to use their Google-managed credentials or, if they have them, use their NASA credentials to access these subsystems. It is our intention that this development leads to increased access to and usage of these tools for more investigators.Linked data One the biggest areas where many data repositories fall short using FAIR-based metrics is interoperability (2), which often presents a barrier to data reusability. In order to support systems interoperation and increase data reuse, the GeneLab repository data uses the widely known ISA experiment model (7) for tagging data files with metadata. The ISA model leverages community-developed concept vocabularies (ontologies), so that there is agreement among users on metadata meaning, and therefore data characterization. Furthermore these models support linkage of data values (‘linked data’) so that, for example, biological samples, personnel or resources reused across experiments need only be described once by the first experiment to refer to them. Subsequent investigations that also use these objects then can quickly search for and refer to them in their investigation descriptions. In the specific domain of space biology, it is common to re-use samples across different investigations, given the high cost of generating biological sample data in space environments. In many other application areas, it is common to re-use parts of experimental protocols, and these too can be similar referred to by data submitters using the ISA model, rather than duplicated semantically in the data repository.Web-browser data submissions The most recent addition to the GeneLab Data Systems is GEODE, the GeneLab Environment for Online Data Entry. This interface supports the creation of complex metadata descriptions of datasets, and was built in collaboration with, and by extending an interface originally developed by, the Metabolights (8) database at EBI. This web browser interface (Figure 4) allows users to develop ISA-tab sets of metadata through either a guided submission ‘wizard’, in which users create metadata step-by-step, or ‘Study Overview’ method, in which metadata can be arbitrarily edited. Data submitters and GeneLab curation staff can both create metadata using GEODE; submitters are limited to editing only their own submitted metadata, while GeneLab curation staff can access and edit all metadata. The web interface provides the capability for submitters (or curators) to look up metadata concepts in online ontologies dynamically, which reduces metadata normalization effort of the curation staff. Furthermore, GEODE provides continuously available data set editing for submitters (or curators), so that they can rapidly and efficiently update and correct their data; any data set owner (or curator) can change the status of their published data sets to ‘In Review’, make changes to the data/metadata, and re-submit it for release at any time. Figure 4. Open in a new tab The GEODE web browser interface used by both data submitters and GeneLab data curation staff. Below the data set ‘Status’ and desired release date fields (A) are the user-entered title, contact(s) and brief study description fields (B), the user-selected chosen taxon(s) studied (C), relevant publication objects (D) and subsections for users to specify further details of the study's description, protocols, samples, assays and study files (E), all validated against the ISA model.Enhanced API GeneLab has always provided an Application Programming Interface (API) for the retrieval of individual experiment data and metadata files. Improvements in this API now enables users to query the database for samples, potentially across multiple datasets and assays, by combinations of values of metadata fields, and then to retrieve sample-associated experiment data. Both the data and the accompanying annotations are returned in a tabular format suitable for downstream processing in a variety of languages and environments commonly used by data scientists. This, in turn, empowers researchers to conduct multi-dataset and multi-omics analyses, such as investigating the impact of single experiment factors on a variety of organisms during space flight. For example, the API can be leveraged to interrogate the entirety of the GeneLab database for RNA-Seq assay gene expression counts from all samples from Mus musculus that experienced a specified level of ionizing radiation; such a request returns gene counts from multiple datasets as well as all other metadata values associated with the samples (status of space flight, radiation dose, diet, age, etc.), immediately providing the end-user with data and annotations suitable to build a complex model that accounts for all main and confounding factors known to the database. The API also supports queries for multiple assay types, for example, all transcriptomic and epigenomic assays, facilitating multi-omics data analyses. This enhanced API layer is currently being leveraged within GeneLab to provide advanced data visualizations of GeneLab processed data (9). These include a data table browser for sample data and annotations, and common statistical data visualizations such as principal component analysis, in a web-browser interface. Finally, we should note that, as the data API leverages the versatile ISA-Tab format to bring annotations to data files, this API could be easily extended to numerous types of assay data, not just omics.COMMUNITY Scientific outreach A key goal of the GeneLab project is to bring together a community of scientists to generate novel hypotheses and make valuable scientific discoveries using the data in the GeneLab database. GeneLab has sought to engage working groups of students, bioinformaticians, space biologists, researchers and citizen scientists by providing freely-available data analysis tools and support for their use. Users can access user guides and tutorial videos on how to use the various GeneLab applications, including how to analyze RNA-seq datasets using the GeneLab Analysis Platform (https://genelab.nasa.gov/help/tutorials). Furthermore, NASA has developed the GeneLab 4 High School (GL4HS) training program, in which fifteen high school students learn how to use the GeneLab tools over four weeks to analyze spaceflight microarray and RNA-seq data, how to generate follow-on hypotheses based on these analyses, how to design a ground-based experiment to test these hypotheses, and ultimately write research proposals for the experiments (https://www.nasa.gov/ames/genelab-for-high-schools). GeneLab is also launching an Education Working Group, a group of educators and scientists, who will develop educational content that promotes the use of the GeneLab database, and its visualization and analytical tools.Analysis working groups In 2018 GeneLab formed four Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) comprised of over 100 scientists and students from multiple space agencies, academia, and industry, for the purpose of optimizing and standardizing the processing of raw omics data from the GeneLab repository. The AWGs work in four major areas: animal, plant, microbial, and multi-omics data processing. The consensus data processing pipelines developed in each group are then used by GeneLab to process the data in the repository (see Data Processing Standardization above). The AWGs have begun to utilize the processed data to publish insights in important areas of space biology (10–14).Data re-use The number of GeneLab studies continue to grow rapidly, providing more opportunities for meta-analysis. Currently there are 18 publications of this type linked to repository datasets that together leveraged 78 repository datasets (see https://genelab.nasa.gov/publications/derived). In addition, an increasing number of extramural visualization tools are consuming the processed data in the repository through its API. For example, the Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) tool has a graphical user interface through which users can quickly compare the data from plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or explore gene networks of interest (15). Likewise, Project MANGO (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/super-studies/3) users can generate and visualize taxonomic analyses of GeneLab processed data to explore the microbiome of the ISS.FUTURE DIRECTIONS Astronaut data In 2011 the National Research Council of the U.S. recognized the importance of collecting astronaut data, in addition to model organism data in the Decadal Survey (16): ‘because of the limited number of humans who undergo exposure to the space environment, maintaining an extensive and well-organized database and managing it as a resource to be shared with the scientific community has long been viewed as an essential step for scientific discovery’. However, anonymizing astronaut data presents a unique challenge as the cohort is indeed extremely small, and very few metadata (e.g. just gender and flight dates) may be used to identify individuals. Nevertheless, to achieve greater reuse of these data, they too should be made part of an Open Science framework using FAIR principles. They should be stored in non-proprietary formats based on open (community-derived) standards, with open access and with linkages to other data that provide important context (17). This goal was nicely summarized by Higman et al. (17), ‘data should be as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. More effort should be put into identifying what types of data can remain open, even if one can identify the individuals to which they belong. For example, gene expression levels do not present any sensitive information in the context of the response to stresses like microgravity and radiation. Such information should therefore be made available through open science frameworks as soon as these data are released for publication by investigators. Any information revealing sensitive and personal information, such as that which can be derived from DNA or RNA sequences, would remain access-controlled.Enabling precision space risk management Although valuable knowledge has been gained from experiments conducted in space or from space simulations on the ground, little progress has been made in terms of modelling the impact of spaceflight on humans. Most risk models have been focusing on space radiation and cancer (18–20). The strong epidemiological data on cancer risk from ionizing radiation (21) and the existence of accelerators dedicated to simulating space radiation have been the main thrust behind these risk models. Ionizing radiation is an easy-to-use experimental factor, with good quantitative input and output, enabling mathematical models. Briefly, scientists control precisely the dose, the dose rate and the type of radiation delivered and they can measure precisely short-term endpoints such as DNA double strand breaks (22,23). Interestingly, such responses have been shown to be modulated by the genetic background of an individual (24–26), eventually leading to DNA mutations and cancer (27–29). Because modelling requires quantitative data, omics data are very well suited to informing risk models and to tackling more challenging stressors such as microgravity. The growing amount of omics data generated by NASA principal investigators and the recent guidelines from NASA emphasizing the importance of submitting all omics data to GeneLab are therefore exciting developments for modellers. Indeed, the software architecture designed by GeneLab and its strategies around data and metadata harmonization will enable the development of the next generation of space risk models. By classifying experimental factors into digital objects and by transforming raw data into comparable quantitative endpoints using a workflow approved by the community, GeneLab lets users see how space factors affect a large array of biological processes (13,30–32). By establishing mathematical laws describing the relationship between factors’ values and biological endpoints, one can start building more elaborate computer models. By integrating information from other NASA databases with more qualitative data (e.g. immunocytochemistry, behavioural data) using the same metadata schema and harmonization strategies, GeneLab can continue to evolve as a knowledge-based system, fully leveraging advances in machine learning, providing insights on enabling human life in space, and enabling individualized space risk models for precision space medicine. GeneLab plans to utilize machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to maximize the usage of its data, especially in the context of modelling and extrapolation to human risks. Such effort may start by providing a portal proposing mechanistic models describing known health risks (cancer, muscle atrophy, bone loss, etc.). Such a tool would allow users to test how well GeneLab omics data and data from other databases support these models and test alternative models. Such approach will involve collaborating with the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA), which archives biospecimens and non-omics data from mammalian and microbial NASA experiments.DATA AVAILABILITY NASA GeneLab is an open-access data repository (https://genelab.nasa.gov).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank all members of the GeneLab team and the data systems team in particular: Ms Jamie Bales, Mr Peter O’Donnell, Ms Sonja Caldwell and Mr Matias Fernandez, for developing the database and web applications.Contributor Information Daniel C Berrios, USRA/NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA.

    "abstract": "Summary Spaceflight is known to impose changes on human physiology with unknown molecular etiologies. To reveal these causes, we used a multi-omics, systems biology analytical approach using biomedical profiles from fifty-nine astronauts and data from NASA’s GeneLab derived from hundreds of samples flown in space, to determine transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic responses to spaceflight. Overall pathway analyses on the multi-omic datasets showed significant enrichment for mitochondrial processes, as well as innate immunity, chronic inflammation, cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory functions. Importantly, NASA’s Twin Study provided a platform to confirm several of our principal findings. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data compiled from the astronaut cohort and NASA Twin Study data, indicating mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight.

    "introduction": "Introduction Humanity is on the brink of a new era in space exploration, with NASA and international partners committed to returning to the Moon and planned manned missions to Mars (Dawson, 2016). Exposure to space radiation and microgravity are primary hazards to astronauts’ health in long-duration space missions (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). In addition to the known increased cancer risk from chronic low doses of radiation exposure (Durante and Cucinotta, 2008), astronauts that returned from missions on the International Space Station (ISS) presented with health issues similar to geriatric stress, including bone and muscle mass loss, central nervous system issues, immune dysfunction, and cardiovascular health risks (Strollo et al., 2018). Future success in long-duration space exploration requires a comprehensive understanding of the impact of spaceflight on human biology, and such knowledge could be used to design efficient countermeasures that would benefit astronauts and the health of people on Earth. Here, we provide an integrated analysis of mammalian space biology using a systems biology approach powered by multiple “omic” platforms. Realized by the existence of NASA’s GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov/) (Ray et al., 2019), a dedicated space omics database, our work includes 4 human cell models, 13 different tissues (11 mouse and 2 human), 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/C), and space missions ranging from 2006 to 2017, culminating in the measurement of astronaut blood and urine metabolites, as well as transcriptional data from the NASA Twin Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Gertz et al., 2020). Our data-driven approach resulted in three discoveries. First, spaceflight effects were more evident in isolated cells than whole organs, suggesting that tissue complexity plays an essential role in response to space-related stress. Second, the liver undergoes more differential gene and protein expression changes than other organs, consistent with the role the liver plays as a dynamic and critical hub in sensing changes in blood composition and maintaining homeostasis. Finally, our comprehensive pathway analyses identified how spaceflight impacts mitochondrial function at the genetic, protein, and metabolite levels of cellular, tissue, and organismal biology.",

Since these experiments were previously done by others and data is publicly available on GeneLab, all experimental details for these mouse models can be found on GeneLab in the description section for each dataset. Rodent Research-9 (RR-9) mission tissues were utilized for metabolomic analysis of the medial head of the gastrocnemius, and the quadriceps femoris (“quadriceps”) on male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) that spent ~34 days in microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the RR-9 mission in August, 2017, that launched as part of the SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services (CRS)-12 mission. Seven days prior to launch (L-7d), 9-week old mice were grouped as mice to be sent to ISS (Flight; n=10); or ground-based habitat controls placed within in environmental chambers replicating the environmental conditions for the Flight mice aboard ISS (Habitat; n=10). Unberthing from ISS and splashdown of live mice occurred on L+34d, and the live mice were collected by the science teams on L +35d for behavioral and functional testing, as well as tissue harvest. The gastrocnemius and quadriceps remained attached to the left hind limb after removal of the limb from the body by disarticulation at the acetabulum. The femur and tibia were disarticulated, the gastrocnemius was cut at the Achilles tendon, and both muscles remained attached to the femur which was then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80°C until tissues were removed for metabolomic analysis. All animal procedures performed in these experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and the methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. For both RR-1 and RR-3 missions, as stated above we utilized publicly available data available on GeneLab. The authors of this manuscript did not conduct the actual rodent research. Regardless, we have provided the specific details for both of the original experiments for the readers convenience. The following is a description of the for the RR-1 mission, as described on NASA Life Sciences and data archive (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/document/doc_detail/Doc13600): “Twenty adult female mice were launched Sept 21, 2014 in RR hardware within a Dragon Capsule (SpaceX-4) as the flight group (FLT), then after 4 days in transit, were transferred for habitation on the ISS for a total time in space of 37–38 days (10 validation mice), when animals were euthanized and select tissues recovered on orbit. Three control groups at Kennedy Space Center consisted of: 1) Basal mice from the same cohorts as FLT mice euthanized at the time of launch, 2) Vivarium (VIV) controls housed in standard vivarium cages, and 3) Ground Controls (GC) housed in RR flight hardware within an environment chamber that controlled temperature, CO2 and humidity to ISS levels. The health and behavior of all mice on the ISS were monitored by video feed on a daily basis. Mice were euthanized by injection of Euthasol, then either fast frozen intact or dissected to preserve livers (fast frozen) and spleens (RNAlater™). Samples were stored at = −80°C until their return to Earth for later analyses.” The following is a description of the for the RR-3 mission, as described on NASA Life Sciences and data archive (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/13961): “The RR3 payload consisted of twenty female BALB/c mice that were approximately twelve weeks old. The mice were carried to ISS in a transporter aboard SpaceX Commercial Resupply Mission 8 Dragon cargo spacecraft (SpaceX-8, CRS-8). Dragon docked with the station on April 10, 2016 and by April 12 the animals were transferred aboard the station. Once onboard, they were divided into two groups of ten and housed in habitats for six weeks. Approximately one hour of video per day showing animal health and behavior was recorded in each habitat during the mission. Dissections were conducted over four days at thirty-nine to forty-two days in microgravity. Each dissection day consisted of five animals being dissected. Following euthanasia, blood was extracted via cardiac puncture, separated by centrifugation, and frozen. Right hind limbs were dissected and fixed in four percent paraformaldehyde, and carcasses were frozen. The frozen tissue samples were stored in the minus eighty degree freezer (MELFI). Hardware and tissue samples were returned to Earth for recovery and post-flight analyses. Biospecimens were delivered to CASIS.” Ground controls were conducted on a three-day delay at Kennedy Space Center in ISS environmental simulators (ISSESs) programmed with data from the Dragon capsule and the ISS cabin. Based on post-flight analysis of the RR-2 Habitat telemetry data, the ISSESs were programmed to be two degrees Celsius higher than the ISS cabin data; the result of this off-set was that the internal temperatures of the ground control habitats matched the flight Habitats closely for most of the experiment.” In Vitro Models All data related to the in vitro experiments were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab platform (https://genelab.nasa.gov/) from the following dataset identifiers: GLDS-13, GLDS-52, GLDS-54, GLDS-114, GLDS-118, and GLDS-174. All detailed information on the cell lines are available on the description for each dataset. Here also will provide a brief description of the cell lines and experiments contained in each dataset. The GLDS-174 data set includes a total of 60 samples from 10 individual astronauts. Six hair follicle samples were collected at six timepoints with two pre-spaceflight, two in-spaceflight and two post-spaceflight. The GLDS-52 data set includes a total of six samples from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Samples were collected in triplicate for flight or ground treatments. The GLDS-114 data set includes a total of 15 samples from human fibroblasts. The GLDS-118 data set includes a total of 6 samples from human fibroblasts. The GLDS-13 data set includes a total of 6 samples from human T cells. The GLDS-54 data set includes a total of 12 samples from human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). Samples were collected in duplicate at three timepoints (0, 4, and 8 hours) during ground or spaceflight with or without treatment with LPS.Human data Data are reported from three human subject experiments conducted on the International Space Station: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006–2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Spaceflight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013–2018). All protocols were reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent. While subsets of some of these data have been published in other papers (Crucian et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2015), as a whole, the data provided here have not been previously published. Crews from these experiments had missions of 4–6 months in duration, and these studies included blood and urine collections before, during, and after flight, with analysis of an array of nutritional and biochemical markers. Blood and urine samples were collected 2 or 3 times before flight: approximately Launch minus (L-) 180 days and L-45 days. In some cases, a third blood sample was collected (typically along with the L-45 collection), and these tubes were centrifuged and frozen for aliquoting after flight batched with the samples collected inflight. Blood samples were collected inflight, at approximately Flight Day (FD) 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180. Postflight samples were collected in the first 24-h after landing (designated return+0, R+0) and again 30-d later (R+30). The R+0 samples were not necessarily fasting, given the time of day and nature of return from flight. Of the 59 crewmembers reported herein: 8 returned on the Space Shuttle, with blood collection 2–4 hours after landing; 51 landed in Kazakhstan, with 7 of them returning to Star City, Russia, with blood collection 8–10 hours after landing; 44 were transported directly back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, with blood collection approximately 24-h after landing. Pre and postflight collections included two 24-h urine collections, and inflight collections included one 24-h urine collection. These collection techniques have been previously described (Smith et al., 2012a; Zwart et al., 2011). We report here vitamins and metabolites, oxidative stress and damage markers, inflammatory markers and cytokines, liver enzymes and endocrine indices. These were analyzed using standard techniques as reported previously (Crucian et al., 2014; Zwart et al., 2016; Zwart et al., 2013; Zwart et al., 2009). As of this writing, data were available for 59 crewmembers (47 male, 12 female). Age at launch was 47.0 ± 5.6 y, body mass at launch was 79.2 ± 11.8 kg (M: 83.3 ± 9.3; F: 63.0 ± 4.5). Body mass index was 25.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2 (M: 26.4 ± 2.6; F: 22.3 ± 1.5). All available data are reported here, although the reported n for any given test or session varies for a number of reasons, including: not all experiments had all analytes included, mission length differences for some crewmembers, schedule or other issues occasionally precluded sample collection, and methods changes over time. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p<0.001 are reported. METHOD DETAILS RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, and Proteomics For all RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, and proteomics datasets being utilized for this manuscript the data was gathered from the GeneLab platform. All information and details for sample preparation, library construction, and sequencing is available in the descriptions for that particular GeneLab dataset and the GLDS identifier is available in the Key Resource Table.RNA-sequence on Twin Study Samples Longitudinal samples were collected from a male astronaut aboard the International Space Station and his identical twin on Earth during a 340 day mission including 6 months preflight and 6 months postflight follow-up, for total of 19 timepoints for the flight subject and 13 timepoints for the ground subject. Blood was collected using CPT vacutainers (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. For full details of sample separation, processing see (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Briefly, samples collected on ISS were either frozen in −80°C after separation of mononuclear cells by centrifugation (referred to as CPT), or returned to Earth in 4°C in a Soyuz capsule and sorted into CD4, CD8, CD19 populations and a lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction. Samples collected on Earth were either frozen for mononuclear cells or processed when fresh for sorted cell populations. To correct for the effects of ambient temperature exposure on RNA (approximately 36 hours including landing and repatriation) control samples were created by simulating similar conditions to those that may occur during the ambient return and were compared to fresh blood collections from the same individual. RNA extraction, library prep and sequencing were completed per (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) using both ribodepletion or polyA selection kits.Metabolomic profiling All reagents were of LC-MS grade. Approximately 10 mg of tissue from RR9 (gastrocnemius and quadricep, habitat and flight) were added in a siliconized microcentrifuge tube, followed by addition of 300 μl of chilled 50%:50% methanol:water, containing 4 μM debrisoquine sulfate, 30 μM 4-nitrobenzoic acid, and 5 μM chlorpropamide as internal standards. All samples were randomized. The tissues were homogenized, followed by sonication for 10 sec. 10 μl was removed for protein quantification through a micro BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm at 4°C and the supernatant was transferred to a clean siliconized microcentrifuge tube. Chilled 50%:50% acetonitrile:water (300 μl) was added to the pellet and vortexed thoroughly. Following a 15 min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged again and the supernatant combined with the one previously obtained. The samples were vacuum dried and resuspended in 200 μl of 50%:50% methanol:water, without internal standards, and vortexed thoroughly. Samples were further filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and subsequently transferred to a glass mass spectrometry vial. 2 μl of each sample was injected in a BEH C18 column, 130 Å, 1.7 μm at 60°C and analyzed with a Waters Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system coupled to a time-of-flight Xevo G2S mass spectrometry (MS) instrument, operated in MSE mode. The chromatographic and MS conditions are presented in Table S4. A quality control sample was also generated by pooling together 5 μl from each sample, injected every 10 samples. Initial mass accuracy was determined with a metmix mixture of 6 chemicals that ionize in both modes (acetaminophen, sulfaguanidine, sulfadimethoxine, Val-Tyr-Val, terfenadine, and leucine enkephalin). Mass correction and accuracy was achieved throughout the whole run with intermittent injections of leucine enkephalin as LockSpray™. Positive identification of candidate metabolites was performed through tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with ramping collision energy 10–40 eV with pure chemicals and cross-validation of MS/MS spectra through METLIN or HMDB (spectra shown in Figs. S4–S6). All raw data is available on NASA’s GeneLab platform with identifier: GLDS-343 and DOI: 10.26030/h968-2m75.Real-time PCR (rtPCR) on NASA Twin study samples A summary of the samples used for the rtPCR analysis is found in Table S5. The whole-blood cell fractions (CPT) was used for isolating RNA and rtPCR. 100ng RNA per sample was reverse transcribed using the iScript Advanced cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The synthesized cDNA was diluted 1:4 in water and quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate with the Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Thermo-Fisher) using the QuantStudio 6 Flex RT-PCR system. The sequences of primers used for RT-qPCR were: MT-RNR1: F - ATGCAGCTCAAAACGCTTAGC; R - GCTGGCACGAAATTGACCAA MT-RNR2: F - CCCTGTACGAAAGGACAAGAGAAAT; R - TCTTGGGTGGGTGTGGGTATAAT MT-CO1: F - CAGCAGTCCTACTTCTCCTATCTCT; R - GGGTCGAAGAAGGTGGTGTT MT-CO2: F - GCCCTTTTCCTAACACTCACAACAA; R - GTAAAGGATGCGTAGGGATGGG MT-ND1: F - CCCTAAAACCCGCCACATCT; R - GGCTAGAATAAATAGGAGGCCTAGGT 18S rRNA: F - GGCCCTGTAATTGGAATGAGTC; R - CCAAGATCCAACTACGAGCTT GAPDH: F - AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAAC; R - GGGGTCATTGATGGCAACAATA. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS In vitro microarray data analysis Background correction and quantile normalization, differential gene expression was performed using LIMMA (Ritchie et al., 2015). All the datasets were compared with “Flight vs Ground Control” samples. The product of the log10(p-value) and fold change were used to create a preranked gene list for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005). Pathway analysis was performed using GSEA and gene sets were visualized using the EnrichmentMap plugin (Merico et al., 2010) for Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003).RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, and Proteomics For all RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, and proteomics datasets being utilized for this manuscript the data was gathered from the GeneLab platform. All information and details for sample preparation, library construction, and sequencing is available in the descriptions for that particular GeneLab dataset.RNA-sequence Data Analysis on Murine Samples RNASeq Analysis included 1) data validation and quality control with FASTQC and Trim Galore!, 2) read alignment to the mice genome using STAR RNA-seq aligner (Dobin et al., 2013), and 3) generation of gene-level expected count data with RSEM (Dobin et al., 2013). The list of software and its versions is as follow: FASTQC version 0.11.8, Trim Galore! Version 0.50, STAR version STAR_2.6.1a_08–27, mice genome version mm10-GRCm38, RSEM version 1.3.1. The quality of the sequencing step was evaluated with FASTQC, Trim Galore was used to pre-process the expression data trimming Illumina standard adapters sequences and nucleotides with a quality phred score below 33. For Differential Expression (DE) analysis, R Version 3.5.1 and DESeq2 Version 1.22.2 (Love et al., 2014) were used. Expected counts from RSEM step were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. A gene was considered differentially expressed with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 when using the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment procedure for false discovery rate (FDR) corrections.WGCNA Analysis on GLDS-168 Liver Tissue Count data used for Deseq2 analysis were prepared for WGCNA by normalizing using the TMM method in NoiSeq. WGCNA was then performed on the expression data, using Pearson correlation. Modules were then correlated against radiation status. Significant modules were then extracted and subjected to topGO gene enrichment analysis. A detailed R script for the WGCNA procedure is included in the supplementary methods (Method S1).RNA-sequence Data Analysis on Twin Study Samples Generated sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! (v0.4.1) and quantified to genes using kallisto on ENSEMBL transcripts (Bray et al., 2016). Differentially expressed genes were called using DESeq2 on each cell type separately by comparing preflight, inflight and postflight groups, controlling for the normal biological variance within the 24 months using the longitudinal data of the ground twin and using the simulated ambient control samples as another covariate for sorted cells (Love et al., 2014). Mitochondrial specific analysis on the Twin Study RNA-seq was done by finding the overlapping significantly regulated genes (FDR < 0.05) to mitochondrial genes determined from MitoCarta (Calvo et al., 2015). Heatmap was displayed using pheatmap (Kolde, 2015).Methylation Data Analysis Raw DNA methylation data was retrieved from the NASA GeneLab Data System (“GLDS”) website for all datasets that contained whole genome bisulfite data (GLDS-47, 48, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 137, 161, and 163). Each sample was aligned using bwa-meth version 0.2.2 (Pedersen et al., 2014) with default settings against an in silico bisulfite-converted mm10 Mus musculus reference genome. Alignments were de-duplicated using Picard MarkDuplicates v2.10.10-SNAPSHOT with default settings (Thomer et al., 2016). MethylDackel mbias (Ogoh et al., 2018) was used on each sample to determine regions of inclusion for each aligned read, in order to correct for methylation bias at the ends of reads. MethylDackel extract was then implemented using mBias-informed inclusion parameters to calculate per-base methylation. Finally, for each methylation call set, strands were merged using MethylDackel mergeContext and a minimum 10x coverage threshold was implemented per CpG. Differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) between the “flight” and “ground” samples were called for each dataset using methylKit (Akalin et al., 2012) with a logistic regression model. CpGs that had SLIM adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were taken as significant (Wang et al., 2011). Further, differentially methylated genes were identified by taking the median methylation around the promoter of each gene (transcription start site ±250bp), converting it to a M-value by logit function transform, and using limma (Ritchie et al., 2015) to call statistical significance. Genes with adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were taken as significantly differentially methylated. For gene set enrichment analysis these genes were ranked by the degree of methylation difference (log2 fold-change of the M-values) from hyper-methylated to hypo-methylated and were used as inputs to GSEA (Sergushichev, 2016; Subramanian et al., 2005) using MSigDB and MGI phenotypes signature databases (Finger et al., 2017; Liberzon, 2014; Liberzon et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2018) (Figs. 1, 2D, 5A, 7D and Table S3). Relationship between absolute methylation and expression was calculated by taking the base median expression for all genes in each dataset and correlating it to the median promoter methylation of that gene. Significance of the relationship between the methylation change and expression change was calculated by taking the log2 fold-change values for gene expression and methylation and fitting a linear model.Protein identification, quantification, and data analysis Peptide and protein identification and quantification was performed with MaxQuant (1.6.2.3) (Tyanova et al., 2016a) using a mouse reference database from Uniprot (downloaded on 20180104) (Tyanova et al., 2016a). The type of experiment was set to Reporter ion MS3 with 10plex TMT labeling. Propionamide of Cys was defined as a fixed modification and Oxidation of Met and Acetylation of protein N-terminal were set as variable modifications. Trypsin/P was selected as the digestion enzyme, and a maximum of 3 labeled amino acids and 2 missed cleavages per peptide were allowed. The False Discovery Rate for peptides and proteins were set at 1%. Fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.5 Da. The MS/MS tolerance was set at 20 ppm. The minimum peptide length was set at 7 amino acids. The rest of the parameters in MaxQuant were kept as default. The generated results by MaxQuant was further processed by PTXQC for quality control analysis (Bielow et al., 2016). Perseus (1.6.2.2) (Tyanova et al., 2016b) and in-house R scripts were used for proteomics data processing and statistical analysis (Tyanova et al., 2016b). The corrected reporter intensity values generated by MaxQuant were used to analyze the TMT-based proteomics data. Protein groups containing matches to decoy database or contaminants were discarded. Total ion intensity for each reporter ion channel were calculated and matched to correct for the sample loads in each TMT experiment. Only proteins that were quantified in the pooled samples were used for the analysis. Subsequently, internal reference scaling (IRS) method was employed to normalize protein intensities between different TMT runs using common proteins in pooled internal standards (Plubell et al., 2017). The data was log2 transformed and scaled by subtracting the median for each sample. LIMMA was employed to determine differentially protein abundance between groups and volcano plots were generated using EnhancedVolcano package (Bioconductor) to visualize the affected proteins (Ritchie et al., 2015). The affected proteins with p-value of less than 0.05 and log fold change of greater than 1.0 or less than −1.0 were considered significant. Differentially abundant proteins (with p-value < 0.05) were selected for GO term and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using NCI DAVID (Huang da et al., 2009). The categories with p-value of 0.05 or less were considered as significant. Top 4 most significant GO terms and KEGG pathways for each sample were reported in the text.Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Count data from datasets GLDS-161, GLDS-162, GLDS-163 and GLDS-168 described above were annotated to gene symbols, Rounded-up for the next integer and normalized by the variance stabilizing variation method using DEseq2 version 1.20.0 and R version 3.5.1. All the datasets were compared with “Flight vs Ground Control” samples, the ranked list of genes were defined by the signal-to-noise metric, and the statistical significance were determined by 1000 permutations of the genesets (Subramanian et al., 2005). Genesets using Gene Ontology terms - Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component - and KEGG pathways were run separately (Ashburner et al., 2000).Network maps for cross-omics and cross-tissue analysis Pathway results were integrated across multiple tissues and RNAseq and proteomics platforms to summarize the system-wide effects of spaceflight compared to ground control. Enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were integrating using a network framework, where two pathways are connected by an edge if they share a significant fraction of genes (similar to EnrichmentMap). Pathways dysregulated in two or more tissues are displayed. Pathway up and down regulation is encoded by node color, and pathways dysregulated by multiple tissues are mapped to larger node size.Metabolomic profiling and analysis Chromatographic deconvolution was conducted with the software Progenesis QI, which also allowed for normalization of the data with the function “normalize to all compounds” (http://www.nonlinear.com/progenesis/qi/v2.0/faq/how-normalisation-works.aspx). Statistical analysis for potential biomarker identification was conducted with the software MetaboLyzer (Mak et al., 2014). Complete presence ions with a ≥75% presence in both control (habitat) and experimental (flight) group were analyzed with the non-parametric Mann Whitney U test, while samples with <75% presence with the Barnard’s test. Outliers were removed via 1.5 IQR base filtering, zero abundance values were removed from the analysis, and a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.1 was applied. Putative identities were assigned through the databases Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2014) with <10 ppm error (Table S4). Graphical representation of putative biomarkers was conducted through GraphPad Prism and p-values were calculated with one-way ANOVA testing with Tukey’s multiple comparisons testing. All data are represented as scatter plots, with mean±standard error of the mean (SEM). A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Pathway enrichment was conducted through the software MetaboAnalyst (Chong et al., 2018). Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were constructed with the software Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector (GEDI) (Eichler et al., 2003).Metabolic modeling and downstream statistical analyses Tissue-specific metabolic models per sample were generated with Corda (Schultz and Qutub, 2016) on the selected tissue data with global flux confidence parameters determined by minimizing within-group flux standard deviation: (40, 10, 50, 0, 0). Flux balance analysis (FBA) was performed in a Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3 (with Python 3.7.6) environment (Kluyver et al., 2016) with the cobrapy package (Ebrahim et al., 2013) on the imm1415 metabolic model (Sigurdsson et al., 2010) optimizing for NAD biosynthesis using Gurobi solver as LP (Gurobi Optimization, L. L. C. (2020). Gurobi Optimizer Reference Manual. http://www.gurobi.com). Specifically, the capacity of NAD biosynthesis through all pathways in mouse is simulated by optimizing the flux of the cytosolic NAD demand reaction in the iMM1415 model(Chowdhry et al. 2019 and Liu et al 2018). In order to include reactions that may not be completely represented from the transcription data, we required the model to include essential pathways ‘Oxidative Phosphorylation’, ‘ROS Detoxification’,’Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis’, ‘Citric Acid Cycle’,’CoA Biosynthesis’,’CoA Catabolism’,’Biomass and maintenance functions’,’NAD Metabolism’,’Fatty Acid Metabolism’,’Fatty acid activation’,’Fatty acid elongation’, and ‘Fatty acid oxidation’. All metabolic models were analyzed using these identical parameters, except for the transcriptional data input per sample. Results from the FBA analyses on each sample were reported as fluxes that were then analyzed as grouped variables between the flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) groups. Flux heatmaps using row-wise Z-scores on the FBA results are shown for liver (Figs. 3G and 6C) and muscle (Figs. 3G and 6D). Fluxes in FLT and GC groups were compared using the non-parametric Van der Waerden (VdW) test as we cannot assume normality nor equality of variance between the groups, using the R matrixTests package (v. 0.1.9). Resulting VdW p-values were not adjusted for multiple testing correction because of the likelihood of over-penalization of strongly dependent fluxes in and between pathways. P-values were considered as significant at p < 0.05 (black squares in Fig. 6) and suggestive at 0.05 < p < 0.1 (grey squares in Fig. 6). Data and scripts related to the post-FBA statistical analyses can be found at https://osf.io/utmwf/. Flux levels and results from statistical analyses per flux can be found in the Supplementary Materials (Table S7).Quantitative Response to Spaceflight - Global view of the data For each assay, the overall average level of up and down regulated molecules across all species and strains was computed and use to normalize the individual levels of up and down regulated gene/protein/small molecules (metabolome) by dividing by the average of each assay. Note that regulation here refers to comparing Flight samples versus Ground samples, and thus reflects changes happening in space. For example, Liver data were recorded for both RR1 (C57BL/6) and RR3 (Balb/C) missions for both proteomics and transcriptomics. Thus, the reported value for liver for up-regulation is the average expression measured for liver in both lineages divided by the total average level of gene or protein expression reported here across both strains of mice. Such approach gives an overall view of the various dataset simplifying the identification of tissue systematically up or down regulated for individual assays across all assays, without suffering from absolute regulation levels which vary greatly between assays. Specifically, for the analysis for Figs 1A and B we listed the average number of genes/proteins/metabolome that were up or down regulated across all tissue listed. For example, on average, there were 106 and 37 Proteins up and down regulated respectively, with an overall average of 71. The plotted values are normalized to the overall average (i.e. 71). For example, for gene expression, there is an average of 974 genes regulated (average up: 969, average down: 980). In the case of human fibroblasts, values for either up or down regulated genes were about 5, which implies 5 × 974 genes = 4870 genes for each direction. In contrast, a value of 0.574 and 0.845 for up and down for T cells was found, corresponding to 0.574 × 974 = 560 and 0.845 × 974 = 833 respectively. Such scaling was necessary to show the relative amount of changes between tissue and across all assay, without suffering from very distinct level of expression between assays. In the case of protein, we reported the average number of proteins being detected for all groups. Across all tissues, on average across tissue, we had 2980 proteins and 27109 genes detected. Thus, 969 up regulated genes correspond to 3.6% of all detected genes and 37 down regulated proteins corresponds to 1.3% of all detected proteins.",
    "results": "Results Cellular and tissue dynamics altered by spaceflight Global analysis of the mRNA, protein, and metabolite responses to spaceflight across all GeneLab data (Fig. 1A–1D and Table S1) was performed by calculating the average number of differentially detected molecules between in-flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) samples. We found that cultured human cells and primary human hair follicles had the strongest response to spaceflight than other cells and tissues (vs genes regulated with adj. p<0.05). From the ten mouse tissues included in the analysis, we found that the soleus muscle, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, and liver had the highest number of differentially expressed genes (Table S1). Figure 1. Global analysis of the transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics datasets. Open in a new tab To provide a global view of the changes occurring for all GeneLab data used in this manuscript we computed the overall mean levels of up (A) and down (B) regulated molecules across all data sets for each assay and normalized to the individual levels of up and down regulated gene/protein/metabolite by dividing by the average of each assay. Note that regulation here refers to flight versus ground samples. C) Overall summary of the Differential Gene Methylation for hyper- and hypo-methylated genes. D) The relationship between absolute methylation and expression for all genes in each dataset and correlating it to the median promoter methylation of that gene. Significance of the relationship between the methylation change and expression change was calculated by taking the log2 fold-change values for gene expression and methylation and fitting a linear model. The significance is displayed on the plot by * p-value < 0.05, ** p-value < 0.01, and *** p-value < 0.001.As gene expression can be regulated or maintained epigenetically by DNA methylation, we found that EDL muscle and liver had an association between hypomethylation and increased gene transcription (Fig. 1A–1D). Our results in muscle tissue are consistent with previous findings (Beheshti et al., 2018), suggesting reduced muscle loading due to microgravity is a strong driver of gene regulation that can influence transcriptional responses to spaceflight. Consistent with that concept, we analyzed global differences between two common inbred strains of mice with distinct genetic backgrounds and found that C57BL/6 was more responsive at a transcriptional level to spaceflight than BALB/c (Table S1). The systemic mitochondrial stress response pathway is induced by spaceflight at the cellular and tissue level. To uncover the underlying systemic impact of spaceflight on astronauts, we analyzed four human cell line in vitro datasets available on GeneLab. Since these datasets are from legacy microarray data, comparisons were performed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for the overlapping pathways, using a false discovery rate cutoff of less than 10% (Fig. 2A). We found one overlapping collection of gene sets across all four cell types (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, primary T cells, and hair follicles). Remarkably, this overlap contained multiple mitochondrial function GO terms: mitochondrial ATP synthesis, mitochondrial electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and hydrogen ion transmembrane transportation (overlapping pathways in Fig. 2A). These data support the concept that spaceflight causes a universal change in gene expression related to energy generation.

Each node contains 4 wedges for each dataset (indicated by the legend in the figure) and the color of each wedge indicates if the gene set is downregulated (blue) or upregulated (red). The shade of the color indicates degree of regulation. The thickness of the edge (blue lines) represents the number of genes associated with the overlap of the gene sets (or nodes) that the edge connects. In addition, the green highlighted nodes represent the gene sets related to mitochondrial pathways. B) Liver, Kidney, Eye and Adrenal Gland Tissue Analysis from C57BL/6 and BALB/C mice from mission RR1 and RR3, C) C57BL/6 extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius (GST), quadriceps (Quad), soleus (SLS), tibialis anterior (TA), and BALB/C carotid artery (Carotid). B) and C) Pathway results were integrated across multiple tissues and RNAseq and proteomics platforms to summarize the system-wide effects of spaceflight compared to ground control. Enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were integrated using a network framework, where two pathways are connected by an edge if they share a significant fraction of genes. Pathways dysregulated in two or more tissues are displayed. Pathway up and down regulation is encoded by node color, and pathways dysregulated by multiple tissues are mapped to larger node size. D) Heatmap representation of GSEA analysis on the methylated genes from both mission. E) Heatmap representation of all mitochondrial genes that are significantly expressed (FDR < 0.05) between spaceflight vs ground fold-change values for all tissues. The mitochondrial genes were obtained from MitoCarta. The panel on the left of the heatmap shows the distribution of the significantly regulated (FDR < 0.05) mitochondrial genes for each comparison.Next, we extended our network analyses to data from mouse tissues to identify changes that span DNA to RNA to protein in response to spaceflight. This collection included transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenetics data of liver, kidney, eye, and adrenal gland tissues from two different mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) housed on the ISS for 33 and 37 days, respectively. We linked mitochondrial stress in the tissues and cells to ribosomal and translational changes (Fig. 2A–2C, S1, and Tables S2 and S6). Specifically, we found ribosome assembly, mitochondrial, and cytosolic translation pathways altered, implying proteostasis failure induced by spaceflight (Lu and Guo, 2020). We observed a consistent change in mitochondrial pathways across most tissues we tested, except in the adrenal gland and soleus muscle (Figs. 2B and 2C). The direction of transcriptional changes repeats at the epigenetic level in the internal organs and muscles (Fig. 2D). Lastly, to determine specific mitochondrial activity per tissue from mice flown in space, we analyzed a panel of mitochondrial genes identified from the MitoCarta resource (Calvo et al., 2015) (Fig. 2E). Liver contained the most mitochondrial activity across all organs, while the soleus and EDL had the most mitochondrial activity amongst the muscles (Fig. 2E). We analyzed metabolomic data from gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscle from both FLT and ground control GC C57BL/6 mice (RR9) to confirm potential metabolic changes in these tissues. Pathway enrichment analyses of metabolites from this data showed significant alterations in response to spaceflight (Fig. 3A, S2A, and Table S4), and the enrichment of several mitochondrial and energy-related pathways, such as β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids and tricarboxylic acid cycle (Fig. 3A). L-carnitine and malate (Fig. S2B), two examples of metabolites involved in ATP generating processes, showed distinguishable increases in the muscles. Our analyses suggest that tissues vary in their stress response to spaceflight as it pertains to mitochondrial function. Alternatively, our observation could reflect different adaptive energy requirements of each tissue. Figure 3.

Solid bars represent the ground samples (HR) over time and the patterned bars represent the flight samples (TW) over time. Expression in the 100215_CPT_HR ground sample (the second bar for ground samples) was set as 1. Sample details can be found in Table S5. The x-axis displays color-coded bars indicating which samples are pre-flight (black), during flight (yellow), and post-flight (orange). The error bars represent technical replicates. F) Levels of antioxidative capacity, 8OHdG, and PGF2-alpha in astronauts’ blood and urine for 59 crewmembers. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p<0.001 are reported. Full data table available in Table S3. G) Heatmaps show flux values (rows) vs mice (columns) from both RR1 and RR3 experiments for liver and muscle. Flux values are calculated as described in the methods, showing in the leftmost bar those fluxes whose differential testing results between FLT and GC result in p-values<0.05 (black) or suggestive where p-values fall between 0.05 and 0.1 (grey). Heatmap color scales indicate row-wise Z-scores for a particular flux, with Z-score ranges for that map indicated by key. Links to full heatmaps with all fluxes for all pathways in the tested tissues, as well as flux maps for the above can be found at https://osf.io/utmwf/ which also includes data used to generate these figures. Mitochondrial dysfunction as a consequence of spaceflight We observed mitochondrial dysfunction as a significant consequence of long-term space fight in both mouse models and humans by comparing spaceflight versus ground-based twins (Fig. 3). Observed changes include altered mitochondria-associated metabolites and modified nDNA and mtDNA OXPHOS gene expression (Fig. 3B), reduced antioxidant defenses and increased urinary markers of oxidative stress (Fig. 3F), and altered integrated stress response (ISR) gene expression (Fig. 3C). These and related observations suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may alter metabolic flux through mitochondrial pathways, perturb mitochondrial gene expression, and activate the ISR. We also observed opposite trends in transcriptional expression of nDNA versus mtDNA derived mitochondrial genes in livers from mice from the RR3 experiment (BALB/c) (Fig. 3B), further supporting the concept of spaceflight-associated mitochondrial dysfunction. In the liver, the nDNA-coded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) transcripts were strongly down-regulated, including cytochrome c oxidase (Cox4i1, Cox5a, Cox4i1, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6a1, Cox6b1, Cox6c, Cox7a2, Cox7a2l, Cox7b, Cox7c, Cox8a) as well as for coenzyme Q biosynthesis (Coq9). In contrast, we found a strong upregulation of the liver mtDNA-coded OXPHOS genes mt-ND4 and mt-ND5. The kidney also showed the induction of the mtDNA-coded subunits (mt-Nd2, mt-Nd4l, mt-ND5, mt-Co2, mt-Co3), and in the oxidative soleus muscle, the nDNA-coded COX genes were also down-regulated. In the EDL, a highly glycolytic tissue, we observed higher levels of mtDNA OXPHOS genes (mt-Co1, mt-Co3, mt-Nd4, mt-Nd4l, mt-Nd5, mt-Atp6), although nDNA-coded mitochondrial genes were not decreased (Fig. 3B). These observations support the conclusion that spaceflight suppresses nDNA-coded mitochondrial OXPHOS gene expression predominantly in oxidative tissues, and the induction of the mtDNA genes partially compensates for the diminished mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The reason for the opposite changes in transcription of the nDNA- and mtDNA-coded mitochondrial OXPHOS genes in spaceflight is unclear, but our results suggest that oxidative damage contributes to decreased nDNA OXPHOS transcripts. Levels of the transcriptional coactivator, PCG1α, which controls both sources of OXPHOS genes (Spiegelman and Heinrich, 2004) are increased in the liver, anterior tibialis, and EDL (Fig. 3C), which would be consistent with increased mitochondrial biogenesis. If these opposite trends in the differential transcription of the nDNA- and mtDNA-coded mitochondrial OXPHOS genes extend to the protein level, this would lead to imbalances in the assembly of OXPHOS complexes and promote the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT) (Houtkooper et al., 2011). Activation of the UPRMT can activate the integrated stress response (ISR) (Fig. 3C). For example, oxidative stress activates four kinases (GCN2, PKR, HRI, PERK) that initiate the ISR by regulating the phosphorylation of the cytosolic translation elongation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) (Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016). Phosphorylation of eIF2α reduces the cytosolic initiation complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-initiation tRNA), resulting in the preferential translation of mRNAs with an upstream ORF (uORF1) and activates the ISR (Balsa et al., 2019b; Quiros et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2019). ATF5 binds the amino acid receptor elements to upregulate 1-carbon folate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and the stress response factors FGF21 and GDF15 (Forsstrom et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2017b). GADD34 dephosphorylates p-eIF2α, allowing protein synthesis to return to normal (Fig. 3C). Our analysis of ISR-related genes expression from two murine space missions, RR1 and RR3 (Fig. 3C), showed that Gadd34 was increased in the adrenal gland in both missions. In the RR3 mission, Gadd34 was down-regulated in the oxidative soleus muscle and upregulated in the glycolytic anterior tibialis muscle, while the stress gene Atf5 was upregulated in both the anterior tibialis and in the EDL muscle, which is also a predominantly glycolytic muscle. Finally, we observed the downregulation of the stress response genes Fgf21 or Gdf15 in liver or soleus muscle, respectively. Therefore Atf5, Chop, and Gdf15 are downregulated in oxidative muscle during spaceflight, consistent with reduced ISR. In contrast, the increase in Atf5 and Gadd34 gene expression in glycolytic muscle suggests increased ISR. The modulation of Atf5, Chop, Gadd34, and Gdf15 (Fig. 3C) may indicate that the ISR may be a critical retort to spaceflight-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Activation of the ISR via mitochondrial dysfunction could be in response to the increased oxidative stress, which would impinge on all of the ISR kinases. Alternatively, the imbalance between the nDNA and mtDNA coded OXPHOS proteins, and UPRMT could also activate ISR. We investigated astronaut data to support the evidence of the biological processes observed in spaceflight mice. First, we analyzed the global mitochondrial levels from different cell populations (T lymphocytes CD4+ and CD8+, B lymphocyte CD19+, and Lymphocyte Depleted (LD) cells) in the blood from the NASA Twin Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) (Fig. 3D). Although the mitochondrial levels between the twin in space compared to the ground control differed pre-flight, we observed a significant shift in mitochondrial activity from in-flight to post-flight compared to pre-flight. CD19 cells had the greatest increase in mitochondrial activity post-flight for the twin in space, while mitochondrial activity in the CD4 population was significantly reduced in-flight and post-flight (Fig. 3D). Next, we measured the expression of five mtDNA genes related to OXPHOS, isolated from whole-blood cell fraction samples from the NASA Twin Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) including pre-, during, and post-flight samples, paired to ground control samples (Fig. 3E). All five mtDNA genes showed a similar pattern in response to spaceflight, starting with a 2- to 3-fold increase in expression at the beginning of the twin’s time on the ISS, and the peak was at 7- to 9-fold increase towards the end of the twin’s time on the ISS. In contrast, there were no robust changes in any of the genes from matched samples for the twin on Earth or in GAPDH, a key cytosolic enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. Remarkably, the mtDNA gene expression changes that occurred during spaceflight returned to baseline levels post-flight within a few weeks. The astronaut in the Twin Study passed only 2% of his lifespan in space (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019), whereas the mice from the RR1 and RR3 missions passed approximated 25% of their lifespan at the ISS. From the murine perspective, this was a long-term space mission, a particularly important consideration given the recent findings that mice and humans have different biochemical reaction speeds that affect development (Matsuda et al., 2020). While we observed an increase in mtDNA gene expression in the Twin Study, spaceflight reduced astronauts’ antioxidant capacity (Fig. 3F), coupled with an increase in urinary markers of oxidative stress including 8OHdG and Prostaglandin F2 alpha (PDGF2-alpha) (Table S4 and Fig. 3F). Urinary 8-OHdG is a biomarker of generalized cellular oxidative stress, a marker of oxidized DNA that signals that DNA repair is occurring, and a risk factor for cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes (Wu et al., 2004). PDGF2-alpha levels in urine are primarily related to cyclooxygenase-independent synthesis and oxidative stress (Yin et al., 2007). These data suggest that spaceflight increases oxidative stress as indicated by both blood and urinary markers. To further examine metabolic changes related to oxidative stress, we derived context-specific metabolic models from the RR1 and RR3 transcriptional data from mice flown to the ISS (Fig. 3G), and performed flux balance analysis (FBA) calculations to derive metabolic flux activity in each tissue optimized for NAD oxidation based on our interest in its central role in mitochondrial metabolism (Liu et al., 2018). Results for flux comparisons between flight and control mice show several notable metabolic pathway groups with opposite trends in muscle versus liver in both mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress (Fig. 3G and Table S7). Modeled flux through the citric acid cycle (CAC) gatekeeping enzyme Citrate Synthase (CSm, Fig. 6C–6D) in FLT vs GC significantly decreased in muscle but was up in liver. While metabolic flux activity does not necessarily directly relate to metabolite concentration, our flux model results do not disagree with our MS/MS experimental observations of increases in free muscle L-carnitine and malate. The CAC malate dehydrogenase (MDHm) flux that converts malate to oxaloacetate is significantly reduced in FLT vs GC muscle, as are mitochondrial Carnitine O acetyltransferase (CSNATm), which converts carnitine into acetyl carnitine, and Malonyl-CoA Decarboxylase (MCD), which converts the fatty acid metabolism antagonist malonyl-CoA (Brady et al., 1993) (Fig. 6C–6D). Fluxes related to carbohydrate metabolism also show differential changes and are mapped in Figs. S7 and S8. Files associated with flux results and statistical tests are included as supplemental files. Figure 6.

C) and D) Heatmaps show flux values (rows) vs mice (columns) from both RR1 and RR3 experiments for liver (C) and muscle (D). Details available on analysis in Figure Legend 3G.Using these modeled flux values, we can identify the tissue enrichment of mitochondria-localized substrates (MLS) versus the significance of the modeled fluxes. By partitioning fluxes by MLS and p-value significance, a 2×2 chi-square test of independence can detect relationships between mitochondrial substrates and differential flux results within each tissue. Significant fluxes were dominated by MLS, with 91 MLS (out of 316) significant fluxes, vs 81 MLS (out of 591) non-significant fluxes (p = 5.47e-08). In muscle, we found an opposite and significant trend, with a higher ratio of MLS in non-significant fluxes, with 162 MLS (out of 645) non-significant fluxes versus 18 MLS (out of 227) significant fluxes (p = 6.41e-08). Systemic innate immunity pathway alteration at cellular, internal tissues, and muscle levels induced by spaceflight Our GSEA analysis identified additional pathways that are affected by the space environment, including immune-related pathways. Cell culture models found an overall upregulation in immune-related pathways during spaceflight (Fig. 4A). In the internal organs, there was also a high presence of activated innate immune system pathways. Immune response through interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interferon-alpha (IFN-α) gene sets were down-regulated in the kidney and liver (Fig. 4B), with the epigenetic analysis showing differential methylation of these same gene sets (Fig. 5A). In all muscle tissues, we found an up-regulation in IFN-γ, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene sets (Fig. 4C), pathways linked to inflammation-induced muscle wasting (Londhe and Guttridge, 2015). Linked to these immune alterations, gene sets related to the proteasome were altered in both the internal organs and muscles (Fig. 4B and 4C), suggesting protein homeostasis is changed but not limited to the muscle degradation. At the epigenetic level, only EDL and GST muscles showed altered methylation, with EDL showing alteration in the IFN-α (Fig. 5A). However, we observed T-cell activation in the Twins study. These omic datasets suggest that spaceflight alters inflammatory pathways, so we measured circulating inflammatory markers in astronauts. We found decreased 1,25 Vitamin D levels and increased levels of VEGF-1, IGF-1, IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-1ra during spaceflight in astronauts (Fig. 5B), that again resolved to baseline levels upon returning to Earth.

Details available on analysis in Figure Legend 3F. C) WGCNA heatmap plot with arrows identify key hubs in spaceflight for liver samples. D) GO pathway analysis utilizing ClueGo from the genes identified in the spaceflight correlated WGCNA modules. Lipid dysregulation and the liver: a centralized role in the spaceflight response To further understand critical modules or gene hubs regulated by spaceflight, we used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the liver datasets (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008). We focused on the liver since we previously demonstrated that the liver regulates immune activity and lipid dysregulation during spaceflight (Beheshti et al., 2019). We observed two consensus networks significantly correlating with spaceflight in each group (denoted by arrows in Fig. 5C). ClueGO (Bindea et al., 2009) analysis of modules revealed significant enrichment of genes associated with DNA repair and bone resorption and remodeling (Fig. 5D). This enrichment agrees with our findings of reduced 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D during spaceflight (Fig. 5B) and also with increased urinary 8-OHdG excretion (Fig. 3C). The third major grouping of GSEA pathway hits focused on lipid biology. As stated earlier, lipid dysregulation with spaceflight originates from the liver (Beheshti et al., 2019). From our analysis of tissue pathways, lipid metabolism gene sets were upregulated in the liver and kidneys and downregulated in the eyes and adrenal gland (Fig. 6A). Also, the lipid profile in astronauts changed with spaceflight. We found higher levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, accompanied by decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Again, these levels reverted to normal after returning to Earth (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that spaceflight impacts lipid metabolism at the hepatic gene expression level, extending to the circulating lipid profile. We did not assess dietary intake before or after spaceflight. Still, it is worth noting that the spaceflight food system is limited, and astronauts’ diets differ from a nominal (earth based) diet. Our tissue-specific FBA analysis results on liver tissues from flight versus control mice in both missions identified an increase in fluxes related to carbohydrate and lipid-related metabolic factors (Fig. 6C and Table S7). Several conditions that lead to liver fibrosis are known to be marked by specifically dysregulated metabolic pathways, including significant increases in metabolites involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fructose and mannose metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, valine, leucine, isoleucine metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (citric acid) cycle metabolism (Chang and Yang, 2019). We found fluxes related to these fibrosis-related pathways significantly increased (p<0.05) in the pathways cited above (Fig. 6C). Circadian rhythm, olfactory activity, and muscle extracellular matrix (ECM)-related pathways and blood and urine parameters affected by spaceflight in vitro and in vivo Finally, our multi-omics analysis of spaceflight biology identified a grouping of pathways related to the circadian rhythm, olfactory activity, synapse/receptor signaling, and ECM (Fig. 7, Table S2 and S6). Cell cycle pathways were upregulated in all cell and tissue models except in human T cells, where these same terms were downregulated (Fig. 7A and 7B). Cell cycle dysfunction is heavily involved with all the other pathways discussed below. ECM related pathways were unaltered in the quadriceps, upregulated in SLS, EDL, GST, and TA muscles, and downregulated in the carotid artery (Fig. 7C). Circadian rhythm pathways were upregulated at the transcriptional level in all internal organs but the liver (Fig. 7C), suggesting that spaceflight impacts diurnal patterns of gene expression. Also, circadian rhythm pathways for the methylated genes were upregulated in the quadriceps and adrenal glands (Fig. 7D). Olfactory activity was also upregulated for methylated genes in the eyes, adrenal glands, kidneys, and GST muscle (Fig. 7D). Renin, an enzyme linked to vitamin D and calcium levels, significantly increased in 59 astronauts (Fig. 7E), and increases in renin impact circadian rhythm activity (Ohashi et al., 2017). Figure 7.

    "discussion": "Discussion Utilizing an integrated, comprehensive, and multi-omics systems biology approach, we have uncovered insights into fundamental biological mechanisms affected by spaceflight. Our analyses suggest systemic shifts in mitochondrial function occur in spaceflight in most of the tissues we examined. Mitochondrial changes likely impact processes such as innate immunity, lipid metabolism, and gene regulation in both mice and humans, and the results from our analyses are consistent with those from previous studies (Beheshti et al., 2019; Suomalainen and Battersby, 2018) and are supported by multiple other omics studies (Bezdan et al., 2020; Gertz et al., 2020). Raising awareness for adverse health outcomes during spaceflight will help guide scientific community responses to mitigate spaceflight associated health risks and develop appropriate countermeasures. We are not the first to propose changes to mitochondrial activity during spaceflight. Nikawa and collaborators proposed a spaceflight-specific, induced mitochondrial activity alteration associated with muscle atrophy in 2004 (Nikawa et al., 2004). Another study reported decreased mitochondrial activity in the roots of space-flown soybean seedlings (Klimchuk, 2007). Low doses of radiation trigger severe mitochondrial damage (Shimura et al., 2016) and the lower diffusion rates of solutes in microgravity (Smith et al., 2009) reduce the hydrogen gradient at the mitochondrial intermembrane space, reducing electron transport chain and ATP synthesis (Nelson, 2013). Our findings report transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolomic patterns (Figs. 2 and 3) consistent with mitochondrial stress in different cells and multiple organs, including muscle tissues (Jha et al., 2017; Topf et al., 2019). Specifically, mouse ISS data (Fig. 3B), astronaut studies (Fig. 3F), and the NASA Twin Study data (Fig. 3E) all strongly support an alteration in the electron transport chain reaction and ATP production in the mitochondria. Taken as a body of evidence, this suggests spaceflight induces mitochondrial stress in multiple organisms. The existence of spaceflight-induced mitochondrial stress is further supported by metabolite studies reporting increased urinary 8-OHdG and prostaglandin F2 alpha. 8-OHdG is a biomarker of cellular oxidative stress related to DNA repair (Wu et al., 2004). Increased prostaglandin F2 alpha levels in urine are associated with oxidative stress and cyclooxygenase independent synthesis (Yin et al., 2007). These markers are consistent with our analysis suggesting mitochondrial stress and dysfunction due to oxidative stress during spaceflight (Figs. 3B, 3F, and 3G). Oxidative stress is critical to mitochondria-mediated disease processes (Wallace, 2013). The longitudinal decrease in antioxidant capacity observed in astronauts during spaceflight (Fig. 3F) agrees with the development of mitochondrial and metabolic impairment dependent on space exposure. Energy homeostasis is of great importance when considering extended duration space missions, such as the possible mission to Mars, that will last at least 560 days (Pecaut et al., 2017). Our context-specific metabolic flux analysis (Fig. 3G) further demonstrates that spaceflight upregulates NAD metabolism in the liver, linking oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Massudi et al., 2012). A time-dependent increase in oxidative stress could have cumulative effects on astronaut physiology, including impacts on cognition and the development of impairing conditions that can make the journey unviable without effective countermeasures. Future research is needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of oxidative stress on astronaut health. Increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial stress were implicated in causing androgenetic alopecia (permanent hair loss) (Ho et al., 2019; Upton et al., 2015). Our analysis from the cell line data shows hair follicles exhibit increased expression of genes related to mitochondrial activity, while other cells show reduced expression (Fig. 2A). Increases in PPARGC1α (PGC1α), similar to what we have observed in the mouse tissue (Fig. 2C), were implicated with androgenetic alopecia through oxidative stress and mitochondrial activity (Ho et al., 2019). PGC1α also interacts with PPARγ, and dysregulation of PPARγ has been shown in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) to produce similar results to scarring alopecia (i.e., hair loss disorder) (Karnik et al., 2009). An increase in ROS, as encountered in spaceflight, triggers adult stem cells differentiation, and rapidly switches to mitochondrial OXPHOS (Hamanaka et al., 2013; Ito and Suda, 2014). We hypothesize that the increase in ROS caused by the spaceflight derived mitochondria dysfunction causes the shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS, increasing HFSC mitochondrial activity, and a potential mechanism to explain astronaut hair grown inhibition. Skeletal muscle also depends on OXPHOS for energy production (Kelley et al., 2002) reported to play a role in regulating metabolism (Argiles et al., 2016; Pratesi et al., 2013). The loss of skeletal muscle alters whole-body metabolism (Argiles et al., 2016). Microgravity-induced muscle degeneration is well reported (Demontis et al., 2017; Nikawa et al., 2004). The reduction of muscle metabolic flux when comparing between FLT vs GC vs the opposite result in liver (Figs. 3G, 6C, and 6D) may be due to the liver’s response to muscle wasting (sarcopenia). Sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) cohorts, independent of obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance (Koo et al., 2017). A recent comprehensive meta-analysis across similar studies found increased risks of NAFLD and liver fibrosis in subjects with sarcopenia (Cai et al., 2020). It is also interesting to note that opposite trends in mitochondrial activity in liver and muscle are common in subjects with prediabetes or diabetes type 2 (Bhansali et al., 2017; Pottecher et al., 2018). We suggest that muscle loss may relate to the increased metabolic flux changes in spaceflight for the mouse liver versus muscle, an area for future research. Our data indicate an overall dysregulation in lipid metabolism caused by the space environment, with particular attention to the liver being the body’s central metabolic organ and where LDL is produced (Nelson, 2013). We observed lipid metabolism pathways altered in mice and humans exposed to the space environment (Fig. 6). However, since no lipid pathway changes were observed in cell line data, we suggest lipid metabolism changes are derived from complex interactions at the tissue and organ levels. Two mouse strains were previously found to have accumulated lipids in the liver due to spaceflight exposure (Beheshti et al., 2019). Besides, lipid-related metabolic pathways were increased in the liver of the spaceflight mice (Fig 6C). Increased tryptophan, valine, leucine, isoleucine, TCA cycle, sphingolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolites are reported in the development and onset of fibrosis, with valine and bile acid synthesis related to more advanced stages (Chang and Yang, 2019; Musso et al., 2018). The lipid/glycolytic metabolic flux imbalance occurring in liver for mice flown to space-related to the onset of fibrosis is directly involved with the mitochondrial process, which involves modulation of oxidative phosphorylation (Diamond et al., 2007) (Fig. 3B). Also, inflammation leads to changes in lipid metabolism, and the persistence of the inflammatory stimulus can lead to chronic lipid changes associated with metabolic syndrome (Esteve et al., 2005). Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction is both a cause and a consequence of metabolic disorders (Bhatti et al., 2017). Spaceflight induced dyslipidemia in mice and astronauts (Schmidt et al., 2020) can be one contributor to cardiovascular health risks during longer-term space missions (Stein et al., 2019). It is also well established that cardiovascular risk is related to lipid disorders (Stein et al., 2019) and associations between dysregulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism and poor cardiac health are common (Meyers et al., 2013). The renin-angiotensin system induces hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, culminating in cell death (Siasos et al., 2018). As we found, in the case of renin (Fig. 7E), the hormones in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were reported as increased in spaceflight (Hughson et al., 2018). Early in 2020, the first occurrence of venous thrombosis was reported during spaceflight (Aunon-Chancellor et al., 2020). Limited knowledge exists for the effects of spaceflight on platelets (Vernice et al., 2020). However, mitochondrial dysfunction attenuates platelet survival and increased risk for thrombovascular events (Kunz et al., 2017; Melchinger et al., 2019), increasing stroke risk (Behrouzi and Punter, 2018). Mitochondrial dysfunction may cause stroke-like episodes independent of hypoxia (Ng et al., 2019). Therefore, spaceflight-induced mitochondrial dysfunction could increase cardiovascular disease risk in long-term missions caused by microgravity cardiovascular deconditioning and space radiation (Hughson et al., 2018). Cardiovascular disease is also linked to mitochondrial dysfunction through proteostasis failure related to lipid accumulation and ROS activity (Alam et al., 2020; Arrieta et al., 2020). Alterations in ribosome assembly, mitochondrial, and cytosol translation pathway in the cell models, internal organs, and muscles (Figs. 2 and 3) suggest the presence of proteostasis failure (Lu and Guo, 2020). Proteostasis refers to the maintenance of the proteome homeostasis by protein synthesis, folding, and degradation. Proteostasis failure occurs in C. elegans in response to spaceflight, although it was not clear if this response was due only to muscle wasting (Honda et al., 2012). Alterations in proteostasis were widespread in our cell models and internal organ tissues (Fig. 2). Mitochondrial dysfunction inhibits cytosolic protein synthesis and defective protein quality control (Lu and Guo, 2020; Topf et al., 2019). Since mitochondrial function can prevent age-related proteostasis collapse (Williams et al., 2020), we suggest countermeasures focused on re-establishing the mitochondrial function will also recuperate the proteostasis condition. Interestingly, proteostasis loss is a hallmark of aged muscles (Fernando et al., 2019). Lipid metabolism changes can also be caused by inflammation (Esteve et al., 2005) which is related to our observed markers for innate immunity with dysregulation of adaptive immunity occurring during spaceflight, consistent with an increased innate immunity profile on spaceflight (Crucian et al., 2018). The complement system and pathways related to IFN-γ and IFN-α change in the internal organs (Fig. 4B). Mitochondrial debris were observed in blood in the Twin Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) and mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate innate immune pathways (Banoth and Cassel, 2018; Zhang et al., 2010). We found a similar pattern with IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF-α up-regulation within muscle tissues and astronaut blood (Figs. 4 and 5B). Interestingly, we also found altered proteasome expression linked to innate immunity (Table S6). IFN-γ can induce a switch to aerobic glycolysis and has a significant role in proteasome regulation (Wang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 1992), linking mitochondrial dysfunction, innate immunity, and alterations in proteostasis. IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF-α are known to be drivers of muscle wasting in chronic inflammatory diseases (Londhe and Guttridge, 2015). Vitamin D can modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses as the vitamin D receptor is expressed on B cells, T cells, antigen-presenting cells, and dendritic cells (Aranow, 2011). The lower levels of 1,25 Vitamin D and higher IL-1 and IGF-1 levels measured from 59 astronauts are consistent with findings at the cellular and tissue levels (Fig. 5). Adequate energy, protein, and vitamin D supply are essential for bone mineral density maintenance after six months of spaceflight (Smith et al., 2012b). Astronauts had a decrease in 1,25 vitamin D levels (the active form of vitamin D) (Fig. 5B) consistent with other studies (Smith et al., 2005) Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation prevents 1,25 vitamin D loss, leading NASA to increase the vitamin D supplementation to 1000 IU/d (Douglas, 2020). Vitamin D3 is modified through the mitochondria in the liver and kidney to assume its active form, 1,25 vitamin D (Bikle, 2014). Synthetic active vitamin D analogs may not help increase the health risks already associated with spaceflight such as hypercalcemia, kidney stone formation, and ectopic calcification (Nicogossian et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2015). Immune dysregulation is known to be strongly influenced by the cell cycle (Laphanuwat and Jirawatnotai, 2019). We found that cell cycle-associated genes were affected by spaceflight in both the in vitro and in vivo models (Fig. 7). Spaceflight caused an increased expression of cell cycle genes in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and the hair follicles, but these genes were down-regulated in T cells (Fig. 7A). Intracellular ROS enhances fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and hair follicles cell proliferation (Day and Suzuki, 2006; Hamanaka et al., 2013). However, ROS causes T cell cycle arrest (Belikov et al., 2015; Yan and Banerjee, 2010) and T cell activation/proliferation requires a reducing extracellular microenvironment (Yan and Banerjee, 2010). Cell cycle and mitochondrial activity directly control circadian rhythm in cells and organisms (Sardon Puig et al., 2018). Sleep disorders are common in astronauts (Wu et al., 2018) and patients with primary mitochondrial diseases (Ramezani and Stacpoole, 2014). Intriguingly, we have found alterations in circadian cycle on internal organs, particularly in the eyes. In this study, the mice in space and ground control were maintained in a 12/12 light/dark cycle. They were not subjected to any workload activities that commonly impact astronauts, which rules out both possible causes for this alteration. A return to mitochondrial homeostasis could help restore a healthy awake/sleep cycle in astronauts. The methylated genes demonstrated olfactory activity pathways upregulation in multiple tissues (Fig. 7D). The olfactory bulb pathways are closely linked to circadian rhythm affecting feeding times (Pavlovski et al., 2018) and immune functions (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016). Additionally, mitochondrial Ca(2+) is a critical element in olfactory signaling (Fluegge et al., 2012) and in astronauts, smelling behavior changes occur potentially due to microgravity causing an upward shift of body fluid (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016). Olfactory signaling has even been directly linked to mitochondrial structure and glucose activity (Kovach et al., 2016), indicating we have uncovered a systemic impact on the body driven by the mitochondria. G proteins are ubiquitous inside cells and play an essential role in circadian regulation (Doi et al., 2011). They also regulate a wide range of cellular processes, including a significant role in synapse formation and elimination, affecting memory formation (Leung and Wong, 2017; Ye and Carew, 2010). We identified potential alterations in receptor signaling in our cell models due to changes in the expression of several G protein-linked signal transduction genes (Figs. 1A, 4A, 7A, and Table S6). Interesting, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) was reported to act as a gatekeeper of mitochondrial function in the heart, and the inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) preserved mitochondrial function after myocardial infarction (Chen et al., 2020; Sorriento et al., 2019). In addition, G proteins are heavily involved with the renin-angiotensin system, with the activation of G proteins resulting in similar increases to the renin levels we observed (Fig. 7E). (Balakumar and Jagadeesh, 2014). The potential of targeting G protein-coupled receptor signaling as a spaceflight countermeasure should be investigated further. Countermeasures for spaceflight consist of procedures or nutritional and therapeutic interventions to counteract the adverse effects of spaceflight on the human body, maintain health, reduce risk, and improve safety (Clément, 2011). The principal countermeasure applied to astronauts is exercise; astronauts onboard the ISS exercise for up to 2 hours per day, but there is still a considerable decrease in muscle mass, and bone loss observed after landing (Clément, 2011). Exercise also counteracts the effect of microgravity on the cardiovascular system; nonetheless, neither exercise intensity nor duration showed sufficient to prevent vascular changes as increased arterial and intima-media thickness, cardiac atrophy, and the development of insulin resistance (Hughson et al., 2018). A study on acute exercise in individuals with a spectrum of insulin resistance showed that acute physical activity triggers molecular responses on the metabolic and energy-producing pathways, increasing glycolysis, TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation (Contrepois et al., 2020). In comparison, our results show an overall decrease in the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism in the muscle tissue based on the metabolic flux analysis (Fig. 6D). At the same time, these factors increase in the liver (Fig. 6C), indicating exercise may not be enough to counteract the stressors in space. With exercise currently utilized as an inflight countermeasure, the increases of acute inflammatory markers seen during exercise (e.g., IL-6, TNF-a, IL1-RA, and IGF-1) could be problematic to an already increased inflammatory pattern we measured in astronauts (Fig. 5B), even though these markers are reduced by regular exercise in low-grade systemic inflammation patients (Contrepois et al., 2020; Khazaei, 2012). In addition to exercise, pharmacotherapy and nutritional interventions used in patients with mitochondrial dysfunction should be considered for future spaceflight countermeasures. An essential aspect of astronauts’ metabolic health is consuming the recommended energy intake consisting of carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. The field of nutritional mitochondrial therapeutics is still evolving, with some evidence pointing to effective treatments (Camp et al., 2016; Rinninella et al., 2018). The strongest candidate is the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) that should be administered to the majority of primary mitochondrial diseases (PMD), independent of CoQ10 deficiency (Camp et al., 2016). CoQ10 is an abundant lipid-soluble nutrient scavenging free radical and protecting cells against oxidative damage (Zhang et al., 2018). CoQ10 is currently being tested on the ISS as a countermeasure for retinal lesions, and data from this project could help elucidate if CoQ10 could be used as a more general intervention (Lulli et al., 2019). In summary, the effects of spaceflight on the mitochondria provides a unifying framework for integrating the various alterations observed in the astronauts. Reduced mitochondrial function with sustained calories would generate excess mitochondrial ROS and activate compensatory mtDNA replication, resulting in increased mtDNA transcripts. The combination of replicating mtDNA and ROS would oxidize the mtDNA, which would be released to activate the innate immune system inflammasome and the Type I interferon pathway (West and Shadel, 2017; Zhong et al., 2018). The reduced NADH and radiation-induced DNA damage would reduce NAD+ levels (Fig. 3G), which would impair the circadian rhythm system through perturbed Sirt1 regulation of BMAL acetylation (Nakahata et al., 2008). Alteration in mitochondrial protein production would activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Fig. 7A), which would trigger the integrated stress response pathway (Fig. 3C), causing phosphorylation of the cytosolic initiation factor eIF2α. This would activate the ATF4 transcription factor to upregulate expression of FGF21 and GDF15 and induce the mitochondrial supercomplex assembly factor SCAF1 (Balsa et al., 2019a; Khan et al., 2017a). Finally, inhibiting the electron transport chain (Fig. 3G) would alter the mitochondrial metabolites, which serve as the substrates for the epigenome modification enzymes (Kopinski et al., 2019). Overall, this work highlights the power of comparing and integrating multiple omics and data types to understand further how life adapts to spaceflight conditions and risks. We found mitochondrial dysregulation as a central hub for space biology. This concept can guide new nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions and studies that will increase the viability of long-term human-crewed space missions. Health effects from mitochondrial dysfunction should be considered with spaceflight health risk models when planning future human-crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.",

To reveal these causes, we used a multi-omics, systems biology analytical approach using biomedical profiles from fifty-nine astronauts and data from NASA’s GeneLab derived from hundreds of samples flown in space, to determine transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic responses to spaceflight. Overall pathway analyses on the multi-omic datasets showed significant enrichment for mitochondrial processes, as well as innate immunity, chronic inflammation, cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory functions. Importantly, NASA’s Twin Study provided a platform to confirm several of our principal findings. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data compiled from the astronaut cohort and NASA Twin Study data, indicating mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight.

Exposure to space radiation and microgravity are primary hazards to astronauts’ health in long-duration space missions (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). In addition to the known increased cancer risk from chronic low doses of radiation exposure (Durante and Cucinotta, 2008), astronauts that returned from missions on the International Space Station (ISS) presented with health issues similar to geriatric stress, including bone and muscle mass loss, central nervous system issues, immune dysfunction, and cardiovascular health risks (Strollo et al., 2018). Future success in long-duration space exploration requires a comprehensive understanding of the impact of spaceflight on human biology, and such knowledge could be used to design efficient countermeasures that would benefit astronauts and the health of people on Earth. Here, we provide an integrated analysis of mammalian space biology using a systems biology approach powered by multiple “omic” platforms. Realized by the existence of NASA’s GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov/) (Ray et al., 2019), a dedicated space omics database, our work includes 4 human cell models, 13 different tissues (11 mouse and 2 human), 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/C), and space missions ranging from 2006 to 2017, culminating in the measurement of astronaut blood and urine metabolites, as well as transcriptional data from the NASA Twin Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Gertz et al., 2020). Our data-driven approach resulted in three discoveries. First, spaceflight effects were more evident in isolated cells than whole organs, suggesting that tissue complexity plays an essential role in response to space-related stress. Second, the liver undergoes more differential gene and protein expression changes than other organs, consistent with the role the liver plays as a dynamic and critical hub in sensing changes in blood composition and maintaining homeostasis. Finally, our comprehensive pathway analyses identified how spaceflight impacts mitochondrial function at the genetic, protein, and metabolite levels of cellular, tissue, and organismal biology.Results Cellular and tissue dynamics altered by spaceflight Global analysis of the mRNA, protein, and metabolite responses to spaceflight across all GeneLab data (Fig. 1A–1D and Table S1) was performed by calculating the average number of differentially detected molecules between in-flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) samples. We found that cultured human cells and primary human hair follicles had the strongest response to spaceflight than other cells and tissues (vs genes regulated with adj. p<0.05). From the ten mouse tissues included in the analysis, we found that the soleus muscle, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, and liver had the highest number of differentially expressed genes (Table S1). Figure 1. Global analysis of the transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics datasets. Open in a new tab To provide a global view of the changes occurring for all GeneLab data used in this manuscript we computed the overall mean levels of up (A) and down (B) regulated molecules across all data sets for each assay and normalized to the individual levels of up and down regulated gene/protein/metabolite by dividing by the average of each assay. Note that regulation here refers to flight versus ground samples. C) Overall summary of the Differential Gene Methylation for hyper- and hypo-methylated genes. D) The relationship between absolute methylation and expression for all genes in each dataset and correlating it to the median promoter methylation of that gene. Significance of the relationship between the methylation change and expression change was calculated by taking the log2 fold-change values for gene expression and methylation and fitting a linear model. The significance is displayed on the plot by * p-value < 0.05, ** p-value < 0.01, and *** p-value < 0.001.As gene expression can be regulated or maintained epigenetically by DNA methylation, we found that EDL muscle and liver had an association between hypomethylation and increased gene transcription (Fig. 1A–1D). Our results in muscle tissue are consistent with previous findings (Beheshti et al., 2018), suggesting reduced muscle loading due to microgravity is a strong driver of gene regulation that can influence transcriptional responses to spaceflight. Consistent with that concept, we analyzed global differences between two common inbred strains of mice with distinct genetic backgrounds and found that C57BL/6 was more responsive at a transcriptional level to spaceflight than BALB/c (Table S1).The systemic mitochondrial stress response pathway is induced by spaceflight at the cellular and tissue level. To uncover the underlying systemic impact of spaceflight on astronauts, we analyzed four human cell line in vitro datasets available on GeneLab. Since these datasets are from legacy microarray data, comparisons were performed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for the overlapping pathways, using a false discovery rate cutoff of less than 10% (Fig. 2A). We found one overlapping collection of gene sets across all four cell types (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, primary T cells, and hair follicles). Remarkably, this overlap contained multiple mitochondrial function GO terms: mitochondrial ATP synthesis, mitochondrial electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and hydrogen ion transmembrane transportation (overlapping pathways in Fig. 2A). These data support the concept that spaceflight causes a universal change in gene expression related to energy generation.

Cytoscape enrichment maps of GO and KEGG sets with FDR <10% in at least two GLDS datasets. Each node contains 4 wedges for each dataset (indicated by the legend in the figure) and the color of each wedge indicates if the gene set is downregulated (blue) or upregulated (red). The shade of the color indicates degree of regulation. The thickness of the edge (blue lines) represents the number of genes associated with the overlap of the gene sets (or nodes) that the edge connects. In addition, the green highlighted nodes represent the gene sets related to mitochondrial pathways. B) Liver, Kidney, Eye and Adrenal Gland Tissue Analysis from C57BL/6 and BALB/C mice from mission RR1 and RR3, C) C57BL/6 extensor digitorum longus (EDL), gastrocnemius (GST), quadriceps (Quad), soleus (SLS), tibialis anterior (TA), and BALB/C carotid artery (Carotid). B) and C) Pathway results were integrated across multiple tissues and RNAseq and proteomics platforms to summarize the system-wide effects of spaceflight compared to ground control. Enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were integrated using a network framework, where two pathways are connected by an edge if they share a significant fraction of genes. Pathways dysregulated in two or more tissues are displayed. Pathway up and down regulation is encoded by node color, and pathways dysregulated by multiple tissues are mapped to larger node size. D) Heatmap representation of GSEA analysis on the methylated genes from both mission. E) Heatmap representation of all mitochondrial genes that are significantly expressed (FDR < 0.05) between spaceflight vs ground fold-change values for all tissues. The mitochondrial genes were obtained from MitoCarta. The panel on the left of the heatmap shows the distribution of the significantly regulated (FDR < 0.05) mitochondrial genes for each comparison.Next, we extended our network analyses to data from mouse tissues to identify changes that span DNA to RNA to protein in response to spaceflight. This collection included transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenetics data of liver, kidney, eye, and adrenal gland tissues from two different mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) housed on the ISS for 33 and 37 days, respectively. We linked mitochondrial stress in the tissues and cells to ribosomal and translational changes (Fig. 2A–2C, S1, and Tables S2 and S6). Specifically, we found ribosome assembly, mitochondrial, and cytosolic translation pathways altered, implying proteostasis failure induced by spaceflight (Lu and Guo, 2020). We observed a consistent change in mitochondrial pathways across most tissues we tested, except in the adrenal gland and soleus muscle (Figs. 2B and 2C). The direction of transcriptional changes repeats at the epigenetic level in the internal organs and muscles (Fig. 2D). Lastly, to determine specific mitochondrial activity per tissue from mice flown in space, we analyzed a panel of mitochondrial genes identified from the MitoCarta resource (Calvo et al., 2015) (Fig. 2E). Liver contained the most mitochondrial activity across all organs, while the soleus and EDL had the most mitochondrial activity amongst the muscles (Fig. 2E). We analyzed metabolomic data from gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscle from both FLT and ground control GC C57BL/6 mice (RR9) to confirm potential metabolic changes in these tissues. Pathway enrichment analyses of metabolites from this data showed significant alterations in response to spaceflight (Fig. 3A, S2A, and Table S4), and the enrichment of several mitochondrial and energy-related pathways, such as β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids and tricarboxylic acid cycle (Fig. 3A). L-carnitine and malate (Fig. S2B), two examples of metabolites involved in ATP generating processes, showed distinguishable increases in the muscles. Our analyses suggest that tissues vary in their stress response to spaceflight as it pertains to mitochondrial function. Alternatively, our observation could reflect different adaptive energy requirements of each tissue. Figure 3.

F) Levels of antioxidative capacity, 8OHdG, and PGF2-alpha in astronauts’ blood and urine for 59 crewmembers.

Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p<0.001 are reported. Full data table available in Table S3. G) Heatmaps show flux values (rows) vs mice (columns) from both RR1 and RR3 experiments for liver and muscle. Flux values are calculated as described in the methods, showing in the leftmost bar those fluxes whose differential testing results between FLT and GC result in p-values<0.05 (black) or suggestive where p-values fall between 0.05 and 0.1 (grey). Heatmap color scales indicate row-wise Z-scores for a particular flux, with Z-score ranges for that map indicated by key. Links to full heatmaps with all fluxes for all pathways in the tested tissues, as well as flux maps for the above can be found at https://osf.io/utmwf/ which also includes data used to generate these figures.Mitochondrial dysfunction as a consequence of spaceflight We observed mitochondrial dysfunction as a significant consequence of long-term space fight in both mouse models and humans by comparing spaceflight versus ground-based twins (Fig. 3). Observed changes include altered mitochondria-associated metabolites and modified nDNA and mtDNA OXPHOS gene expression (Fig. 3B), reduced antioxidant defenses and increased urinary markers of oxidative stress (Fig. 3F), and altered integrated stress response (ISR) gene expression (Fig. 3C). These and related observations suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may alter metabolic flux through mitochondrial pathways, perturb mitochondrial gene expression, and activate the ISR. We also observed opposite trends in transcriptional expression of nDNA versus mtDNA derived mitochondrial genes in livers from mice from the RR3 experiment (BALB/c) (Fig. 3B), further supporting the concept of spaceflight-associated mitochondrial dysfunction. In the liver, the nDNA-coded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) transcripts were strongly down-regulated, including cytochrome c oxidase (Cox4i1, Cox5a, Cox4i1, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6a1, Cox6b1, Cox6c, Cox7a2, Cox7a2l, Cox7b, Cox7c, Cox8a) as well as for coenzyme Q biosynthesis (Coq9). In contrast, we found a strong upregulation of the liver mtDNA-coded OXPHOS genes mt-ND4 and mt-ND5. The kidney also showed the induction of the mtDNA-coded subunits (mt-Nd2, mt-Nd4l, mt-ND5, mt-Co2, mt-Co3), and in the oxidative soleus muscle, the nDNA-coded COX genes were also down-regulated. In the EDL, a highly glycolytic tissue, we observed higher levels of mtDNA OXPHOS genes (mt-Co1, mt-Co3, mt-Nd4, mt-Nd4l, mt-Nd5, mt-Atp6), although nDNA-coded mitochondrial genes were not decreased (Fig. 3B). These observations support the conclusion that spaceflight suppresses nDNA-coded mitochondrial OXPHOS gene expression predominantly in oxidative tissues, and the induction of the mtDNA genes partially compensates for the diminished mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The reason for the opposite changes in transcription of the nDNA- and mtDNA-coded mitochondrial OXPHOS genes in spaceflight is unclear, but our results suggest that oxidative damage contributes to decreased nDNA OXPHOS transcripts. Levels of the transcriptional coactivator, PCG1α, which controls both sources of OXPHOS genes (Spiegelman and Heinrich, 2004) are increased in the liver, anterior tibialis, and EDL (Fig. 3C), which would be consistent with increased mitochondrial biogenesis. If these opposite trends in the differential transcription of the nDNA- and mtDNA-coded mitochondrial OXPHOS genes extend to the protein level, this would lead to imbalances in the assembly of OXPHOS complexes and promote the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT) (Houtkooper et al., 2011). Activation of the UPRMT can activate the integrated stress response (ISR) (Fig. 3C). For example, oxidative stress activates four kinases (GCN2, PKR, HRI, PERK) that initiate the ISR by regulating the phosphorylation of the cytosolic translation elongation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) (Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016). Phosphorylation of eIF2α reduces the cytosolic initiation complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-initiation tRNA), resulting in the preferential translation of mRNAs with an upstream ORF (uORF1) and activates the ISR (Balsa et al., 2019b; Quiros et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2019). ATF5 binds the amino acid receptor elements to upregulate 1-carbon folate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and the stress response factors FGF21 and GDF15 (Forsstrom et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2017b). GADD34 dephosphorylates p-eIF2α, allowing protein synthesis to return to normal (Fig. 3C). Our analysis of ISR-related genes expression from two murine space missions, RR1 and RR3 (Fig. 3C), showed that Gadd34 was increased in the adrenal gland in both missions. In the RR3 mission, Gadd34 was down-regulated in the oxidative soleus muscle and upregulated in the glycolytic anterior tibialis muscle, while the stress gene Atf5 was upregulated in both the anterior tibialis and in the EDL muscle, which is also a predominantly glycolytic muscle. Finally, we observed the downregulation of the stress response genes Fgf21 or Gdf15 in liver or soleus muscle, respectively. Therefore Atf5, Chop, and Gdf15 are downregulated in oxidative muscle during spaceflight, consistent with reduced ISR. In contrast, the increase in Atf5 and Gadd34 gene expression in glycolytic muscle suggests increased ISR. The modulation of Atf5, Chop, Gadd34, and Gdf15 (Fig. 3C) may indicate that the ISR may be a critical retort to spaceflight-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Activation of the ISR via mitochondrial dysfunction could be in response to the increased oxidative stress, which would impinge on all of the ISR kinases. Alternatively, the imbalance between the nDNA and mtDNA coded OXPHOS proteins, and UPRMT could also activate ISR. We investigated astronaut data to support the evidence of the biological processes observed in spaceflight mice. First, we analyzed the global mitochondrial levels from different cell populations (T lymphocytes CD4+ and CD8+, B lymphocyte CD19+, and Lymphocyte Depleted (LD) cells) in the blood from the NASA Twin Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) (Fig. 3D). Although the mitochondrial levels between the twin in space compared to the ground control differed pre-flight, we observed a significant shift in mitochondrial activity from in-flight to post-flight compared to pre-flight. CD19 cells had the greatest increase in mitochondrial activity post-flight for the twin in space, while mitochondrial activity in the CD4 population was significantly reduced in-flight and post-flight (Fig. 3D). Next, we measured the expression of five mtDNA genes related to OXPHOS, isolated from whole-blood cell fraction samples from the NASA Twin Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) including pre-, during, and post-flight samples, paired to ground control samples (Fig. 3E). All five mtDNA genes showed a similar pattern in response to spaceflight, starting with a 2- to 3-fold increase in expression at the beginning of the twin’s time on the ISS, and the peak was at 7- to 9-fold increase towards the end of the twin’s time on the ISS. In contrast, there were no robust changes in any of the genes from matched samples for the twin on Earth or in GAPDH, a key cytosolic enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. Remarkably, the mtDNA gene expression changes that occurred during spaceflight returned to baseline levels post-flight within a few weeks. The astronaut in the Twin Study passed only 2% of his lifespan in space (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019), whereas the mice from the RR1 and RR3 missions passed approximated 25% of their lifespan at the ISS. From the murine perspective, this was a long-term space mission, a particularly important consideration given the recent findings that mice and humans have different biochemical reaction speeds that affect development (Matsuda et al., 2020). While we observed an increase in mtDNA gene expression in the Twin Study, spaceflight reduced astronauts’ antioxidant capacity (Fig. 3F), coupled with an increase in urinary markers of oxidative stress including 8OHdG and Prostaglandin F2 alpha (PDGF2-alpha) (Table S4 and Fig. 3F). Urinary 8-OHdG is a biomarker of generalized cellular oxidative stress, a marker of oxidized DNA that signals that DNA repair is occurring, and a risk factor for cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes (Wu et al., 2004). PDGF2-alpha levels in urine are primarily related to cyclooxygenase-independent synthesis and oxidative stress (Yin et al., 2007). These data suggest that spaceflight increases oxidative stress as indicated by both blood and urinary markers. To further examine metabolic changes related to oxidative stress, we derived context-specific metabolic models from the RR1 and RR3 transcriptional data from mice flown to the ISS (Fig. 3G), and performed flux balance analysis (FBA) calculations to derive metabolic flux activity in each tissue optimized for NAD oxidation based on our interest in its central role in mitochondrial metabolism (Liu et al., 2018). Results for flux comparisons between flight and control mice show several notable metabolic pathway groups with opposite trends in muscle versus liver in both mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress (Fig. 3G and Table S7). Modeled flux through the citric acid cycle (CAC) gatekeeping enzyme Citrate Synthase (CSm, Fig. 6C–6D) in FLT vs GC significantly decreased in muscle but was up in liver. While metabolic flux activity does not necessarily directly relate to metabolite concentration, our flux model results do not disagree with our MS/MS experimental observations of increases in free muscle L-carnitine and malate. The CAC malate dehydrogenase (MDHm) flux that converts malate to oxaloacetate is significantly reduced in FLT vs GC muscle, as are mitochondrial Carnitine O acetyltransferase (CSNATm), which converts carnitine into acetyl carnitine, and Malonyl-CoA Decarboxylase (MCD), which converts the fatty acid metabolism antagonist malonyl-CoA (Brady et al., 1993) (Fig. 6C–6D). Fluxes related to carbohydrate metabolism also show differential changes and are mapped in Figs. S7 and S8. Files associated with flux results and statistical tests are included as supplemental files. Figure 6.

C) and D) Heatmaps show flux values (rows) vs mice (columns) from both RR1 and RR3 experiments for liver (C) and muscle (D). Details available on analysis in Figure Legend 3G.Using these modeled flux values, we can identify the tissue enrichment of mitochondria-localized substrates (MLS) versus the significance of the modeled fluxes. By partitioning fluxes by MLS and p-value significance, a 2×2 chi-square test of independence can detect relationships between mitochondrial substrates and differential flux results within each tissue. Significant fluxes were dominated by MLS, with 91 MLS (out of 316) significant fluxes, vs 81 MLS (out of 591) non-significant fluxes (p = 5.47e-08). In muscle, we found an opposite and significant trend, with a higher ratio of MLS in non-significant fluxes, with 162 MLS (out of 645) non-significant fluxes versus 18 MLS (out of 227) significant fluxes (p = 6.41e-08).Systemic innate immunity pathway alteration at cellular, internal tissues, and muscle levels induced by spaceflight Our GSEA analysis identified additional pathways that are affected by the space environment, including immune-related pathways. Cell culture models found an overall upregulation in immune-related pathways during spaceflight (Fig. 4A). In the internal organs, there was also a high presence of activated innate immune system pathways. Immune response through interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interferon-alpha (IFN-α) gene sets were down-regulated in the kidney and liver (Fig. 4B), with the epigenetic analysis showing differential methylation of these same gene sets (Fig. 5A). In all muscle tissues, we found an up-regulation in IFN-γ, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene sets (Fig. 4C), pathways linked to inflammation-induced muscle wasting (Londhe and Guttridge, 2015). Linked to these immune alterations, gene sets related to the proteasome were altered in both the internal organs and muscles (Fig. 4B and 4C), suggesting protein homeostasis is changed but not limited to the muscle degradation. At the epigenetic level, only EDL and GST muscles showed altered methylation, with EDL showing alteration in the IFN-α (Fig. 5A). However, we observed T-cell activation in the Twins study. These omic datasets suggest that spaceflight alters inflammatory pathways, so we measured circulating inflammatory markers in astronauts. We found decreased 1,25 Vitamin D levels and increased levels of VEGF-1, IGF-1, IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-1ra during spaceflight in astronauts (Fig. 5B), that again resolved to baseline levels upon returning to Earth.

D) GO pathway analysis utilizing ClueGo from the genes identified in the spaceflight correlated WGCNA modules.Lipid dysregulation and the liver: a centralized role in the spaceflight response To further understand critical modules or gene hubs regulated by spaceflight, we used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the liver datasets (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008). We focused on the liver since we previously demonstrated that the liver regulates immune activity and lipid dysregulation during spaceflight (Beheshti et al., 2019). We observed two consensus networks significantly correlating with spaceflight in each group (denoted by arrows in Fig. 5C). ClueGO (Bindea et al., 2009) analysis of modules revealed significant enrichment of genes associated with DNA repair and bone resorption and remodeling (Fig. 5D). This enrichment agrees with our findings of reduced 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D during spaceflight (Fig. 5B) and also with increased urinary 8-OHdG excretion (Fig. 3C). The third major grouping of GSEA pathway hits focused on lipid biology. As stated earlier, lipid dysregulation with spaceflight originates from the liver (Beheshti et al., 2019). From our analysis of tissue pathways, lipid metabolism gene sets were upregulated in the liver and kidneys and downregulated in the eyes and adrenal gland (Fig. 6A). Also, the lipid profile in astronauts changed with spaceflight. We found higher levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, accompanied by decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Again, these levels reverted to normal after returning to Earth (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that spaceflight impacts lipid metabolism at the hepatic gene expression level, extending to the circulating lipid profile. We did not assess dietary intake before or after spaceflight. Still, it is worth noting that the spaceflight food system is limited, and astronauts’ diets differ from a nominal (earth based) diet. Our tissue-specific FBA analysis results on liver tissues from flight versus control mice in both missions identified an increase in fluxes related to carbohydrate and lipid-related metabolic factors (Fig. 6C and Table S7). Several conditions that lead to liver fibrosis are known to be marked by specifically dysregulated metabolic pathways, including significant increases in metabolites involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fructose and mannose metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, valine, leucine, isoleucine metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (citric acid) cycle metabolism (Chang and Yang, 2019). We found fluxes related to these fibrosis-related pathways significantly increased (p<0.05) in the pathways cited above (Fig. 6C).Circadian rhythm, olfactory activity, and muscle extracellular matrix (ECM)-related pathways and blood and urine parameters affected by spaceflight in vitro and in vivo Finally, our multi-omics analysis of spaceflight biology identified a grouping of pathways related to the circadian rhythm, olfactory activity, synapse/receptor signaling, and ECM (Fig. 7, Table S2 and S6). Cell cycle pathways were upregulated in all cell and tissue models except in human T cells, where these same terms were downregulated (Fig. 7A and 7B). Cell cycle dysfunction is heavily involved with all the other pathways discussed below. ECM related pathways were unaltered in the quadriceps, upregulated in SLS, EDL, GST, and TA muscles, and downregulated in the carotid artery (Fig. 7C). Circadian rhythm pathways were upregulated at the transcriptional level in all internal organs but the liver (Fig. 7C), suggesting that spaceflight impacts diurnal patterns of gene expression. Also, circadian rhythm pathways for the methylated genes were upregulated in the quadriceps and adrenal glands (Fig. 7D). Olfactory activity was also upregulated for methylated genes in the eyes, adrenal glands, kidneys, and GST muscle (Fig. 7D). Renin, an enzyme linked to vitamin D and calcium levels, significantly increased in 59 astronauts (Fig. 7E), and increases in renin impact circadian rhythm activity (Ohashi et al., 2017). Figure 7.

Details available on analysis in Figure Legend 3F.Discussion Utilizing an integrated, comprehensive, and multi-omics systems biology approach, we have uncovered insights into fundamental biological mechanisms affected by spaceflight. Our analyses suggest systemic shifts in mitochondrial function occur in spaceflight in most of the tissues we examined. Mitochondrial changes likely impact processes such as innate immunity, lipid metabolism, and gene regulation in both mice and humans, and the results from our analyses are consistent with those from previous studies (Beheshti et al., 2019; Suomalainen and Battersby, 2018) and are supported by multiple other omics studies (Bezdan et al., 2020; Gertz et al., 2020). Raising awareness for adverse health outcomes during spaceflight will help guide scientific community responses to mitigate spaceflight associated health risks and develop appropriate countermeasures. We are not the first to propose changes to mitochondrial activity during spaceflight. Nikawa and collaborators proposed a spaceflight-specific, induced mitochondrial activity alteration associated with muscle atrophy in 2004 (Nikawa et al., 2004). Another study reported decreased mitochondrial activity in the roots of space-flown soybean seedlings (Klimchuk, 2007). Low doses of radiation trigger severe mitochondrial damage (Shimura et al., 2016) and the lower diffusion rates of solutes in microgravity (Smith et al., 2009) reduce the hydrogen gradient at the mitochondrial intermembrane space, reducing electron transport chain and ATP synthesis (Nelson, 2013). Our findings report transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolomic patterns (Figs. 2 and 3) consistent with mitochondrial stress in different cells and multiple organs, including muscle tissues (Jha et al., 2017; Topf et al., 2019). Specifically, mouse ISS data (Fig. 3B), astronaut studies (Fig. 3F), and the NASA Twin Study data (Fig. 3E) all strongly support an alteration in the electron transport chain reaction and ATP production in the mitochondria. Taken as a body of evidence, this suggests spaceflight induces mitochondrial stress in multiple organisms. The existence of spaceflight-induced mitochondrial stress is further supported by metabolite studies reporting increased urinary 8-OHdG and prostaglandin F2 alpha. 8-OHdG is a biomarker of cellular oxidative stress related to DNA repair (Wu et al., 2004). Increased prostaglandin F2 alpha levels in urine are associated with oxidative stress and cyclooxygenase independent synthesis (Yin et al., 2007). These markers are consistent with our analysis suggesting mitochondrial stress and dysfunction due to oxidative stress during spaceflight (Figs. 3B, 3F, and 3G). Oxidative stress is critical to mitochondria-mediated disease processes (Wallace, 2013). The longitudinal decrease in antioxidant capacity observed in astronauts during spaceflight (Fig. 3F) agrees with the development of mitochondrial and metabolic impairment dependent on space exposure. Energy homeostasis is of great importance when considering extended duration space missions, such as the possible mission to Mars, that will last at least 560 days (Pecaut et al., 2017). Our context-specific metabolic flux analysis (Fig. 3G) further demonstrates that spaceflight upregulates NAD metabolism in the liver, linking oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Massudi et al., 2012). A time-dependent increase in oxidative stress could have cumulative effects on astronaut physiology, including impacts on cognition and the development of impairing conditions that can make the journey unviable without effective countermeasures. Future research is needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of oxidative stress on astronaut health. Increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial stress were implicated in causing androgenetic alopecia (permanent hair loss) (Ho et al., 2019; Upton et al., 2015). Our analysis from the cell line data shows hair follicles exhibit increased expression of genes related to mitochondrial activity, while other cells show reduced expression (Fig. 2A). Increases in PPARGC1α (PGC1α), similar to what we have observed in the mouse tissue (Fig. 2C), were implicated with androgenetic alopecia through oxidative stress and mitochondrial activity (Ho et al., 2019). PGC1α also interacts with PPARγ, and dysregulation of PPARγ has been shown in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) to produce similar results to scarring alopecia (i.e., hair loss disorder) (Karnik et al., 2009). An increase in ROS, as encountered in spaceflight, triggers adult stem cells differentiation, and rapidly switches to mitochondrial OXPHOS (Hamanaka et al., 2013; Ito and Suda, 2014). We hypothesize that the increase in ROS caused by the spaceflight derived mitochondria dysfunction causes the shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS, increasing HFSC mitochondrial activity, and a potential mechanism to explain astronaut hair grown inhibition. Skeletal muscle also depends on OXPHOS for energy production (Kelley et al., 2002) reported to play a role in regulating metabolism (Argiles et al., 2016; Pratesi et al., 2013). The loss of skeletal muscle alters whole-body metabolism (Argiles et al., 2016). Microgravity-induced muscle degeneration is well reported (Demontis et al., 2017; Nikawa et al., 2004). The reduction of muscle metabolic flux when comparing between FLT vs GC vs the opposite result in liver (Figs. 3G, 6C, and 6D) may be due to the liver’s response to muscle wasting (sarcopenia). Sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) cohorts, independent of obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance (Koo et al., 2017). A recent comprehensive meta-analysis across similar studies found increased risks of NAFLD and liver fibrosis in subjects with sarcopenia (Cai et al., 2020). It is also interesting to note that opposite trends in mitochondrial activity in liver and muscle are common in subjects with prediabetes or diabetes type 2 (Bhansali et al., 2017; Pottecher et al., 2018). We suggest that muscle loss may relate to the increased metabolic flux changes in spaceflight for the mouse liver versus muscle, an area for future research. Our data indicate an overall dysregulation in lipid metabolism caused by the space environment, with particular attention to the liver being the body’s central metabolic organ and where LDL is produced (Nelson, 2013). We observed lipid metabolism pathways altered in mice and humans exposed to the space environment (Fig. 6). However, since no lipid pathway changes were observed in cell line data, we suggest lipid metabolism changes are derived from complex interactions at the tissue and organ levels. Two mouse strains were previously found to have accumulated lipids in the liver due to spaceflight exposure (Beheshti et al., 2019). Besides, lipid-related metabolic pathways were increased in the liver of the spaceflight mice (Fig 6C). Increased tryptophan, valine, leucine, isoleucine, TCA cycle, sphingolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolites are reported in the development and onset of fibrosis, with valine and bile acid synthesis related to more advanced stages (Chang and Yang, 2019; Musso et al., 2018). The lipid/glycolytic metabolic flux imbalance occurring in liver for mice flown to space-related to the onset of fibrosis is directly involved with the mitochondrial process, which involves modulation of oxidative phosphorylation (Diamond et al., 2007) (Fig. 3B). Also, inflammation leads to changes in lipid metabolism, and the persistence of the inflammatory stimulus can lead to chronic lipid changes associated with metabolic syndrome (Esteve et al., 2005). Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction is both a cause and a consequence of metabolic disorders (Bhatti et al., 2017). Spaceflight induced dyslipidemia in mice and astronauts (Schmidt et al., 2020) can be one contributor to cardiovascular health risks during longer-term space missions (Stein et al., 2019). It is also well established that cardiovascular risk is related to lipid disorders (Stein et al., 2019) and associations between dysregulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism and poor cardiac health are common (Meyers et al., 2013). The renin-angiotensin system induces hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, culminating in cell death (Siasos et al., 2018). As we found, in the case of renin (Fig. 7E), the hormones in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were reported as increased in spaceflight (Hughson et al., 2018). Early in 2020, the first occurrence of venous thrombosis was reported during spaceflight (Aunon-Chancellor et al., 2020). Limited knowledge exists for the effects of spaceflight on platelets (Vernice et al., 2020). However, mitochondrial dysfunction attenuates platelet survival and increased risk for thrombovascular events (Kunz et al., 2017; Melchinger et al., 2019), increasing stroke risk (Behrouzi and Punter, 2018). Mitochondrial dysfunction may cause stroke-like episodes independent of hypoxia (Ng et al., 2019). Therefore, spaceflight-induced mitochondrial dysfunction could increase cardiovascular disease risk in long-term missions caused by microgravity cardiovascular deconditioning and space radiation (Hughson et al., 2018). Cardiovascular disease is also linked to mitochondrial dysfunction through proteostasis failure related to lipid accumulation and ROS activity (Alam et al., 2020; Arrieta et al., 2020). Alterations in ribosome assembly, mitochondrial, and cytosol translation pathway in the cell models, internal organs, and muscles (Figs. 2 and 3) suggest the presence of proteostasis failure (Lu and Guo, 2020). Proteostasis refers to the maintenance of the proteome homeostasis by protein synthesis, folding, and degradation. Proteostasis failure occurs in C. elegans in response to spaceflight, although it was not clear if this response was due only to muscle wasting (Honda et al., 2012). Alterations in proteostasis were widespread in our cell models and internal organ tissues (Fig. 2). Mitochondrial dysfunction inhibits cytosolic protein synthesis and defective protein quality control (Lu and Guo, 2020; Topf et al., 2019). Since mitochondrial function can prevent age-related proteostasis collapse (Williams et al., 2020), we suggest countermeasures focused on re-establishing the mitochondrial function will also recuperate the proteostasis condition. Interestingly, proteostasis loss is a hallmark of aged muscles (Fernando et al., 2019). Lipid metabolism changes can also be caused by inflammation (Esteve et al., 2005) which is related to our observed markers for innate immunity with dysregulation of adaptive immunity occurring during spaceflight, consistent with an increased innate immunity profile on spaceflight (Crucian et al., 2018). The complement system and pathways related to IFN-γ and IFN-α change in the internal organs (Fig. 4B). Mitochondrial debris were observed in blood in the Twin Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) and mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate innate immune pathways (Banoth and Cassel, 2018; Zhang et al., 2010). We found a similar pattern with IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF-α up-regulation within muscle tissues and astronaut blood (Figs. 4 and 5B). Interestingly, we also found altered proteasome expression linked to innate immunity (Table S6). IFN-γ can induce a switch to aerobic glycolysis and has a significant role in proteasome regulation (Wang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 1992), linking mitochondrial dysfunction, innate immunity, and alterations in proteostasis. IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF-α are known to be drivers of muscle wasting in chronic inflammatory diseases (Londhe and Guttridge, 2015). Vitamin D can modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses as the vitamin D receptor is expressed on B cells, T cells, antigen-presenting cells, and dendritic cells (Aranow, 2011). The lower levels of 1,25 Vitamin D and higher IL-1 and IGF-1 levels measured from 59 astronauts are consistent with findings at the cellular and tissue levels (Fig. 5). Adequate energy, protein, and vitamin D supply are essential for bone mineral density maintenance after six months of spaceflight (Smith et al., 2012b). Astronauts had a decrease in 1,25 vitamin D levels (the active form of vitamin D) (Fig. 5B) consistent with other studies (Smith et al., 2005) Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation prevents 1,25 vitamin D loss, leading NASA to increase the vitamin D supplementation to 1000 IU/d (Douglas, 2020). Vitamin D3 is modified through the mitochondria in the liver and kidney to assume its active form, 1,25 vitamin D (Bikle, 2014). Synthetic active vitamin D analogs may not help increase the health risks already associated with spaceflight such as hypercalcemia, kidney stone formation, and ectopic calcification (Nicogossian et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2015). Immune dysregulation is known to be strongly influenced by the cell cycle (Laphanuwat and Jirawatnotai, 2019). We found that cell cycle-associated genes were affected by spaceflight in both the in vitro and in vivo models (Fig. 7). Spaceflight caused an increased expression of cell cycle genes in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and the hair follicles, but these genes were down-regulated in T cells (Fig. 7A). Intracellular ROS enhances fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and hair follicles cell proliferation (Day and Suzuki, 2006; Hamanaka et al., 2013). However, ROS causes T cell cycle arrest (Belikov et al., 2015; Yan and Banerjee, 2010) and T cell activation/proliferation requires a reducing extracellular microenvironment (Yan and Banerjee, 2010). Cell cycle and mitochondrial activity directly control circadian rhythm in cells and organisms (Sardon Puig et al., 2018). Sleep disorders are common in astronauts (Wu et al., 2018) and patients with primary mitochondrial diseases (Ramezani and Stacpoole, 2014). Intriguingly, we have found alterations in circadian cycle on internal organs, particularly in the eyes. In this study, the mice in space and ground control were maintained in a 12/12 light/dark cycle. They were not subjected to any workload activities that commonly impact astronauts, which rules out both possible causes for this alteration. A return to mitochondrial homeostasis could help restore a healthy awake/sleep cycle in astronauts. The methylated genes demonstrated olfactory activity pathways upregulation in multiple tissues (Fig. 7D). The olfactory bulb pathways are closely linked to circadian rhythm affecting feeding times (Pavlovski et al., 2018) and immune functions (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016). Additionally, mitochondrial Ca(2+) is a critical element in olfactory signaling (Fluegge et al., 2012) and in astronauts, smelling behavior changes occur potentially due to microgravity causing an upward shift of body fluid (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016). Olfactory signaling has even been directly linked to mitochondrial structure and glucose activity (Kovach et al., 2016), indicating we have uncovered a systemic impact on the body driven by the mitochondria. G proteins are ubiquitous inside cells and play an essential role in circadian regulation (Doi et al., 2011). They also regulate a wide range of cellular processes, including a significant role in synapse formation and elimination, affecting memory formation (Leung and Wong, 2017; Ye and Carew, 2010). We identified potential alterations in receptor signaling in our cell models due to changes in the expression of several G protein-linked signal transduction genes (Figs. 1A, 4A, 7A, and Table S6). Interesting, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) was reported to act as a gatekeeper of mitochondrial function in the heart, and the inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) preserved mitochondrial function after myocardial infarction (Chen et al., 2020; Sorriento et al., 2019). In addition, G proteins are heavily involved with the renin-angiotensin system, with the activation of G proteins resulting in similar increases to the renin levels we observed (Fig. 7E). (Balakumar and Jagadeesh, 2014). The potential of targeting G protein-coupled receptor signaling as a spaceflight countermeasure should be investigated further. Countermeasures for spaceflight consist of procedures or nutritional and therapeutic interventions to counteract the adverse effects of spaceflight on the human body, maintain health, reduce risk, and improve safety (Clément, 2011). The principal countermeasure applied to astronauts is exercise; astronauts onboard the ISS exercise for up to 2 hours per day, but there is still a considerable decrease in muscle mass, and bone loss observed after landing (Clément, 2011). Exercise also counteracts the effect of microgravity on the cardiovascular system; nonetheless, neither exercise intensity nor duration showed sufficient to prevent vascular changes as increased arterial and intima-media thickness, cardiac atrophy, and the development of insulin resistance (Hughson et al., 2018). A study on acute exercise in individuals with a spectrum of insulin resistance showed that acute physical activity triggers molecular responses on the metabolic and energy-producing pathways, increasing glycolysis, TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation (Contrepois et al., 2020). In comparison, our results show an overall decrease in the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism in the muscle tissue based on the metabolic flux analysis (Fig. 6D). At the same time, these factors increase in the liver (Fig. 6C), indicating exercise may not be enough to counteract the stressors in space. With exercise currently utilized as an inflight countermeasure, the increases of acute inflammatory markers seen during exercise (e.g., IL-6, TNF-a, IL1-RA, and IGF-1) could be problematic to an already increased inflammatory pattern we measured in astronauts (Fig. 5B), even though these markers are reduced by regular exercise in low-grade systemic inflammation patients (Contrepois et al., 2020; Khazaei, 2012). In addition to exercise, pharmacotherapy and nutritional interventions used in patients with mitochondrial dysfunction should be considered for future spaceflight countermeasures. An essential aspect of astronauts’ metabolic health is consuming the recommended energy intake consisting of carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. The field of nutritional mitochondrial therapeutics is still evolving, with some evidence pointing to effective treatments (Camp et al., 2016; Rinninella et al., 2018). The strongest candidate is the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) that should be administered to the majority of primary mitochondrial diseases (PMD), independent of CoQ10 deficiency (Camp et al., 2016). CoQ10 is an abundant lipid-soluble nutrient scavenging free radical and protecting cells against oxidative damage (Zhang et al., 2018). CoQ10 is currently being tested on the ISS as a countermeasure for retinal lesions, and data from this project could help elucidate if CoQ10 could be used as a more general intervention (Lulli et al., 2019). In summary, the effects of spaceflight on the mitochondria provides a unifying framework for integrating the various alterations observed in the astronauts. Reduced mitochondrial function with sustained calories would generate excess mitochondrial ROS and activate compensatory mtDNA replication, resulting in increased mtDNA transcripts. The combination of replicating mtDNA and ROS would oxidize the mtDNA, which would be released to activate the innate immune system inflammasome and the Type I interferon pathway (West and Shadel, 2017; Zhong et al., 2018). The reduced NADH and radiation-induced DNA damage would reduce NAD+ levels (Fig. 3G), which would impair the circadian rhythm system through perturbed Sirt1 regulation of BMAL acetylation (Nakahata et al., 2008). Alteration in mitochondrial protein production would activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Fig. 7A), which would trigger the integrated stress response pathway (Fig. 3C), causing phosphorylation of the cytosolic initiation factor eIF2α. This would activate the ATF4 transcription factor to upregulate expression of FGF21 and GDF15 and induce the mitochondrial supercomplex assembly factor SCAF1 (Balsa et al., 2019a; Khan et al., 2017a). Finally, inhibiting the electron transport chain (Fig. 3G) would alter the mitochondrial metabolites, which serve as the substrates for the epigenome modification enzymes (Kopinski et al., 2019). Overall, this work highlights the power of comparing and integrating multiple omics and data types to understand further how life adapts to spaceflight conditions and risks. We found mitochondrial dysregulation as a central hub for space biology. This concept can guide new nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions and studies that will increase the viability of long-term human-crewed space missions. Health effects from mitochondrial dysfunction should be considered with spaceflight health risk models when planning future human-crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.STAR★Methods RESOURCE AVAILABILITY Lead Contact Further information and request for resources, data and code availability should be directed to the corresponding author Afshin Beheshti (afshin.beheshti@nasa.gov).Materials Availability This study did not generate new unique reagents.Data and Code Availability The published article includes the WGCNA code generated and analyzed during this study in Methods S1.

Since these experiments were previously done by others and data is publicly available on GeneLab, all experimental details for these mouse models can be found on GeneLab in the description section for each dataset. Rodent Research-9 (RR-9) mission tissues were utilized for metabolomic analysis of the medial head of the gastrocnemius, and the quadriceps femoris (“quadriceps”) on male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) that spent ~34 days in microgravity aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the RR-9 mission in August, 2017, that launched as part of the SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services (CRS)-12 mission. Seven days prior to launch (L-7d), 9-week old mice were grouped as mice to be sent to ISS (Flight; n=10); or ground-based habitat controls placed within in environmental chambers replicating the environmental conditions for the Flight mice aboard ISS (Habitat; n=10). Unberthing from ISS and splashdown of live mice occurred on L+34d, and the live mice were collected by the science teams on L +35d for behavioral and functional testing, as well as tissue harvest. The gastrocnemius and quadriceps remained attached to the left hind limb after removal of the limb from the body by disarticulation at the acetabulum. The femur and tibia were disarticulated, the gastrocnemius was cut at the Achilles tendon, and both muscles remained attached to the femur which was then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80°C until tissues were removed for metabolomic analysis. All animal procedures performed in these experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) for flight at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and the methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. For both RR-1 and RR-3 missions, as stated above we utilized publicly available data available on GeneLab. The authors of this manuscript did not conduct the actual rodent research. Regardless, we have provided the specific details for both of the original experiments for the readers convenience. The following is a description of the for the RR-1 mission, as described on NASA Life Sciences and data archive (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/document/doc_detail/Doc13600): “Twenty adult female mice were launched Sept 21, 2014 in RR hardware within a Dragon Capsule (SpaceX-4) as the flight group (FLT), then after 4 days in transit, were transferred for habitation on the ISS for a total time in space of 37–38 days (10 validation mice), when animals were euthanized and select tissues recovered on orbit. Three control groups at Kennedy Space Center consisted of: 1) Basal mice from the same cohorts as FLT mice euthanized at the time of launch, 2) Vivarium (VIV) controls housed in standard vivarium cages, and 3) Ground Controls (GC) housed in RR flight hardware within an environment chamber that controlled temperature, CO2 and humidity to ISS levels. The health and behavior of all mice on the ISS were monitored by video feed on a daily basis. Mice were euthanized by injection of Euthasol, then either fast frozen intact or dissected to preserve livers (fast frozen) and spleens (RNAlater™). Samples were stored at = −80°C until their return to Earth for later analyses.” The following is a description of the for the RR-3 mission, as described on NASA Life Sciences and data archive (https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/13961): “The RR3 payload consisted of twenty female BALB/c mice that were approximately twelve weeks old. The mice were carried to ISS in a transporter aboard SpaceX Commercial Resupply Mission 8 Dragon cargo spacecraft (SpaceX-8, CRS-8). Dragon docked with the station on April 10, 2016 and by April 12 the animals were transferred aboard the station. Once onboard, they were divided into two groups of ten and housed in habitats for six weeks. Approximately one hour of video per day showing animal health and behavior was recorded in each habitat during the mission. Dissections were conducted over four days at thirty-nine to forty-two days in microgravity. Each dissection day consisted of five animals being dissected. Following euthanasia, blood was extracted via cardiac puncture, separated by centrifugation, and frozen. Right hind limbs were dissected and fixed in four percent paraformaldehyde, and carcasses were frozen. The frozen tissue samples were stored in the minus eighty degree freezer (MELFI). Hardware and tissue samples were returned to Earth for recovery and post-flight analyses. Biospecimens were delivered to CASIS.” Ground controls were conducted on a three-day delay at Kennedy Space Center in ISS environmental simulators (ISSESs) programmed with data from the Dragon capsule and the ISS cabin. Based on post-flight analysis of the RR-2 Habitat telemetry data, the ISSESs were programmed to be two degrees Celsius higher than the ISS cabin data; the result of this off-set was that the internal temperatures of the ground control habitats matched the flight Habitats closely for most of the experiment.” In Vitro Models All data related to the in vitro experiments were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab platform (https://genelab.nasa.gov/) from the following dataset identifiers: GLDS-13, GLDS-52, GLDS-54, GLDS-114, GLDS-118, and GLDS-174. All detailed information on the cell lines are available on the description for each dataset. Here also will provide a brief description of the cell lines and experiments contained in each dataset. The GLDS-174 data set includes a total of 60 samples from 10 individual astronauts. Six hair follicle samples were collected at six timepoints with two pre-spaceflight, two in-spaceflight and two post-spaceflight. The GLDS-52 data set includes a total of six samples from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Samples were collected in triplicate for flight or ground treatments. The GLDS-114 data set includes a total of 15 samples from human fibroblasts. The GLDS-118 data set includes a total of 6 samples from human fibroblasts. The GLDS-13 data set includes a total of 6 samples from human T cells. The GLDS-54 data set includes a total of 12 samples from human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). Samples were collected in duplicate at three timepoints (0, 4, and 8 hours) during ground or spaceflight with or without treatment with LPS.Human data Data are reported from three human subject experiments conducted on the International Space Station: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006–2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Spaceflight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013–2018). All protocols were reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent. While subsets of some of these data have been published in other papers (Crucian et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2015), as a whole, the data provided here have not been previously published. Crews from these experiments had missions of 4–6 months in duration, and these studies included blood and urine collections before, during, and after flight, with analysis of an array of nutritional and biochemical markers. Blood and urine samples were collected 2 or 3 times before flight: approximately Launch minus (L-) 180 days and L-45 days. In some cases, a third blood sample was collected (typically along with the L-45 collection), and these tubes were centrifuged and frozen for aliquoting after flight batched with the samples collected inflight. Blood samples were collected inflight, at approximately Flight Day (FD) 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180. Postflight samples were collected in the first 24-h after landing (designated return+0, R+0) and again 30-d later (R+30). The R+0 samples were not necessarily fasting, given the time of day and nature of return from flight. Of the 59 crewmembers reported herein: 8 returned on the Space Shuttle, with blood collection 2–4 hours after landing; 51 landed in Kazakhstan, with 7 of them returning to Star City, Russia, with blood collection 8–10 hours after landing; 44 were transported directly back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, with blood collection approximately 24-h after landing. Pre and postflight collections included two 24-h urine collections, and inflight collections included one 24-h urine collection. These collection techniques have been previously described (Smith et al., 2012a; Zwart et al., 2011). We report here vitamins and metabolites, oxidative stress and damage markers, inflammatory markers and cytokines, liver enzymes and endocrine indices. These were analyzed using standard techniques as reported previously (Crucian et al., 2014; Zwart et al., 2016; Zwart et al., 2013; Zwart et al., 2009). As of this writing, data were available for 59 crewmembers (47 male, 12 female). Age at launch was 47.0 ± 5.6 y, body mass at launch was 79.2 ± 11.8 kg (M: 83.3 ± 9.3; F: 63.0 ± 4.5). Body mass index was 25.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2 (M: 26.4 ± 2.6; F: 22.3 ± 1.5). All available data are reported here, although the reported n for any given test or session varies for a number of reasons, including: not all experiments had all analytes included, mission length differences for some crewmembers, schedule or other issues occasionally precluded sample collection, and methods changes over time. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p<0.001 are reported.METHOD DETAILS RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, and Proteomics For all RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, and proteomics datasets being utilized for this manuscript the data was gathered from the GeneLab platform. All information and details for sample preparation, library construction, and sequencing is available in the descriptions for that particular GeneLab dataset and the GLDS identifier is available in the Key Resource Table.RNA-sequence on Twin Study Samples Longitudinal samples were collected from a male astronaut aboard the International Space Station and his identical twin on Earth during a 340 day mission including 6 months preflight and 6 months postflight follow-up, for total of 19 timepoints for the flight subject and 13 timepoints for the ground subject. Blood was collected using CPT vacutainers (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. For full details of sample separation, processing see (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Briefly, samples collected on ISS were either frozen in −80°C after separation of mononuclear cells by centrifugation (referred to as CPT), or returned to Earth in 4°C in a Soyuz capsule and sorted into CD4, CD8, CD19 populations and a lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction. Samples collected on Earth were either frozen for mononuclear cells or processed when fresh for sorted cell populations. To correct for the effects of ambient temperature exposure on RNA (approximately 36 hours including landing and repatriation) control samples were created by simulating similar conditions to those that may occur during the ambient return and were compared to fresh blood collections from the same individual. RNA extraction, library prep and sequencing were completed per (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) using both ribodepletion or polyA selection kits.Metabolomic profiling All reagents were of LC-MS grade. Approximately 10 mg of tissue from RR9 (gastrocnemius and quadricep, habitat and flight) were added in a siliconized microcentrifuge tube, followed by addition of 300 μl of chilled 50%:50% methanol:water, containing 4 μM debrisoquine sulfate, 30 μM 4-nitrobenzoic acid, and 5 μM chlorpropamide as internal standards. All samples were randomized. The tissues were homogenized, followed by sonication for 10 sec. 10 μl was removed for protein quantification through a micro BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm at 4°C and the supernatant was transferred to a clean siliconized microcentrifuge tube. Chilled 50%:50% acetonitrile:water (300 μl) was added to the pellet and vortexed thoroughly. Following a 15 min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged again and the supernatant combined with the one previously obtained. The samples were vacuum dried and resuspended in 200 μl of 50%:50% methanol:water, without internal standards, and vortexed thoroughly. Samples were further filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and subsequently transferred to a glass mass spectrometry vial. 2 μl of each sample was injected in a BEH C18 column, 130 Å, 1.7 μm at 60°C and analyzed with a Waters Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system coupled to a time-of-flight Xevo G2S mass spectrometry (MS) instrument, operated in MSE mode. The chromatographic and MS conditions are presented in Table S4. A quality control sample was also generated by pooling together 5 μl from each sample, injected every 10 samples. Initial mass accuracy was determined with a metmix mixture of 6 chemicals that ionize in both modes (acetaminophen, sulfaguanidine, sulfadimethoxine, Val-Tyr-Val, terfenadine, and leucine enkephalin). Mass correction and accuracy was achieved throughout the whole run with intermittent injections of leucine enkephalin as LockSpray™. Positive identification of candidate metabolites was performed through tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with ramping collision energy 10–40 eV with pure chemicals and cross-validation of MS/MS spectra through METLIN or HMDB (spectra shown in Figs. S4–S6). All raw data is available on NASA’s GeneLab platform with identifier: GLDS-343 and DOI: 10.26030/h968-2m75.Real-time PCR (rtPCR) on NASA Twin study samples A summary of the samples used for the rtPCR analysis is found in Table S5. The whole-blood cell fractions (CPT) was used for isolating RNA and rtPCR. 100ng RNA per sample was reverse transcribed using the iScript Advanced cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The synthesized cDNA was diluted 1:4 in water and quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate with the Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Thermo-Fisher) using the QuantStudio 6 Flex RT-PCR system. The sequences of primers used for RT-qPCR were: MT-RNR1: F - ATGCAGCTCAAAACGCTTAGC; R - GCTGGCACGAAATTGACCAA MT-RNR2: F - CCCTGTACGAAAGGACAAGAGAAAT; R - TCTTGGGTGGGTGTGGGTATAAT MT-CO1: F - CAGCAGTCCTACTTCTCCTATCTCT; R - GGGTCGAAGAAGGTGGTGTT MT-CO2: F - GCCCTTTTCCTAACACTCACAACAA; R - GTAAAGGATGCGTAGGGATGGG MT-ND1: F - CCCTAAAACCCGCCACATCT; R - GGCTAGAATAAATAGGAGGCCTAGGT 18S rRNA: F - GGCCCTGTAATTGGAATGAGTC; R - CCAAGATCCAACTACGAGCTT GAPDH: F - AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAAC; R - GGGGTCATTGATGGCAACAATA. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS In vitro microarray data analysis Background correction and quantile normalization, differential gene expression was performed using LIMMA (Ritchie et al., 2015). All the datasets were compared with “Flight vs Ground Control” samples. The product of the log10(p-value) and fold change were used to create a preranked gene list for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005). Pathway analysis was performed using GSEA and gene sets were visualized using the EnrichmentMap plugin (Merico et al., 2010) for Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003).RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, and Proteomics For all RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, and proteomics datasets being utilized for this manuscript the data was gathered from the GeneLab platform. All information and details for sample preparation, library construction, and sequencing is available in the descriptions for that particular GeneLab dataset.RNA-sequence Data Analysis on Murine Samples RNASeq Analysis included 1) data validation and quality control with FASTQC and Trim Galore!, 2) read alignment to the mice genome using STAR RNA-seq aligner (Dobin et al., 2013), and 3) generation of gene-level expected count data with RSEM (Dobin et al., 2013). The list of software and its versions is as follow: FASTQC version 0.11.8, Trim Galore! Version 0.50, STAR version STAR_2.6.1a_08–27, mice genome version mm10-GRCm38, RSEM version 1.3.1. The quality of the sequencing step was evaluated with FASTQC, Trim Galore was used to pre-process the expression data trimming Illumina standard adapters sequences and nucleotides with a quality phred score below 33. For Differential Expression (DE) analysis, R Version 3.5.1 and DESeq2 Version 1.22.2 (Love et al., 2014) were used. Expected counts from RSEM step were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. A gene was considered differentially expressed with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 when using the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment procedure for false discovery rate (FDR) corrections.WGCNA Analysis on GLDS-168 Liver Tissue Count data used for Deseq2 analysis were prepared for WGCNA by normalizing using the TMM method in NoiSeq. WGCNA was then performed on the expression data, using Pearson correlation. Modules were then correlated against radiation status. Significant modules were then extracted and subjected to topGO gene enrichment analysis. A detailed R script for the WGCNA procedure is included in the supplementary methods (Method S1).RNA-sequence Data Analysis on Twin Study Samples Generated sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! (v0.4.1) and quantified to genes using kallisto on ENSEMBL transcripts (Bray et al., 2016). Differentially expressed genes were called using DESeq2 on each cell type separately by comparing preflight, inflight and postflight groups, controlling for the normal biological variance within the 24 months using the longitudinal data of the ground twin and using the simulated ambient control samples as another covariate for sorted cells (Love et al., 2014). Mitochondrial specific analysis on the Twin Study RNA-seq was done by finding the overlapping significantly regulated genes (FDR < 0.05) to mitochondrial genes determined from MitoCarta (Calvo et al., 2015). Heatmap was displayed using pheatmap (Kolde, 2015).Methylation Data Analysis Raw DNA methylation data was retrieved from the NASA GeneLab Data System (“GLDS”) website for all datasets that contained whole genome bisulfite data (GLDS-47, 48, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 137, 161, and 163). Each sample was aligned using bwa-meth version 0.2.2 (Pedersen et al., 2014) with default settings against an in silico bisulfite-converted mm10 Mus musculus reference genome. Alignments were de-duplicated using Picard MarkDuplicates v2.10.10-SNAPSHOT with default settings (Thomer et al., 2016). MethylDackel mbias (Ogoh et al., 2018) was used on each sample to determine regions of inclusion for each aligned read, in order to correct for methylation bias at the ends of reads. MethylDackel extract was then implemented using mBias-informed inclusion parameters to calculate per-base methylation. Finally, for each methylation call set, strands were merged using MethylDackel mergeContext and a minimum 10x coverage threshold was implemented per CpG. Differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) between the “flight” and “ground” samples were called for each dataset using methylKit (Akalin et al., 2012) with a logistic regression model. CpGs that had SLIM adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were taken as significant (Wang et al., 2011). Further, differentially methylated genes were identified by taking the median methylation around the promoter of each gene (transcription start site ±250bp), converting it to a M-value by logit function transform, and using limma (Ritchie et al., 2015) to call statistical significance. Genes with adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were taken as significantly differentially methylated. For gene set enrichment analysis these genes were ranked by the degree of methylation difference (log2 fold-change of the M-values) from hyper-methylated to hypo-methylated and were used as inputs to GSEA (Sergushichev, 2016; Subramanian et al., 2005) using MSigDB and MGI phenotypes signature databases (Finger et al., 2017; Liberzon, 2014; Liberzon et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2018) (Figs. 1, 2D, 5A, 7D and Table S3). Relationship between absolute methylation and expression was calculated by taking the base median expression for all genes in each dataset and correlating it to the median promoter methylation of that gene. Significance of the relationship between the methylation change and expression change was calculated by taking the log2 fold-change values for gene expression and methylation and fitting a linear model.Protein identification, quantification, and data analysis Peptide and protein identification and quantification was performed with MaxQuant (1.6.2.3) (Tyanova et al., 2016a) using a mouse reference database from Uniprot (downloaded on 20180104) (Tyanova et al., 2016a). The type of experiment was set to Reporter ion MS3 with 10plex TMT labeling. Propionamide of Cys was defined as a fixed modification and Oxidation of Met and Acetylation of protein N-terminal were set as variable modifications. Trypsin/P was selected as the digestion enzyme, and a maximum of 3 labeled amino acids and 2 missed cleavages per peptide were allowed. The False Discovery Rate for peptides and proteins were set at 1%. Fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.5 Da. The MS/MS tolerance was set at 20 ppm. The minimum peptide length was set at 7 amino acids. The rest of the parameters in MaxQuant were kept as default. The generated results by MaxQuant was further processed by PTXQC for quality control analysis (Bielow et al., 2016). Perseus (1.6.2.2) (Tyanova et al., 2016b) and in-house R scripts were used for proteomics data processing and statistical analysis (Tyanova et al., 2016b). The corrected reporter intensity values generated by MaxQuant were used to analyze the TMT-based proteomics data. Protein groups containing matches to decoy database or contaminants were discarded. Total ion intensity for each reporter ion channel were calculated and matched to correct for the sample loads in each TMT experiment. Only proteins that were quantified in the pooled samples were used for the analysis. Subsequently, internal reference scaling (IRS) method was employed to normalize protein intensities between different TMT runs using common proteins in pooled internal standards (Plubell et al., 2017). The data was log2 transformed and scaled by subtracting the median for each sample. LIMMA was employed to determine differentially protein abundance between groups and volcano plots were generated using EnhancedVolcano package (Bioconductor) to visualize the affected proteins (Ritchie et al., 2015). The affected proteins with p-value of less than 0.05 and log fold change of greater than 1.0 or less than −1.0 were considered significant. Differentially abundant proteins (with p-value < 0.05) were selected for GO term and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using NCI DAVID (Huang da et al., 2009). The categories with p-value of 0.05 or less were considered as significant. Top 4 most significant GO terms and KEGG pathways for each sample were reported in the text.Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Count data from datasets GLDS-161, GLDS-162, GLDS-163 and GLDS-168 described above were annotated to gene symbols, Rounded-up for the next integer and normalized by the variance stabilizing variation method using DEseq2 version 1.20.0 and R version 3.5.1. All the datasets were compared with “Flight vs Ground Control” samples, the ranked list of genes were defined by the signal-to-noise metric, and the statistical significance were determined by 1000 permutations of the genesets (Subramanian et al., 2005). Genesets using Gene Ontology terms - Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component - and KEGG pathways were run separately (Ashburner et al., 2000).Network maps for cross-omics and cross-tissue analysis Pathway results were integrated across multiple tissues and RNAseq and proteomics platforms to summarize the system-wide effects of spaceflight compared to ground control. Enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were integrating using a network framework, where two pathways are connected by an edge if they share a significant fraction of genes (similar to EnrichmentMap). Pathways dysregulated in two or more tissues are displayed. Pathway up and down regulation is encoded by node color, and pathways dysregulated by multiple tissues are mapped to larger node size.Metabolomic profiling and analysis Chromatographic deconvolution was conducted with the software Progenesis QI, which also allowed for normalization of the data with the function “normalize to all compounds” (http://www.nonlinear.com/progenesis/qi/v2.0/faq/how-normalisation-works.aspx). Statistical analysis for potential biomarker identification was conducted with the software MetaboLyzer (Mak et al., 2014). Complete presence ions with a ≥75% presence in both control (habitat) and experimental (flight) group were analyzed with the non-parametric Mann Whitney U test, while samples with <75% presence with the Barnard’s test. Outliers were removed via 1.5 IQR base filtering, zero abundance values were removed from the analysis, and a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.1 was applied. Putative identities were assigned through the databases Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2014) with <10 ppm error (Table S4). Graphical representation of putative biomarkers was conducted through GraphPad Prism and p-values were calculated with one-way ANOVA testing with Tukey’s multiple comparisons testing. All data are represented as scatter plots, with mean±standard error of the mean (SEM). A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Pathway enrichment was conducted through the software MetaboAnalyst (Chong et al., 2018). Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were constructed with the software Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector (GEDI) (Eichler et al., 2003).Metabolic modeling and downstream statistical analyses Tissue-specific metabolic models per sample were generated with Corda (Schultz and Qutub, 2016) on the selected tissue data with global flux confidence parameters determined by minimizing within-group flux standard deviation: (40, 10, 50, 0, 0). Flux balance analysis (FBA) was performed in a Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3 (with Python 3.7.6) environment (Kluyver et al., 2016) with the cobrapy package (Ebrahim et al., 2013) on the imm1415 metabolic model (Sigurdsson et al., 2010) optimizing for NAD biosynthesis using Gurobi solver as LP (Gurobi Optimization, L. L. C. (2020). Gurobi Optimizer Reference Manual. http://www.gurobi.com). Specifically, the capacity of NAD biosynthesis through all pathways in mouse is simulated by optimizing the flux of the cytosolic NAD demand reaction in the iMM1415 model(Chowdhry et al. 2019 and Liu et al 2018). In order to include reactions that may not be completely represented from the transcription data, we required the model to include essential pathways ‘Oxidative Phosphorylation’, ‘ROS Detoxification’,’Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis’, ‘Citric Acid Cycle’,’CoA Biosynthesis’,’CoA Catabolism’,’Biomass and maintenance functions’,’NAD Metabolism’,’Fatty Acid Metabolism’,’Fatty acid activation’,’Fatty acid elongation’, and ‘Fatty acid oxidation’. All metabolic models were analyzed using these identical parameters, except for the transcriptional data input per sample. Results from the FBA analyses on each sample were reported as fluxes that were then analyzed as grouped variables between the flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) groups. Flux heatmaps using row-wise Z-scores on the FBA results are shown for liver (Figs. 3G and 6C) and muscle (Figs. 3G and 6D). Fluxes in FLT and GC groups were compared using the non-parametric Van der Waerden (VdW) test as we cannot assume normality nor equality of variance between the groups, using the R matrixTests package (v. 0.1.9). Resulting VdW p-values were not adjusted for multiple testing correction because of the likelihood of over-penalization of strongly dependent fluxes in and between pathways. P-values were considered as significant at p < 0.05 (black squares in Fig. 6) and suggestive at 0.05 < p < 0.1 (grey squares in Fig. 6). Data and scripts related to the post-FBA statistical analyses can be found at https://osf.io/utmwf/. Flux levels and results from statistical analyses per flux can be found in the Supplementary Materials (Table S7).Quantitative Response to Spaceflight - Global view of the data For each assay, the overall average level of up and down regulated molecules across all species and strains was computed and use to normalize the individual levels of up and down regulated gene/protein/small molecules (metabolome) by dividing by the average of each assay. Note that regulation here refers to comparing Flight samples versus Ground samples, and thus reflects changes happening in space. For example, Liver data were recorded for both RR1 (C57BL/6) and RR3 (Balb/C) missions for both proteomics and transcriptomics. Thus, the reported value for liver for up-regulation is the average expression measured for liver in both lineages divided by the total average level of gene or protein expression reported here across both strains of mice. Such approach gives an overall view of the various dataset simplifying the identification of tissue systematically up or down regulated for individual assays across all assays, without suffering from absolute regulation levels which vary greatly between assays. Specifically, for the analysis for Figs 1A and B we listed the average number of genes/proteins/metabolome that were up or down regulated across all tissue listed. For example, on average, there were 106 and 37 Proteins up and down regulated respectively, with an overall average of 71. The plotted values are normalized to the overall average (i.e. 71). For example, for gene expression, there is an average of 974 genes regulated (average up: 969, average down: 980). In the case of human fibroblasts, values for either up or down regulated genes were about 5, which implies 5 × 974 genes = 4870 genes for each direction. In contrast, a value of 0.574 and 0.845 for up and down for T cells was found, corresponding to 0.574 × 974 = 560 and 0.845 × 974 = 833 respectively. Such scaling was necessary to show the relative amount of changes between tissue and across all assay, without suffering from very distinct level of expression between assays. In the case of protein, we reported the average number of proteins being detected for all groups. Across all tissues, on average across tissue, we had 2980 proteins and 27109 genes detected. Thus, 969 up regulated genes correspond to 3.6% of all detected genes and 37 down regulated proteins corresponds to 1.3% of all detected proteins.Supplementary Material 1Figure S1.

However, the space environment presents stressors that include radiation, microgravity, and isolation. Understanding how these factors affect biology is crucial for safe and effective crewed space exploration. There is a need to develop countermeasures, to adapt plants and microbes for nutrient sources and bioregenerative life support, and to limit pathogen infection. Scientists across the world are conducting space omics experiments on model organisms and, more recently, on humans. Optimal extraction of actionable scientific discoveries from these precious datasets will only occur at the collective level with improved standardization. To address this shortcoming, we established ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing), an international consortium of scientists who aim to enhance standard guidelines between space biologists at a global level. Here we introduce our consortium and share past lessons learned and future challenges related to spaceflight omics. Keywords: space biology, omics, metadata, standardization, ESA, JAXA, NASA, GeneLab, ISSOP, Twins studyThe Bigger Picture With the rise of commercial spaceflight and prospective human missions to Mars, a wider health range of humans will enter space for longer spans and at higher exposure to environmental stressors than ever before. Numerous adverse health effects have been observed in space, including bone demineralization and skeletal muscle atrophy, among others. Scientists across the world are conducting space omics studies to develop countermeasures for safe and effective crewed space missions. However, optimal extraction of scientific insight from such data is contingent on improved standardization. In response, we founded ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing), an international consortium of scientists who aim to enhance guidelines between space biologists globally. This paper informs scientists and data scientists from many fields about the challenges and future avenues of space omics and can serve as an introductory reference for new members in the space biology discipline. Humans will be entering space for longer spans and at higher exposure to environmental stressors than ever before. Numerous adverse health effects have been observed in space, including bone demineralization and skeletal muscle atrophy. We have formed an international consortium of scientists who aim to develop better standardization guidelines of space biology (especially omics) data. Maximum extraction of scientific knowledge from these rare data can lead to countermeasures needed for safe and effective crewed space missions.Background Humankind has entered a new era of deep space exploration, with space agencies announcing plans to put humans back on the Moon in preparation for the first crewed missions to Mars. Radiation, microgravity, altered atmospheric gas composition, isolation, and diet changes are some of the known stressors on humans in the space environment; these factors are expected to increase with mission duration and distance outside of low Earth orbit.1,2 Examples of adverse human health effects during spaceflight include bone demineralization,3 skeletal muscle atrophy,4 cardiovascular deconditioning,5 vestibular control,6 immune system suppression,7,8 and neuro-ocular ailments.9 It is necessary to better understand how spaceflight factors affect human health in order to develop the countermeasures needed for safe and effective crewed space missions. Moreover, critical elements of the space exploration infrastructure, including food and medical supplies, are insufficient for prolonged missions.10 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Twins Study further motivated the need for comprehensive, consortium-based approaches to study the long-term effects of spaceflight on humans.11 Here, nine research groups studied a single data type in detail while a tenth group performed a multi-omics synthesis to construct a systematic whole-body layout of the changes. The study found alterations in numerous data types, including telomere length, gene regulation, gut microbiome composition, body weight, carotid artery dimensions, and serum metabolite profiles. While many of these changes were transient, some persisted for over 6 months after return to Earth.11 While the NASA Twins Study represents a step change in space biology research, it is also anomalous. The vast majority of space biology experiments and datasets are generated using model organisms (Figure 1). Animal models are used to infer how spaceflight affects humans; plant models are used to elicit how crops can be cultivated in space for food and renewed oxygen sources; and microbes are studied to understand how space affects human microbiomes, plant-microbe interactions, and environmental cleanliness, while also advancing the fields of space biotechnology, planetary protection, and astrobiology.12,13 Specifically, the NASA Rodent Research (RR)14 and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)15,16 series are part of a long heritage of rodent experiments in space; the zebrafish, medaka fish, fruit fly, and worm have all been valuable models for studying the effects of microgravity (μg), hypergravity, and space stressors using much larger sample size17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and proper 1g controls in space via centrifuges and on ground via microgravity simulators;25 plant models are consistently flown to investigate gravitropism26 and now food production;27 and microbial models have been guests on Apollo,28 Space Lab 1,29 the Space Shuttle,30 and the International Space Station (ISS),31 with recent interest turning toward understanding the natural microbiomes of spaceships32,33 and astronauts.34 Figure 1. Open in a new tab Example Uses, Pros, and Cons of Various Model Organisms Used in Space Omics ExperimentsIn all cases, space biologists around the world are increasingly reliant on omics approaches due to its ability to maximize the knowledge gained from rare spaceflight experiments (Figure S1). This includes epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics.11 While omics can generate vast quantities of data, potentially paving the way for successful space missions, optimal extraction of actionable scientific insights from these complex data will only occur with improved standardization and communication at the international level. In recent years, various consortiums have formed to address the increasingly expensive, large, and complicated nature of biological data.35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 These committees implemented standards that significantly accelerated the scientific progress of their respective communities. The space omics community remains relatively new and can adopt successful frameworks from these exemplar groups. At the same time, guidelines developed by these groups cannot simply be replicated into the space omics discipline. Conducting biological research in spaceflight presents unique technical and biological challenges that have not been met before and will need to be specifically addressed by the international space biology community to ensure its success. In response, we have formed a consortium called International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP). Our members are scientists who conduct space omics experiments funded by multiple space agencies in Japan (JAXA), Europe (including delegates from the European Space Agency [ESA] Space Omics Topical Team42), and the United States (NASA). We bring expertise related to the processing of space omics samples from humans, vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms, plants, and microbes; the implementation of multi-omics and systems biology approaches in space biology; and the normalization of spaceflight metadata. We are also informed with the latest developments across government, industry, and academia. Our mission is to develop, share, and encourage sample-processing standardization and metadata normalization of spaceflight omics experiments to allow for a better harmonization of data and increased gain of knowledge. In this paper, we begin by describing examples of past lessons learned from omics studies on model organisms in space. These examples showcase the unique technical and biological challenges inherent to performing spaceflight omics and underline the need for improved standardization in the discipline. We then announce the current formation of ISSOP to address these needs at the international level. We close with a brief section with potential future avenues for ISSOP to bring standardized and systematic science to the space omics field.Past Lessons Learned from Space Omics with Model Organisms There are a number of unique challenges during each stage of a space omics experiment. In this section, we summarize those challenges and any advances therein that have been achieved in recent years through model organism studies. We journey through this section in roughly the same order of stages that researchers conduct space omics research projects (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Roadmap of the Unique Challenges and Solutions during Each Stage of a Space Omics ExperimentPlanning and Experimental Phase Limitations in Space, Time, and Finances The space omics community faces novel technical difficulties when planning spaceflight experiments. Basic challenges include logistical limitations in space, time, and finances. First, capacity limitations on orbiting platforms restrict the number of experimental replicates and variables, especially for rodent and plant studies. Small replicate numbers constrain statistical power and limit strain diversity. Genetically diverse crops will be crucial to foster robust bioregenerative life support systems in long-term space missions; however, the majority of plant species studied in space have been confined to low biomass species due to limited volume.43 Second, crew time is exceptionally limited for experimental procedures in spaceflight. In 2019, an hour of astronaut time was valued at $17,500,44 while the mean hourly wage in the United States for biochemists and biophysicists was $52.01.45 These numbers roughly indicate it can be more than 300 times more expensive to perform experiments on orbit versus terrestrially. It is difficult to perform certain procedures on the ISS due to the small crew size and the lack of laboratory equipment and experience compared with what is common in terrestrial laboratories. Third, repeating unsuccessful experiments and following up successful experiments are both difficult due to logistical and financial constraints and typically face much longer waiting times compared with experiments on the ground.43Hardware and Housing Biological experiments during spaceflight are rarely performed using standard ground equipment. Developing special hardware and housing technology that can operate in spaceflight conditions is an ongoing challenge. In the past few decades, several space research platforms for animal and plant physiology have been developed.46, 47, 48, 49 Alongside these engineering advances, it has become clear that the hardware itself and how it is employed in experimental design must be carefully standardized and iteratively improved to mitigate unintentional confounding factors as they become better known. For example, the standard rodent vivarium cages used in ground studies are unsuitable in microgravity. One hardware design that has proved to be an effective platform for rodent studies during spaceflight is the NASA Animal Enclosure Model (AEM).49 A recent meta-study compared AEM ground controls and vivarium ground controls by examining all datasets in the NASA GeneLab database that had samples for both conditions.50 The authors applied an unbiased systems biology approach that revealed substantial transcriptional differences in ground control rodents when only the habitat was changed.50 In particular, a mild hypoxic phenotype was observed in the AEM condition, possibly due to its intentional design to intake ambient air, thereby passively intaking higher CO2 concentrations implemented to match the spaceflight environment.50 Importantly, increased CO2 levels may cause a decrease in cognitive scores and an increase in headaches in humans.51,52 Overall, this study underlined the critical need for well-designed ground control experiments in order to address confounders that might otherwise lead to incorrect conclusions about the omics effects of spaceflight, something that has also been observed in flies cultivated in space.25 Plants also require special hardware designs for spaceflight, several of which have been used enough to understand that the hardware itself introduces extraneous variables. For example, Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware, which required no power and only limited crew time, was employed in numerous astrobotany experiments and found to have several shortcomings. The hardware itself reduced plant endodermal cell size, partially due to etiolated response to its dark environment.53 Similarly, the BRIC Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) hardware induces stress-related changes in the transcriptome and proteome of Arabidopsis seedlings, highlighting the continued need for iterative hardware revisions henceforth.54 The spaceflight community redevelops hardware not only to improve design but also to add new features that conserve time and effort for crew members. These features include real-time imaging, ground commanding, and automated software. New features are also added to better differentiate between the combinatorial effects of living in space. For example, in contrast to the NASA BRIC and BRIC-PDFU platforms, both the European KUBIK incubator and the JAXA Multiple Artificial-Gravity Research System (MARS) platforms provide 1g in-flights controls.15 These controls may mitigate the risk of falsely identifying omics results as responsive to microgravity exposure when they are instead relevant to other spaceflight variables. Nonetheless, we note that, as is the case with most innovative spacecraft housing units, these platforms themselves introduce their own confounding influences. In particular, gravity gradients appear across the rotor system and sample positions do not experience the same gravity force. Given that small differences in partial gravity exposure cause large transcriptional profiles changes in plants,55,56 it is paramount for plant biologists who use these platforms to publish metadata that include both nominal partial g and real partial g for each sample position. The use of reliable 1g controls both on Earth and in orbit is greatly acknowledged.24,57,58 A large variety of ground-based simulation systems55 can be used together to dissect the differential contribution of each confounding factor introduced by spaceflight or hardware requirements. Microgravity simulators include 2D clinostats, random positioning machines (RPMs), rotating wall vessels (RWVs), and diamagnetic levitation.59 Each of these simulators brings specific artifacts; for instance, clinostats introduce centrifugal accelerations and vibrations and diamagnetic levitation affects cell components differently based on magnetic susceptibility.59 For these reasons, consistent terminology must be used and standards must be proposed for different simulators and different modes of operation.59 We note that commercial platforms are increasingly being contracted for spaceflight biological experiments, including TangoLabs (Space Tango, Lexington, KY), NanoLabs (NanoRacks, Houston, TX), and ICE Cubes Facilities (Space Application Services, Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, Belgium). To improve standardization and share lessons learned, communication will be increasingly crucial between the academic, government, and industry sectors developing and improving upon hardware designs. Consistent metadata collection about hardware used will also be crucial for informed interpretation of space omics data.Sample Collection and Storage Sample Collection Due in part to limitations in crew time and finances, inconsistencies have arisen in how samples are obtained for analysis. For example, in some rodent experiments, animals are euthanized in space (“ISS terminal”) and either preserved as whole frozen carcasses (“ISS terminal frozen return”) for eventual dissection on Earth or dissected immediately by astronauts (“ISS terminal dissected return”). Alternatively, animals can be returned to Earth alive for euthanasia and dissection (“live animal return”). Each method has its strengths and weaknesses: While ISS-terminal approaches fix spaceflight responses directly, live animal return saves the time and specialized training astronauts would need to perform fine anatomical dissection on the ISS and ensure that these procedures are instead performed by professional technicians on Earth. Live animal return also allows scientists to study the offspring of returned spaceflight mice and to examine recovery to Earth conditions. On the downside, live animal return is confounded by exerted forces during reentry, reacclimation to Earth conditions after splashdown and before dissection, and circadian rhythm differences.Sample Preservation Adequate preservation of samples aboard the ISS is a continuing challenge and a hindrance to capturing unchanged biological responses to the orbital environment. Without access to liquid nitrogen, the current tissue freezing standard on the ISS is −80°C slow freezing. Unfortunately, NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) missions revealed that space mouse gene expression analysis may not be reliable with slow freezing.14 Indeed, slow freezing of mouse carcasses on orbit for eventual dissection on Earth (ISS terminal frozen return samples) showed large gene expression changes when compared with mice dissected by astronauts in orbit (ISS terminal dissected return samples). This appeared to be exacerbated by the use of poly(A) enrichment-based RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) protocol, and could be alleviated by the use of a ribodepletion-based approach and by snap-freezing carcasses in liquid nitrogen.60 As a result, the Rapid Freeze hardware was recently developed for use on the ISS. The device can freeze mouse tissues (Glovebox freezer) and whole carcasses (Cryochiller) at rates similar to those attained with liquid nitrogen immersion. Studies are ongoing to determine how this new hardware compares with current ISS standard methods. RNAlater consists of quaternary ammonium sulfates and cesium sulfates that denature and deactivate ribonucleases to prevent sample degradation. It is one fixative that has been widely used in space omics because it efficiently preserves nucleic acids and is deemed safe in the orbital environment. However, a secondary control study found that numerous genes identified in spaceflight experiments exhibit more pronounced differential expression induced by RNAlater than by microgravity.61 The fixation process is not rapid enough to prevent a response to the preservative in plants or invertebrates. Under normal circumstances, parallel fixation of treatment and control samples would account for the preservation effects. However, spaceflight is by no means a normal circumstance: it is likely that the fixation process is markedly altered in microgravity, which induces sweeping alterations to structural components of plants and invertebrates and differences in fluid dynamics. Ultimately, transcriptomic experiments performed aboard the ISS should preferentially use snap-freezing preservation. In the absence of snap-freezing capabilities, experimentalists should examine the overlap in response to RNAlater and their experimental treatments to eliminate potential fixative-induced transcriptome events.61,62Data Curation and Distribution The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project significantly enhanced our understanding of complex biology with its carefully curated and publicly available multi-omics database.36 In order to unravel how biology responds to space factors, the space omics community needs to capture this spirit and construct an analogous database tailored to the unique characteristics of space omics data. NASA GeneLab is the first comprehensive space omics database that aims to optimize scientific return from spaceflight and ground simulation experiments funded by multiple space agencies around the world.63 The repository currently maintains more than 300 transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets from plant, animal, and microbial space experiments. Users can upload, download, store, and analyze spaceflight-relevant omics data in an open-access manner. GeneLab complies with FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles64,65 and houses raw, intermediate, and fully processed data files. This renders the data accessible to citizen scientists and scientists at every level. Users can fully reproduce each step of the analysis pipeline and reanalyze data using their preferred bioinformatics tools starting from any step in the pipeline. As raw and intermediate files lack interpretable biological meaning, processed data files contain user-friendly menus that allow users to easily explore statistical comparisons and visualizations between data in order to generate new space biology hypotheses at high and interconnected levels.66 The power of a database is greater than the sum of its individual datasets, but only if its individual datasets can be cross-examined in intelligent ways that assist with pattern discovery. Metadata are datasets that provide information about other datasets and hence are the bedrock of interconnecting datasets in informed manners. For this reason, implementation of best practices for metadata is just as important as for the datasets themselves. GeneLab links critical metadata to each dataset. Metadata cover numerous factors that may present confounding variables during space omics experiments: biology factors (such as age, gender, strain, and ecotype), lifestyle factors (such as diet, exercise, and light cycle), experimental design factors (such as hardware and preflight and postflight exposure to stressors), sample-processing factors (such as preservation methods and library preparation methods), and spaceflight factors (such as gravity, atmospheric pressure, temperature, and ionizing radiation). Overall, metadata can be systematically examined to create robust networks that predict confounding variables and eventually determine additional experimental and engineering improvement areas for spaceflight omics studies.67 Metadata protocols continue to be refined in the space biology discipline. For example, ISS environmental metadata (such as CO2, temperature, and radiation levels) are now integrated in space omics data.68 Dosimeters are not typically incorporated in the housing units of space omics experiments; hence, dosage exposure for study samples must be extrapolated from surrounding dosimeters.68 Meticulous metadata standardization efforts will continue to evolve and solve such challenges. External tools are also being developed to facilitate metadata reproducibility and discoverability. The Gilroy Astrobiology Team at the University of Wisconsin developed a metadata visualization API for the GeneLab platform called TOAST (Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome) and a cross-species transcriptional viewer (NASA GeneLab Cross Kingdom Database) that uses iterative approaches to assist users with discovering common gene clusters among space omics datasets.68 As much as possible, space biologists employ standardized ontological vocabularies accepted by the larger scientific community through the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI). However, given the unprecedented nature of space biology, terminology must sometimes be extended from the OBI. This has been the case especially for radiobiology and space radiation terms. The addition of new ontology terms must be done carefully in manners that support controlled integration between datasets and metadata sources.69 Normalizing metadata is another enormous manual effort, sometimes requiring interviewing principal investigators and perusing publications to procure critical metadata. With growing volumes of incoming space omics datasets, this ambitious effort cannot be scaled.69 Going forward, submission portals can be created to increase automatic curation, which has already been proved relatively successful in non-spaceflight applications.69 Algorithms can guide data submitters to deposit crucial metadata and even provide explanations for why certain metadata are essential. Successfully relaying the importance of space omics confounders to researchers will improve their metadata submission adherence, thereby increasing the automation of metadata curation and the reliability of cross-data studies. Recent groups have indeed demonstrated the power of integrating multiple datasets from the GeneLab database to elicit global systemic responses to the space environment.50 Future studies can similarly leverage the database and its thorough metadata to obtain the larger sample sizes and stronger statistical powers needed to further identify salient factors affecting space-flown organisms.Sample Sharing Deciphering fundamental molecular responses to space will likely not be achieved by a single research group. Sample-sharing schemes must be honed to maximize discoverability and reproducibility between researchers in the space omics discipline. To this end, sharing a common biobank and sample-processing facility is ideal. An organized, navigable biobank can allow researchers to determine whether tissues of interest are already available from previous studies and avoid conducting redundant, resource-consuming experiments in space. A central sample-processing facility can prevent batch effects that would otherwise be introduced in a multiple-facility configuration. The common facility can generate high-quality data using standard operating procedures (SOPs) performed by specially trained laboratory operators and robotic workstations. Overall, this framework would be in congruence with successful multi-omics endeavors, such as the TCGA project, where each type of omics was managed by a single center.36 Fortunately, space omics-sharing schemes are already implemented in Japan and the United States. A typical JAXA mouse live animal return study consists of 12 mice, producing more than 30 different tissue types across multiple omics assays that are then shared by more than 10 primary investigators. Genomics datasets from spaceflight mice are processed in a common laboratory at the University of Tsukuba that implements automated sample processing using LabDroids.70 In the United States, unused frozen spaceflight samples from previous experiments are often archived in the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program of the Life Sciences Data Archive. GeneLab scientists at the sample-processing laboratory process these samples and generate omics data using standardized methods for data reproducibility. While ESA does not have its own sample-sharing schemes, it does encourage multinational spaceflight experiments with sample sharing between European researchers and it does participate bilaterally with JAXA and NASA schemes. As the discipline forges onward, valuable sharing schemes for these rare and costly biological specimens returned from orbit should continue to be perfected.Current Need for a Global Consortium: ISSOP With an increasing reliance on and promise of omics technologies when properly standardized, and with different countries providing specific expertise, we have formed to create guidelines for space omics data with input from scientists at the global level. We envision that, as the field of human space omics matures, our guidelines can be readily extended from animal models to humans and to specifically allow for translatable inference and comparison between animal model data and human data. Our latest protocols will be available on our consortium website (https://issop.space) and GitHub (https://github.com/ISSOP) as they are developed and continuously updated. Here we announce the inception of the ISSOP consortium. ISSOP is a portmanteau of the abbreviations ISS and SOP. We are an international consortium of scientists with a 3-fold mission statement. First, we develop, share, and encourage sample-processing standardization and metadata normalization of spaceflight omics experiments. Second, we aim to optimize the conditions for scientists and the general public to derive valid hypotheses from these precious data by reducing confounding factors and increasing interoperability at the global level. Third, our standardization efforts are crucial for understanding the effects of spaceflight on biological organisms and preparing the international community toward developing safe and effective crewed space exploration beyond low Earth orbit. Our objectives, deliverables, and expected impacts are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Objectives, Deliverables, and Expected Impacts of ISSOP Community objectives (1) Inform space biologists of recommended guidelines for space omics experiments; (2) Enhance information exchange between space biologists at the global level; (3) Reach a more diverse community of scientists and citizen scientists; (4) Incentivize engagement toward space omics and metadata standardization in the space biology research community; (5) Invite researchers committed to these values to join our efforts Tangible deliverables (1) Publish and routinely update our recommended sample-processing guidelines in a free and public repository; (2) Publish and routinely update lessons we have learned about space omics experiments in a free and public repository; (3) Upload key raw files, intermediate files, and final files using transparent and standardized data analysis pipelines for each dataset in the NASA GeneLab database; (4) Implement critical metadata standards for all datasets in the NASA GeneLab database Shorter-term expected impacts (1) Reduction in confounding factors and promotion of harmonization and interoperability between space omics datasets; (2) Increased accuracy when comparing between data, including historic spaceflight data with recently generated data, spaceflight analogue data with actual spaceflight data, and model organism data with human data; (3) Prevention of space biology researchers making the same expensive mistakes that have already been learned from other researchers; (4) Democratized access to priceless space omics data in various file formats accessible to both citizen scientists and seasoned bioinformaticians alike; (5) Accelerated derivation of valid hypotheses and novel discoveries related to the effects of space conditions on biological organisms Longer-term expected impacts (1) Improvements in hardware and software technology for future space omics experiments; (2) Advances in biological technologies, therapeutics, and countermeasures to support life in space; (3) Advances in biological technologies and therapeutics applicable to improvements of life on Earth Open in a new tabISSOP meets regularly virtually and at the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) conference, where we can communicate latest standardization guidelines to and from various industry representatives. Our collaborative meetings are designed to identify mechanisms to increase the impact of future space omics experiments while sharing new data and analysis methods. We invite interested readers to contact ISSOP with inquiries or suggestions at issop@issop.space. Corresponding authors in the current paper can also be contacted with questions specific to each geographical region within ISSOP (R.H. for Europe, M.M. for Japan, and J.M.G. for the United States).Future Avenues In this paper, we discussed the challenges of performing omics experiments in spaceflight on model organisms. An international consortium of scientists who bring expertise in space omics studies across a breadth of assay types and model organisms can best advance the field in a multifaceted manner. In future work, ISSOP can develop space omics recommendations across individual assays, including proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics. Guidelines can also be developed for lesser-known but promising molecular biology laboratory techniques. For instance, JAXA and NASA projects have recently started to utilize laser microdissection (LMD) and spatial transcriptomics respectively for data collection at the tissue-part-specific level as opposed to simply the tissue-specific level. ISSOP members who participate in these studies can develop standardization protocols in the context of space omics. Best practices can also be proposed for various organisms. For example, as mentioned previously, physical limitations on orbit restrict sample sizes in certain organisms, including plants. ISSOP members with expertise in astrobotany can provide guidance on standards to maximize information from small numbers of samples during spaceflight. Digitization of sample handling with advanced robotics will be one of the important components for future remote experiments and project sharing. In total, ISSOP can present diverse and balanced guidelines for conducting space omics experiments across a range of assay types and model organisms; these guidelines can include quantitative and qualitative information about data collection, data extraction, library preparation, quality control, sample preservation, and sequencing parameters. It may be possible to eventually consolidate this information into a protocol decision tree algorithm that can provide standardized recommendations to principal investigators based on their organisms and assays of interest. The challenges delineated in this paper will be further intensified as we leap into an age of human space omics. Commercial spaceflight will induce a wider health range of humans entering space while future long-term deep space missions will expose humans to more intense environmental stressors for longer durations than ever before. Fine-tuning the space telemedicine field will be necessary for these ambitious frontiers and will best be achieved with the addition of omics as a standard measures program. Pioneering crewed missions to Mars will likely require international input due to complexities in the technology and cultural ethics of working with human subjects.71 ISSOP may be uniquely positioned to leverage lessons learned thus far from model organisms to develop an informed framework early on that can maximize scientific discovery and minimize ethical problems for an upcoming era of human space omics. Compellingly, careful standardization of space omics data through ISSOP may pave the way for cell space atlases72,73 and precision spaceflight medicine74, 75, 76, 77, 78 that will critically improve the safety of humans traveling through space. Here we have introduced ISSOP as an international consortium that can prime researchers to extract as much actionable insight as possible from space omics data through improved standardization, altogether benefiting upcoming trailblazing space missions during this critical period. This paper is intended to inform scientists and data scientists across a wide spectrum of disciplines about the challenges and future directions of the exciting field of space omics. This paper can also serve as an introductory reference for students and new members in the space omics and larger space biology discipline. We invite interested readers to learn more about ISSOP through our webpage. Satellite ISSOP papers will follow with more detailed focuses on specific realms of standard space omics processing, all intended to improve our understanding of the omics effects of spaceflight so humanity can reach new worlds safely.Acknowledgments We thank Colin P.S.

    "abstract": "Abstract There has long been an interest in understanding how the hazards from spaceflight may trigger or exacerbate human diseases. With the goal of advancing our knowledge on physiological changes during space travel, NASA GeneLab provides an open-source repository of multi-omics data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. Alone, this data enables identification of biological changes during spaceflight, but cannot infer how that may impact an astronaut at the phenotypic level. To bridge this gap, Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a heterogeneous knowledge graph connecting biological and clinical data from over 30 databases, was used in combination with GeneLab transcriptomic data from six studies. This integration identified critical symptoms and physiological changes incurred during spaceflight. Keywords: spaceflight, knowledge graph, transcriptomics",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction NASA recognizes five main hazards of spaceflight to human health, including altered gravity (microgravity and hypergravity), ionizing radiation, isolation/confinement, hostile/closed environment, and distance from Earth. These health risks caused by the space environment resemble multiple disorders found on Earth, including muscle atrophy and bone loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, immune dysfunction, and central nervous system deficits [1]. Therefore, repurposing current FDA-approved treatments for issues that arise during spaceflight could significantly reduce the time needed to develop new therapeutics and limit their side effects. Since its establishment in 2015, NASA GeneLab [2] has become a prominent open-source repository of data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. This platform has enabled computational analysis of multi-omics data, visualization of results, and integration with descriptive metadata, such as environmental data (e.g., space radiation dosimetry). GeneLab has already supported dozens of published studies, created a global collaboration to develop uniform standards for spaceflight-omics [3], and resulted in new space biology discoveries [4,5]. However, it has not yet been possible to use NASA GeneLab to combine and compare space and terrestrial data. Such capability would be a major advancement in fundamental spaceflight biology and its applications, including identifying new targets or repurposing terrestrial therapeutics for spaceflight countermeasures. NASA GeneLab is planning to set up a portal dedicated to computational modeling that enables comparisons between datasets in addition to already existing data input, query, analysis, and visualization capabilities. Knowledge graphs (KGs) would be a suitable approach to facilitate this goal by unifying disparate datasets into a human queryable framework. KGs have already been widely adopted in biomedical research to unravel the complex relationship between biological changes and disease phenotypes [6,7,8,9,10]. Specifically, a new massive UCSF-based KG database, the Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) has transformed structured data from over 30 human biomedical databases (-omics, chemical structures, molecular and cellular responses, physiological data including e.g., patient symptoms and drug side effects, etc.) into a KG with almost 400,000 nodes of 12 types and over 10 million edges of 32 types [11,12]. Therefore, SPOKE has the potential to be combined with the NASA GeneLab modeling portal, expanding it to link terrestrial biomedical sciences to space biosciences research and space medicine. In this study, we integrated data from six different NASA GeneLab datasets in SPOKE to enable normalization that highlighted new nodes defining systems and effects that are known to be relevant for space travel but would have been impossible to uncover without using SPOKE (workflow Figure 1a). These results suggest that SPOKE can be utilized to gain a deeper biological understanding of the health hazards associated with spaceflight and provide the proof of concept for its broader utilization to integrate space and terrestrial biological data.

    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. GeneLab Data Processing and Analysis Gene expression data were downloaded from the NASA GeneLab repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/), datasets GLDS-4, GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246, GLDS-288, and GLDS-289. All data had been processed and analyzed using standard NASA GeneLab techniques detailed below. Matched flight/live animal return versus ground control data was used for analysis. Previously, raw data were processed separately for each dataset by the NASA GeneLab data processing team. For datasets containing RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) assays (GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246, GLDS-288, GLDS-289), raw FASTQ files were assessed for the percentage of rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.1.0 for GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246 and version 1.3.1 for GLDS-288, GLDS-289; https://s4hts.github.io/HTStream/) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.4; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) [13]. Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC [14] (version 0.11.9). MultiQC [15] (version 1.8 for GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246 and version 1.9 for GLDS-288, GLDS-289) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR [16] and RSEM [17] references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a for GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246 and version 2.7.4a for GLDS-288, GLDS-289) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.3a for GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246 and version 2.7.4a for GLDS-288, GLDS-289) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1 from the NASA GeneLab repository). Data representing the quantitative analysis of gene expression for each dataset was downloaded from the NASA GeneLab repository, where it had been previously analyzed and imported into R [18] (version 3.6.3). It was then combined to create a gene counts table containing the data for all samples of every dataset. For GLDS-244, GLDS-245, and GLDS-246, only non-ERCC (External RNA Controls Consortium [19], i.e., a spike-in mixture used for normalization) genes were used. Data was normalized with DESeq2 [20] (version 1.26.0). A principal component analysis was performed using prcomp (stats version 3.6.3) and plotted using plotly [21] (version 4.9.2.1). For datasets containing DNA microarray assays (GLDS-4) raw CEL files were read in and normalized using an in-house R script as described [22]. To quantify overlapping pathways between GLDS-244, -245, and -246, Entrez Gene IDs of genes that showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) between 29-day flight/live animal return and ground controls were used as the input to Molecular Signatures Database v7.2, GeneOntology [23,24,25] (GO) gene sets. (GO biological process, GO cellular component, GO molecular function). The top 50 statistically significant gene sets were compared to identify overlaps. The same approach was applied to quantify the overlapping gene sets between GLDS-288 and -289. 2.2. Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) [11,12] is a population level heterogeneous knowledge graph. SPOKE was generated by unifying over 30 publicly available databases. Currently, SPOKE contains almost 400,000 nodes of 12 types (Anatomy, BiologicalProcess, CellularComponent, Compound, Disease, Gene, MolecularFunction, Pathway, PharmacologicalClass, Protein, SideEffect, and Symptom). These nodes are connected by 32 types of biologically meaningful edges (n > 10 million). 2.3. Gene-Specific Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) are generated using a modified version of topic-specific page rank to learn and embed the importance of each node in SPOKE for a given restart node or set of nodes [26,27]. These restart nodes, called SPOKE Entry Points (SEPs), are any concept in the input data that overlaps with a node(s) in SPOKE [28]. In this analysis, the SEPs were the mouse genes that have homologs to the human Gene nodes in SPOKE. A Gene PSEV was produced by allowing a random walker to traverse the edges in SPOKE and then forcing them to restart at a specific Gene SEP. The forced restart ensures that the walker will spend the majority of time on nodes that are important for that Gene. The significance of each node is then stored in an element of the PSEV such that the length of the PSEV is equal to the number of nodes in SPOKE (n = 389,297). Code used to generate the data in this manuscript is available at (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4408540). 2.4. Integrating Gene Expression Data and PSEVs For each study, the −log2 fold-change (FC) mouse gene expression data was mapped to the human gene nodes in SPOKE. The homologous mapping between species was achieved using HomoloGene IDs [29]. If multiple mouse genes mapped to a single human gene, then the average FC was used. Additionally, some studies contained multiple comparisons between space and ground or baseline control mice. An example of this is the study GLDS-244 that compared mice at two space-time points (day-29 and days 53–56). In these instances, genes were removed if the FC comparisons were not in the same direction (i.e., if space versus ground day-29 had a positive FC and days-53–56 had a negative FC). This filter focuses on the data set of genes that remain consistent during space travel. After genes were mapped and filtered for a given study, the pre-computed PSEVs for the remaining genes were extracted. This PSEV matrix was z-score normalized and then ranked such that the most important node in a given PSEV was equal to the number of nodes in SPOKE (n = 389,297) and the least important was ranked one. Then for each comparison, the filtered PSEV matrix was adjusted using the FCs. This was accomplished by taking the product of a single column in the FC matrix and the filtered normalized PSEV matrix. It is necessary for the rows (genes) of the filtered normalized PSEV matrix to be in the same order as the rows in the FC matrix. Next, each column (node) in the adjusted PSEV-matrix was summed resulting in a vector in which each element or position corresponded to a node in SPOKE (length = 389,297). Each node was then ranked as before (with the highest value in the vector ranked 389,297). In practice, this was achieved by taking the dot product of the filtered FC matrix (transposed) and the filtered normalized PSEV matrix and then ranking the resulting matrix. 2.5. Finding Significant Spoke Nodes The PSEV comparisons from the six studies were pooled together and separated into three groups (Ground vs. Baseline, Space vs. Baseline, and Space vs. Ground). Welch’s t-test was used to evaluate whether the distribution of ranks of a given node in the Ground vs. Baseline group was significantly different from that in either Space vs. Baseline or Space vs. Ground (Table S1, in the Supplementary Materials). Top nodes, those that were ranked significantly different in either space travel comparisons (Space vs. Baseline and Space vs. Ground) than in Ground vs. Baseline, were identified using the p-values from the Welch’s t-test. Since 159,374 nodes had a p-value < 0.025 in either or both space travel comparisons, top nodes were further filtered by selecting the most significant 2.5% of each node type for Space vs. Ground and/or Space vs. Baseline (n = 15,801; 4.1%). 2.6. Retracing Paths from Input Gene to SPOKE Node A high correlation between a gene’s FC and the rank of a specific node suggests that the gene FC is at least partially responsible for the prioritization of the node within a PSEVs. The correlation was calculated between genes (present in >20% of FC comparisons; n = 7567) and a set of top Anatomy, BiologicalProcess, CellularComponent, MolecularFunction, Pathway, and Symptom nodes (n = 22). Next, paths were found between genes that had a high correlation (correlation > 0.6) and the set of top nodes. Gene-node pairs were then filtered to only include pairs that had the same sign (positive gene expression and positive Welch t-statistic). Then, in order to visualize paths between gene-node pairs, paths were filtered to have a maximum of three edges and less than 100 possible combinations of nodes within the path. This left over 17,000 gene-node pairs and 234,000 possible paths. The paths shown were selected based on their simplicity and the FC of the original genes (Figure S1, in the Supplementary Materials). The p-values, derived when calculating the FCs used as input for PSEV creation, were combined for Ground vs. Baseline and the space travel groups (Space vs. Baseline and Space vs. Ground together) using Stouffer’s method [30]. Each gene FC was judged on whether the average space travel group had a combined p-value that was more significant than Ground v Baseline (Figure S1, y-axis). Then the Welch’s t-test was used to determine whether the FC distributions were significantly different between groups. Space vs. Baseline and Space vs. Ground distributions were compared to the Ground vs. Baseline separately and then averaged (Figure S1, x-axis).",

Transcriptional Profiling of Mice after Space Flight Here we conducted a meta-analysis of six independent transcriptomic datasets (GLDS-4, -244, -245, -246, -288, and -289) from experimental mice obtained during four different spaceflight missions (STS-118, TCU (SpaceX-9), MHU-2 (Space X-12), and RR-6 (SpaceX-13)), at five time- points of collection (13-, 29-, 30-, and 35-days live animal return (LAR); and 53–56 days (ISS terminal)), on the International Space Station (ISS) (Figure 1b and Table 1). While experiments varied in their design (i.e., duration of flight, age at launch, the genotype of mice, transcriptomic platform, time of collection), the objective of these experiments was to identify changes in gene expression induced by spaceflight in three different immune-related organs—thymus (primary lymphoid organ), spleen (secondary lymphoid organ), and liver (immune-associated/digestive organ, with lymphatic cells playing a role in its responses to injury [31]).

After data normalization, the principal component analysis revealed a strong separation of samples by mission and tissues (Figure 2a). These findings are unsurprising, given that these variables are confounding factors of different missions/collections. However, we also observed that samples from the same time point of mission/collection from two different experiments clustered together, suggesting that some biological effects were captured. When PCA was used to plot samples from similar experimental conditions (space-flown, ground, and baseline from the same RR-6 mission), no obvious separation between samples obtained during flight, baseline, and the ground was observed (Figure 2b).

Three out of the top 50 gene ontology (GO) gene sets overlapped between datasets GLDS-288 and -289, none of which overlapped with GLDS-244, -245, and -246.Differentially expressed genes were identified in the thymus, liver, and spleen in space-flown mice vs. ground controls after live animal return from the RR-6 (SpaceX-13) mission. Furthermore, using the differentially expressed genes as an input to pathway analysis (by a hypergeometric test) showed a number of statistically significant biological functions dysregulated by space flight in the thymus, liver, and spleen, including some that overlapped between the tissues (Figure 2c). While some gene sets were tissue-specific, nine of them were shared among the three tissues, including apoptosis, cell metabolic process, and cell membrane integrity (Figure 2d). 3.2. Fold-Change Enhanced Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors While established methods of transcriptional profiling can inform about dysregulated molecular pathways, they provide little insight into higher-order phenotypes, such as associated signs and symptoms of disease. Using SPOKE, a KG that integrates information of both biological and clinical databases, it is possible to score every node of the graph as a function of the “information flow” elicited by a defined set of quantitative inputs. SPOKE leverages the complexity of the hierarchical organization of complex organisms to identify nodes with shared information flow (regardless of whether the input itself was significant or not). Gene-specific Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) were generated from the selected GeneLab studies prior to integrating gene expression results with SPOKE [11,12]. Each gene-specific PSEV was created using a modified version of topic-specific page rank [26,27] in which the random walker was forced to restart at the corresponding Gene node in SPOKE (See Methods, Figure 3a). This focused the random walker on nodes that were the most important for a given node (in this case, Gene node since the input is gene expression). The amount of time a random walker spent on a node was then stored in a defined element (position within) of the PSEV vector. All PSEVs were then stored in the pre-computed PSEV matrix. For each gene expression study, the pre-computed PSEV matrix was filtered and normalized to match the genes within the study (Figure 3b; Methods). The dot product was then used with the normalized PSEV matrix and the −log2 fold-change (FC) to produce the PSEVs for that study. After PSEVs were computed for each study, they were pooled and separated into specific experimental groups to enable meaningful comparisons to test the hypothesis that spaceflight alters gene expression (Ground vs. Baseline, Space vs. Baseline, and Space vs. Ground) (Figure 3c). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) using gene expression fold-change (FC). (a) PSEVs were pre-computed for all SPOKE genes. For each gene, the random walker was forced to restart at that gene (probability of random jump = 0.1). After PSEVs were finished they were stored in the pre-computed PSEV matrix. (b) For each study, the pre-computed PSEV matrix was filtered and normalized. Then the dot product was taken between the normalized matrix and the FC matrix to generate the PSEV matrix for that study. (c top) The PSEV matrices for each study were pooled together and separated into groups: Ground vs. Baseline (blue), Space vs. Baseline (yellow), and Space vs. Ground (green). (c bottom) The distributions of the node ranks were adjusted using the mean Ground vs. Baseline rank.Each element in a PSEV corresponds to a single node in SPOKE. Therefore, it is possible to determine the overall significance of a node for spaceflight by evaluating the differential distribution of node ranks in the PSEV. Welch’s t-test [32] was utilized to compare a node’s rank distribution in the Ground vs. Baseline to that in either Space vs. Baseline or Space vs. Ground (Supplementary Table S1). Strikingly, nodes that are known to be relevant for space travel such as space motion sickness (Symptom), regulation of blood vessel diameter (BiologicalProcess), taste receptor complex (CellularComponent), Vitamin D (calciferol) metabolism (Pathway), and sympathetic nervous system (Anatomy) scored among the top 5% of nodes (top 2.5% per type for Space vs. Baseline and/or Space vs. Ground). Figure 4 shows violin plots from a select set of nodes (n = 22) in SPOKE that had significantly different ranks in spaceflight (Space vs. Baseline and/or Space vs. Ground) compared to Ground vs. Baseline. From these, 11 correspond to symptoms (pink boxed violin charts, Figure 4a), five to gene ontology/pathway concepts (teal boxed violin charts, Figure 4b–d), and six to anatomical regions (green boxed violin charts, Figure 4e). Violin plots for each category, sub-networks demonstrate how the gene expression results drive information from these 22 nodes. Among the other biological top nodes were nodes that reflected the results of the original studies such as those related to t-cell activity, regulation of stress, and TGFβ1 [1,33]. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Retracing paths between genes and top nodes. Gene expression FC values drive information flow to nodes in SPOKE. (a–e) Paths were traced between genes that were partially responsible for pushing information to a set of significant nodes (n = 22). These paths were shown for (a) 10 Symptom nodes, (b) taste receptor complex (CellularComponent), (c) regulation of cortisol secretion (BiologicalProcess) and Vitamin D (calciferol) metabolism (Pathway), (d) regulation of vasoconstriction (BiologicalProcess) and regulation of blood vessel diameter (BiologicalProcess), and (e) six Anatomy nodes. Violin plots for each significant node show that the ranks within Space vs. Baseline and/or Space vs. Ground separated from the Ground vs. Baseline. In each violin plot Ground vs. Baseline (blue), Space vs. Baseline (yellow), and Space vs. Ground (green).Taken together, these results show that potential human physiological changes during spaceflight can be inferred by embedding mouse gene expression data with a KG that integrates observed concepts (i.e., genes) with unobserved, higher-order phenotypes associated with each other in a biologically meaningful manner.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion One of the major objectives of biomedical research is to advance our understanding of human diseases in order to develop effective countermeasures. This aim becomes considerably more challenging when the physiological changes arise from spaceflight. Major efforts have been made by NASA GeneLab to collect and provide multi-omics data from model organisms. Additionally, NASA GeneLab data brought into the SPOKE system could be complemented by including murine phenotypical pathophysiological and biochemical non-omics data (more nodes) from the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive [34], and eventually the SPOKE system could be used for human spaceflight research data related to astronauts. However, the major challenges of analyzing any datasets generated during spaceflight are their low statistical power, considerable heterogeneity, and limited reproducibility [35]. These limitations are largely accepted by the scientific community as a reasonable trade-off for the novelty and potential for discovery these experiments entail. As a new strategy to maximize the utility of these datasets, we propose the data from model organisms can be integrated through a knowledge graph (KG) such as SPOKE. KGs including SPOKE, are bounded by present day biological knowledge. As a result, inferences made through SPOKE may change as our biological data and knowledge expands. Here, we report the results of a KG-driven, meta-analysis of six murine transcriptomic studies (five RNAseq and one microarray) from NASA GeneLab. The samples were taken from three distinct anatomical sites (thymus, liver, and spleen) and covered multiple spaceflight duration and gravity conditions. PCAs using only gene expression data illustrated that most of the differences between the samples could be attributed to either the study or the anatomical site. Next, we hypothesized that, though this data came from a diverse set of experiments, SPOKE embeddings (i.e., “signatures”) could be used to recover space travel changes that are conserved across the studies. To accomplish this, −log2 fold-change gene expression (FC) data from each study was applied to gene-specific Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs). Gene-specific PSEVs are vectors that describe how important each node in SPOKE is for a given gene. Therefore, multiplying PSEVs by FC data will highlight nodes that are both important for the input gene set and to prioritize them according to how differentially expressed the input genes are. PSEVs from all of the studies were then pooled together and separated into three groups based on the type of FC comparison (Ground vs. Baseline, Space vs. Baseline, and Space vs. Ground). The distribution of node rank was analyzed for each node and the top 5% were selected for each node type. These top nodes were enriched for nodes for phenotypes and physiological changes known to be impacted by spaceflight. Furthermore, paths were found between the input gene set and the top node set. These paths shed light onto the underpinnings of spaceflight related health hazards and could potentially be used to identify drug targets. In the future, archived spaceflight and other experimental samples could be used to validate the predicted signatures and assess their physiological significance without the need for further experiments. Thus, we anticipate that our results are the very first steps towards a broader collaboration utilizing the SPOKE model to compare spaceflight and terrestrial phenotypes. There is increasing interest in developing personalized risk predictions and treatments in support of long-duration deep space missions [36]. Thus, expanding the computational approaches from the general comparison of spaceflight and terrestrial diseases to using input from a single subject to map their individual risk profile would allow developing optimal medical care for individual astronauts. Notably, the power of SPOKE stems from a wide variety of its inputs that combine multi-omics, clinical, and physiological data, which may provide a useful complement to the currently utilized risk management tools that are based upon probabilistic mathematical modeling and simulations [37]. Using a knowledge graph connecting molecular and physiological entities (among others) via biologically relevant relationships constitutes a significant advancement for complex, heterogeneous data analysis. This approach complements conventional transcriptomics analysis by extending the biological significance to higher-level phenotypes such as symptoms and side effects, which is not possible with current methods. In the long-term perspective, the SPOKE platform may also be of value to mission planners such as the NASA Human Systems Risk Board.",

Copyright notice ID: 7828077 PMID: 33445483 Abstract There has long been an interest in understanding how the hazards from spaceflight may trigger or exacerbate human diseases. With the goal of advancing our knowledge on physiological changes during space travel, NASA GeneLab provides an open-source repository of multi-omics data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. Alone, this data enables identification of biological changes during spaceflight, but cannot infer how that may impact an astronaut at the phenotypic level. To bridge this gap, Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a heterogeneous knowledge graph connecting biological and clinical data from over 30 databases, was used in combination with GeneLab transcriptomic data from six studies. This integration identified critical symptoms and physiological changes incurred during spaceflight. Keywords: spaceflight, knowledge graph, transcriptomics1. Introduction NASA recognizes five main hazards of spaceflight to human health, including altered gravity (microgravity and hypergravity), ionizing radiation, isolation/confinement, hostile/closed environment, and distance from Earth. These health risks caused by the space environment resemble multiple disorders found on Earth, including muscle atrophy and bone loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, immune dysfunction, and central nervous system deficits [1]. Therefore, repurposing current FDA-approved treatments for issues that arise during spaceflight could significantly reduce the time needed to develop new therapeutics and limit their side effects. Since its establishment in 2015, NASA GeneLab [2] has become a prominent open-source repository of data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. This platform has enabled computational analysis of multi-omics data, visualization of results, and integration with descriptive metadata, such as environmental data (e.g., space radiation dosimetry). GeneLab has already supported dozens of published studies, created a global collaboration to develop uniform standards for spaceflight-omics [3], and resulted in new space biology discoveries [4,5]. However, it has not yet been possible to use NASA GeneLab to combine and compare space and terrestrial data. Such capability would be a major advancement in fundamental spaceflight biology and its applications, including identifying new targets or repurposing terrestrial therapeutics for spaceflight countermeasures. NASA GeneLab is planning to set up a portal dedicated to computational modeling that enables comparisons between datasets in addition to already existing data input, query, analysis, and visualization capabilities. Knowledge graphs (KGs) would be a suitable approach to facilitate this goal by unifying disparate datasets into a human queryable framework. KGs have already been widely adopted in biomedical research to unravel the complex relationship between biological changes and disease phenotypes [6,7,8,9,10]. Specifically, a new massive UCSF-based KG database, the Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) has transformed structured data from over 30 human biomedical databases (-omics, chemical structures, molecular and cellular responses, physiological data including e.g., patient symptoms and drug side effects, etc.) into a KG with almost 400,000 nodes of 12 types and over 10 million edges of 32 types [11,12]. Therefore, SPOKE has the potential to be combined with the NASA GeneLab modeling portal, expanding it to link terrestrial biomedical sciences to space biosciences research and space medicine. In this study, we integrated data from six different NASA GeneLab datasets in SPOKE to enable normalization that highlighted new nodes defining systems and effects that are known to be relevant for space travel but would have been impossible to uncover without using SPOKE (workflow Figure 1a). These results suggest that SPOKE can be utilized to gain a deeper biological understanding of the health hazards associated with spaceflight and provide the proof of concept for its broader utilization to integrate space and terrestrial biological data. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Analysis workflow and summary of experimental conditions across GeneLab datasets used for the analysis. (a) Workflow depicting the different stages of the analysis. (b) Datasets GLDS-4, -244, -245, and -246 used C57BL/6NTac mice. Datasets GLDS-288 and -289 used C57BL/6J mice for spaceflight and both C57BL/6J and Charles River mice for ground controls.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. GeneLab Data Processing and Analysis Gene expression data were downloaded from the NASA GeneLab repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/), datasets GLDS-4, GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246, GLDS-288, and GLDS-289. All data had been processed and analyzed using standard NASA GeneLab techniques detailed below. Matched flight/live animal return versus ground control data was used for analysis. Previously, raw data were processed separately for each dataset by the NASA GeneLab data processing team. For datasets containing RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) assays (GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246, GLDS-288, GLDS-289), raw FASTQ files were assessed for the percentage of rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.1.0 for GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246 and version 1.3.1 for GLDS-288, GLDS-289; https://s4hts.github.io/HTStream/) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.4; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) [13]. Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC [14] (version 0.11.9). MultiQC [15] (version 1.8 for GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246 and version 1.9 for GLDS-288, GLDS-289) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR [16] and RSEM [17] references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a for GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246 and version 2.7.4a for GLDS-288, GLDS-289) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.3a for GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246 and version 2.7.4a for GLDS-288, GLDS-289) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1 from the NASA GeneLab repository). Data representing the quantitative analysis of gene expression for each dataset was downloaded from the NASA GeneLab repository, where it had been previously analyzed and imported into R [18] (version 3.6.3). It was then combined to create a gene counts table containing the data for all samples of every dataset. For GLDS-244, GLDS-245, and GLDS-246, only non-ERCC (External RNA Controls Consortium [19], i.e., a spike-in mixture used for normalization) genes were used. Data was normalized with DESeq2 [20] (version 1.26.0). A principal component analysis was performed using prcomp (stats version 3.6.3) and plotted using plotly [21] (version 4.9.2.1). For datasets containing DNA microarray assays (GLDS-4) raw CEL files were read in and normalized using an in-house R script as described [22]. To quantify overlapping pathways between GLDS-244, -245, and -246, Entrez Gene IDs of genes that showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) between 29-day flight/live animal return and ground controls were used as the input to Molecular Signatures Database v7.2, GeneOntology [23,24,25] (GO) gene sets. (GO biological process, GO cellular component, GO molecular function). The top 50 statistically significant gene sets were compared to identify overlaps. The same approach was applied to quantify the overlapping gene sets between GLDS-288 and -289.2.2. Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) [11,12] is a population level heterogeneous knowledge graph. SPOKE was generated by unifying over 30 publicly available databases. Currently, SPOKE contains almost 400,000 nodes of 12 types (Anatomy, BiologicalProcess, CellularComponent, Compound, Disease, Gene, MolecularFunction, Pathway, PharmacologicalClass, Protein, SideEffect, and Symptom). These nodes are connected by 32 types of biologically meaningful edges (n > 10 million).2.3. Gene-Specific Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) are generated using a modified version of topic-specific page rank to learn and embed the importance of each node in SPOKE for a given restart node or set of nodes [26,27]. These restart nodes, called SPOKE Entry Points (SEPs), are any concept in the input data that overlaps with a node(s) in SPOKE [28]. In this analysis, the SEPs were the mouse genes that have homologs to the human Gene nodes in SPOKE. A Gene PSEV was produced by allowing a random walker to traverse the edges in SPOKE and then forcing them to restart at a specific Gene SEP. The forced restart ensures that the walker will spend the majority of time on nodes that are important for that Gene. The significance of each node is then stored in an element of the PSEV such that the length of the PSEV is equal to the number of nodes in SPOKE (n = 389,297). Code used to generate the data in this manuscript is available at (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4408540).2.4. Integrating Gene Expression Data and PSEVs For each study, the −log2 fold-change (FC) mouse gene expression data was mapped to the human gene nodes in SPOKE. The homologous mapping between species was achieved using HomoloGene IDs [29]. If multiple mouse genes mapped to a single human gene, then the average FC was used. Additionally, some studies contained multiple comparisons between space and ground or baseline control mice. An example of this is the study GLDS-244 that compared mice at two space-time points (day-29 and days 53–56). In these instances, genes were removed if the FC comparisons were not in the same direction (i.e., if space versus ground day-29 had a positive FC and days-53–56 had a negative FC). This filter focuses on the data set of genes that remain consistent during space travel. After genes were mapped and filtered for a given study, the pre-computed PSEVs for the remaining genes were extracted. This PSEV matrix was z-score normalized and then ranked such that the most important node in a given PSEV was equal to the number of nodes in SPOKE (n = 389,297) and the least important was ranked one. Then for each comparison, the filtered PSEV matrix was adjusted using the FCs. This was accomplished by taking the product of a single column in the FC matrix and the filtered normalized PSEV matrix. It is necessary for the rows (genes) of the filtered normalized PSEV matrix to be in the same order as the rows in the FC matrix. Next, each column (node) in the adjusted PSEV-matrix was summed resulting in a vector in which each element or position corresponded to a node in SPOKE (length = 389,297). Each node was then ranked as before (with the highest value in the vector ranked 389,297). In practice, this was achieved by taking the dot product of the filtered FC matrix (transposed) and the filtered normalized PSEV matrix and then ranking the resulting matrix.2.5. Finding Significant Spoke Nodes The PSEV comparisons from the six studies were pooled together and separated into three groups (Ground vs. Baseline, Space vs. Baseline, and Space vs. Ground). Welch’s t-test was used to evaluate whether the distribution of ranks of a given node in the Ground vs. Baseline group was significantly different from that in either Space vs. Baseline or Space vs. Ground (Table S1, in the Supplementary Materials). Top nodes, those that were ranked significantly different in either space travel comparisons (Space vs. Baseline and Space vs. Ground) than in Ground vs. Baseline, were identified using the p-values from the Welch’s t-test. Since 159,374 nodes had a p-value < 0.025 in either or both space travel comparisons, top nodes were further filtered by selecting the most significant 2.5% of each node type for Space vs. Ground and/or Space vs. Baseline (n = 15,801; 4.1%).2.6. Retracing Paths from Input Gene to SPOKE Node A high correlation between a gene’s FC and the rank of a specific node suggests that the gene FC is at least partially responsible for the prioritization of the node within a PSEVs. The correlation was calculated between genes (present in >20% of FC comparisons; n = 7567) and a set of top Anatomy, BiologicalProcess, CellularComponent, MolecularFunction, Pathway, and Symptom nodes (n = 22). Next, paths were found between genes that had a high correlation (correlation > 0.6) and the set of top nodes. Gene-node pairs were then filtered to only include pairs that had the same sign (positive gene expression and positive Welch t-statistic). Then, in order to visualize paths between gene-node pairs, paths were filtered to have a maximum of three edges and less than 100 possible combinations of nodes within the path. This left over 17,000 gene-node pairs and 234,000 possible paths. The paths shown were selected based on their simplicity and the FC of the original genes (Figure S1, in the Supplementary Materials). The p-values, derived when calculating the FCs used as input for PSEV creation, were combined for Ground vs. Baseline and the space travel groups (Space vs. Baseline and Space vs. Ground together) using Stouffer’s method [30]. Each gene FC was judged on whether the average space travel group had a combined p-value that was more significant than Ground v Baseline (Figure S1, y-axis). Then the Welch’s t-test was used to determine whether the FC distributions were significantly different between groups. Space vs. Baseline and Space vs. Ground distributions were compared to the Ground vs. Baseline separately and then averaged (Figure S1, x-axis).3. Results 3.1. Transcriptional Profiling of Mice after Space Flight Here we conducted a meta-analysis of six independent transcriptomic datasets (GLDS-4, -244, -245, -246, -288, and -289) from experimental mice obtained during four different spaceflight missions (STS-118, TCU (SpaceX-9), MHU-2 (Space X-12), and RR-6 (SpaceX-13)), at five time- points of collection (13-, 29-, 30-, and 35-days live animal return (LAR); and 53–56 days (ISS terminal)), on the International Space Station (ISS) (Figure 1b and Table 1). While experiments varied in their design (i.e., duration of flight, age at launch, the genotype of mice, transcriptomic platform, time of collection), the objective of these experiments was to identify changes in gene expression induced by spaceflight in three different immune-related organs—thymus (primary lymphoid organ), spleen (secondary lymphoid organ), and liver (immune-associated/digestive organ, with lymphatic cells playing a role in its responses to injury [31]).

After data normalization, the principal component analysis revealed a strong separation of samples by mission and tissues (Figure 2a). These findings are unsurprising, given that these variables are confounding factors of different missions/collections. However, we also observed that samples from the same time point of mission/collection from two different experiments clustered together, suggesting that some biological effects were captured. When PCA was used to plot samples from similar experimental conditions (space-flown, ground, and baseline from the same RR-6 mission), no obvious separation between samples obtained during flight, baseline, and the ground was observed (Figure 2b).

Venn diagram showing overlapping gene sets between datasets (c) and the list of gene sets overlapping between all three datasets (d). Three out of the top 50 gene ontology (GO) gene sets overlapped between datasets GLDS-288 and -289, none of which overlapped with GLDS-244, -245, and -246.Differentially expressed genes were identified in the thymus, liver, and spleen in space-flown mice vs. ground controls after live animal return from the RR-6 (SpaceX-13) mission. Furthermore, using the differentially expressed genes as an input to pathway analysis (by a hypergeometric test) showed a number of statistically significant biological functions dysregulated by space flight in the thymus, liver, and spleen, including some that overlapped between the tissues (Figure 2c). While some gene sets were tissue-specific, nine of them were shared among the three tissues, including apoptosis, cell metabolic process, and cell membrane integrity (Figure 2d).3.2. Fold-Change Enhanced Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors While established methods of transcriptional profiling can inform about dysregulated molecular pathways, they provide little insight into higher-order phenotypes, such as associated signs and symptoms of disease. Using SPOKE, a KG that integrates information of both biological and clinical databases, it is possible to score every node of the graph as a function of the “information flow” elicited by a defined set of quantitative inputs. SPOKE leverages the complexity of the hierarchical organization of complex organisms to identify nodes with shared information flow (regardless of whether the input itself was significant or not). Gene-specific Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) were generated from the selected GeneLab studies prior to integrating gene expression results with SPOKE [11,12]. Each gene-specific PSEV was created using a modified version of topic-specific page rank [26,27] in which the random walker was forced to restart at the corresponding Gene node in SPOKE (See Methods, Figure 3a). This focused the random walker on nodes that were the most important for a given node (in this case, Gene node since the input is gene expression). The amount of time a random walker spent on a node was then stored in a defined element (position within) of the PSEV vector. All PSEVs were then stored in the pre-computed PSEV matrix. For each gene expression study, the pre-computed PSEV matrix was filtered and normalized to match the genes within the study (Figure 3b; Methods). The dot product was then used with the normalized PSEV matrix and the −log2 fold-change (FC) to produce the PSEVs for that study. After PSEVs were computed for each study, they were pooled and separated into specific experimental groups to enable meaningful comparisons to test the hypothesis that spaceflight alters gene expression (Ground vs. Baseline, Space vs. Baseline, and Space vs. Ground) (Figure 3c). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) using gene expression fold-change (FC). (a) PSEVs were pre-computed for all SPOKE genes. For each gene, the random walker was forced to restart at that gene (probability of random jump = 0.1). After PSEVs were finished they were stored in the pre-computed PSEV matrix. (b) For each study, the pre-computed PSEV matrix was filtered and normalized. Then the dot product was taken between the normalized matrix and the FC matrix to generate the PSEV matrix for that study. (c top) The PSEV matrices for each study were pooled together and separated into groups: Ground vs. Baseline (blue), Space vs. Baseline (yellow), and Space vs. Ground (green). (c bottom) The distributions of the node ranks were adjusted using the mean Ground vs. Baseline rank.Each element in a PSEV corresponds to a single node in SPOKE. Therefore, it is possible to determine the overall significance of a node for spaceflight by evaluating the differential distribution of node ranks in the PSEV. Welch’s t-test [32] was utilized to compare a node’s rank distribution in the Ground vs. Baseline to that in either Space vs. Baseline or Space vs. Ground (Supplementary Table S1). Strikingly, nodes that are known to be relevant for space travel such as space motion sickness (Symptom), regulation of blood vessel diameter (BiologicalProcess), taste receptor complex (CellularComponent), Vitamin D (calciferol) metabolism (Pathway), and sympathetic nervous system (Anatomy) scored among the top 5% of nodes (top 2.5% per type for Space vs. Baseline and/or Space vs. Ground). Figure 4 shows violin plots from a select set of nodes (n = 22) in SPOKE that had significantly different ranks in spaceflight (Space vs. Baseline and/or Space vs. Ground) compared to Ground vs. Baseline. From these, 11 correspond to symptoms (pink boxed violin charts, Figure 4a), five to gene ontology/pathway concepts (teal boxed violin charts, Figure 4b–d), and six to anatomical regions (green boxed violin charts, Figure 4e). Violin plots for each category, sub-networks demonstrate how the gene expression results drive information from these 22 nodes. Among the other biological top nodes were nodes that reflected the results of the original studies such as those related to t-cell activity, regulation of stress, and TGFβ1 [1,33]. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Retracing paths between genes and top nodes. Gene expression FC values drive information flow to nodes in SPOKE. (a–e) Paths were traced between genes that were partially responsible for pushing information to a set of significant nodes (n = 22). These paths were shown for (a) 10 Symptom nodes, (b) taste receptor complex (CellularComponent), (c) regulation of cortisol secretion (BiologicalProcess) and Vitamin D (calciferol) metabolism (Pathway), (d) regulation of vasoconstriction (BiologicalProcess) and regulation of blood vessel diameter (BiologicalProcess), and (e) six Anatomy nodes. Violin plots for each significant node show that the ranks within Space vs. Baseline and/or Space vs. Ground separated from the Ground vs. Baseline. In each violin plot Ground vs. Baseline (blue), Space vs. Baseline (yellow), and Space vs. Ground (green).Taken together, these results show that potential human physiological changes during spaceflight can be inferred by embedding mouse gene expression data with a KG that integrates observed concepts (i.e., genes) with unobserved, higher-order phenotypes associated with each other in a biologically meaningful manner.4. Discussion One of the major objectives of biomedical research is to advance our understanding of human diseases in order to develop effective countermeasures. This aim becomes considerably more challenging when the physiological changes arise from spaceflight. Major efforts have been made by NASA GeneLab to collect and provide multi-omics data from model organisms. Additionally, NASA GeneLab data brought into the SPOKE system could be complemented by including murine phenotypical pathophysiological and biochemical non-omics data (more nodes) from the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive [34], and eventually the SPOKE system could be used for human spaceflight research data related to astronauts. However, the major challenges of analyzing any datasets generated during spaceflight are their low statistical power, considerable heterogeneity, and limited reproducibility [35]. These limitations are largely accepted by the scientific community as a reasonable trade-off for the novelty and potential for discovery these experiments entail. As a new strategy to maximize the utility of these datasets, we propose the data from model organisms can be integrated through a knowledge graph (KG) such as SPOKE. KGs including SPOKE, are bounded by present day biological knowledge. As a result, inferences made through SPOKE may change as our biological data and knowledge expands. Here, we report the results of a KG-driven, meta-analysis of six murine transcriptomic studies (five RNAseq and one microarray) from NASA GeneLab. The samples were taken from three distinct anatomical sites (thymus, liver, and spleen) and covered multiple spaceflight duration and gravity conditions. PCAs using only gene expression data illustrated that most of the differences between the samples could be attributed to either the study or the anatomical site. Next, we hypothesized that, though this data came from a diverse set of experiments, SPOKE embeddings (i.e., “signatures”) could be used to recover space travel changes that are conserved across the studies. To accomplish this, −log2 fold-change gene expression (FC) data from each study was applied to gene-specific Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs). Gene-specific PSEVs are vectors that describe how important each node in SPOKE is for a given gene. Therefore, multiplying PSEVs by FC data will highlight nodes that are both important for the input gene set and to prioritize them according to how differentially expressed the input genes are. PSEVs from all of the studies were then pooled together and separated into three groups based on the type of FC comparison (Ground vs. Baseline, Space vs. Baseline, and Space vs. Ground). The distribution of node rank was analyzed for each node and the top 5% were selected for each node type. These top nodes were enriched for nodes for phenotypes and physiological changes known to be impacted by spaceflight. Furthermore, paths were found between the input gene set and the top node set. These paths shed light onto the underpinnings of spaceflight related health hazards and could potentially be used to identify drug targets. In the future, archived spaceflight and other experimental samples could be used to validate the predicted signatures and assess their physiological significance without the need for further experiments. Thus, we anticipate that our results are the very first steps towards a broader collaboration utilizing the SPOKE model to compare spaceflight and terrestrial phenotypes. There is increasing interest in developing personalized risk predictions and treatments in support of long-duration deep space missions [36]. Thus, expanding the computational approaches from the general comparison of spaceflight and terrestrial diseases to using input from a single subject to map their individual risk profile would allow developing optimal medical care for individual astronauts. Notably, the power of SPOKE stems from a wide variety of its inputs that combine multi-omics, clinical, and physiological data, which may provide a useful complement to the currently utilized risk management tools that are based upon probabilistic mathematical modeling and simulations [37]. Using a knowledge graph connecting molecular and physiological entities (among others) via biologically relevant relationships constitutes a significant advancement for complex, heterogeneous data analysis. This approach complements conventional transcriptomics analysis by extending the biological significance to higher-level phenotypes such as symptoms and side effects, which is not possible with current methods. In the long-term perspective, the SPOKE platform may also be of value to mission planners such as the NASA Human Systems Risk Board.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/11/1/42/s1, Figure S1.

    "abstract": "Summary With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with the data available in GeneLab. Subject areas: Omics, Space Sciences",
    "introduction": "Introduction Opportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized. There is presently no consensus on how best to analyze RNA-seq data, and the impact of analysis tool selection on results is an active field of research. Indeed, selections of trimming parameters (Williams et al., 2016), read aligner (Yang et al., 2015), quantification tool (Teng et al., 2016), and differential expression detection algorithm (Costa-Silva et al. 2017) all affect results. Because of such challenges, groups such as ENCODE and MINSEQE have developed standardized analysis pipelines for better comparison of RNA-seq datasets (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020; Functional Genomics Data Society, 2012). The NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) was created as a central repository for spaceflight-related omics-data. The repository includes data from experiments that profile transcription (RNA-seq, microarray), DNA/RNA methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. The most prevalent data type in this repository is RNA-seq from organisms exposed to spaceflight conditions. As of August 2020, the NASA GeneLab database has over eighty datasets with RNA-sequencing data (Table S1). These datasets include Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Arabidopsis thaliana (model higher plant), Oryzias latipes (Japanese rice fish), Helix lucorum (land snail), Brassica rapa (Fast Plant), Eruca vesicaria (arugula/edible plant), Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid), Ceratopteris richardii (aquatic fern), and the bacterium, Bacillus subtilis from experiments performed during true spaceflight on various orbital platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), as well as spaceflight-analog studies, such as hindlimb unloading and bed rest studies (Berrios et al., 2020). NASA's GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) projects have put forward an ambitious strategy focused on integrating data, metadata, and biospecimens to fully utilize the 40+ years of archived NASA Life Sciences data (Scott et al., 2020). One of the first steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets impact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data are harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientific community and held its first Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceflight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most common types of spaceflight datasets: transcription profiling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic software tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools. The main driver for developing the consensus pipeline was to present consistently processed data to the public, therefore making space-relevant multi-omics data more accessible and reusable. The overall goals were (1) to get more consistently processed data to the public; (2) to provide output data from every step of the consensus pipeline so users can download and use these “intermediate” data; (3) to support easier and more consistent analysis of space-relevant data by users including those in the NASA AWGs; and (4) to allow easier cross-analysis of experiments to identify effects that result from the spaceflight environment, independent of confounding factors. In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent. Therefore, providing new and processed datasets to the public allows biologists and others to more easily interpret these data and contributes significantly to our collective knowledge of the effects of spaceflight on terrestrial organisms. Here we present the RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) developed by the GeneLab AWG along with the rationale behind the tool settings and options selected. The RCP includes three distinct steps: data pre-processing, data processing, and differential gene expression computation/annotation (Figure 1A). These steps use tools for quality control (FastQC, MultiQC) (Andrews, 2010; Ewels et al., 2016), read trimming (TrimGalore) (Krueger 2019), mapping (STAR) (Dobin et al., 2013), quantification (RSEM) (Li and Dewey 2011), and differential gene expression calculation/annotation (DESeq2) (Love et al. 2014) (Figure 1B). The RCP has been integrated into the GeneLab database, and files produced by the RCP for each RNA-seq dataset hosted in GeneLab are and will continue to be publicly available for download. Figure 1. Open in a new tab GeneLab RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP) (A) The three broad steps of the RCP. The RCP handles (1) data preprocessing to trim sequencing adapters and to provide quality control metrics; (2) data processing to map reads to the reference genome and quantify the number of read counts per gene; and (3) differential gene expression calculation, which will provide a list of differentially expressed genes that can be sorted by adjusted p value and log fold-change. (B) The full RCP annotated with tools, input files, and output files.",
    "methods": "Methods All methods can be found in the accompanying transparent methods supplemental file.",
    "results": "Results Data pre-processing: quality control and trimming There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the first of which is data preprocessing (Figure 2A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ files from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) (Figure 2B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Data preprocessing (pipeline step 1): quality control and trimming (A) Data preprocessing pipeline. FastQ files from Illumina base-calling software are quality checked using FastQC and MultiQC. Data are then trimmed using TrimGalore and are re-checked for quality; (B) flags used for FastQC program; (C) flags used for MultiQC program; (D) flags used for TrimGalore program; trimmed reads (∗fastq.gz) are then used as input data for FastQC (B) followed by MultiQC (C) to generate trimmed read quality metrics. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The FastQC program is run on each individual sample file. However, reviewing the FastQC results for each sample file can be tedious and time consuming. Experiments typically have many sample files (biological and/or technical replicates) for multiple experimental conditions (spaceflight, ground control, etc.). For this reason, we also use the MultiQC package (Ewels et al., 2016) (Figure 2C) to create a summary statistics report that includes the same quality control result categories from FastQC across all experiment samples. After performing quality control on the raw FASTQ data, reads are trimmed using TrimGalore (Krueger 2019) to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality bases that would disrupt read mapping during the data processing pipeline step (Figure 2D). TrimGalore is a wrapper program that uses the cutadapt program (Martin 2011) for read trimming. TrimGalore was selected for the RCP due to its simplified command line interface, thorough output of trimming metrics, and ability to automatically detect adapters. In this step, bases that are part of a sequencing adapter or of low quality are removed from each read, and reads that become too short are subsequently removed. After trimming, the quality control programs, FastQC and MultiQC, are again run on the trimmed FASTQ files for viewing the quality control metrics of the reads that will be used for data processing. Once the data have been preprocessed, the sequenced reads are ready for mapping and quantification. Data processing: read mapping and sample quantification In the data processing step (Figure 1; Step 2A), the trimmed reads are first aligned to the reference genome (Figure 3A) with STAR, a splice-aware aligner (Dobin et al., 2013). STAR must be run in two steps. The first step is to create indexed genome files (Figure 3B). These files are used to assist read mapping and only need to be generated once for each reference genome file. This step requires reference FASTA and GTF files (Table S2). Some datasets include the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in control—a pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths and GC content covering a 220 concentration range (Jiang et al., 2011). If ERCC spike-ins were included, the spike-in FASTA and GTF files are appended to the reference FASTA and GTF files, respectively. The second step of STAR mapping is to use the indexed reference genome and the trimmed reads from the preprocessing step in order to map the reads to the genome and the transcriptome (Figure 3C). STAR will also produce genome mapped data, which can optionally be used to find reads that map outside of annotated reference transcripts. STAR mapping output data are in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format, which has a separate entry for each mapped read and states which transcript each read is mapped to. In order to improve the detection and quantification of splice sites, STAR is run in “two-pass mode.” Here, splice sites are detected in the initial mapping to the reference and used to build a new reference that includes these splice sites. Reads are then re-mapped to this dynamically generated reference to improve the quantification of splice isoforms (Dobin et al., 2013). Users are provided with these results (as per sample SJ.out files) for further analysis of differential splicing. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2A): read mapping (A) Data processing pipeline. Trimmed reads are mapped to their reference genome and transcriptome with STAR. Gene counts are then quantified with RSEM; (B) flags used for generating the indexed STAR reference files; (C) flags used for mapping reads with STAR. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The second part of processing is quantifying the number of reads mapped to each annotated transcript and gene (Figure 1A; Step 2B, Figure 4A). For this task, the RCP uses RSEM (Li and Dewey 2011). The main reasons for using RSEM are its ability to account for reads that map to multiple transcripts and distinguish gene isoforms. In short-read sequencing experiments it is likely that some number of reads will map to multiple regions in the genome. RSEM computes maximum likelihood abundance estimates to split the read count across multiple genes. Similar to STAR, RSEM is run in two distinct phases (Figure 4A). The first phase uses the reference genome and GTF files (with or without ERCC as appropriate) (Table S2) to prepare indexed genome files (Figure 4B). The second phase uses the indexed files and the mapped reads from STAR to assign counts to each gene (Figure 4C). There are two output files generated for each sample: counts assigned to genes and counts assigned to isoforms. Gene counts are used to calculate differential gene expression. Isoform counts are also generated as an option to look at differential isoform expression but are not used during differential gene expression calculation in the RCP. Once the RSEM count files are generated, the data are used to compute differentially expressed genes. A list of the reference genomes used in the GeneLab pipeline is available in Table S2 . These reference genomes were the most recent releases at the time each STAR and RSEM indexed references were created. Although it is possible to run STAR mapping through the RSEM toolkit, we elected not to do this because the alignment parameters used in this case are from ENCODE's STAR-RSEM pipeline and are not customizable. Thus, we would have been precluded from using the precise mapping parameters agreed to by the GeneLab AWG. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2B): gene quantification (A) Data processing pipeline. Mapping results from STAR are quantified by RSEM; (B) parameters for RSEM indexed reference files generation; (C) parameters for quantifying gene and isoform counts with RSEM. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS repository.We elected to adopt a mapping-based approach rather than rapidly quantifying the reads via a k-mer-based counting algorithm, pseudo-aligners, or a quasi-mapping method that utilizes RNA-seq inference procedures such as Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) or Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) despite their speed advantages. This is because alignment-free quantification tools do not accurately quantify low-abundant and small RNAs especially when biological variation is present (Wu et al., 2018). Furthermore, alignment of reads allows for additional analyses beyond transcript and gene quantification such as measurement of gene body coverage and detection of novel transcripts. There are several alignment-based mapping tools available and each has advantages and disadvantages. An alignment tool that is sensitive to splice-isoforms is critical to accurately identify how expression of splice-isoforms is affected by the spaceflight environment. DNA-specific aligners such as BWA (Li and Durbin 2009) and Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) cannot handle intron-sized gaps and thus an RNA-seq-specific aligner is needed (Baruzzo et al., 2017). In addition to splice-awareness, when selecting an aligner the following criteria were also considered: ability to input both single- and paired-end reads, handle strand-specific data, applicability to a variety of different model organisms with both low- and high-complexity genomic regions, efficient runtime and memory usage, ability to identify chimeric reads, high sensitivity, low rate of false discovery, and ability to output both genome and transcriptome alignments. Several studies have been conducted to compare the wide variety of available RNA-seq specific alignment tools, and of these, the STAR aligner consistently performs better than or on par with the tools tested for the indicated criteria (Baruzzo et al., 2017; Schaarschmidt et al., 2020; Raplee et al. 2019). Differential gene expression calculations and addition of gene annotations Once reads have been mapped and quantified, differential expression analysis is performed using the DESeq2 R package (Figure 1; Step 3, Figure 5A). Unlike the previous steps, a custom R script (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R or GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R) (Data S1and S2) is used to run DESeq2; to create both unnormalized and normalized counts tables; and to generate a differential gene expression (DGE) output table containing normalized counts for each sample, DGE results, and gene annotations (Figure 5B). The GeneLab DGE R script also creates computer-readable tables that are used by the GeneLab visualization portal to generate various plots so users can easily view and begin interpreting the processed data. These scripts are provided in the NASA GeneLab_Data_Processing Github repository (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). In the following sections we describe each step of these scripts in order. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differential gene expression calculation (pipeline step 3) (A) Data processing pipeline. The R program DESeq2 is run in order to determine which genes are differentially expressed between experimental conditions using gene count files from RSEM. (B) Output files generated. The table columns distinguish which script produces each output. The columns distinguish how those output files are used.The GeneLab DGE R script requires three inputs: the quantified count data from the previous (RSEM) step; sample metadata from the Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) tables in the ISA.zip file (provided in the GeneLab repository with each dataset) (Sansone et al., 2012; Rocca-Serra et al., 2010); and the organisms.csv file (Table S3), which is used to specify the organism used in the study and relevant gene annotations to load. Because samples from some GeneLab RNA-seq datasets contain ERCC spike-in and others do not, there are two versions of the GeneLab DGE R script, one for datasets with ERCC spike-in (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R, Data S1) and one for those without (GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, Data S2). Prior to running either script, paths to directories containing the input data and the output data location must be defined. Each script starts by defining the organism used in the study, which should be consistent with the name in the organisms.csv file so that it matches the abbreviations used in the PANTHER database (Mi et al. 2013; Thomas 2003) for that organism. Next, the metadata from the ISA.zip file are imported and formatted for use with the DESeq2 package. During metadata formatting, groups for comparison are defined based on experimental factors, and a sample table is created to specify the group to which each sample belongs. Next, a contrasts matrix is generated, which specifies the groups that will be compared during DGE analysis; each group is compared with every other group in a pairwise manner in both directions (i.e. spaceflight versus ground and ground versus spaceflight). This approach provides the user with the results for all possible group comparisons, allowing each user to select the most relevant comparisons for their particular scientific questions. After metadata formatting, the RSEM gene count data files from each sample are listed and re-ordered (to match the order the samples appear in the metadata), then imported with the R package, tximport (Soneson et al., 2015), and sample names are assigned. Prior to running DESeq2, a value of 1 is added to genes with lengths of zero, which is necessary to make a DESeqDataSet object. A DESeqDataSet object is then created using the formatted metadata and the count data that was imported with tximport. For datasets that contain samples with ERCC spike-in, we use the GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R script (Data S1). To reduce the possibility of skewing the data during DESeq2 normalization (McIntyre et al., 2011; Risso et al., 2011; Conesa et al., 2016; Law et al., 2016), all genes that have a sum of less than 10 counts across all samples are removed. The cutoff value of 10 is a best practice recommended by the DESeq2 tutorial on Bioconductor. These filtered data are then prepared for normalization and DGE analysis with DESeq2. Because there is no consensus for whether or not ERCC-normalization improves the accuracy of the results (Risso et al., 2014), the GeneLab project and its AWG members decided to perform the DGE analysis both with and without ERCC-normalization (for datasets with samples containing ERCC spike-in). To enable DESeq2 analysis with and without considering ERCC reads, the DESeqDataSet object is used to create a DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads. Because all samples must contain ERCC spike-in for ERCC-normalization, the DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads is used to identify and remove any samples that do not contain ERCC reads. Next, a DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads is created by removing rows containing ERCC reads. These data are then used for DESeq2 analysis. For DESeq2 analysis with ERCC-normalization (Data S2), the size factor object of the non-ERCC data is replaced with group B ERCC size factors for re-scaling in the first DESeq2 step. Group B ERCC genes contain the same concentration in both mix1 and mix 2. Therefore, only group B ERCC genes are used for generating the size factors for re-scaling duirng ERCC-normalization. For DESeq2 analysis without ERCC-normalization, the DESeq2 default algorithm is applied to the DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads. The unnormalized and DESeq2-normalized count data as well as the sample table are then outputted as CSV files. The “Unnormalized_Counts.csv,” “Normalized_Counts.csv,” and “ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv” files for each RNA-seq dataset are available in the GeneLab Data Repository; the “SampleTable.csv” file is used internally for verifying and validating the processed data prior to publication. There are two types of hypothesis tests that can be run with DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which is similar to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculation in linear regression and allows for comparison across all groups, and the Wald test, in which the estimated standard error of a log2 fold change is used to compare differences between two groups. The DGE step of the RCP performs both of these analyses. After normalization, the DESeq2 likelihood ratio test design is applied to the normalized data (both ERCC- and nonERCC-normalized data) to generate the F statistic p value, which is similar to an ANOVA p value and reveals genes that are changed in any number of combinations of all factors defined in the experiment. To prepare for building a gene/pathway annotation database, the STRINGdb (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) and PANTHER.db (Thomas 2003) libraries are loaded, and the organisms.csv file is read and used to indicate the Bioconductor AnnotationData Package needed (Huber et al., 2015; Gentleman et al., 2004). The current gene annotation database for the organism specified at the beginning of the R script is then loaded. Next, DGE tables containing normalized counts for each sample, pairwise DGE results, and current gene annotations as well as computer-readable DGE tables (that will be used for visualization) are created first with nonERCC-normalized data and then with ERCC-normalized data. For pairwise DGE analysis, first normalized count data are used to create two output tables: one that is used to create the human-readable DGE output table provided to users with processed data for each dataset and the other respective computer-readable DGE output table that contains additional columns and is used to visualize the data. Next, normalized count data are iterated through Wald Tests to generate pairwise comparisons of all groups based on the contrasts matrix that was generated during metadata formatting. The pairwise DGE analysis results are then added as columns to both DGE output tables. Then an annotation database is built by first defining the “keytype,” which indicates the primary type of annotation used (for most GeneLab datasets this is ENSEMBL). The keytype is then used to map to annotations in the organism-specific Bioconductor AnnotationData Package, and the following annotation columns are added to the annotation database: SYMBOL, GENENAME, ENSEMBL (if not the primary), REFSEQ, and ENTREZID. STRING and GOSLIM annotation columns are also added to the annotation database using the STRINGdb and PANTHER.db R packages, respectively. All of the aforementioned annotation columns are added to the annotation database to enable users to perform downstream analyses without having to map gene IDs themselves. Once the annotation database is complete, additional calculations are performed on the normalized count data before assembling the final DGE output tables. Means and standard deviations of normalized count data for each gene across all samples, and for samples within each respective group, are calculated and added as columns to the DGE output tables. A column containing the F statistic p value, calculated previously, is also added to the DGE output tables. The following columns are added only to the computer-readable DGE output table (used for visualization): a column to indicate whether each gene (or pathway) is up- or downregulated for each pairwise comparison, a column to indicate genes that are differentially expressed using a p value cutoff of ≤0.1 and another column using a p value cutoff of ≤0.05, a column indicating the log2 of the p value for each pairwise comparison and another column indicating the log2 of the adjusted p value, both of which are used to create Volcano plots. After all columns are added to the DGE tables, both the human- and computer-readable DGE tables are combined with the current annotation database to create the complete human- and computer-readable DGE tables. An example of the complete human readable DGE tables provided with processed RNAseq datasets in the GeneLab Data Repository is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Principal component analysis (PCA) is also performed on the normalized count data and used to create PCA plots for the GeneLab data visualization portal. DGE analysis of datasets without ERCC spike-in is performed exactly the same way as the nonERCC-normalized approach described above, except that no ERCC reads have to be removed from the DESeqDataSet object prior to DESeq analysis.

To showcase the value of using a consensus pipeline and publishing the processed data from each step of the pipeline, downstream analyses were performed using processed data from select samples from RNAseq datasets hosted on GeneLab. One of the advantages of providing expression data of all samples in each dataset as well as all possible pairwise DGE comparisons is to allow users the flexibility to pick and choose which samples and which comparisons they would like to focus on. Thus, when selecting samples for downstream analysis, we exercised this flexibility and searched the GeneLab Data Repository for datasets/samples that met a specific set of criteria. These criteria were as follows: (1) datasets that evaluated the same tissue (liver) from the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) and sex (female), (2) only samples derived from animals flown in space and respective ground control samples, (3) studies that used the same preservation protocol (liver samples extracted from frozen carcasses post-mission) and library preparation method (ribo-depletion), and (4) samples that contained ERCC spike-in to evaluate outputs with and without ERCC normalization. Select samples from two GeneLab datasets, GLDS-168 and GLDS-245, met these criteria, and processed data including the Normalized_Counts.csv, differential_expression.csv, ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv, and the ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files from these two datasets were used for downstream analyses. Prior to downstream analysis, the processed data files were filtered so that only samples that met the criteria listed above were included. Because GLDS-168 contains samples from both the Rodent Research 1 (RR-1) and RR-3 missions and only the RR-1 mission met our first criteria of using the C57BL/6 mouse strain, RR-3 samples were removed from the process data files. GLDS-168 processed data files were subsequently filtered to remove all samples, except spaceflight (FLT) and respective ground control (GC) samples, to meet the second criteria listed above. Lastly, because GLDS-168 contains a set of FLT and GC samples that were spiked with ERCC and another set in which ERCC was not added, the later set of samples were removed to meet the fourth criteria. GLDS-245 contains liver samples from the RR-6 mission, which included a set of animals that were returned to earth alive after ∼30 days of spaceflight and another set of animals that remained in space (aboard the ISS) for a total of ∼60 days before being sacrificed aboard the ISS (note that there were respective control samples for each set of spaceflight animals described). The former set of animals had their livers dissected immediately after euthanasia, whereas livers from the latter set of animals were frozen in situ and dissected from frozen carcasses after return to earth. Thus, only the later (ISS-terminal) set of FLT and respective GC samples met criteria 2 and 3, so the GLDS-245 processed data files were filtered to remove all other samples. In addition, because the downstream analyses focused on the differences between FLT and GC samples in these two datasets, all other comparisons were removed from the differential_expression.csv and ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files prior to analysis. The filtered processed data files (available in Mendeley Data, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/fv3kd6h7k4.1) were then used to create Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots (Figures 6A, 6B, S1A, and S1B), heatmaps containing the top 30 most significant FLT versus GC differentially expressed (and annotated) genes (adj. p value <0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) (Figures 6C, 6D, S1C, and S1D), and to evaluate FLT versus GC gene ontology (GO) differences using Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA) analysis (Tables 3 and S5). These results can then be further evaluated to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between these two studies and draw novel conclusions about the effects of spaceflight that are consistent across spaceflight experiments.

    "discussion": "Discussion The differentially expressed genes calculated by the RCP can be further explored with a variety of tools designed for higher-order analysis. For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and/or metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab working group members include WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), PIANO (Väremo et al. 2013), Reactome (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), and ToppFun (Chen et al., 2009). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives. The RCP has been designed to handle sequencing experiments that either lack or include the ERCC RNA spike-in mix—a set of 96 polyadenylated RNAs that can be used during differential gene expression calculation to normalize read counts across samples (Munro et al., 2014). However, the use of normalization according to ERCC spike-ins remains controversial among AWG members, and Munro et al. suggested its usage only for determining limit of detection of ratio (LODR), expression ratio variability, and measurement bias (Munro et al., 2014). For this reason, ERCC normalization remains optional in the GeneLab pipeline, and both kinds of DGE outputs are provided in the GeneLab database. In addition, ERCC spike-in could have two other usages. First, it allows us to evaluate whether normalization succeeded in removing systemic bias between libraries by using methods such as Rlog and VST when normalizing the spike-in RNAs along with all other genes. Second, most normalization methods of RNA-seq data assume that most genes are not differentially expressed toward one direction. Comparing spike-in measurements between libraries will help us to estimate the validity of this assumption. A high number of biological replicates can increase certainty in the differentially expressed genes determined by the RCP. However, conducting experiments in spaceflight often limits the number of biological replicates that a researcher can include. Therefore, it is important to note that at least three biological replicates are required for the pipeline, specifically for DESeq2, to perform its statistical methods. However, at least six replicates are suggested in order to minimize the false discovery rate (FDR) (Schurch et al., 2016). Finally, RNA-seq datasets hosted on GeneLab that do not contain biological replicates are only processed up until unnormalized (raw) counts are obtained, the step right before DESeq2 is used for DGE calculation. More advanced RCP users might have additional data inquiries that fall beyond the scope of this pipeline. For this reason, there are two parts of the pipeline that include additional output that are not used in our differential gene expression computation. The first is in the output from STAR, mapping output is also provided in genomic coordinates. This is useful for obtaining reads that are mapped outside of the reference transcriptome. For example, this may be used to find novel genes, transcripts, or exons that have not yet been annotated by consortiums. The second part of the pipeline with alternative output files is RSEM. This also provides transcript-level counts that can be used to investigate differential isoform expression. Moreover, intermediate files are provided as outputs to allow users to use components of the pipeline that they find useful. The GeneLab database also includes other types of transcriptomic data. As discussed in this article, the RCP is not used for microarray data that are fundamentally different, and the AWG is still debating the best approach for cross-dataset comparisons between microarrays. GeneLab also accepts data from long read experiments, such as those produced by Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Roberts et al. 2013) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing (Jain et al., 2016). Long-read data would be processed with similar steps to the RCP but will require tools specifically designed for the intricacies of long-read data, such as reads that contain multiple splice junctions and reads that currently have a higher base-calling error rate. Currently, long-reads are typically used for DNA sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the ISS using ONT for de novo assembly of the Escherichia coli genome from raw reads (Castro-Wallace et al., 2017). However, even though throughput and accuracy remain far inferior to short-reads, long-reads offer some advantages for RNA-seq as well, with less ambiguity for genes and isoforms detection, much faster mapping, potential identification of genes not yet known from reference genomes, and eventually less bias in DGE. To conclude, the RCP is specifically designed for RNA-seq data from short-read sequencers and has been developed in order to encourage and facilitate analysis of spaceflight multi-omic data. The creation of the RCP by a large community of scientists (GeneLab AWG: https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg) and the sharing of pipeline details in a peer-reviewed article provide analysis transparency and enable data reproducibility. Limitations of the study The results of this study are limited to short-read RNA-seq and are not applicable to other transcriptomic profiling methods (e.g. microarray, long-read RNA-seq). In addition, the pipeline cannot compensate for poor library preparation technique or inadequate sample size. Sample preservation protocols between datasets need to also be evaluated, because variations in sample preservation protocol could lead to poor correlation between studies that are otherwise identical (Lai Polo et al., 2020). The number of sequenced reads may also be a limiting factor in the usefulness and accuracy of the differentially expressed genes calculated by DESeq2 and, similarly, during splice isoform analysis. Note that this article does not discuss strategies and pipelines regarding older transcriptomics data in GeneLab (i.e. more than 100 microarray datasets), as it is much more challenging to provide meta-analysis with microarrays, which are prone to strong batch effects and gene lists that are platform dependent. Future efforts of GeneLab and the AWG will address microarray pipelines. In the future, we will add functionality to process unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that can identify PCR duplicates using tools such as UMI tools (Smith et al. 2017). This will allow PCR duplicates to be removed after mapping and before quantification. In addition, transcriptomic data will be integrated with proteomic and metabolomics data; this will help further understand the significance of gene expression changes to metabolic “fitness” in the spaceflight environment.

Copyright notice ID: 8044432 PMID: 33870146 Summary With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with the data available in GeneLab.

In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized. There is presently no consensus on how best to analyze RNA-seq data, and the impact of analysis tool selection on results is an active field of research. Indeed, selections of trimming parameters (Williams et al., 2016), read aligner (Yang et al., 2015), quantification tool (Teng et al., 2016), and differential expression detection algorithm (Costa-Silva et al. 2017) all affect results. Because of such challenges, groups such as ENCODE and MINSEQE have developed standardized analysis pipelines for better comparison of RNA-seq datasets (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020; Functional Genomics Data Society, 2012). The NASA GeneLab database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) was created as a central repository for spaceflight-related omics-data. The repository includes data from experiments that profile transcription (RNA-seq, microarray), DNA/RNA methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. The most prevalent data type in this repository is RNA-seq from organisms exposed to spaceflight conditions. As of August 2020, the NASA GeneLab database has over eighty datasets with RNA-sequencing data (Table S1). These datasets include Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Arabidopsis thaliana (model higher plant), Oryzias latipes (Japanese rice fish), Helix lucorum (land snail), Brassica rapa (Fast Plant), Eruca vesicaria (arugula/edible plant), Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid), Ceratopteris richardii (aquatic fern), and the bacterium, Bacillus subtilis from experiments performed during true spaceflight on various orbital platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), as well as spaceflight-analog studies, such as hindlimb unloading and bed rest studies (Berrios et al., 2020). NASA's GeneLab and Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) projects have put forward an ambitious strategy focused on integrating data, metadata, and biospecimens to fully utilize the 40+ years of archived NASA Life Sciences data (Scott et al., 2020). One of the first steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets impact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data are harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientific community and held its first Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceflight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most common types of spaceflight datasets: transcription profiling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic software tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools. The main driver for developing the consensus pipeline was to present consistently processed data to the public, therefore making space-relevant multi-omics data more accessible and reusable. The overall goals were (1) to get more consistently processed data to the public; (2) to provide output data from every step of the consensus pipeline so users can download and use these “intermediate” data; (3) to support easier and more consistent analysis of space-relevant data by users including those in the NASA AWGs; and (4) to allow easier cross-analysis of experiments to identify effects that result from the spaceflight environment, independent of confounding factors. In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent. Therefore, providing new and processed datasets to the public allows biologists and others to more easily interpret these data and contributes significantly to our collective knowledge of the effects of spaceflight on terrestrial organisms. Here we present the RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) developed by the GeneLab AWG along with the rationale behind the tool settings and options selected. The RCP includes three distinct steps: data pre-processing, data processing, and differential gene expression computation/annotation (Figure 1A). These steps use tools for quality control (FastQC, MultiQC) (Andrews, 2010; Ewels et al., 2016), read trimming (TrimGalore) (Krueger 2019), mapping (STAR) (Dobin et al., 2013), quantification (RSEM) (Li and Dewey 2011), and differential gene expression calculation/annotation (DESeq2) (Love et al. 2014) (Figure 1B). The RCP has been integrated into the GeneLab database, and files produced by the RCP for each RNA-seq dataset hosted in GeneLab are and will continue to be publicly available for download. Figure 1. Open in a new tab GeneLab RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP) (A) The three broad steps of the RCP. The RCP handles (1) data preprocessing to trim sequencing adapters and to provide quality control metrics; (2) data processing to map reads to the reference genome and quantify the number of read counts per gene; and (3) differential gene expression calculation, which will provide a list of differentially expressed genes that can be sorted by adjusted p value and log fold-change. (B) The full RCP annotated with tools, input files, and output files.Results Data pre-processing: quality control and trimming There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the first of which is data preprocessing (Figure 2A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ files from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) (Figure 2B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Data preprocessing (pipeline step 1): quality control and trimming (A) Data preprocessing pipeline. FastQ files from Illumina base-calling software are quality checked using FastQC and MultiQC. Data are then trimmed using TrimGalore and are re-checked for quality; (B) flags used for FastQC program; (C) flags used for MultiQC program; (D) flags used for TrimGalore program; trimmed reads (∗fastq.gz) are then used as input data for FastQC (B) followed by MultiQC (C) to generate trimmed read quality metrics. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The FastQC program is run on each individual sample file. However, reviewing the FastQC results for each sample file can be tedious and time consuming. Experiments typically have many sample files (biological and/or technical replicates) for multiple experimental conditions (spaceflight, ground control, etc.). For this reason, we also use the MultiQC package (Ewels et al., 2016) (Figure 2C) to create a summary statistics report that includes the same quality control result categories from FastQC across all experiment samples. After performing quality control on the raw FASTQ data, reads are trimmed using TrimGalore (Krueger 2019) to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality bases that would disrupt read mapping during the data processing pipeline step (Figure 2D). TrimGalore is a wrapper program that uses the cutadapt program (Martin 2011) for read trimming. TrimGalore was selected for the RCP due to its simplified command line interface, thorough output of trimming metrics, and ability to automatically detect adapters. In this step, bases that are part of a sequencing adapter or of low quality are removed from each read, and reads that become too short are subsequently removed. After trimming, the quality control programs, FastQC and MultiQC, are again run on the trimmed FASTQ files for viewing the quality control metrics of the reads that will be used for data processing. Once the data have been preprocessed, the sequenced reads are ready for mapping and quantification.Data processing: read mapping and sample quantification In the data processing step (Figure 1; Step 2A), the trimmed reads are first aligned to the reference genome (Figure 3A) with STAR, a splice-aware aligner (Dobin et al., 2013). STAR must be run in two steps. The first step is to create indexed genome files (Figure 3B). These files are used to assist read mapping and only need to be generated once for each reference genome file. This step requires reference FASTA and GTF files (Table S2). Some datasets include the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in control—a pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths and GC content covering a 220 concentration range (Jiang et al., 2011). If ERCC spike-ins were included, the spike-in FASTA and GTF files are appended to the reference FASTA and GTF files, respectively. The second step of STAR mapping is to use the indexed reference genome and the trimmed reads from the preprocessing step in order to map the reads to the genome and the transcriptome (Figure 3C). STAR will also produce genome mapped data, which can optionally be used to find reads that map outside of annotated reference transcripts. STAR mapping output data are in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format, which has a separate entry for each mapped read and states which transcript each read is mapped to. In order to improve the detection and quantification of splice sites, STAR is run in “two-pass mode.” Here, splice sites are detected in the initial mapping to the reference and used to build a new reference that includes these splice sites. Reads are then re-mapped to this dynamically generated reference to improve the quantification of splice isoforms (Dobin et al., 2013). Users are provided with these results (as per sample SJ.out files) for further analysis of differential splicing. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2A): read mapping (A) Data processing pipeline. Trimmed reads are mapped to their reference genome and transcriptome with STAR. Gene counts are then quantified with RSEM; (B) flags used for generating the indexed STAR reference files; (C) flags used for mapping reads with STAR. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS Repository.The second part of processing is quantifying the number of reads mapped to each annotated transcript and gene (Figure 1A; Step 2B, Figure 4A). For this task, the RCP uses RSEM (Li and Dewey 2011). The main reasons for using RSEM are its ability to account for reads that map to multiple transcripts and distinguish gene isoforms. In short-read sequencing experiments it is likely that some number of reads will map to multiple regions in the genome. RSEM computes maximum likelihood abundance estimates to split the read count across multiple genes. Similar to STAR, RSEM is run in two distinct phases (Figure 4A). The first phase uses the reference genome and GTF files (with or without ERCC as appropriate) (Table S2) to prepare indexed genome files (Figure 4B). The second phase uses the indexed files and the mapped reads from STAR to assign counts to each gene (Figure 4C). There are two output files generated for each sample: counts assigned to genes and counts assigned to isoforms. Gene counts are used to calculate differential gene expression. Isoform counts are also generated as an option to look at differential isoform expression but are not used during differential gene expression calculation in the RCP. Once the RSEM count files are generated, the data are used to compute differentially expressed genes. A list of the reference genomes used in the GeneLab pipeline is available in Table S2 . These reference genomes were the most recent releases at the time each STAR and RSEM indexed references were created. Although it is possible to run STAR mapping through the RSEM toolkit, we elected not to do this because the alignment parameters used in this case are from ENCODE's STAR-RSEM pipeline and are not customizable. Thus, we would have been precluded from using the precise mapping parameters agreed to by the GeneLab AWG. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Data processing (pipeline step 2B): gene quantification (A) Data processing pipeline. Mapping results from STAR are quantified by RSEM; (B) parameters for RSEM indexed reference files generation; (C) parameters for quantifying gene and isoform counts with RSEM. Tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the RNA-seq processing protocol in the GLDS repository.We elected to adopt a mapping-based approach rather than rapidly quantifying the reads via a k-mer-based counting algorithm, pseudo-aligners, or a quasi-mapping method that utilizes RNA-seq inference procedures such as Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) or Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) despite their speed advantages. This is because alignment-free quantification tools do not accurately quantify low-abundant and small RNAs especially when biological variation is present (Wu et al., 2018). Furthermore, alignment of reads allows for additional analyses beyond transcript and gene quantification such as measurement of gene body coverage and detection of novel transcripts. There are several alignment-based mapping tools available and each has advantages and disadvantages. An alignment tool that is sensitive to splice-isoforms is critical to accurately identify how expression of splice-isoforms is affected by the spaceflight environment. DNA-specific aligners such as BWA (Li and Durbin 2009) and Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) cannot handle intron-sized gaps and thus an RNA-seq-specific aligner is needed (Baruzzo et al., 2017). In addition to splice-awareness, when selecting an aligner the following criteria were also considered: ability to input both single- and paired-end reads, handle strand-specific data, applicability to a variety of different model organisms with both low- and high-complexity genomic regions, efficient runtime and memory usage, ability to identify chimeric reads, high sensitivity, low rate of false discovery, and ability to output both genome and transcriptome alignments. Several studies have been conducted to compare the wide variety of available RNA-seq specific alignment tools, and of these, the STAR aligner consistently performs better than or on par with the tools tested for the indicated criteria (Baruzzo et al., 2017; Schaarschmidt et al., 2020; Raplee et al. 2019).Differential gene expression calculations and addition of gene annotations Once reads have been mapped and quantified, differential expression analysis is performed using the DESeq2 R package (Figure 1; Step 3, Figure 5A). Unlike the previous steps, a custom R script (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R or GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R) (Data S1and S2) is used to run DESeq2; to create both unnormalized and normalized counts tables; and to generate a differential gene expression (DGE) output table containing normalized counts for each sample, DGE results, and gene annotations (Figure 5B). The GeneLab DGE R script also creates computer-readable tables that are used by the GeneLab visualization portal to generate various plots so users can easily view and begin interpreting the processed data. These scripts are provided in the NASA GeneLab_Data_Processing Github repository (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing). In the following sections we describe each step of these scripts in order. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differential gene expression calculation (pipeline step 3) (A) Data processing pipeline. The R program DESeq2 is run in order to determine which genes are differentially expressed between experimental conditions using gene count files from RSEM. (B) Output files generated. The table columns distinguish which script produces each output. The columns distinguish how those output files are used.The GeneLab DGE R script requires three inputs: the quantified count data from the previous (RSEM) step; sample metadata from the Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) tables in the ISA.zip file (provided in the GeneLab repository with each dataset) (Sansone et al., 2012; Rocca-Serra et al., 2010); and the organisms.csv file (Table S3), which is used to specify the organism used in the study and relevant gene annotations to load. Because samples from some GeneLab RNA-seq datasets contain ERCC spike-in and others do not, there are two versions of the GeneLab DGE R script, one for datasets with ERCC spike-in (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R, Data S1) and one for those without (GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, Data S2). Prior to running either script, paths to directories containing the input data and the output data location must be defined. Each script starts by defining the organism used in the study, which should be consistent with the name in the organisms.csv file so that it matches the abbreviations used in the PANTHER database (Mi et al. 2013; Thomas 2003) for that organism. Next, the metadata from the ISA.zip file are imported and formatted for use with the DESeq2 package. During metadata formatting, groups for comparison are defined based on experimental factors, and a sample table is created to specify the group to which each sample belongs. Next, a contrasts matrix is generated, which specifies the groups that will be compared during DGE analysis; each group is compared with every other group in a pairwise manner in both directions (i.e. spaceflight versus ground and ground versus spaceflight). This approach provides the user with the results for all possible group comparisons, allowing each user to select the most relevant comparisons for their particular scientific questions. After metadata formatting, the RSEM gene count data files from each sample are listed and re-ordered (to match the order the samples appear in the metadata), then imported with the R package, tximport (Soneson et al., 2015), and sample names are assigned. Prior to running DESeq2, a value of 1 is added to genes with lengths of zero, which is necessary to make a DESeqDataSet object. A DESeqDataSet object is then created using the formatted metadata and the count data that was imported with tximport. For datasets that contain samples with ERCC spike-in, we use the GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R script (Data S1). To reduce the possibility of skewing the data during DESeq2 normalization (McIntyre et al., 2011; Risso et al., 2011; Conesa et al., 2016; Law et al., 2016), all genes that have a sum of less than 10 counts across all samples are removed. The cutoff value of 10 is a best practice recommended by the DESeq2 tutorial on Bioconductor. These filtered data are then prepared for normalization and DGE analysis with DESeq2. Because there is no consensus for whether or not ERCC-normalization improves the accuracy of the results (Risso et al., 2014), the GeneLab project and its AWG members decided to perform the DGE analysis both with and without ERCC-normalization (for datasets with samples containing ERCC spike-in). To enable DESeq2 analysis with and without considering ERCC reads, the DESeqDataSet object is used to create a DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads. Because all samples must contain ERCC spike-in for ERCC-normalization, the DESeqDataSet object containing only ERCC reads is used to identify and remove any samples that do not contain ERCC reads. Next, a DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads is created by removing rows containing ERCC reads. These data are then used for DESeq2 analysis. For DESeq2 analysis with ERCC-normalization (Data S2), the size factor object of the non-ERCC data is replaced with group B ERCC size factors for re-scaling in the first DESeq2 step. Group B ERCC genes contain the same concentration in both mix1 and mix 2. Therefore, only group B ERCC genes are used for generating the size factors for re-scaling duirng ERCC-normalization. For DESeq2 analysis without ERCC-normalization, the DESeq2 default algorithm is applied to the DESeqDataSet object containing only non-ERCC reads. The unnormalized and DESeq2-normalized count data as well as the sample table are then outputted as CSV files. The “Unnormalized_Counts.csv,” “Normalized_Counts.csv,” and “ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv” files for each RNA-seq dataset are available in the GeneLab Data Repository; the “SampleTable.csv” file is used internally for verifying and validating the processed data prior to publication. There are two types of hypothesis tests that can be run with DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT), which is similar to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculation in linear regression and allows for comparison across all groups, and the Wald test, in which the estimated standard error of a log2 fold change is used to compare differences between two groups. The DGE step of the RCP performs both of these analyses. After normalization, the DESeq2 likelihood ratio test design is applied to the normalized data (both ERCC- and nonERCC-normalized data) to generate the F statistic p value, which is similar to an ANOVA p value and reveals genes that are changed in any number of combinations of all factors defined in the experiment. To prepare for building a gene/pathway annotation database, the STRINGdb (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) and PANTHER.db (Thomas 2003) libraries are loaded, and the organisms.csv file is read and used to indicate the Bioconductor AnnotationData Package needed (Huber et al., 2015; Gentleman et al., 2004). The current gene annotation database for the organism specified at the beginning of the R script is then loaded. Next, DGE tables containing normalized counts for each sample, pairwise DGE results, and current gene annotations as well as computer-readable DGE tables (that will be used for visualization) are created first with nonERCC-normalized data and then with ERCC-normalized data. For pairwise DGE analysis, first normalized count data are used to create two output tables: one that is used to create the human-readable DGE output table provided to users with processed data for each dataset and the other respective computer-readable DGE output table that contains additional columns and is used to visualize the data. Next, normalized count data are iterated through Wald Tests to generate pairwise comparisons of all groups based on the contrasts matrix that was generated during metadata formatting. The pairwise DGE analysis results are then added as columns to both DGE output tables. Then an annotation database is built by first defining the “keytype,” which indicates the primary type of annotation used (for most GeneLab datasets this is ENSEMBL). The keytype is then used to map to annotations in the organism-specific Bioconductor AnnotationData Package, and the following annotation columns are added to the annotation database: SYMBOL, GENENAME, ENSEMBL (if not the primary), REFSEQ, and ENTREZID. STRING and GOSLIM annotation columns are also added to the annotation database using the STRINGdb and PANTHER.db R packages, respectively. All of the aforementioned annotation columns are added to the annotation database to enable users to perform downstream analyses without having to map gene IDs themselves. Once the annotation database is complete, additional calculations are performed on the normalized count data before assembling the final DGE output tables. Means and standard deviations of normalized count data for each gene across all samples, and for samples within each respective group, are calculated and added as columns to the DGE output tables. A column containing the F statistic p value, calculated previously, is also added to the DGE output tables. The following columns are added only to the computer-readable DGE output table (used for visualization): a column to indicate whether each gene (or pathway) is up- or downregulated for each pairwise comparison, a column to indicate genes that are differentially expressed using a p value cutoff of ≤0.1 and another column using a p value cutoff of ≤0.05, a column indicating the log2 of the p value for each pairwise comparison and another column indicating the log2 of the adjusted p value, both of which are used to create Volcano plots. After all columns are added to the DGE tables, both the human- and computer-readable DGE tables are combined with the current annotation database to create the complete human- and computer-readable DGE tables. An example of the complete human readable DGE tables provided with processed RNAseq datasets in the GeneLab Data Repository is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Principal component analysis (PCA) is also performed on the normalized count data and used to create PCA plots for the GeneLab data visualization portal. DGE analysis of datasets without ERCC spike-in is performed exactly the same way as the nonERCC-normalized approach described above, except that no ERCC reads have to be removed from the DESeqDataSet object prior to DESeq analysis.

To showcase the value of using a consensus pipeline and publishing the processed data from each step of the pipeline, downstream analyses were performed using processed data from select samples from RNAseq datasets hosted on GeneLab. One of the advantages of providing expression data of all samples in each dataset as well as all possible pairwise DGE comparisons is to allow users the flexibility to pick and choose which samples and which comparisons they would like to focus on. Thus, when selecting samples for downstream analysis, we exercised this flexibility and searched the GeneLab Data Repository for datasets/samples that met a specific set of criteria. These criteria were as follows: (1) datasets that evaluated the same tissue (liver) from the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) and sex (female), (2) only samples derived from animals flown in space and respective ground control samples, (3) studies that used the same preservation protocol (liver samples extracted from frozen carcasses post-mission) and library preparation method (ribo-depletion), and (4) samples that contained ERCC spike-in to evaluate outputs with and without ERCC normalization. Select samples from two GeneLab datasets, GLDS-168 and GLDS-245, met these criteria, and processed data including the Normalized_Counts.csv, differential_expression.csv, ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv, and the ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files from these two datasets were used for downstream analyses. Prior to downstream analysis, the processed data files were filtered so that only samples that met the criteria listed above were included. Because GLDS-168 contains samples from both the Rodent Research 1 (RR-1) and RR-3 missions and only the RR-1 mission met our first criteria of using the C57BL/6 mouse strain, RR-3 samples were removed from the process data files. GLDS-168 processed data files were subsequently filtered to remove all samples, except spaceflight (FLT) and respective ground control (GC) samples, to meet the second criteria listed above. Lastly, because GLDS-168 contains a set of FLT and GC samples that were spiked with ERCC and another set in which ERCC was not added, the later set of samples were removed to meet the fourth criteria. GLDS-245 contains liver samples from the RR-6 mission, which included a set of animals that were returned to earth alive after ∼30 days of spaceflight and another set of animals that remained in space (aboard the ISS) for a total of ∼60 days before being sacrificed aboard the ISS (note that there were respective control samples for each set of spaceflight animals described). The former set of animals had their livers dissected immediately after euthanasia, whereas livers from the latter set of animals were frozen in situ and dissected from frozen carcasses after return to earth. Thus, only the later (ISS-terminal) set of FLT and respective GC samples met criteria 2 and 3, so the GLDS-245 processed data files were filtered to remove all other samples. In addition, because the downstream analyses focused on the differences between FLT and GC samples in these two datasets, all other comparisons were removed from the differential_expression.csv and ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files prior to analysis. The filtered processed data files (available in Mendeley Data, Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/fv3kd6h7k4.1) were then used to create Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots (Figures 6A, 6B, S1A, and S1B), heatmaps containing the top 30 most significant FLT versus GC differentially expressed (and annotated) genes (adj. p value <0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) (Figures 6C, 6D, S1C, and S1D), and to evaluate FLT versus GC gene ontology (GO) differences using Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA) analysis (Tables 3 and S5). These results can then be further evaluated to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between these two studies and draw novel conclusions about the effects of spaceflight that are consistent across spaceflight experiments.

For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and/or metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab working group members include WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), PIANO (Väremo et al. 2013), Reactome (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), and ToppFun (Chen et al., 2009). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives. The RCP has been designed to handle sequencing experiments that either lack or include the ERCC RNA spike-in mix—a set of 96 polyadenylated RNAs that can be used during differential gene expression calculation to normalize read counts across samples (Munro et al., 2014). However, the use of normalization according to ERCC spike-ins remains controversial among AWG members, and Munro et al. suggested its usage only for determining limit of detection of ratio (LODR), expression ratio variability, and measurement bias (Munro et al., 2014). For this reason, ERCC normalization remains optional in the GeneLab pipeline, and both kinds of DGE outputs are provided in the GeneLab database. In addition, ERCC spike-in could have two other usages. First, it allows us to evaluate whether normalization succeeded in removing systemic bias between libraries by using methods such as Rlog and VST when normalizing the spike-in RNAs along with all other genes. Second, most normalization methods of RNA-seq data assume that most genes are not differentially expressed toward one direction. Comparing spike-in measurements between libraries will help us to estimate the validity of this assumption. A high number of biological replicates can increase certainty in the differentially expressed genes determined by the RCP. However, conducting experiments in spaceflight often limits the number of biological replicates that a researcher can include. Therefore, it is important to note that at least three biological replicates are required for the pipeline, specifically for DESeq2, to perform its statistical methods. However, at least six replicates are suggested in order to minimize the false discovery rate (FDR) (Schurch et al., 2016). Finally, RNA-seq datasets hosted on GeneLab that do not contain biological replicates are only processed up until unnormalized (raw) counts are obtained, the step right before DESeq2 is used for DGE calculation. More advanced RCP users might have additional data inquiries that fall beyond the scope of this pipeline. For this reason, there are two parts of the pipeline that include additional output that are not used in our differential gene expression computation. The first is in the output from STAR, mapping output is also provided in genomic coordinates. This is useful for obtaining reads that are mapped outside of the reference transcriptome. For example, this may be used to find novel genes, transcripts, or exons that have not yet been annotated by consortiums. The second part of the pipeline with alternative output files is RSEM. This also provides transcript-level counts that can be used to investigate differential isoform expression. Moreover, intermediate files are provided as outputs to allow users to use components of the pipeline that they find useful. The GeneLab database also includes other types of transcriptomic data. As discussed in this article, the RCP is not used for microarray data that are fundamentally different, and the AWG is still debating the best approach for cross-dataset comparisons between microarrays. GeneLab also accepts data from long read experiments, such as those produced by Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (Roberts et al. 2013) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing (Jain et al., 2016). Long-read data would be processed with similar steps to the RCP but will require tools specifically designed for the intricacies of long-read data, such as reads that contain multiple splice junctions and reads that currently have a higher base-calling error rate. Currently, long-reads are typically used for DNA sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the ISS using ONT for de novo assembly of the Escherichia coli genome from raw reads (Castro-Wallace et al., 2017). However, even though throughput and accuracy remain far inferior to short-reads, long-reads offer some advantages for RNA-seq as well, with less ambiguity for genes and isoforms detection, much faster mapping, potential identification of genes not yet known from reference genomes, and eventually less bias in DGE. To conclude, the RCP is specifically designed for RNA-seq data from short-read sequencers and has been developed in order to encourage and facilitate analysis of spaceflight multi-omic data. The creation of the RCP by a large community of scientists (GeneLab AWG: https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg) and the sharing of pipeline details in a peer-reviewed article provide analysis transparency and enable data reproducibility. Limitations of the study The results of this study are limited to short-read RNA-seq and are not applicable to other transcriptomic profiling methods (e.g. microarray, long-read RNA-seq). In addition, the pipeline cannot compensate for poor library preparation technique or inadequate sample size. Sample preservation protocols between datasets need to also be evaluated, because variations in sample preservation protocol could lead to poor correlation between studies that are otherwise identical (Lai Polo et al., 2020). The number of sequenced reads may also be a limiting factor in the usefulness and accuracy of the differentially expressed genes calculated by DESeq2 and, similarly, during splice isoform analysis. Note that this article does not discuss strategies and pipelines regarding older transcriptomics data in GeneLab (i.e. more than 100 microarray datasets), as it is much more challenging to provide meta-analysis with microarrays, which are prone to strong batch effects and gene lists that are platform dependent. Future efforts of GeneLab and the AWG will address microarray pipelines. In the future, we will add functionality to process unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that can identify PCR duplicates using tools such as UMI tools (Smith et al. 2017). This will allow PCR duplicates to be removed after mapping and before quantification. In addition, transcriptomic data will be integrated with proteomic and metabolomics data; this will help further understand the significance of gene expression changes to metabolic “fitness” in the spaceflight environment.Resource availability Lead contact Jonathan M.

    "abstract": "Abstract Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a significant health risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies. For broader scientific impact, all datasets from this study are available through an interactive data portal, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Open Science Data Repository (OSDR).

    "introduction": "Introduction In preparation for long-duration lunar and Mars missions, it is crucial to investigate the health risks to astronauts that are posed by exposure to the space environment1. The key physiological impairments include DNA damage and oxidative stress from galactic cosmic radiation2, bone and muscle damage from loss of gravity3,4, circadian and sleep dysregulation5, microbial dysbiosis6 and tissue and organ degeneration, including cardiovascular and CNS damage7. Studies on animal models have shown several spaceflight stressors directly impacting brain molecular mechanisms causing neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and neurovascular damage8–11. Specifically, exposure to simulated space radiation at doses comparable to the ones expected during the planned Mars mission, leads to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in vivo and in tissue and cell models12, as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits in rodent models. Furthermore, major physiological effects of microgravity in low-Earth orbit, as observed at the International Space Station (ISS), include a redistribution of body fluids from lower towards upper body parts, leading to significant cardiovascular13 and CNS changes14. However, deeper investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms and specificity of these impairments, and identify targets for countermeasure development. Studies performed directly on astronauts have to be minimally invasive, resulting in limited information on molecular and cellular level outcomes, while spaceflown rodent models allow the range of subcellular to behavioral-level investigation of spaceflight effects. In this study, we used spatial transcriptomics and multiomics to explore spaceflight-induced molecular changes in brain tissue of young adult female BALB/c mice samples obtained during the Rodent Research-3 (RR-3) mission and requested from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC). We combined single-nucleus multiomics (i.e., snMultiomics, RNA and ATAC sequencing) with Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data to study changes in chromatin accessibility and RNA expression in different cell types and brain regions and to identify key regional and cell type differences in responses to spaceflight. Single-cell sequencing is a powerful method to obtain information about the cellular composition of a tissue and cellular-level responses to perturbations. However, the applicability of single-cell transcriptomics relies on the accessibility of fresh specimens and the possibility to successfully dissociate the tissue of interest15. Since sample preparation in spaceflight studies typically involves in-orbit freezing of the entire carcass to simplify the experiment and minimize crew time, single-nucleus transcriptomics becomes a more feasible method. Using single-nuclei multiomics, we were able to assess both transcriptional profiles and chromatin changes within the same nuclei, thus providing paired data of RNA expression and chromatin accessibility. While single-nuclei sequencing methods facilitate the study of individual nuclei transcriptomes, they lack spatial context. Therefore, spatial transcriptomics is a powerful addition, enabling the comparison of effects among brain structures and providing transcriptomics information coupled with the original location within tissue sections16. Overall, our study is a stepping stone towards the understanding of the molecular changes induced by the space environment at the resolution of individual cell type and brain region. Our findings not only advance the knowledge of the neurological effects of spaceflight, but also provide a critical foundation for future space biology mission designs.",
    "methods": "Methods Ethical approval The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (CAS-15-001-Y1) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for both flight (housed at the NASA Ames Research Center) and ground control (housed at the Kennedy Space Center) mice. Animals A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39–42 days. Male mice were not used in this study because of their behavioral impairments when co-housed in a stressful environment. Recent studies have also shown that the ISS differences across individual male mice are greater than those across female mice61, indicating negligible effects of any hormonal changes during estrus cycle in female mice. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used as ground controls housed in identical hardware (Rodent Habitat AEM-X, identifier 1379) and matching ISS environmental conditions62, including but not limited to cage type, light cycle (standard 12:12 light/dark cycle for both ground control and flight mice groups), food (Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB)), temperature (23.36 °C, and 21.37 °C on average for ground control and flight mice, respectively), humidity (41.86% and 41.53% on average for ground control and flight mice, respectively) and CO2 concentration (3664.89 ppm mean CO2 for ground controls, and 3711.97 ppm mean CO2 for flight mice). Detailed information on environmental telemetry data including temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and cabin radiation exposure can be found on NASA’s Environmental Data Application (EDA) by clicking on the publicly accessible link https://visualization.osdr.nasa.gov/eda/ and selecting ‘RR-3’ from the dropdown menu in the Mission Dashboard on the right-hand panel. Additionally, all information on RR-3 mission payload is publicly available on NASA OSDR link https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/payloads/RR-3. At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls were euthanized (using euthanasia chemical ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine) and whole carcasses were stored at −80 °C until the dissection on earth. Mouse carcasses were removed from −80 °C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15–20 min for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 h from collection of the first tissue. Brain tissues were harvested and placed into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes for snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, then stored in −80 °C freezer for sample processing. RNA extraction RNA was extracted from tissue sections using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA integrity was measured by using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. All samples had RIN values above 8. Sample preparation Six brains in total, three from each group, were used in this study. Hemispheres of each of the brain samples were split. One hemisphere from each sample was embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. and cryo-sectioned in the hippocampus area at 10 µm thickness. Sections were placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays, Superfrost glass slides or into Eppendorf tubes. Second hemisphere of each brain was used for nuclei isolation. Samples were stored in −80 °C before processing. Visium Spatial Gene Expression technology and sequencing First, 10× Genomics Spatial Gene Expression Tissue Optimization protocol was performed on 8 consecutive mouse brain sections to determine the optimal permeabilization time. One tissue section was used as a negative control. The experiment was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (User Guide, CG000283 Rev B). Spatial gene expression libraries were generated using the Visium Gene Expression kit (10x Genomics). Brain hemispheres were cryo-sectioned to reach the hippocampus area. Two consecutive sections of hippocampus from the ground control cohort and two consecutive sections of hippocampus from the flight cohort were placed on Visium glass slides. Consecutive sections were considered technical replicates. In total, 12 Visium libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s protocol (User Guide, CG000239 Rev F). Twelve libraries were sequenced by using an Illumina Novaseq platform, while four were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform and sequenced by using a Illumina Novaseq platform. Length of read 1 was 28 bp and read 2 was 120 bp long. Chromium single-cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression technology and sequencing Nuclei isolation One hemisphere of 4 brains used for Spatial Transcriptomics was utilized for nuclei isolation. Brain tissue was placed into a tube together with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 nM NaCl, 3 nM MgCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 1 mM DTT, 1U/µl RNAseOUT), homogenized by pestle homogenization in eppendorf tube and incubated on ice for 5 min. The nuclei were extracted by following 10XGenomic protocol for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (User Guide, CG000375 Rev B). Each sample was filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer prior to FACS sorting. Sorted and permeabilized nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, counted and used for Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression library preparation. One hemisphere from the ground control G1 sample was used to optimize the nuclei isolation protocol.Cell sorting The stained cell nuclei suspension samples were then analyzed and sorted utilizing a BD Bioscience Influx flow cytometer using an 86 μm nozzle. Flow cytometry analyses and sorting were carried out by the following gating strategy: nuclei:singlets:7-AAD positive events. The nuclei sub-population was characterized in the Side Scatter-Forward Scatter plot by back-gating from the 7-AAD (ex. 488 nm, em. 692 nm), singlets were gated in the Side Scatter – Pulse width plot and finally the nuclei were gated in the Side Scatter – 7-AAD plot. The nuclei were collected in a BSA coated Eppendorf tube.Single nuclei samples Isolated and sorted nuclei were used to generate single nuclei gene expression and ATAC-seq libraries according to the manufacturer’s protocol using Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kit (User Guide, CG000338 Rev E). Finished Gene Expression libraries were sequenced by using an Illumina NextSeq2000 platform with lengths of read 1 and read 2, 28 bp and 120 bp long respectively. Finished ATAC-seq libraries were sequenced by using an Illumina NextSeq2000 platform. Length of both read 1 and read 2 was 50 bp long. Pre-processing and Clustering of Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) and multiomics Data ST data generation Sequenced Visium libraries were processed using Space Ranger software (version 1.0.0, 10X Genomics). Reads were aligned to the Space Ranger built-in mouse reference genome (mm10-3.0.0) and count matrices were generated using these along with the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images. ST data analysis ST data analysis was performed jointly in R (v4.1.1) using the Seurat package (v4.0.1) and STUtility (v0.1.0). InputFromTable() was used to generate a Seurat object from the count matrices with specific filtering parameters (min.spot.feature.count = 100, min.gene.count = 100, min.gene.spots = 10, and min.spot.count = 100). The count matrices were enriched for protein-coding and lincRNA genes and then filtered for MALAT1, ribosomal and mitochondrial genes. Next, all spots containing less than 200 genes were removed. Technical variability within data was reduced with SCTransform (SCTransform() with default settings; SelectIntegrationFeatures() with nfeatures = 3000; PrepSCTIntegration() with anchor.features assigned to genes returned from the SelectIntegrationFeatures()) and Harmony (RunHarmony() with group.vars = ‘section.name’ addressing for batches associated with different Visium slide capture areas) packages. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for selection of significant components (RunPCA() with default 50 PCs computed; 35 selected for the rest of the analysis). FindClusters() with resolution = 0.35 and dims = 1:35 was used to identify ST clusters and then Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the same in 2D space. Multiomics data generation The sequenced multiomics (snRNA-seq, and snATAC-seq) libraries were processed using CellRanger ARC (v2) software from 10X Genomics with default settings. Reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10 reference 2020-A from 10X Genomics). Multiomics data analysis Data analysis for the snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data was performed in R (v4.1.1) using the packages Seurat (v4.1.0) and Signac (v1.6.0). In total, extracted single nuclei from 5 brain hemispheres were processed, resulting in 21,178 nuclei used in the analysis. The chromatin assay was generated using CreateChromatinAssay() from the Signac package (min.cells = 10). The annotation data for this was obtained using GetGRangesFromEnsDb() (ensdb=EnsDb.Mmusculus.v79). The snRNA-seq assay was generated using Read10X_h5() available in the Seurat package. MALAT1, ribosomal and mitochondrial genes were removed and count matrix was further filtered on number of reads, genes and peaks, as well as fraction ATAC-seq reads in peaks, and enrichment of ATAC-seq reads at transcription start sites. Filtering for low quality nuclei and genes was applied separately for each sample using a custom function, code for which can be found on our GitHub repository63 (see Code availability for more details). Doublet finder was used for doublet removal (v2.0.3) with a doublet score cut-off of 0.6. RNA-seq data was normalized using SCTransform with V2 regularization, while also regressing out cell cycle effects using cell cycle genes list available in the Seurat package. ATAC-seq data was normalized using TF-IDF normalization with default settings. Harmony (group.by.vars=‘bio_origin’) was then used to remove batch effects and integrate data from different samples, after which cells from both RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data were clustered using Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) Analysis (FindMultiModalNeighbors() function with parameters reduction.list=list(‘SCT_CC_harmony’, ‘ATAC_harmony’); dims.list=list(1:30, 2:30); k.nn=30). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the multiomics clusters (FindClusters() with setting Resolution=0.2). Differential expression analysis For identification of differentially expressed genes between clusters, Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, implemented in the Seurat function FindAllMarkers() was used. Only genes expressed in at least 25% of cells were included in the analysis, and genes with log2 fold change >0.25 and FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Differential gene expression between flight and ground conditions was performed using MAST, with a mixed model, using sample as a random effect. The analysis was done on each cell type separately, and included genes expressed in at least 30% of flight or ground cells in the given cell type. Genes with FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Differential chromatin accessibility between flight and ground conditions was performed the same way, using the same parameters. Gene overlap test To test the significance of the overlapping genes found from the validation analysis, a hypergeometric distribution test was used to test the null hypothesis: The overlap of X genes between the two genelists is a random sampling effect. The phyper() function in R (v4.3.2) was used to perform the hypergeometric distribution test and the resultant p-value was recorded. The R scripts consisting of the code for this test is available on our github repository63 (refer to Code availability for details). Motif analysis ChromVAR (v1.16.0)64, with default settings, was used to assess chromatin accessibility around DNA sequence motifs, taken from the JASPAR (v2020_0.99.10) database65. For each motif and cell chromVAR calculated a score representing chromatin accessibility, while correcting for confounders such as for GC content and average accessibility. The chromatin accessibility scores from flight and ground cells were then compared, for each cell type separately. This was done with a mixed model using, sample as a random effect, implemented in the lmer() function from the lme4 (v1.1-28.9000) package. Motifs with FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially accessible between flight and ground conditions. Gene and cluster annotation Marker genes from the clustering analysis and the DEGs from the differential expression, for both ST and multiomics data, were using marker genes in the Tabula muris database66, literature search and EnrichR pathway analysis tool (with mouse model organism used as background)67–69. These annotations for the marker genes were used as a guide for manual annotation of the multiomics as well as the ST clusters. Pathway analysis For pathway analysis and visualization of the results, the Consensus Pathway Analysis platform18 and the EnrichR pathway analysis tool67–69 were used. For both these tools, pathway enrichment was determined relative to a universal background rather than a custom-defined, brain-specific gene list. This is to accept a known bias towards overrepresentation of brain-specific pathways in place of potential unknown biases resulting from the construction of a custom background gene list. Ligand-receptor analysis Ligand-receptor interactions analysis was performed with the package CellPhoneDB (v3)70. Multiomics clusters were analyzed using the DE genes for spaceflight obtained from using MAST (v1.20.0) (see Differential Expression Analysis in Methods). For the analysis, DE genes were transformed to their human orthologues which is a required criteria to run CellPhoneDB. The ligand-receptor analysis on the spatial data to identify co-expressed LR pairs was performed using SpatialDM (v0.1.0)26. The standard pipeline to perform global selection of significant LR pairs and for local selection of spots for co-expressed LR pairs was performed using the package documentation as a reference (with l = 250 and cutoff = 0.2 in sdm.weight_matrix() function). Likelihood ratio test was used in the differential testing and the test was run by following the package documentation. For further details on the scripts used in this analysis, refer to the Code availability section. Spatial pattern analysis We inferred a gene regulatory network (GRN) from the brain multiomics dataset using CellOracle43. A tissue-specific GRN was generated by grouping all brain cell types into the same label before running the method. Transcription Factor (TF) activities were inferred for the brain spatial transcriptomics data using decoupler-py41 with the method mlm and the obtained GRN as prior knowledge. Additionally, pathway activities were inferred for the brain spatial transcriptomics data using decoupler-py with the method mlm and the PROGENy model of pathway footprints as prior knowledge42. To analyze spatial relationships between cell types and pathway activities, we built cell type specific models with MISTy40, which predict abundances (as determined by Stereoscope) from pathway activities in situ and from the local neighborhood (up to two spots away). In this case, The MISTy models are built only on Visium spots with at least 5% of the specific cell type. We then extracted cell type-pathway interactions that occur in only one of the conditions. In the regions of interest where these differential interactions occur, we investigate changes in correlation (Pearson) between pathway activities and TF activities inferred from the CellOracle GRNs. We used Student’s t-tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction for both determining the differential interactions and the changes in correlation. Metabolic pathway analysis The flight-vs-ground expression level fold changes of each cluster were computed for genes that are expressed in more than 1% of the cells in either flight or ground condition of the cluster, using the FindMarkers() function in the Seurat package (v4.1.1)71. Genes listed in the RECON3D metabolic model72 were extracted with their assigned metabolic pathway membership. The human gene IDs were translated to mouse gene IDs using the manual inspection and the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) Comparison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP) service73. All genes from the flight-vs-ground expression analysis were then ranked by fold-change differences (positive to negative) regardless of the p-value from FindMarkers() function, and tested for pathway enrichment vs the genes in RECON3D pathways using the fgsea function in the fgsea package (v1.22.0)74 in R (v4.2.1)75. Resulting p-value enrichment of RECON3D-sourced pathways were adjusted (adjusted p-value) by program for the number of pathway tests performed. ShinyApp ShinyApp was designed using the package shiny (v1.7.1) in R (v4.1.1) and the theme superhero was used for the overall esthetics of the shinyapp design. The R (v4.3.2) package babelgene (v22.9) with references from the  database was used to identify the human orthologs for the genes listed under the Cluster markers - Expression and Spaceflight DEGs - Expression tabs in the shinyapp. All genes from Supplementary Data 4, 7 and 8 can be visualized on the shinyapp. RNAscope Single molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH) to detect expression of genes of interest (Adcyl and Gpc55) was performed using the RNAscope technology following the manufacturer’s protocol (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, ACD, Hayward, CA). Target genes (Gpc5 in channel red, Adcy1 in channel green) were visualized using the HRP-based RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Assay V2 (Cat. No. 323110). Brains from a cohort of 14–15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J wild type mice flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 28-29 days (NASA RR-10 mission) were used for this validation. Brains from mice of similar age, sex and strain were used as ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls were euthanized (euthanasia method: bilateral thoracotomy with sedation, ketamine/xylazine injection) and whole carcasses were stored at −80 °C until the dissection on earth. Brain tissues were harvested and snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored in −80 °C freezer for sample processing. Brains from two ground controls (GC3, GC9) and three flights (FL1, FL3 and FL5) were cryo-sectioned to reach the hippocampus area and for each of them, one 10 µm section was placed on a superfrost plus slide and stored at −80 °C for less than a week before proceeding to the RNAscope protocol. The tissue sections were subjected to permeabilization steps before incubation with the target probes. The signal was amplified using the HRP-based technology (visualized by Tyramide Signal Amplification or TSATM fluorophores by PerkinElmer). RNAscope signal quantification The quantification of the fluorescence signal was performed with Fiji by ImageJ software. The images were taken with a ZEN LSM700 confocal microscope and exported as tiff with the same settings. Once exported they were loaded on ImageJ and the whole area of the section, i.e., the whole hemisphere was selected for quantification. Image was then transformed from RGB to 16-bit and quantification was done by counting the number of pixels positive for the threshold set. The threshold was unique for each channel and was kept the same for ground and control samples.

    "results": "Results To identify specific cellular microenvironments affected by spaceflight, we combined the techniques of spatial transcriptomics (ST; 10X Genomics Visium) and single-nucleus multiomics (snMultiomics; gene expression and chromatin accessibility; 10× Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression) on mouse brain. In total, we analyzed three brains from mice euthanized on-board of the International Space Station (ISS; F1, F2, F3) and three brains from ground control mice (G1, G2, G3) that were kept under matched conditions (see Animals in Methods). For each sample, we isolated nuclei from one hemisphere for snMultiomics analysis and cryo-sectioned the other hemisphere for ST analysis with the focus on the hippocampal region (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Summary of the project workflow. Open in a new tab Overview of the study workflow where brains from International Space Station (ISS; Flight mice) and ground control mouse groups (Ground control mice) were split into the two hemispheres for Spatial Gene Expression Analysis (Spatial Transcriptomics or ST) and Single Nuclei Multiomics analysis (snMultiomics). Spaceflight sample quality is suitable for ST and snMultiomics analysis As a first step, we ensured that the morphological and RNA quality of the samples was suitable for our experimental workflow given that the spaceflown samples had undergone a specific preservation approach17, which was also used for the corresponding ground control animals (see Animals in Methods). We measured the RNA integrity number (RIN) for each sample and found that it was 9.15 on average (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we performed a tissue optimization experiment confirming that both RNA integrity and tissue morphology was of sufficient quality for ST analysis (see Visium Spatial Gene Expression technology and sequencing in Methods; Supplementary Fig. 1B). snMultiomics dissects the effects of spaceflight on different cell types in spaceflown mouse brains To dissect the alterations induced by spaceflight at the single-nucleus level, we performed a snMultiomics analysis on hemispheres of three spaceflown (F1, F2, F3) mice and two out of three ground controls (G2, G3), obtaining RNA expression profiles (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) information from the same nucleus. In total, we isolated 21,178 nuclei across the spaceflight and control samples with an average of 3140 unique transcripts (Unique Molecular Identifier or UMI) per nucleus (i.e., from snRNA-seq) and 9217 peaks per nucleus (i.e., from snATAC-seq) (Fig. 2A, B; Supplementary Fig. 1C) and an overall high gene expression correlation between the spaceflight and ground control samples (r = 0.95, p < 0.05; Fig. 2C). By integrating snRNASeq and snATAC-seq data and performing a joint clustering analysis, we identified 18 snMultiomics clusters (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. 2). Fig. 2.

The majority of clusters were related to neurogenesis, neuronal activity and synaptic transmission, distinguished by differences in neurotransmitters (GABAergic, glutamatergic, dopaminergic) and based on gene expression patterns, tentatively associated with neuronal locations in hypothalamus, striatum, cortex and hippocampus. We identified a total of 825 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spaceflown and ground control samples across all multiomics clusters (Supplementary Data 3). The majority of these 825 DEGs were involved in neuronal development (multiomics clusters 9, 11), axonal or dendritic outgrowth (multiomics cluster 9), and synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 4), including specifically GABAergic synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 11). Comparison of 825 spaceflight multiomics DEGs to the 629 significant DEGs (Spaceflight vs Ground Control; p-value < 0.05) from the bulk RNAseq data of the same mice brains from the same NASA mission (RR-3), indicated 11 shared genes (p-value = 0.01582549, hypergeometric distribution test; see Gene overlap test in Methods; Supplementary Data 4). Out of these 11 overlapping genes, only 2 genes (Gabra6, and Kctd16) showed the same directional change in both the datasets indicating that the majority of spaceflight effects are cell type-specific and emphasizing the need for cell-specific analysis of central nervous system responses to spaceflight. We also compared these 825 spaceflight DEGs with spaceflight DEGs reported in a total of 11 other datasets processed by NASA OSDR including mass spectrometry and RNA-seq data collected from different organs of BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice strains. This comparison revealed a total of 461 overlapping DEGs (p-value < 0.05) across all the 11 datasets combined (refer to Supplementary Data 5 for a detailed list of overlapping genes and the resulting p-value from the hypergeometric distribution test performed for each dataset). ST provides a high-resolution mapping of gene expression changes to mouse brain regions To investigate spaceflight-induced CNS alterations at a spatial level, we performed ST analysis on the other brain hemispheres from 3 flight (F1, F2, F3) and 3 ground control mice (G1, G2, G3). We collected two coronal sections from each brain hemisphere containing hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, striatum, amygdala and corpus callosum. In total, we captured 14,630 genes across 29,770 spots after filtering and detected 10,884 UMIs/spot and 3755 genes/spot on average (Fig. 2F, G; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B) and found a high overall gene expression correlation between spaceflight and ground control tissue sections (r = 0.99, p < 0.05; Fig. 2H). Unsupervised clustering analysis of spot information identified 18 distinct spatial clusters (further referred as ST clusters) (Fig. 3A, B; Supplementary Data 6), which presented a clear separation between the cortical top (ST cluster 1) and bottom layers (ST cluster 9), as well as other major structures, including hippocampus (with separation of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus in ST clusters 10, 8 and 11 respectively), thalamus (ST cluster 5), striatum (ST clusters 0, 14), hypothalamus (ST cluster 2), pituitary (anterior and posterior; ST cluster 2), corpus callosum (ST cluster 12) and cerebral peduncles (ST cluster 4) (Fig. 3C). Key functions of the markers (Supplementary Data 7) that were shared by numerous ST clusters include neurogenesis, neuronal development, axonal growth and synaptogenesis, indicating that ST cluster analysis is dominated by neuronal gene expression.

B Marker genes for each ST cluster visualized as dotplot.

D Significantly different pathways (p < 0.05) between flight and ground control in ST cluster 9 (Cortical neurons, bottom layers). E Visualization of number of clusters identified by single-nuclei multiomics and their proportions in each ST cluster (x-axis; 0–17). Only multiomics clusters with higher proportions (>10%) are displayed in the barplot. F Cell type proportions mapped to spatial coordinates on three ground control (top row) and three flight (bottom row) mouse brain sections (Synaptic transmission I or multiomics cluster 1; Myelination or multiomics cluster 3; Neuronal activity, Synaptic transmission III or multiomics cluster 15).Next, we investigated how spaceflight influences gene expression at the spatial level and identified a total of 4057 DEGs in 7 out of 18 ST clusters (Supplementary Data 8). The majority of DEGs were involved in neuronal development, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration, including 21 DEGs in hippocampal CA3 neurons. The most pronounced change in gene expression due to spaceflight was observed in cortical neurons (bottom layers; ST cluster 9) which showed 3208 DEGs (1808 upregulated, and 1400 downregulated) with similar functions related to neuronal development and synaptic transmission in somatosensory, motor and visual cortex. Consensus pathway analysis18 highlighted neurodegeneration-associated pathways in cortical neurons (bottom layers; ST cluster 9) including protein misfolding and abnormal protein clearance, indicating potential similarities with neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein misfolding and accumulation, such as Parkinson’s disease19,20 (Fig. 3D). Integration of multiomics and ST datasets for spatial and cell type-level effects of spaceflight To infer the spatial distribution of the clusters identified by multiomics, we performed spot deconvolution analysis on matching ST dataset using Stereoscope21 (which corrects for biases arising from different experimental techniques before calculating celltype proportions probabilities) (Fig. 3E; refer to Supplementary Figs. 4–6 for detailed visualizations of multiomics cluster proportions in ST dataset). The deconvolution analysis revealed similarities based on the assigned functional annotations between several multiomics and spatial data clusters, for instance, synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 1 matched with ST clusters 0 and 2), myelination (multiomics cluster 3 matched ST clusters 4 and 12), and neuronal activity (multiomics cluster 15 matched ST cluster 5) (Fig. 3F; Supplementary Figs. 7, 8; Supplementary Data 9). This comparative analysis suggested the effects of spaceflight on synaptic transmission specifically in cortex (including both neurons and astrocytes, as revealed by snRNA-seq data that allowed cell type separation) and on dopaminergic neuron development specifically in striatum (Supplementary Data 9). Ligand-receptor interaction analysis suggests spaceflight-mediated effects on astrocyte functions To assess the effects of spaceflight on the cell-cell interaction level, we performed a ligand-receptor analysis on two multiomics clusters that showed among highest number of differentially expressed genes in response to spaceflight, i.e., multiomics clusters 4 (Astrocytes), and 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). We found 4 significantly upregulated interactions (Fig. 4A), including adhesion molecule pairs, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) pairs, and VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor). These ligand-receptor interactions have previously been shown to be involved in cellular development in the CNS. EGFR22, is involved in neuronal development, including axonal outgrowth. Meanwhile, VEGFA23,24 primarily regulates angiogenesis though it can also play a role in hippocampal neurogenesis, and astrocyte-produced VEGFA has previously been demonstrated to regulate neuronal NMDA receptor activity23–25. Interestingly, we found that spaceflight widely increased VEGFA_GRIN28 interactions between multiomics cluster pairs related to astrocytes and synaptic transmission, i.e., 4-11 (Astrocytes-GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). No ligand-receptor interactions in these clusters were significantly downregulated. Fig. 4. Ligand-receptor interactions, motif accessibility, and signaling pathways affected by spaceflight. Open in a new tab A Dotplot showing the differentially expressed ligand receptor pairs found by CellPhoneDB between two interacting multiomics clusters (4 and 11) which are affected by spaceflight. These clusters showed the largest number of spaceflight DEGs, and four LR pairs were found significantly upregulated in these interactions. The null distribution of the mean expression of the LR pairs was estimated by employing a random permutation approach. The mean expression of the interacting LR molecule pairs are indicated by the dot colors and the dot sizes represent the p-values which refers to the enrichment of the LR pair in the interacting multiomics clusters. Scales for both dot size and color are presented below the plot. B Accessibility differences for motifs Atoh1, Zic1, and Zic2 in multiomics cluster 4 of flight mice and ground control mice. Spaceflight results in reduced accessibility of these motifs in flight samples. Two-sided Chi-square test statistic was used for differential testing with FDR correction (fdr <0.05). C Accessibility differences for motifs Pou5f1, and Sox2 in multiomics cluster 11 of flight and ground control mice. Spaceflight results in increased accessibility of these motifs in flight samples.

D (left) adjusted p-value of differential interactions found by MISTy in intraview (cell type and pathway activity colocalization) occuring only in flight (blue; n = 3 individual ST flight mouse samples) or in controls (red; n = 3 individual ST ground control mouse samples), tiles with black border identify statistically significant changes, (middle) correlation of MAPK pathway activity and Neurovasculature abundance, and mapped on Visium slide for two samples (right). Two-sided Student’s t tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used to determine the differential interactions.

Two-sided Student’s t tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used to determine the differential interactions.

Two-sided Student’s t tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used to determine the changes in correlation. multiomics cl: multiomics cluster. The boxplots in D, F, and G show the median as a central line, the box boundaries denote the first and third quartiles and the whiskers extend to the most extreme point in the range within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box.We also extended the ligand-receptor analysis to the ST dataset using SpatialDM26. We applied SpatialDM on each ST brain section to identify spatially co-expressed LR pairs and found a total of 1260 LR pairs (Supplementary Fig. 9; refer to Supplementary Data 10 for a detailed list of LR pairs with corresponding z-scores across each ST section). Differential testing between the two conditions (flight and ground control) for the observed 1260 LR pairs revealed a total of 134 differential LR pairs (differential p-value < 0.1; Supplementary Data 11). Motif analysis shows spaceflight effects on transcription factor (TF) activity To investigate the effects of spaceflight on transcription factors (TFs), we performed motif analysis on snATAC-seq peaks from the single nucleus multiomics data, which revealed spaceflight-mediated differences in TF activity in several multiomics clusters (Supplementary Data 12), especially 4 (Astrocytes), and 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). Spaceflight was associated with reduced accessibility of motifs Zic1, Zic2 and Atoh1 in multiomics clusters 4 (Astrocytes)27,28 (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, increased accessibility of motifs Pou5f1 and Sox2 in multiomics cluster 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission) might indicate reduced neuronal differentiation in spaceflight29–31 (Fig. 4C). In addition to neuronal effects, motifs Pparg, Rxra and Nr2f6, which collectively inhibit immune responses, showed decreased accessibility in telencephalon interneurons (multiomics cluster 11), suggesting increased inflammatory responses in space32–34, and possible circadian dysregulation35–39. Spatial gene expression patterns show several changes in signaling pathways occurring in spaceflight brain samples Local environments of cell types may affect the functional responses to spaceflight represented by changes in signaling pathways. We compared key signaling pathways in adjacent locations based on the spatially-resolved cell type deconvolution results from Stereoscope analyzed using the Multiview intercellular SpaTial modeling framework (MISTy)40. This tool allowed us to investigate the relationships between cell type proportions in each ST spot and activities of 14 pathways inferred by decoupler-py and PROGENy41,42. Specifically, the MISTy models predict cell type abundance in a spot based on an intraview (features in the same spot) and paraview (weighted sum of the features in the neighboring spots; weights decreasing with distance). Either cell type abundances or pathway activities were selected as “features” for the model, and a separate model was built for each sample and cell type. To analyze the effects of spaceflight, the models were subsequently aggregated into flight and ground control groups. Based on cell type abundances, we did not find any significant changes in cell type colocalization (which would occur during tissue restructuring or lesion formation) between flight and ground controls, similar to our previous finding of no significant changes in cell type abundance in deconvolution results (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). In contrast, changes in signaling pathways were associated with individual cell types. Cell abundance in neurovasculature (multiomics cluster 12) colocalized with decreased MAPK signaling in spaceflight (Fig. 4D). Similarly, signaling changes in local neighborhood (MISTy paraview) of several other cell types were found in spaceflight samples (Fig. 4E): (1) less negative correlation of EGFR signaling and glutamatergic neuronal cells; (2) more negative correlation of MAPK and cholinergic, monoaminergic and peptidergic neurons; (3) increased TGFbeta signaling in the vicinity of GABAergic interneurons; (4) reduced WNT signaling in class II glutamatergic neurons. To assess the downstream effects of these changes, we built a tissue-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) from the multiomics data using CellOracle43 and used it to predict TF activities in spatial data and computed the Pearson correlation between TF and signaling activities for the dysregulated pathways in spots containing the cell types identified above. The network suggested that the decrease in MAPK signaling in spaceflight increases activity of the transcription factor Glis3 and reduces Lef1 in neurovasculature, respectively (Fig. 4F, G). Metabolic gene enrichment analysis shows decreased gene expression in spaceflight mice Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on the ST data using metabolic pathways indicated spaceflight-mediated inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, especially Complex I signaling (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Data 13), as well as pathways related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 10), fructose and mannose metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 11) and arachidonic acid metabolism (Fig. 5B). Analysis of multiomics data was consistent with spaceflight-mediated reduction in these pathways together with fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Data 14). Deficits in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation are consistent with previously reported mitochondrial impairments caused by spaceflight44, while, arachidonic acid is primarily produced by astrocytes and suggests astrocyte dysfunction as a potential target for future spaceflight CNS studies.

Validation of differential gene expression In order to validate our findings on the spaceflight affected processes in mouse brain, we performed single molecule Fluorescence In situ Hybridization (smFISH) using the RNAscope technology for two genes of interest (Adcy1 and Gpc5) in five brain sections: 3 flights, 2 ground controls (Supplementary Fig. 12) from a comparative set of mice (see Methods). We observed significant upregulation in the expression of both genes in spaceflight samples, confirming our findings from the ST data and multiomics data analysis (Supplementary Data 3 and 8, Supplementary Fig. 13A–C). Adcy1 was particularly upregulated in the hippocampus and associated with changes in neuronal activity (ST clusters 8, 11), while Gpc5 was upregulated in astrocytes (multiomics cluster 4).",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we used brain samples from ground control and spaceflown female mice from the RR-3 mission to understand the effects of the space environment at high resolution: at the level of individual brain cell types and brain regions. The main alterations in gene expression induced by spaceflight included changes in synaptogenesis and neuronal development, as well as neurodegeneration and inflammation, similar to previously reported tissue and behavioral-level effects of simulated spaceflight and simulated deep space radiation in mice12. In addition, multiple gene expression changes mapped to pathways associated with circadian rhythm and mitochondrial functions. This study applies spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multiomics to study the effects of spaceflight on the CNS which can serve as a stepping stone towards comparative investigation of samples from other space missions and the outcomes of live animal return and reacclimation to Earth conditions. We demonstrate spatial transcriptomics and single nuclei multiomics datasets to be highly complementary. For example, single-nucleus resolution permitted a focus on glial cells including astrocytes and microglia, which were not distinguishable in neuron-dominated ST datasets, due to the lower resolution of the method. Similarly, our snATAC-seq analysis in transcription factor binding sites indicated immune dysfunction34, while immune cells were too few to be distinguishable in ST. On the other hand, combining spatial and gene expression data revealed region-specific effects of spaceflight32,45. Furthermore, analysis of ligand-receptor interactions revealed interactions between different cell types, with the focus on neurodevelopment and astrocyte functions. In our study, multiple lines of evidence converged on spaceflight-mediated disruption of neurogenesis, neuronal development and synaptogenesis, including dopaminergic synapse formation in the striatum. Similar outcomes of increased pluripotency and reduced cell differentiation have previously been reported in spaceflown mouse bone samples46, in spaceflown human stem cell models47, and in irradiated mouse models48, indicating that it might be a systemic impairment that has now been identified to include the CNS. In addition, neurogenesis has been shown to be affected in a spaceflight analog study that combined simulated microgravity and low dose rate photon irradiation in mice10. Notably, synaptogenesis is particularly sensitive to simulated galactic cosmic radiation components49, indicating a potential additional risk for deep space missions. Finally, our observations in the striatal gene expression changes and transcription factor accessibility are worth validating in future spaceflight experiments, since they might result in disrupted dopaminergic signaling. Spaceflight-associated changes in circadian gene expression are consistent with circadian disruption as one of the major biological responses to spaceflight50, though it has been studied comparatively little so far, especially in animal models51. Molecular and cellular CNS correlation of circadian gene expression dysregulation in spaceflight remains to be investigated in greater detail. Our results suggest potential similarities between spaceflight and some terrestrial CNS conditions. Changes in gene expression associated with disrupted synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, oxidative stress and inflammation collectively resemble neurodegeneration that is associated with natural aging. Thus, in future studies anti-aging and neuroprotective therapeutics, such as antioxidants52 or mitochondria-targeting pharmaceuticals53,54, might be repurposed as spaceflight countermeasures, or vice versa, spaceflight might be used as a model for accelerated aging55. We have recently begun computational studies on identifying terrestrial disorder analogs to alterations induced by spaceflight, though they have not yet included CNS effects, which will require comparing the data from multiple spaceflight experiments56. Our study presents two main limitations. The first one is related to statistical robustness. Specifically, since the input material consists of spaceflight legacy samples collected without envisioning a spatial transcriptomics analysis, the resulting brain morphology is not fully even across samples. This limits the interpretability of the differences between spaceflight and ground control conditions to only a subset of spatial and multiomics clusters. Therefore, it will be important to validate the results of the RR-3 mission by comparing them to the neuronal effects of spaceflight in other mouse studies at similarly high resolution to increase statistical robustness. Moreover, it will be meaningful to expand the experimental design by including samples from animals that underwent a period of reacclimation to ground conditions after spaceflight. By doing so, it will be possible to quantify the extent to which spaceflight-mediated impairments persist after landing, especially once model organisms begin to age. This will allow the investigation of key aspects of astronaut health risks that have not been included yet. The second limitation of our study relates to the sex of the analyzed animals. The majority of mouse studies in spaceflight have been performed on females to facilitate group housing, while astronaut cohorts include both male and female astronauts. Thus, it will be necessary to compare male and female animals to address the sexual dimorphism of CNS health risks. In order to further extrapolate animal models to human outcomes, human and mouse CNS organ model systems will have to be flown as payloads. The first human neurovascular models have already been investigated on the ISS57,58, though their results have not yet been published, while analyzing the effects of simulated space radiation on human neurovascular models59 highlighted the importance of investigating astrocyte functions in missions beyond low-Earth orbit. In preparation for these missions, in which crew time will be severely limited, it will be essential to develop automated, long-lasting CNS models and compare their responses to model organisms. Overall, our study serves as a preliminary indication to the potential risks that the brain is exposed to in spaceflight missions and more studies with larger sample sizes will be required to confirm our findings. To encourage the scientific community to use our datasets for generating new discoveries, all our data is openly available through NASA GeneLab and can be explored by a Shiny app (https://giacomellolabst.shinyapps.io/rr3-brain-shiny/). In summary, in this study, we observed that spaceflight altered the expression of genes associated with neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal development in multiple regions of the brain, especially striatum, as well as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation collectively resembling neurological aging and neurodegeneration. Future studies are planned to increase statistical robustness, focus on neuroimmune outcomes and investigate the persistence of spaceflight effects after landing and re-acclimation to Earth environment. In addition, our findings illustrate the benefits of combined spatial transcriptomics and single-cell analysis in revealing detailed biological alterations and suggest them as highly relevant techniques for future space biology research.

Copyright notice ID: 11166911 PMID: 38862479 Abstract Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a significant health risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies. For broader scientific impact, all datasets from this study are available through an interactive data portal, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Subject terms: Molecular neuroscience, Genetics of the nervous system, Computational neuroscience A spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multiomics study performed on mouse brain tissue. Here, authors show region-specific spaceflight-induced alterations in processes of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission.Introduction In preparation for long-duration lunar and Mars missions, it is crucial to investigate the health risks to astronauts that are posed by exposure to the space environment1. The key physiological impairments include DNA damage and oxidative stress from galactic cosmic radiation2, bone and muscle damage from loss of gravity3,4, circadian and sleep dysregulation5, microbial dysbiosis6 and tissue and organ degeneration, including cardiovascular and CNS damage7. Studies on animal models have shown several spaceflight stressors directly impacting brain molecular mechanisms causing neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and neurovascular damage8–11. Specifically, exposure to simulated space radiation at doses comparable to the ones expected during the planned Mars mission, leads to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in vivo and in tissue and cell models12, as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits in rodent models. Furthermore, major physiological effects of microgravity in low-Earth orbit, as observed at the International Space Station (ISS), include a redistribution of body fluids from lower towards upper body parts, leading to significant cardiovascular13 and CNS changes14. However, deeper investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms and specificity of these impairments, and identify targets for countermeasure development. Studies performed directly on astronauts have to be minimally invasive, resulting in limited information on molecular and cellular level outcomes, while spaceflown rodent models allow the range of subcellular to behavioral-level investigation of spaceflight effects. In this study, we used spatial transcriptomics and multiomics to explore spaceflight-induced molecular changes in brain tissue of young adult female BALB/c mice samples obtained during the Rodent Research-3 (RR-3) mission and requested from the NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection (NBISC). We combined single-nucleus multiomics (i.e., snMultiomics, RNA and ATAC sequencing) with Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data to study changes in chromatin accessibility and RNA expression in different cell types and brain regions and to identify key regional and cell type differences in responses to spaceflight. Single-cell sequencing is a powerful method to obtain information about the cellular composition of a tissue and cellular-level responses to perturbations. However, the applicability of single-cell transcriptomics relies on the accessibility of fresh specimens and the possibility to successfully dissociate the tissue of interest15. Since sample preparation in spaceflight studies typically involves in-orbit freezing of the entire carcass to simplify the experiment and minimize crew time, single-nucleus transcriptomics becomes a more feasible method. Using single-nuclei multiomics, we were able to assess both transcriptional profiles and chromatin changes within the same nuclei, thus providing paired data of RNA expression and chromatin accessibility. While single-nuclei sequencing methods facilitate the study of individual nuclei transcriptomes, they lack spatial context. Therefore, spatial transcriptomics is a powerful addition, enabling the comparison of effects among brain structures and providing transcriptomics information coupled with the original location within tissue sections16. Overall, our study is a stepping stone towards the understanding of the molecular changes induced by the space environment at the resolution of individual cell type and brain region. Our findings not only advance the knowledge of the neurological effects of spaceflight, but also provide a critical foundation for future space biology mission designs.Results To identify specific cellular microenvironments affected by spaceflight, we combined the techniques of spatial transcriptomics (ST; 10X Genomics Visium) and single-nucleus multiomics (snMultiomics; gene expression and chromatin accessibility; 10× Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression) on mouse brain. In total, we analyzed three brains from mice euthanized on-board of the International Space Station (ISS; F1, F2, F3) and three brains from ground control mice (G1, G2, G3) that were kept under matched conditions (see Animals in Methods). For each sample, we isolated nuclei from one hemisphere for snMultiomics analysis and cryo-sectioned the other hemisphere for ST analysis with the focus on the hippocampal region (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Summary of the project workflow. Open in a new tab Overview of the study workflow where brains from International Space Station (ISS; Flight mice) and ground control mouse groups (Ground control mice) were split into the two hemispheres for Spatial Gene Expression Analysis (Spatial Transcriptomics or ST) and Single Nuclei Multiomics analysis (snMultiomics).Spaceflight sample quality is suitable for ST and snMultiomics analysis As a first step, we ensured that the morphological and RNA quality of the samples was suitable for our experimental workflow given that the spaceflown samples had undergone a specific preservation approach17, which was also used for the corresponding ground control animals (see Animals in Methods). We measured the RNA integrity number (RIN) for each sample and found that it was 9.15 on average (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we performed a tissue optimization experiment confirming that both RNA integrity and tissue morphology was of sufficient quality for ST analysis (see Visium Spatial Gene Expression technology and sequencing in Methods; Supplementary Fig. 1B).snMultiomics dissects the effects of spaceflight on different cell types in spaceflown mouse brains To dissect the alterations induced by spaceflight at the single-nucleus level, we performed a snMultiomics analysis on hemispheres of three spaceflown (F1, F2, F3) mice and two out of three ground controls (G2, G3), obtaining RNA expression profiles (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) information from the same nucleus. In total, we isolated 21,178 nuclei across the spaceflight and control samples with an average of 3140 unique transcripts (Unique Molecular Identifier or UMI) per nucleus (i.e., from snRNA-seq) and 9217 peaks per nucleus (i.e., from snATAC-seq) (Fig. 2A, B; Supplementary Fig. 1C) and an overall high gene expression correlation between the spaceflight and ground control samples (r = 0.95, p < 0.05; Fig. 2C). By integrating snRNASeq and snATAC-seq data and performing a joint clustering analysis, we identified 18 snMultiomics clusters (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. 2). Fig. 2.

This is a two-sided Pearson correlation test with 95% confidence intervals performed on the average expression (log(1 + avgUMI)). avgUMI: average UMI counts per spot.Next, we leveraged previously reported marker genes in the literature (see Gene and cluster annotation in Methods for details) to identify 11 macro categories for the 18 snMultiomics clusters (interchangeably referred to as multiomics clusters in the next sections) according to their functions (Fig. 2E; Supplementary Data 1, 2). The majority of clusters were related to neurogenesis, neuronal activity and synaptic transmission, distinguished by differences in neurotransmitters (GABAergic, glutamatergic, dopaminergic) and based on gene expression patterns, tentatively associated with neuronal locations in hypothalamus, striatum, cortex and hippocampus. We identified a total of 825 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spaceflown and ground control samples across all multiomics clusters (Supplementary Data 3). The majority of these 825 DEGs were involved in neuronal development (multiomics clusters 9, 11), axonal or dendritic outgrowth (multiomics cluster 9), and synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 4), including specifically GABAergic synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 11). Comparison of 825 spaceflight multiomics DEGs to the 629 significant DEGs (Spaceflight vs Ground Control; p-value < 0.05) from the bulk RNAseq data of the same mice brains from the same NASA mission (RR-3), indicated 11 shared genes (p-value = 0.01582549, hypergeometric distribution test; see Gene overlap test in Methods; Supplementary Data 4). Out of these 11 overlapping genes, only 2 genes (Gabra6, and Kctd16) showed the same directional change in both the datasets indicating that the majority of spaceflight effects are cell type-specific and emphasizing the need for cell-specific analysis of central nervous system responses to spaceflight. We also compared these 825 spaceflight DEGs with spaceflight DEGs reported in a total of 11 other datasets processed by NASA OSDR including mass spectrometry and RNA-seq data collected from different organs of BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice strains. This comparison revealed a total of 461 overlapping DEGs (p-value < 0.05) across all the 11 datasets combined (refer to Supplementary Data 5 for a detailed list of overlapping genes and the resulting p-value from the hypergeometric distribution test performed for each dataset).ST provides a high-resolution mapping of gene expression changes to mouse brain regions To investigate spaceflight-induced CNS alterations at a spatial level, we performed ST analysis on the other brain hemispheres from 3 flight (F1, F2, F3) and 3 ground control mice (G1, G2, G3). We collected two coronal sections from each brain hemisphere containing hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, striatum, amygdala and corpus callosum. In total, we captured 14,630 genes across 29,770 spots after filtering and detected 10,884 UMIs/spot and 3755 genes/spot on average (Fig. 2F, G; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B) and found a high overall gene expression correlation between spaceflight and ground control tissue sections (r = 0.99, p < 0.05; Fig. 2H). Unsupervised clustering analysis of spot information identified 18 distinct spatial clusters (further referred as ST clusters) (Fig. 3A, B; Supplementary Data 6), which presented a clear separation between the cortical top (ST cluster 1) and bottom layers (ST cluster 9), as well as other major structures, including hippocampus (with separation of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus in ST clusters 10, 8 and 11 respectively), thalamus (ST cluster 5), striatum (ST clusters 0, 14), hypothalamus (ST cluster 2), pituitary (anterior and posterior; ST cluster 2), corpus callosum (ST cluster 12) and cerebral peduncles (ST cluster 4) (Fig. 3C). Key functions of the markers (Supplementary Data 7) that were shared by numerous ST clusters include neurogenesis, neuronal development, axonal growth and synaptogenesis, indicating that ST cluster analysis is dominated by neuronal gene expression.

D Significantly different pathways (p < 0.05) between flight and ground control in ST cluster 9 (Cortical neurons, bottom layers). E Visualization of number of clusters identified by single-nuclei multiomics and their proportions in each ST cluster (x-axis; 0–17). Only multiomics clusters with higher proportions (>10%) are displayed in the barplot. F Cell type proportions mapped to spatial coordinates on three ground control (top row) and three flight (bottom row) mouse brain sections (Synaptic transmission I or multiomics cluster 1; Myelination or multiomics cluster 3; Neuronal activity, Synaptic transmission III or multiomics cluster 15).Next, we investigated how spaceflight influences gene expression at the spatial level and identified a total of 4057 DEGs in 7 out of 18 ST clusters (Supplementary Data 8). The majority of DEGs were involved in neuronal development, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration, including 21 DEGs in hippocampal CA3 neurons. The most pronounced change in gene expression due to spaceflight was observed in cortical neurons (bottom layers; ST cluster 9) which showed 3208 DEGs (1808 upregulated, and 1400 downregulated) with similar functions related to neuronal development and synaptic transmission in somatosensory, motor and visual cortex. Consensus pathway analysis18 highlighted neurodegeneration-associated pathways in cortical neurons (bottom layers; ST cluster 9) including protein misfolding and abnormal protein clearance, indicating potential similarities with neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein misfolding and accumulation, such as Parkinson’s disease19,20 (Fig. 3D).Integration of multiomics and ST datasets for spatial and cell type-level effects of spaceflight To infer the spatial distribution of the clusters identified by multiomics, we performed spot deconvolution analysis on matching ST dataset using Stereoscope21 (which corrects for biases arising from different experimental techniques before calculating celltype proportions probabilities) (Fig. 3E; refer to Supplementary Figs. 4–6 for detailed visualizations of multiomics cluster proportions in ST dataset). The deconvolution analysis revealed similarities based on the assigned functional annotations between several multiomics and spatial data clusters, for instance, synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 1 matched with ST clusters 0 and 2), myelination (multiomics cluster 3 matched ST clusters 4 and 12), and neuronal activity (multiomics cluster 15 matched ST cluster 5) (Fig. 3F; Supplementary Figs. 7, 8; Supplementary Data 9). This comparative analysis suggested the effects of spaceflight on synaptic transmission specifically in cortex (including both neurons and astrocytes, as revealed by snRNA-seq data that allowed cell type separation) and on dopaminergic neuron development specifically in striatum (Supplementary Data 9).Ligand-receptor interaction analysis suggests spaceflight-mediated effects on astrocyte functions To assess the effects of spaceflight on the cell-cell interaction level, we performed a ligand-receptor analysis on two multiomics clusters that showed among highest number of differentially expressed genes in response to spaceflight, i.e., multiomics clusters 4 (Astrocytes), and 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). We found 4 significantly upregulated interactions (Fig. 4A), including adhesion molecule pairs, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) pairs, and VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor). These ligand-receptor interactions have previously been shown to be involved in cellular development in the CNS. EGFR22, is involved in neuronal development, including axonal outgrowth. Meanwhile, VEGFA23,24 primarily regulates angiogenesis though it can also play a role in hippocampal neurogenesis, and astrocyte-produced VEGFA has previously been demonstrated to regulate neuronal NMDA receptor activity23–25. Interestingly, we found that spaceflight widely increased VEGFA_GRIN28 interactions between multiomics cluster pairs related to astrocytes and synaptic transmission, i.e., 4-11 (Astrocytes-GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). No ligand-receptor interactions in these clusters were significantly downregulated. Fig. 4. Ligand-receptor interactions, motif accessibility, and signaling pathways affected by spaceflight. Open in a new tab A Dotplot showing the differentially expressed ligand receptor pairs found by CellPhoneDB between two interacting multiomics clusters (4 and 11) which are affected by spaceflight. These clusters showed the largest number of spaceflight DEGs, and four LR pairs were found significantly upregulated in these interactions. The null distribution of the mean expression of the LR pairs was estimated by employing a random permutation approach. The mean expression of the interacting LR molecule pairs are indicated by the dot colors and the dot sizes represent the p-values which refers to the enrichment of the LR pair in the interacting multiomics clusters. Scales for both dot size and color are presented below the plot. B Accessibility differences for motifs Atoh1, Zic1, and Zic2 in multiomics cluster 4 of flight mice and ground control mice. Spaceflight results in reduced accessibility of these motifs in flight samples. Two-sided Chi-square test statistic was used for differential testing with FDR correction (fdr <0.05). C Accessibility differences for motifs Pou5f1, and Sox2 in multiomics cluster 11 of flight and ground control mice. Spaceflight results in increased accessibility of these motifs in flight samples. Effects of spaceflight shown by increased accessibility of these motifs in flight samples. Two-sided Chi-square test statistic was used for differential testing with FDR correction (fdr <0.05). D (left) adjusted p-value of differential interactions found by MISTy in intraview (cell type and pathway activity colocalization) occuring only in flight (blue; n = 3 individual ST flight mouse samples) or in controls (red; n = 3 individual ST ground control mouse samples), tiles with black border identify statistically significant changes, (middle) correlation of MAPK pathway activity and Neurovasculature abundance, and mapped on Visium slide for two samples (right). Two-sided Student’s t tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used to determine the differential interactions. E adjusted p-value of differential interactions found by MISTy in paraview (cell type and pathway activity in local neighborhood) occuring only in flight (blue; n = 3 individual ST flight mouse samples) or in controls (red; n = 3 individual ST ground control mouse samples), tiles with black border identify statistically significant changes. Two-sided Student’s t tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used to determine the differential interactions. F Pearson correlation of Glis3 activity (left) containing vascular endothelial cells and MAPK activity (n = 6 individual ST mouse samples, 3 flight, 3 ground controls), and their respective activities in Visium slides (4 plots on the right). Two-sided Student’s t-tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used to determine the changes in correlation. G Pearson correlation of Lef1 activity (left) within spots containing vascular endothelial cells and MAPK activity, and their respective activities in Visium slides (4 plots on the right). Two-sided Student’s t tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used to determine the changes in correlation. multiomics cl: multiomics cluster. The boxplots in D, F, and G show the median as a central line, the box boundaries denote the first and third quartiles and the whiskers extend to the most extreme point in the range within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box.We also extended the ligand-receptor analysis to the ST dataset using SpatialDM26. We applied SpatialDM on each ST brain section to identify spatially co-expressed LR pairs and found a total of 1260 LR pairs (Supplementary Fig. 9; refer to Supplementary Data 10 for a detailed list of LR pairs with corresponding z-scores across each ST section). Differential testing between the two conditions (flight and ground control) for the observed 1260 LR pairs revealed a total of 134 differential LR pairs (differential p-value < 0.1; Supplementary Data 11).Motif analysis shows spaceflight effects on transcription factor (TF) activity To investigate the effects of spaceflight on transcription factors (TFs), we performed motif analysis on snATAC-seq peaks from the single nucleus multiomics data, which revealed spaceflight-mediated differences in TF activity in several multiomics clusters (Supplementary Data 12), especially 4 (Astrocytes), and 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). Spaceflight was associated with reduced accessibility of motifs Zic1, Zic2 and Atoh1 in multiomics clusters 4 (Astrocytes)27,28 (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, increased accessibility of motifs Pou5f1 and Sox2 in multiomics cluster 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission) might indicate reduced neuronal differentiation in spaceflight29–31 (Fig. 4C). In addition to neuronal effects, motifs Pparg, Rxra and Nr2f6, which collectively inhibit immune responses, showed decreased accessibility in telencephalon interneurons (multiomics cluster 11), suggesting increased inflammatory responses in space32–34, and possible circadian dysregulation35–39.Spatial gene expression patterns show several changes in signaling pathways occurring in spaceflight brain samples Local environments of cell types may affect the functional responses to spaceflight represented by changes in signaling pathways. We compared key signaling pathways in adjacent locations based on the spatially-resolved cell type deconvolution results from Stereoscope analyzed using the Multiview intercellular SpaTial modeling framework (MISTy)40. This tool allowed us to investigate the relationships between cell type proportions in each ST spot and activities of 14 pathways inferred by decoupler-py and PROGENy41,42. Specifically, the MISTy models predict cell type abundance in a spot based on an intraview (features in the same spot) and paraview (weighted sum of the features in the neighboring spots; weights decreasing with distance). Either cell type abundances or pathway activities were selected as “features” for the model, and a separate model was built for each sample and cell type. To analyze the effects of spaceflight, the models were subsequently aggregated into flight and ground control groups. Based on cell type abundances, we did not find any significant changes in cell type colocalization (which would occur during tissue restructuring or lesion formation) between flight and ground controls, similar to our previous finding of no significant changes in cell type abundance in deconvolution results (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). In contrast, changes in signaling pathways were associated with individual cell types. Cell abundance in neurovasculature (multiomics cluster 12) colocalized with decreased MAPK signaling in spaceflight (Fig. 4D). Similarly, signaling changes in local neighborhood (MISTy paraview) of several other cell types were found in spaceflight samples (Fig. 4E): (1) less negative correlation of EGFR signaling and glutamatergic neuronal cells; (2) more negative correlation of MAPK and cholinergic, monoaminergic and peptidergic neurons; (3) increased TGFbeta signaling in the vicinity of GABAergic interneurons; (4) reduced WNT signaling in class II glutamatergic neurons. To assess the downstream effects of these changes, we built a tissue-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) from the multiomics data using CellOracle43 and used it to predict TF activities in spatial data and computed the Pearson correlation between TF and signaling activities for the dysregulated pathways in spots containing the cell types identified above. The network suggested that the decrease in MAPK signaling in spaceflight increases activity of the transcription factor Glis3 and reduces Lef1 in neurovasculature, respectively (Fig. 4F, G).Metabolic gene enrichment analysis shows decreased gene expression in spaceflight mice Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on the ST data using metabolic pathways indicated spaceflight-mediated inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, especially Complex I signaling (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Data 13), as well as pathways related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 10), fructose and mannose metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 11) and arachidonic acid metabolism (Fig. 5B). Analysis of multiomics data was consistent with spaceflight-mediated reduction in these pathways together with fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Data 14). Deficits in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation are consistent with previously reported mitochondrial impairments caused by spaceflight44, while, arachidonic acid is primarily produced by astrocytes and suggests astrocyte dysfunction as a potential target for future spaceflight CNS studies.

Two-sided Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test was done with FDR adjustment. multiomics cl: multiomics cluster.Validation of differential gene expression In order to validate our findings on the spaceflight affected processes in mouse brain, we performed single molecule Fluorescence In situ Hybridization (smFISH) using the RNAscope technology for two genes of interest (Adcy1 and Gpc5) in five brain sections: 3 flights, 2 ground controls (Supplementary Fig. 12) from a comparative set of mice (see Methods). We observed significant upregulation in the expression of both genes in spaceflight samples, confirming our findings from the ST data and multiomics data analysis (Supplementary Data 3 and 8, Supplementary Fig. 13A–C). Adcy1 was particularly upregulated in the hippocampus and associated with changes in neuronal activity (ST clusters 8, 11), while Gpc5 was upregulated in astrocytes (multiomics cluster 4).Discussion In this study, we used brain samples from ground control and spaceflown female mice from the RR-3 mission to understand the effects of the space environment at high resolution: at the level of individual brain cell types and brain regions. The main alterations in gene expression induced by spaceflight included changes in synaptogenesis and neuronal development, as well as neurodegeneration and inflammation, similar to previously reported tissue and behavioral-level effects of simulated spaceflight and simulated deep space radiation in mice12. In addition, multiple gene expression changes mapped to pathways associated with circadian rhythm and mitochondrial functions. This study applies spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multiomics to study the effects of spaceflight on the CNS which can serve as a stepping stone towards comparative investigation of samples from other space missions and the outcomes of live animal return and reacclimation to Earth conditions. We demonstrate spatial transcriptomics and single nuclei multiomics datasets to be highly complementary. For example, single-nucleus resolution permitted a focus on glial cells including astrocytes and microglia, which were not distinguishable in neuron-dominated ST datasets, due to the lower resolution of the method. Similarly, our snATAC-seq analysis in transcription factor binding sites indicated immune dysfunction34, while immune cells were too few to be distinguishable in ST. On the other hand, combining spatial and gene expression data revealed region-specific effects of spaceflight32,45. Furthermore, analysis of ligand-receptor interactions revealed interactions between different cell types, with the focus on neurodevelopment and astrocyte functions. In our study, multiple lines of evidence converged on spaceflight-mediated disruption of neurogenesis, neuronal development and synaptogenesis, including dopaminergic synapse formation in the striatum. Similar outcomes of increased pluripotency and reduced cell differentiation have previously been reported in spaceflown mouse bone samples46, in spaceflown human stem cell models47, and in irradiated mouse models48, indicating that it might be a systemic impairment that has now been identified to include the CNS. In addition, neurogenesis has been shown to be affected in a spaceflight analog study that combined simulated microgravity and low dose rate photon irradiation in mice10. Notably, synaptogenesis is particularly sensitive to simulated galactic cosmic radiation components49, indicating a potential additional risk for deep space missions. Finally, our observations in the striatal gene expression changes and transcription factor accessibility are worth validating in future spaceflight experiments, since they might result in disrupted dopaminergic signaling. Spaceflight-associated changes in circadian gene expression are consistent with circadian disruption as one of the major biological responses to spaceflight50, though it has been studied comparatively little so far, especially in animal models51. Molecular and cellular CNS correlation of circadian gene expression dysregulation in spaceflight remains to be investigated in greater detail. Our results suggest potential similarities between spaceflight and some terrestrial CNS conditions. Changes in gene expression associated with disrupted synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, oxidative stress and inflammation collectively resemble neurodegeneration that is associated with natural aging. Thus, in future studies anti-aging and neuroprotective therapeutics, such as antioxidants52 or mitochondria-targeting pharmaceuticals53,54, might be repurposed as spaceflight countermeasures, or vice versa, spaceflight might be used as a model for accelerated aging55. We have recently begun computational studies on identifying terrestrial disorder analogs to alterations induced by spaceflight, though they have not yet included CNS effects, which will require comparing the data from multiple spaceflight experiments56. Our study presents two main limitations. The first one is related to statistical robustness. Specifically, since the input material consists of spaceflight legacy samples collected without envisioning a spatial transcriptomics analysis, the resulting brain morphology is not fully even across samples. This limits the interpretability of the differences between spaceflight and ground control conditions to only a subset of spatial and multiomics clusters. Therefore, it will be important to validate the results of the RR-3 mission by comparing them to the neuronal effects of spaceflight in other mouse studies at similarly high resolution to increase statistical robustness. Moreover, it will be meaningful to expand the experimental design by including samples from animals that underwent a period of reacclimation to ground conditions after spaceflight. By doing so, it will be possible to quantify the extent to which spaceflight-mediated impairments persist after landing, especially once model organisms begin to age. This will allow the investigation of key aspects of astronaut health risks that have not been included yet. The second limitation of our study relates to the sex of the analyzed animals. The majority of mouse studies in spaceflight have been performed on females to facilitate group housing, while astronaut cohorts include both male and female astronauts. Thus, it will be necessary to compare male and female animals to address the sexual dimorphism of CNS health risks. In order to further extrapolate animal models to human outcomes, human and mouse CNS organ model systems will have to be flown as payloads. The first human neurovascular models have already been investigated on the ISS57,58, though their results have not yet been published, while analyzing the effects of simulated space radiation on human neurovascular models59 highlighted the importance of investigating astrocyte functions in missions beyond low-Earth orbit. In preparation for these missions, in which crew time will be severely limited, it will be essential to develop automated, long-lasting CNS models and compare their responses to model organisms. Overall, our study serves as a preliminary indication to the potential risks that the brain is exposed to in spaceflight missions and more studies with larger sample sizes will be required to confirm our findings. To encourage the scientific community to use our datasets for generating new discoveries, all our data is openly available through NASA GeneLab and can be explored by a Shiny app (https://giacomellolabst.shinyapps.io/rr3-brain-shiny/). In summary, in this study, we observed that spaceflight altered the expression of genes associated with neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal development in multiple regions of the brain, especially striatum, as well as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation collectively resembling neurological aging and neurodegeneration. Future studies are planned to increase statistical robustness, focus on neuroimmune outcomes and investigate the persistence of spaceflight effects after landing and re-acclimation to Earth environment. In addition, our findings illustrate the benefits of combined spatial transcriptomics and single-cell analysis in revealing detailed biological alterations and suggest them as highly relevant techniques for future space biology research. Our shared data, freely available in NASA’s OSDR database60, aims to deepen our collective understanding of the impact of spaceflight on biological systems.Methods Ethical approval The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol (CAS-15-001-Y1) was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for both flight (housed at the NASA Ames Research Center) and ground control (housed at the Kennedy Space Center) mice.Animals A cohort of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39–42 days. Male mice were not used in this study because of their behavioral impairments when co-housed in a stressful environment. Recent studies have also shown that the ISS differences across individual male mice are greater than those across female mice61, indicating negligible effects of any hormonal changes during estrus cycle in female mice. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used as ground controls housed in identical hardware (Rodent Habitat AEM-X, identifier 1379) and matching ISS environmental conditions62, including but not limited to cage type, light cycle (standard 12:12 light/dark cycle for both ground control and flight mice groups), food (Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB)), temperature (23.36 °C, and 21.37 °C on average for ground control and flight mice, respectively), humidity (41.86% and 41.53% on average for ground control and flight mice, respectively) and CO2 concentration (3664.89 ppm mean CO2 for ground controls, and 3711.97 ppm mean CO2 for flight mice). Detailed information on environmental telemetry data including temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and cabin radiation exposure can be found on NASA’s Environmental Data Application (EDA) by clicking on the publicly accessible link https://visualization.osdr.nasa.gov/eda/ and selecting ‘RR-3’ from the dropdown menu in the Mission Dashboard on the right-hand panel. Additionally, all information on RR-3 mission payload is publicly available on NASA OSDR link https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/payloads/RR-3. At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls were euthanized (using euthanasia chemical ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine) and whole carcasses were stored at −80 °C until the dissection on earth. Mouse carcasses were removed from −80 °C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15–20 min for dissection. Each carcass dissection time was no longer than 1 h from collection of the first tissue. Brain tissues were harvested and placed into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes for snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, then stored in −80 °C freezer for sample processing.RNA extraction RNA was extracted from tissue sections using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA integrity was measured by using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. All samples had RIN values above 8.Sample preparation Six brains in total, three from each group, were used in this study. Hemispheres of each of the brain samples were split. One hemisphere from each sample was embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. and cryo-sectioned in the hippocampus area at 10 µm thickness. Sections were placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays, Superfrost glass slides or into Eppendorf tubes. Second hemisphere of each brain was used for nuclei isolation. Samples were stored in −80 °C before processing.Visium Spatial Gene Expression technology and sequencing First, 10× Genomics Spatial Gene Expression Tissue Optimization protocol was performed on 8 consecutive mouse brain sections to determine the optimal permeabilization time. One tissue section was used as a negative control. The experiment was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (User Guide, CG000283 Rev B). Spatial gene expression libraries were generated using the Visium Gene Expression kit (10x Genomics). Brain hemispheres were cryo-sectioned to reach the hippocampus area. Two consecutive sections of hippocampus from the ground control cohort and two consecutive sections of hippocampus from the flight cohort were placed on Visium glass slides. Consecutive sections were considered technical replicates. In total, 12 Visium libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s protocol (User Guide, CG000239 Rev F). Twelve libraries were sequenced by using an Illumina Novaseq platform, while four were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform and sequenced by using a Illumina Novaseq platform. Length of read 1 was 28 bp and read 2 was 120 bp long.Chromium single-cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression technology and sequencing Nuclei isolation One hemisphere of 4 brains used for Spatial Transcriptomics was utilized for nuclei isolation. Brain tissue was placed into a tube together with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 nM NaCl, 3 nM MgCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 1 mM DTT, 1U/µl RNAseOUT), homogenized by pestle homogenization in eppendorf tube and incubated on ice for 5 min. The nuclei were extracted by following 10XGenomic protocol for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (User Guide, CG000375 Rev B). Each sample was filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer prior to FACS sorting. Sorted and permeabilized nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, counted and used for Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression library preparation. One hemisphere from the ground control G1 sample was used to optimize the nuclei isolation protocol.Cell sorting The stained cell nuclei suspension samples were then analyzed and sorted utilizing a BD Bioscience Influx flow cytometer using an 86 μm nozzle. Flow cytometry analyses and sorting were carried out by the following gating strategy: nuclei:singlets:7-AAD positive events. The nuclei sub-population was characterized in the Side Scatter-Forward Scatter plot by back-gating from the 7-AAD (ex. 488 nm, em. 692 nm), singlets were gated in the Side Scatter – Pulse width plot and finally the nuclei were gated in the Side Scatter – 7-AAD plot. The nuclei were collected in a BSA coated Eppendorf tube.Single nuclei samples Isolated and sorted nuclei were used to generate single nuclei gene expression and ATAC-seq libraries according to the manufacturer’s protocol using Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kit (User Guide, CG000338 Rev E). Finished Gene Expression libraries were sequenced by using an Illumina NextSeq2000 platform with lengths of read 1 and read 2, 28 bp and 120 bp long respectively. Finished ATAC-seq libraries were sequenced by using an Illumina NextSeq2000 platform. Length of both read 1 and read 2 was 50 bp long.Pre-processing and Clustering of Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) and multiomics Data ST data generation Sequenced Visium libraries were processed using Space Ranger software (version 1.0.0, 10X Genomics). Reads were aligned to the Space Ranger built-in mouse reference genome (mm10-3.0.0) and count matrices were generated using these along with the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images.ST data analysis ST data analysis was performed jointly in R (v4.1.1) using the Seurat package (v4.0.1) and STUtility (v0.1.0). InputFromTable() was used to generate a Seurat object from the count matrices with specific filtering parameters (min.spot.feature.count = 100, min.gene.count = 100, min.gene.spots = 10, and min.spot.count = 100). The count matrices were enriched for protein-coding and lincRNA genes and then filtered for MALAT1, ribosomal and mitochondrial genes. Next, all spots containing less than 200 genes were removed. Technical variability within data was reduced with SCTransform (SCTransform() with default settings; SelectIntegrationFeatures() with nfeatures = 3000; PrepSCTIntegration() with anchor.features assigned to genes returned from the SelectIntegrationFeatures()) and Harmony (RunHarmony() with group.vars = ‘section.name’ addressing for batches associated with different Visium slide capture areas) packages. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for selection of significant components (RunPCA() with default 50 PCs computed; 35 selected for the rest of the analysis). FindClusters() with resolution = 0.35 and dims = 1:35 was used to identify ST clusters and then Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the same in 2D space.Multiomics data generation The sequenced multiomics (snRNA-seq, and snATAC-seq) libraries were processed using CellRanger ARC (v2) software from 10X Genomics with default settings. Reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10 reference 2020-A from 10X Genomics).Multiomics data analysis Data analysis for the snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data was performed in R (v4.1.1) using the packages Seurat (v4.1.0) and Signac (v1.6.0). In total, extracted single nuclei from 5 brain hemispheres were processed, resulting in 21,178 nuclei used in the analysis. The chromatin assay was generated using CreateChromatinAssay() from the Signac package (min.cells = 10). The annotation data for this was obtained using GetGRangesFromEnsDb() (ensdb=EnsDb.Mmusculus.v79). The snRNA-seq assay was generated using Read10X_h5() available in the Seurat package. MALAT1, ribosomal and mitochondrial genes were removed and count matrix was further filtered on number of reads, genes and peaks, as well as fraction ATAC-seq reads in peaks, and enrichment of ATAC-seq reads at transcription start sites. Filtering for low quality nuclei and genes was applied separately for each sample using a custom function, code for which can be found on our GitHub repository63 (see Code availability for more details). Doublet finder was used for doublet removal (v2.0.3) with a doublet score cut-off of 0.6. RNA-seq data was normalized using SCTransform with V2 regularization, while also regressing out cell cycle effects using cell cycle genes list available in the Seurat package. ATAC-seq data was normalized using TF-IDF normalization with default settings. Harmony (group.by.vars=‘bio_origin’) was then used to remove batch effects and integrate data from different samples, after which cells from both RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data were clustered using Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) Analysis (FindMultiModalNeighbors() function with parameters reduction.list=list(‘SCT_CC_harmony’, ‘ATAC_harmony’); dims.list=list(1:30, 2:30); k.nn=30). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the multiomics clusters (FindClusters() with setting Resolution=0.2).Differential expression analysis For identification of differentially expressed genes between clusters, Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, implemented in the Seurat function FindAllMarkers() was used. Only genes expressed in at least 25% of cells were included in the analysis, and genes with log2 fold change >0.25 and FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Differential gene expression between flight and ground conditions was performed using MAST, with a mixed model, using sample as a random effect. The analysis was done on each cell type separately, and included genes expressed in at least 30% of flight or ground cells in the given cell type. Genes with FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Differential chromatin accessibility between flight and ground conditions was performed the same way, using the same parameters.Gene overlap test To test the significance of the overlapping genes found from the validation analysis, a hypergeometric distribution test was used to test the null hypothesis: The overlap of X genes between the two genelists is a random sampling effect. The phyper() function in R (v4.3.2) was used to perform the hypergeometric distribution test and the resultant p-value was recorded. The R scripts consisting of the code for this test is available on our github repository63 (refer to Code availability for details).Motif analysis ChromVAR (v1.16.0)64, with default settings, was used to assess chromatin accessibility around DNA sequence motifs, taken from the JASPAR (v2020_0.99.10) database65. For each motif and cell chromVAR calculated a score representing chromatin accessibility, while correcting for confounders such as for GC content and average accessibility. The chromatin accessibility scores from flight and ground cells were then compared, for each cell type separately. This was done with a mixed model using, sample as a random effect, implemented in the lmer() function from the lme4 (v1.1-28.9000) package. Motifs with FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially accessible between flight and ground conditions.Gene and cluster annotation Marker genes from the clustering analysis and the DEGs from the differential expression, for both ST and multiomics data, were using marker genes in the Tabula muris database66, literature search and EnrichR pathway analysis tool (with mouse model organism used as background)67–69. These annotations for the marker genes were used as a guide for manual annotation of the multiomics as well as the ST clusters.Pathway analysis For pathway analysis and visualization of the results, the Consensus Pathway Analysis platform18 and the EnrichR pathway analysis tool67–69 were used. For both these tools, pathway enrichment was determined relative to a universal background rather than a custom-defined, brain-specific gene list. This is to accept a known bias towards overrepresentation of brain-specific pathways in place of potential unknown biases resulting from the construction of a custom background gene list.Ligand-receptor analysis Ligand-receptor interactions analysis was performed with the package CellPhoneDB (v3)70. Multiomics clusters were analyzed using the DE genes for spaceflight obtained from using MAST (v1.20.0) (see Differential Expression Analysis in Methods). For the analysis, DE genes were transformed to their human orthologues which is a required criteria to run CellPhoneDB. The ligand-receptor analysis on the spatial data to identify co-expressed LR pairs was performed using SpatialDM (v0.1.0)26. The standard pipeline to perform global selection of significant LR pairs and for local selection of spots for co-expressed LR pairs was performed using the package documentation as a reference (with l = 250 and cutoff = 0.2 in sdm.weight_matrix() function). Likelihood ratio test was used in the differential testing and the test was run by following the package documentation. For further details on the scripts used in this analysis, refer to the Code availability section.Spatial pattern analysis We inferred a gene regulatory network (GRN) from the brain multiomics dataset using CellOracle43. A tissue-specific GRN was generated by grouping all brain cell types into the same label before running the method. Transcription Factor (TF) activities were inferred for the brain spatial transcriptomics data using decoupler-py41 with the method mlm and the obtained GRN as prior knowledge. Additionally, pathway activities were inferred for the brain spatial transcriptomics data using decoupler-py with the method mlm and the PROGENy model of pathway footprints as prior knowledge42. To analyze spatial relationships between cell types and pathway activities, we built cell type specific models with MISTy40, which predict abundances (as determined by Stereoscope) from pathway activities in situ and from the local neighborhood (up to two spots away). In this case, The MISTy models are built only on Visium spots with at least 5% of the specific cell type. We then extracted cell type-pathway interactions that occur in only one of the conditions. In the regions of interest where these differential interactions occur, we investigate changes in correlation (Pearson) between pathway activities and TF activities inferred from the CellOracle GRNs. We used Student’s t-tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction for both determining the differential interactions and the changes in correlation.Metabolic pathway analysis The flight-vs-ground expression level fold changes of each cluster were computed for genes that are expressed in more than 1% of the cells in either flight or ground condition of the cluster, using the FindMarkers() function in the Seurat package (v4.1.1)71. Genes listed in the RECON3D metabolic model72 were extracted with their assigned metabolic pathway membership. The human gene IDs were translated to mouse gene IDs using the manual inspection and the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) Comparison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP) service73. All genes from the flight-vs-ground expression analysis were then ranked by fold-change differences (positive to negative) regardless of the p-value from FindMarkers() function, and tested for pathway enrichment vs the genes in RECON3D pathways using the fgsea function in the fgsea package (v1.22.0)74 in R (v4.2.1)75. Resulting p-value enrichment of RECON3D-sourced pathways were adjusted (adjusted p-value) by program for the number of pathway tests performed.ShinyApp ShinyApp was designed using the package shiny (v1.7.1) in R (v4.1.1) and the theme superhero was used for the overall esthetics of the shinyapp design. The R (v4.3.2) package babelgene (v22.9) with references from the  database was used to identify the human orthologs for the genes listed under the Cluster markers - Expression and Spaceflight DEGs - Expression tabs in the shinyapp. All genes from Supplementary Data 4, 7 and 8 can be visualized on the shinyapp.RNAscope Single molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (smFISH) to detect expression of genes of interest (Adcyl and Gpc55) was performed using the RNAscope technology following the manufacturer’s protocol (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, ACD, Hayward, CA). Target genes (Gpc5 in channel red, Adcy1 in channel green) were visualized using the HRP-based RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Assay V2 (Cat. No. 323110). Brains from a cohort of 14–15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J wild type mice flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 28-29 days (NASA RR-10 mission) were used for this validation. Brains from mice of similar age, sex and strain were used as ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. At the end of the mission, spaceflight and ground controls were euthanized (euthanasia method: bilateral thoracotomy with sedation, ketamine/xylazine injection) and whole carcasses were stored at −80 °C until the dissection on earth. Brain tissues were harvested and snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored in −80 °C freezer for sample processing. Brains from two ground controls (GC3, GC9) and three flights (FL1, FL3 and FL5) were cryo-sectioned to reach the hippocampus area and for each of them, one 10 µm section was placed on a superfrost plus slide and stored at −80 °C for less than a week before proceeding to the RNAscope protocol. The tissue sections were subjected to permeabilization steps before incubation with the target probes. The signal was amplified using the HRP-based technology (visualized by Tyramide Signal Amplification or TSATM fluorophores by PerkinElmer).RNAscope signal quantification The quantification of the fluorescence signal was performed with Fiji by ImageJ software. The images were taken with a ZEN LSM700 confocal microscope and exported as tiff with the same settings. Once exported they were loaded on ImageJ and the whole area of the section, i.e., the whole hemisphere was selected for quantification. Image was then transformed from RGB to 16-bit and quantification was done by counting the number of pixels positive for the threshold set. The threshold was unique for each channel and was kept the same for ground and control samples.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (13MB, pdf) Peer Review File (893.3KB, pdf) 41467_2024_48916_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (15.9KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Information Dataset 1 (638.8KB, xlsx) Dataset 2 (12.7KB, xlsx) Dataset 3 (51.4KB, xlsx) Dataset 4 (11.7KB, xlsx) Dataset 5 (12.9KB, xlsx) Dataset 6 (20.3KB, xlsx) Dataset 7 (52.4KB, xlsx) Dataset 8 (182.5KB, xlsx) Dataset 9 (29.8KB, xlsx) Dataset 10 (231.5KB, xlsx) Dataset 11 (79.2KB, xlsx) Dataset 12 (23.7KB, xlsx) Dataset 13 (47.4KB, xlsx) Dataset 14 (48.6KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (3.4MB, pdf) Source data Source Data (65.1KB, xlsx) Acknowledgements We would like to gratefully acknowledge the assistance of San-huei Lai Polo with hosting data on the NASA GeneLab server.
