Keywords: orthostatic hypotension, microgravity, microcirculation Orthostatic hypotension was found to manifest among the astronauts of Project Mercury after only brief excursions into space, making this condition one of the first medical complications reported to occur in astronauts (1, 2). Following short-term flight (2–3 wk) on the space shuttle, 20–50% of astronauts exhibit orthostatic hypotension when reexposed to normal gravitational stress (3–5), with the prevalence of this condition rising markedly after longer term (4–6 mo) habitation in microgravity (6). This orthostatic hypotension is due, in part, to a diminished ability to elevate peripheral vascular resistance (PVR; refs. 3, 7–9). One possible mechanism for the impaired ability to elevate PVR following spaceflight is a reduced magnitude or rate of vasoconstriction of the arterial resistance vasculature. Ground-based human and animal models used to simulate the effects of microgravity suggest decrements in vasoconstrictor responsiveness of arterial segments in various regions of the body, including the splanchnic circulation (10–13), as a potential mechanism contributing to orthostatic hypotension in astronauts. In the face of a spaceflight-associated reduction in PVR, cardiac output would have to be augmented in order to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) during an orthostatic challenge. However, the ability to augment cardiac output following simulated microgravity is diminished, owing to decrements in stroke volume (14, 15). Venous filling pressure can affect stroke volume via the Starling mechanism and is largely regulated by systemic venous capacitance, of which the splanchnic region has the greatest capacitance (16). Because veins from the mesentery are responsive to sympathetic activity (17), active baroreceptor-mediated venoconstriction would mobilize mesenteric venous blood volume centrally to maintain venous filling pressure and stroke volume, while a diminished adrenergic and/or myogenic constriction of mesenteric veins after spaceflight would impair this process. Previous investigations simulating microgravity in rats have demonstrated diminished adrenergic and pressure-induced constriction of mesenteric veins (13, 18). However, little is known about the effects of spaceflight on the intrinsic vaso- or venoconstrictor properties of the mesenteric vasculature or whether putative alterations in vasomotor responses are reversible. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of microgravity on intrinsic vasomotor properties of mesenteric arteries and veins from mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS)-131, STS-133, and STS-135 shuttle missions. Based on previous results from studies using ground-based simulations of microgravity (12, 13, 18), we hypothesized that spaceflight will diminish the magnitude of adrenergic KCl- and caffeine-evoked vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries, and that this decrement will be related to altered sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling; and that spaceflight will blunt adrenergic constriction of mesenteric veins across a range of intraluminal pressures. In addition, we hypothesized that the putative decrements in adrenergic vasoconstriction are reversible within 1 wk of return to Earth's gravitational influences. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ( Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). Animals Experiments described herein were performed on distinct animal groups from three separate NASA space shuttle missions. Female C57BL/6 mice (16–23 wk old; n=11; Charles River, Raleigh, NC, USA) were flown on the STS-131 mission for 15 d. Microvessel dissection procedures commenced ∼2.5 h after the landing of the space shuttle, following isoflurane anesthesia and euthanasia via exsanguination. Female BALB/cJ mice (12–13 wk old) were flown on the STS-133 mission for 13 d. Animals were euthanized with a high dose injection of xylazine and ketamine (i.p., 30 mg/kg body weight xylazine plus 300 mg/kg body weight ketamine), and microvessel dissection procedures commenced precisely 1 d (R+1; n=2), 5 d (R+5; n=2), and 7 d (R+7; n=2) after the return landing. Female C57BL/6 mice (9 wk old; n=3) were flown on the STS-135 mission for 13 d. Microvessel dissection procedures commenced ∼3–4 h after landing, following isoflurane anesthesia and euthanasia via cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Spaceflight group (SF) mice were housed in NASA's animal enclosure modules (AEMs) located on the orbiter's middeck, maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle, and provided food (19) and water ad libitum. Age-matched ground-based control group (GC) animals were housed in identical AEMs within an orbital environment simulator at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to mimic the temperature, humidity, and CO2 of the space shuttle middeck. GC mice during the STS-131 (n=11) and STS-135 (n=9) missions were housed for the duration of each mission, beginning 48 h after launch and ending 48 h after landing. Aged-matched GC animals during the STS-133 mission were housed beginning and ending simultaneously to SF animals; experiments with GC mice (total n=10) were performed simultaneously at the R+1 (n=3), R+5 (n=4), and R+7 (n=3) time points. All experimental procedures conducted on SF animals were duplicated on GC animals. The KSC veterinarian deemed all animals healthy prior to SF and GC experiments. All in vitro laboratory experiments involving animals from each space shuttle flight were identically performed as described below.Microvessel preparation Mesenteric tissue was dissected from the carcass, placed in physiological saline solution (PSS) buffer on ice, and transported in a staggered fashion from KSC to the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, FL (∼3-h drive). Distal arcading resistance arteries (STS-131, STS-133) and veins (STS-135) from the mesentery were then dissected free using a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX12; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Vessels were transferred to a Lucite chamber containing PSS, cannulated at each end with glass micropipettes, secured via 11-0 ophthalmic sutures (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA), and pressurized with PSS. After cannulation, the isolated vessel tissue chamber was transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70) interfaced in series with a video camera (Panasonic BG310; Panasonic, Tokyo, Japan), a horizontal video caliper (307A; Colorado Video, Boulder, CO, USA), a data-acquisition system (Powerlab; ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA), a video cassette recorder (VCR; Panasonic AG-7300), and a video monitor (Panasonic WV-BM1410). Vessels were equilibrated for 15 min at 37°C with an intraluminal pressure of 108 cmH2O for arteries (20) and 4 cmH2O for veins prior to investigation of vasoconstrictor and myogenic properties. The distance between cannulating micropipettes was adjusted following pressurization so that the vessel axial length was straight but not stretched. Bathing PSS was replaced every 15 min during equilibration and throughout the experimental procedures. Intraluminal diameters were continuously measured via videomicroscopic techniques (12, 13).Mesenteric arteries Intraluminal pressure was maintained and manipulated by way of two independent reservoirs connected to the glass micropipettes cannulating mesenteric arteries. The basal pressure of 108 cmH2O was achieved by setting both reservoirs to the same hydrostatic level. Active myogenic behavior was determined via stepwise increases in intraluminal pressure (i.e., from 100 to 180 cmH2O) by raising the height of both reservoirs in 20-cmH2O increments. Intraluminal pressure was then decreased in 20-cmH2O increments from 180 to 100 cmH2O before return to basal pressure. Vasoconstrictor responses to increasing concentrations of KCl (10–100 mM) were measured to investigate the contribution of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Target isotonic K+ bath concentrations were achieved by balancing concentrations of NaCl and KCl in PSS such that bath osmolarity was maintained. Vasoconstrictor responses to the cumulative addition of norepinephrine (NE, 10−9 to 10−4 M) were measured to investigate α-adrenoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction through intracellular Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was determined by measuring arterial responses to caffeine (15 mM) as previously described (12, 21). Maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness were determined after two 15-min incubations in Ca2+-free PSS at 108 cmH2O. A bolus dose of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 10−4 M) (22, 23) was added during the second 15-min incubation in Ca2+-free PSS in order to ensure complete smooth muscle relaxation. Medial wall thickness was taken as the mean of three separate wall thickness measurements from positions randomly selected along the microvessel. In a second set of mesenteric arteries, passive vessel behavior was determined using identical procedures as that for the active myogenic response, except that the arteries were incubated twice for 15 min in Ca2+-free PSS with SNP (10−4 M) present during the second incubation prior to and during determination of the pressure-diameter relation. During the NE dose-response test described above, a VCR was used to record the mesenteric artery constriction at 30 frames/s. To characterize mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor dynamics (12), the temporal response to NE was evaluated during the 10−4 M NE dose by using a video caliper (307A; Colorado Video) to conduct frame-by-frame measurements of intraluminal diameter, beginning at the onset of vasoconstriction and proceeding until a steady state was observed. Time and diameter values were curve-fit to a monoexponential-plus decay model (24, 25) using an iterative least-squares technique by means of a commercial graphing/analysis package (KaleidaGraph 3.5; Synergy Software, Inc., Reading, PA, USA). A user-defined function to the data was fit using the following equation: ΔDt=Db−ΔDss[1−e−(t−TD)/τ] where ΔDt is the change in diameter at time t, Db is baseline diameter, ΔDss is the change in diameter from baseline to the steady-state value, TD is the time delay, and τ is the time constant of the response, which estimates the time taken to reach 63% of the final exponential response. From the mathematical modeling results, the mean response time (MRT; TD + τ) and the rate of vasoconstriction (ΔD/τ) were calculated. To determine whether alterations in adrenergic vasoconstriction of arteries returns to normal within 1 wk of return to terrestrial gravity, experiments were performed on days R+1, R+5, and R+7 after landing. Mesenteric arteries were dissected and prepared for in vitro experimentation. NE dose responses, maximal intraluminal diameter, and medial wall thickness measurements were performed as described above.Mesenteric veins Basal intraluminal pressure of mesenteric veins was set at 4 cmH2O. NE dose response curves were determined as described above for mesenteric arteries. Immediately after incubation in the final concentration of 10−4 M NE, intraluminal pressure was decreased to 2 cmH2O for 3 min before increasing intraluminal pressure in a stepwise fashion up to 12 cmH2O in 2-cmH2O increments to determine the pressure-diameter relation. Maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness at 4 cmH2O were determined as described above for mesenteric arteries.mRNA expression Additional mesenteric arteries isolated from SF and GC mice from the STS-131 mission were snap-frozen and stored at −80°C for later analysis of mRNA levels as described previously (12, 26, 27). The RNAqueous-Micro Kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), specified for use in microdissected tissue, was used to isolate total RNA from mesenteric arteries. Vessels immersed in 100 μl of lysis buffer were homogenized using a pellet mixer (Argos Technologies, Elgin, IL, USA). The lysate solution was then passed through the RNAqueous silica filter for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into complimentary DNA (cDNA) via the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was then used in the real-time PCR (StepOnePlus; Applied Biosystems) to determine mRNA levels by way of TaqMan gene expression assays and endogenous controls (Applied Biosystems) specific for ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR-2; Mm00465877_m1), ryanodine receptor 3 (RyR-3; Mm01328421_m1), and 18S ribosomal RNA (4319413E). On the basis of data from a previous study where no ryanodine receptor 1 mRNA expression was detected in mesenteric arteries from hindlimb-unloaded rats (12), we elected only to probe for changes in RyR-2 and RyR-3 mRNA.Solutions and drugs PSS contained (in mM) 145 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.17 MgSO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 5.0 glucose, 2.0 pyruvate, 0.025 EDTA, and 3.0 MOPS, with pH 7.4. PSS was supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1 g/100 ml; USB Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA) and passed through a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filter (430015; Corning, Corning, NY, USA). Ca2+-free PSS preparation was identical except for the addition of 2 mM EDTA, the replacement of CaCl2 with 2.0 mM NaCl, and the exclusion of BSA. KCl and NE stock solutions were prepared in PSS. Caffeine (15 mM) was prepared in Ca2+-free PSS.Statistical and data analyses Intraluminal diameters were measured in micrometers and expressed as a percentage of vasoconstriction as follows: % Vasoconstriction=(Db−Dss)/Db×100 where Db is the initial baseline intraluminal diameter measured before experimental intervention, and Dss is the steady-state intraluminal diameter measured after agonist addition. Spontaneous tone was expressed as a percentage of the maximal diameter (Dm) as follows: % Spontaneous tone=(Dm−Db)/Dm×100 The significance of differences in body mass, vessel characteristics, and mRNA levels were determined via Student's unpaired t tests. Pressure-response and concentration-response curves were evaluated by using repeated-measures analysis of variance with one within (intraluminal pressure or agonist concentration) and one between (experimental groups) factor. Planned contrasts were conducted at each intraluminal pressure or concentration level to determine whether differences existed between experimental groups (GC vs. SF). All values are presented as means ± se. An α level of 0.05 delineated significance.RESULTS Body and soleus muscle mass For STS-131 mice, total body mass was not different between GC and SF mice (22.0±0.4 vs. 20.9±0.7 g, respectively). Total body mass of STS-133 GC mice (21.7±0.2 g) was greater than that of SF R+1 (18.7±0.3 g) and SF R+5 (20.3±0.1 g) mice, but not different from that of SF R+7 (20.6±0.7 g) mice. And total body mass of STS-135 mice was not different between groups (GC: 19.7±0.5 g; SF: 19.4±1.4 g). Right soleus muscle mass was greater in GC than SF mice in both the STS-131 (GC: 13.5±0.6 mg; SF: 10.4±0.4 mg) and STS-135 (GC: 6.0±0.3 mg; SF: 4.6±0.1 mg) missions; soleus muscle mass was not obtained from STS-133 animals.Vessel characteristics For mesenteric arteries pressurized at 108 cmH2O, maximal diameter, medial wall thickness, and spontaneous tone were not different between GC and SF groups on either the STS-131 or STS-133 missions (Table 1). For mesenteric veins pressurized at 4 cmH2O, medial wall thickness and spontaneous tone were not different between GC and SF mice from the STS-135 mission (Table 1). However, maximal diameter of mesenteric veins tended to be larger (P=0.078) in the SF mice (Table 1). Table 1.

Mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor responses NE produced a dose-dependent increase in vasoconstriction of mesenteric arteries from both GC and SF animals (Fig. 1A). The vasoconstriction induced by NE was lower in the arteries from SF vs. GC (Fig. 1A). When quantifying temporal vasoconstrictor responses of mesenteric arteries to 10−4 M NE, both groups demonstrated a delay followed by a monoexponential decrease in lumen diameter. The monoexponential model provided a superb fit, as demonstrated by a high correlation coefficient (GC: r=0.983±0.006; SF: r=0.946±0.042). The speed of vasoconstriction was markedly slower in the SF group, resulting in a doubling in the time taken to reach a steady-state diameter after exposure to NE (GC: 10.0±2.5 s; SF: 20.6±5.6 s; P < 0.05). Arteries from the SF mice demonstrated a prolonged MRT (i.e., time delay + time constant; Fig. 1B) as well as an ∼50% reduction in the rate of vasoconstriction (Δ vasoconstriction ÷ time constant; Fig. 1B) vs. the GC response.

Spaceflight did not alter active myogenic responses to pressure changes (Fig. 2B) or affect the passive-pressure response characteristics of mesenteric arteries (Fig. 2B). Vasoconstrictor responses to caffeine were lower in mesenteric arteries from SF vs. GC mice (Fig. 3A). Figure 2.

NE-evoked constriction was significantly lower in the SF R+1 group relative to that from GC mice (Fig. 4A), and qualitatively similar to results obtained immediately after spaceflight (Fig. 1A). However, after 5 d (Fig. 4B) and 7 d (Fig. 4C) of ground recovery, mesenteric artery vasoconstriction was not different between groups. Figure 4.

Venoconstriction to NE was lower in veins from SF mice (Fig. 5A). Mesenteric vein luminal diameter increased as a function of increasing intraluminal pressure in the presence of 10−4 M NE in both groups. However, intraluminal diameter was greater at each pressure in veins from the SF group (Fig. 5B). Figure 5.

Based on hindlimb unloading (HU) rodent models, which are ground-based studies to simulate a weightless environment (12, 13), we hypothesized that mesenteric vessel responses to NE, KCl, and caffeine would be impaired in SF mice. The results demonstrate that spaceflight diminishes the magnitude (Fig. 1A) and rapidity (Fig. 1B) of mesenteric artery vasoconstriction to the adrenergic agonist NE; microgravity diminishes vasoconstriction to KCl (Fig. 2A) and caffeine (Fig. 3A); and spaceflight does not affect myogenic vasoconstriction (Fig. 2B). The blunted constriction to caffeine, which is mediated through a sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-release mechanism, was associated with lower arterial RyR-2 (Fig. 2B) and RyR-3 (Fig. 2C) mRNA expression. These microgravity-induced changes in arterial vasoconstriction occurred in the absence of any gross structural changes in mesenteric artery wall thickness or maximal interluminal diameter (Table 1), or by any alterations in the passive mechanical properties of the vessels, as indicated by an unaltered passive pressure-diameter response (Fig. 2B). The diminished adrenergic mesenteric artery vasoconstriction persisted 1 d postspaceflight (Fig. 4A), but was similar to that in GC mice at 5 and 7 d postflight (Fig. 4B, C). Finally, spaceflight blunted NE-evoked constriction of mesenteric veins (Fig. 5). These results suggest that on return to Earth, decrements in mesenteric arterial and venous constriction in astronauts could compromise the cardiovascular response to maintain arterial pressure during orthostatic stress. Mechanistic basis for diminished arterial vasoconstriction Following spaceflight, astronauts demonstrate a diminished ability to elevate PVR during orthostasis (3, 6, 8). This reduced PVR occurs despite elevations in sympathetic neural outflow (28) and higher levels of circulating plasma NE (29) during microgravity. Such observations support the contention that microgravity induces a hyporesponsiveness of resistance arteries to adrenergic stimuli. Results from the present study confirm that microgravity impairs both the magnitude and rate of mesenteric artery vasoconstriction to NE (Fig. 1A, B, respectively). In one of only two studies to previously examine the effects of spaceflight on intrinsic vasomotor responsiveness, Hatton et al. (30) reported that microgravity blunted NE-mediated vasoconstriction of mesenteric arteries from SF rats. However, because these animals were spontaneously hypertensive, the effects of spaceflight on vascular responses in normotensive animals was uncertain. In the second study, NE-mediated constriction of gastrocnemius feed arteries was found to be lower in SF mice (31). Collectively, experimental results with rats and mice confirm the contention that spaceflight compromises the vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the peripheral resistance vasculature to adrenergic stimulation. To elucidate potential mechanisms of reduced vasoconstriction after spaceflight, vasoconstrictor responses that occur through discrete mechanisms were determined. NE and KCl cause vasoconstriction through both the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and intracellular Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (32–34). In contrast, myogenic vasoconstriction appears to be more dependent on extracellular Ca2+ for smooth muscle contraction (35–38). Several studies have shown that while mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores may occur during myogenic vasoconstriction (39), release of intracellular Ca2+ is not an essential component for this vasoconstriction to occur (37, 38). Therefore, the differential effects of spaceflight to impair vasoconstriction elicited through both NE (Fig. 1A) and KCl (Fig. 2A), but not via a myogenic response (Fig. 2B), could reflect a deficit in intracellular Ca2+ release. To test this possibility, caffeine-induced vasoconstriction, which occurs through an intracellular Ca2+-release mechanism (32–34), was measured. The finding of a lower caffeine-mediated vasoconstriction of arteries from SF mice (Fig. 3A) suggests that microgravity adversely affects elevations in smooth muscle cell cytosolic Ca2+ levels through an impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-release mechanism. This conclusion is supported by the findings of reduced RyR-2 (Fig. 3B) and RyR-3 (Fig. 3C) mRNA levels in the mesenteric arteries from SF mice. These ryanodine receptor subtypes are important for intracellular release of Ca2+ in smooth muscle cells (40, 41). Numerous ground-based studies using HU rats to simulate the effects of microgravity have found deficits in arterial vasoconstriction, including those of the abdominal and thoracic aorta (42–46), pulmonary arteries (47), femoral arteries (46, 48, 49), skeletal muscle arterioles (22, 50) and mesenteric arteries (12, 13, 51, 52). In mesenteric arteries, Colleran et al. (12) demonstrated lower NE-, KCl-, and caffeine-induced vasoconstriction, as well as decreased RyR-2 mRNA and protein after 14 d of HU. In addition, ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is decreased in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from mesenteric arteries of HU rats (53). Thus, the mechanism of the microgravity-induced impairment of mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor responsiveness in the present study appears to be consistent with that of ground-based studies with HU rats. Alternative mechanisms have been proposed to underlie reductions in responsiveness of central arteries to NE, including enhanced endothelial-dependent vasodilation (offsetting vasoconstriction), and atrophic vascular remodeling resulting in a reduction in medial wall thickness and medial cross-sectional area. With regard to the first alternatively proposed mechanism, it is possible that arterial hyporesponsiveness to NE with simulated microgravity involves up-regulation of the endothelial NO/cGMP pathway, as differences in vasoconstriction were abolished with the ablation of the endothelial cell lining or inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity (42, 47). However, Delp et al. (44) and Sangha et al. (48) have demonstrated in the abdominal aorta that the impairment of vasoconstriction persists regardless of whether the endothelium is removed or intact. And in perhaps the most relevant study, Hatton et al. (30) demonstrated an attenuated relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine in mesenteric arteries of rats after spaceflight, suggesting that endothelium-derived NO bioavailability is depressed rather than enhanced in arteries showing reduced vasoconstrictor responsiveness to NE. The second alternative mechanism for the reduced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric arteries is an atrophic structural remodeling (54, 55). Using both histomorphometric techniques and videographic methods in pressurized mesenteric artery segments to determine vessel medial wall thickness, medial cross-sectional area and intraluminal diameter, Lin et al. (54) have reported a thinner medial wall and diminished medial cross-sectional area with no change in maximal intraluminal diameter in mesenteric arteries from HU rats; this atrophic remodeling was associated with attenuated myogenic KCl- and phenylephrine-evoked vasoconstriction. Others, however, using similar histomorphometric and videographic methodologies, have found no alterations in gross vascular structure of mesenteric arteries in HU rats (12, 13, 56) or spaceflown rats (30) and mice (present study). Thus, the preponderance of evidence suggests that atrophic structural remodeling cannot account for decrements in vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric arteries in spaceflown and HU rodents.Mechanistic basis for diminished venous constriction Venular pressure-diameter responses are regulated by sympathetic activity in vivo (17) through α1 adrenoreceptors (57, 58). To our knowledge, the effects of microgravity on intrinsic venoconstrictor function have not been previously studied. Results from the present study demonstrate blunted NE-induced constriction of mesenteric veins (Fig. 5A) across a range of intraluminal pressures (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent with a previous observation of diminished α-receptor density in the vena cava of rats following spaceflight (59) as a potential mechanism for the diminished venoconstriction. Several studies using HU rats have likewise reported a decreased venoconstriction to NE in the vena cava and mesenteric veins (13, 18, 59, 60), but not in jugular and femoral veins (46). Similar to mesenteric arteries, another potential mechanism for spaceflight-associated impairment of venoconstriction is a blunting of intracellular Ca2+ release through the down-regulation of ryanodine receptors (61). Indeed, Morel et al. (60) demonstrated lower intracellular Ca2+ release in response to NE, angiotensin II, and caffeine in rat portal vein myocytes after 14 d of HU. Further, [3H]ryanodine binding in the same myocytes revealed a reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum-based ryanodine receptors with no change in ryanodine receptor Ca2+ sensitivity or voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity. The primary unanswered question regarding vascular alterations associated with spaceflight is the stimulus for the change. Results from the present and previous studies (30, 31) show impaired contraction of smooth muscle cells of arteries and veins from SF rats and mice. In addition, pregnant rats flown on the Cosmos 1514 mission had prolonged labor (62), and rats flown on Cosmos 1667 had distended stomachs filled with food (63), indicating the possible impairment of uterine and stomach smooth muscle contraction with spaceflight. Also, lymphatic vascular smooth muscle cells in HU rats demonstrate an impaired ability to constrict (64). The apparent systemic nature of the smooth muscle dysfunction would seem to rule out local alterations in hydrostatic pressures or intravascular shear-stress as direct effector mechanisms. Rather, alterations in hydrostatic fluid pressures or other spaceflight-associated phenomena could trigger systemic release of some as of yet unknown factors that could be responsible for the smooth muscle dysfunction induced by microgravity. For example, cephalic fluid shifts elicit elevations in circulating levels of numerous substances (65), including endogenous hormones such as atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) and brain natriuretic peptides (BNPs) that serve to regulate fluid volume (66). We have previously demonstrated that both ANPs and BNPs reduce smooth muscle contractile responses to adrenergic stimulation in mesenteric arteries and veins, and that these peptides are elevated during simulated microgravity (13). Keil et al. (67) have also reported that ANP levels were lower in atrial tissue from rats flown on the Cosmos 2044/Bion 9 biosatellite, and suggested that the lower tissue concentrations reflect elevated ANP secretion during flight. However, others have reported unchanged (68) or decreased (69) plasma ANP concentrations with simulated microgravity. Therefore, whether these peptides or other circulating factors are responsible for microgravity-induced smooth muscle dysfunction remains to be determined.Time course of arterial recovery from spaceflight Impairment of vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric resistance arteries may underlie, at least in part, the orthostatic hypotension evident in humans following spaceflight (3, 6–9, 70), given that ∼20% of the increase in PVR comes from the splanchnic region on standing (71). The condition of orthostatic intolerance is usually corrected within 2 d of return to terrestrial gravity, while complete orthostatic recovery is achieved in a length of time equivalent to that of flight operations (5). Using ground-based models of simulated microgravity, structural and functional adaptations of arteries in various vascular beds require several days before either partial or full return to that observed in control animals (55). Results from the present study demonstrate that reductions in NE-induced vasoconstriction persist 1 d after spaceflight (Fig. 4A), but return to control levels within 5 d of ground recovery (Fig. 4B). The precise mechanisms for the recovered vasoconstriction are presently unknown, but the time frame of recovery (i.e., 2–5 d) is similar to that required to fully restore ryanodine receptor function and caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in mesenteric artery vascular smooth muscle cells after simulated microgravity (53).Functional ramifications of vasomotor alterations Stroke volume has been shown to be diminished during orthostasis following spaceflight (5, 15). Because stroke volume is affected by cardiac contractility and venous filling pressure, a blunting of the magnitude and rate of arterial vasoconstriction would not only affect PVR, but also compromise central venous filling pressure by increasing the volume of blood located within peripheral arterioles, venules, and small veins (71). Given the prodigious vascular capacitance of the splanchnic region (16), a diminished mesenteric vasoconstriction after spaceflight in humans could impair central mobilization of blood volume to support stroke volume and cardiac output. Indeed, a compromised ability to lower perfusion of splanchnic areas during lower-body negative pressure has been shown to occur following prolonged bedrest (10, 11). Intact vasoconstrictor mechanisms are also required for the redistribution of cardiac output away from visceral tissue to active skeletal muscles during exercise (71, 72). Thus, an impaired ability to reduce visceral blood flow in HU rats (14, 51) would adversely affect aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance. Therefore, dysfunction of vaso- and venoconstrictor mechanisms within the splanchnic vasculature in astronauts likely plays a fundamental role in the altered hemodynamics during exercise and orthostasis upon return to Earth.CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study demonstrate that spaceflight diminishes the magnitude (Fig. 1A) and rapidity (Fig. 1B) of mesenteric artery vasoconstriction to the adrenergic receptor agonist NE. Vasoconstriction evoked through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (KCl; Fig. 2A) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release (caffeine; Fig. 3A) was also diminished in arteries from SF mice. The blunted constriction to caffeine was associated with lower arterial RyR-2 (Fig. 2B) and RyR-3 (Fig. 2C) mRNA, indicating that the vasoconstrictor dysfunction of mesenteric arteries from SF mice occurs through an impairment of the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release mechanism. These changes in arterial vasoconstriction elicited by microgravity occurred in the absence of any gross structural changes in mesenteric artery medial wall thickness or maximal luminal diameter (Table 1), or through any alterations in the passive mechanical properties of the vessels (Fig. 2B). The adrenergic vasoconstrictor dysfunction persisted 1 d postspaceflight (Fig. 4A), but was normalized 5 d after landing (Fig. 4B). Finally, spaceflight blunted NE-evoked constriction of mesenteric veins (Fig. 5A). When applied to the human condition, the results suggest that the decrements in mesenteric arterial vasoconstriction could underlie the relative inability of astronauts to augment PVR and maintain MAP during orthostasis on return to Earth. Furthermore, the impairment of arterial and venous constriction could diminish the ability of astronauts to centrally mobilize blood volume to maintain venous filling pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac output during orthostatic and exercise stress.Acknowledgments These studies were originally flown on space shuttle mission STS-107, on which the orbiter Columbia tragically disintegrated during its return flight to Earth.

Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure. Keywords: microgravity, brain blood flow, hemodynamics Approximately 29% of astronauts on short-term (∼2 wk) space shuttle flights and 60% on long-duration (∼6 mo) missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are reported to have experienced some impairment in distant or near visual acuity (1). These visual disturbances have been hypothesized to be related to increases in intracranial pressure (1–3). An increase in intracranial pressure associated with spaceflight could occur through several mechanisms, including the movement of arterial, venous, and cerebrospinal fluids toward the head due to the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector present on Earth. However, given autoregulatory mechanisms that prevent cerebral perfusion from increasing in the presence of elevations in arterial perfusion pressure (4, 5), a putative rise in cerebral arterial pressure (Pa) of 20–30 mmHg in a microgravity environment (6) would not be expected to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and, correspondingly, fluid filtration into the cranium to drive elevations in intracranial pressure. Ground-based animal studies in rats subjected to chronic head-down tail suspension (HDT) have been conducted to simulate the cephalad fluid shift (7–10) and general cardiovascular deconditioning (11, 12) that occurs with spaceflight. In the HDT animal model, elevations in Pa to the head result in decreases in CBF (13, 14), increases in the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries (14–18), and remodeling of the cerebral arterial vasculature that is characterized by the thickening of the medial smooth muscle cell layer and, in some cerebral arteries, a decrease in maximal intraluminal diameter (14, 16, 19, 20). To date, no studies have been conducted to determine the effects of actual microgravity on the function and structure of cerebral arteries. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether spaceflight alters the intrinsic myogenic vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and gross structural properties of cerebral arteries from mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS-135) shuttle mission. Based on experimental results from HDT rats (14, 15, 20), we hypothesized that myogenic vasoconstriction would be enhanced, the passive pressure-diameter relation and mechanical stiffness would be unchanged, and medial wall thickness would be increased in cerebral arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice relative to that in ground-based control group (GC) animals. The results show that the effects of actual microgravity on the mouse cerebral arteries were unlike those of simulated microgravity with HDT rats. To estimate whether these divergent findings are the result of conditions unique to a space environment or the result of species differences between mice and rats, a second set of experiments was conducted to determine the effects of HDT on mouse cerebral artery myogenic vasoconstriction, passive pressure-diameter response, and gross structure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ( Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). Animals The present study was performed as part of a larger study in which 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups: SF-vehicle (n=15), SF-treatment (n=15), GC-vehicle (n=15), and GC-treatment (n=15) mice. One day before flight, all mice received a subcutaneous injection (0.01 ml/g body mass) in the vicinity of the hip of either an A5SuT buffer solution (vehicle) or a sclerostin antibody (treatment). SF mice were flown for 13 d on the STS-135 space shuttle mission. Through a NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP), the current study was to be conducted only on SF-vehicle (n=15) and GC-vehicle (n=15) mice. However, on the day after experiments with SF mice were concluded, it was discovered that both SF-vehicle (n=7) and SF-treatment (n=8) mice were mistakenly passed to BSP investigators, so only data from the 7 SF-vehicle animals are reported herein. SF-vehicle and SF-treatment mice were interspersed with each other at the time of death, so the time frame over which SF-vehicle studies were conducted was similar to the timeframe over which the GC-vehicle experiments were completed. SF mice were housed in NASA's animal enclosure modules (AEMs) located on the orbiter's middeck, maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle, and provided food (21) and water ad libitum. Age-matched GC mice were housed in identical AEMs within an orbital environment simulator at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; FL, USA) to replicate the temperature, humidity, and partial pressure of CO2 on the space shuttle middeck. GC animals were maintained under these conditions beginning 48 h after launch and ending 48 h after landing. All experimental procedures conducted on SF animals were duplicated on GC animals. The KSC veterinarian deemed all animals healthy before SF and GC experiments. A different group of 16-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice from a separate project were housed at NASA Ames Research Center (Mountain View, CA, USA), maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle, and provided food and water ad libitum. Mice were randomly assigned to either a cage control (CON; n=5) or 16 d HDT group (n=5). The HDT treatment, which was carried out as described previously in rats and mice (14, 20, 22), induces an array of cardiovascular changes that occur in astronauts after return from space, including resting tachycardia (22, 23), hypotension (14), and decreased aerobic exercise capacity (11, 12, 22).Microvessel preparation For the shuttle flight study, tissue dissection procedures commenced ∼3–4 h after landing. Animals were anesthetized through isoflurane inhalation and euthanized via cardiac puncture and exsanguination. The brain was rapidly removed and placed in a 4°C physiological saline solution (PSS). Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were then dissected from the brain using a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX12; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), placed in PSS on ice, and transported in a staggered fashion from KSC to the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, FL (∼3 h drive). Basilar arteries were used for in vitro experimentation to determine myogenic vasoconstrictor properties, passive pressure-diameter characteristics and gross vascular structure. PCAs were used to determine vascular tissue mechanics using a nanoindentation methodology. For the HDT study, animals were anesthetized through isoflurane anesthesia and killed by thoracotomy; the brain was rapidly removed and placed in 4°C PSS. The basilar artery was dissected from the brain for in vitro experimentation to determine myogenic vasoconstrictor properties, passive pressure-diameter characteristics, and gross vascular structure. In vitro experimentation Basilar arteries were transferred to a Lucite chamber containing PSS, cannulated at each end with glass micropipettes, and secured via 11-0 ophthalmic suture (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX, USA). After cannulation, the isolated vessel tissue chamber was transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70) interfaced in series with a video camera (Panasonic BG310; Panasonic, Osaka, Japan), a horizontal video caliper (307A; Colorado Video, Boulder, CO, USA), a data-acquisition system (Powerlab; ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA), and a video monitor (Panasonic WV-BM1410). Intraluminal pressure was set at 100 cmH2O (74 mmHg; ref. 24) provided by way of 2 independent PSS-filled reservoirs connected to the glass micropipettes, and the distance between the cannulating micropipettes was adjusted so that the vessel axial length was straight but not stretched. Basilar arteries were equilibrated for 60 min at 37°C in PSS, which was replaced every 15 min during the equilibration period and throughout the experimental procedures. Intraluminal diameters were continuously measured via videomicroscopic techniques (14, 19). To evaluate myogenic vasoconstriction, intraluminal pressure was lowered to 0 cmH2O for 5 min and then increased from 0–140 cmH2O in increments of 20 cmH2O every 5 min by raising both PSS-fluid reservoirs simultaneously so that all pressure changes occurred in the absence of intraluminal flow. Arteries were then incubated for 30 min in Ca2+-free PSS at an intraluminal pressure of 100 cmH2O. A bolus dose of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 10−4 M; refs. 25, 26) was added during the second 15-min incubation in Ca2+-free PSS to ensure complete vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness were determined at the end of the second 15-min incubation in Ca2+-free PSS at 100 cmH2O. Medial wall thickness was taken as the mean of 3 separate wall thickness measurements from positions randomly selected along the microvessel length. To measure medial wall thickness, the video caliper used to measure intraluminal diameter was positioned on the far right or far left side of the vessel. The focal plane was adjusted through the medial wall, and the smallest distance between the inner and outer medial surface was taken to be medial wall thickness. Finally, a passive pressure-diameter relation was determined using identical procedures to those used for the active myogenic response described above, except that the arteries were maintained in Ca2+-free PSS containing 10−4 M SNP.Vascular tissue mechanics Nanoindentation of all PCA samples occurred within 23 h of the vessels being dissected from the brain. Before the indentation procedure, the samples equilibrated for 30 min at 25°C in PSS. PCAs were opened longitudinally using forceps into unit samples that were 900–1400 μm in length and 100–400 μm in width, as measured by an optical microscope, and appeared oblong in shape, as shown in the optical microscope image (Fig. 1). Sample thickness was 20–30 μm, as measured by the difference in working distance for visual focus of the sample surface and background microscope slide. As the solution evaporated, the samples were allowed to adhere for 4 min to special glass microscope slides (Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus, 25×75×1 mm; Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) with a fluid reservoir to promote adhesion via electrostatic attraction; the reservoir was filled with PSS and maintained at 25°C. The fluid reservoir was created on the slides by attaching 2 round zinc alloy washers (9 mm in diameter and 3 mm thick) stacked and bonded to each other and the slide using cyanoacrylate (superglue). A third smaller washer (3 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm thick) was bonded to the slide in the center of the larger washers to aid in locating the sample. In addition, a paper grid of black background with white concentric circles and center crosshair was attached to the bottom of the glass slide. The grid can be seen in an optical microscope and allows for facile identification of the attached sample. This modification ensured that nanoindents were made at predefined locations. A diagram of the modified slides is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Optical microscope image of tissue sample attached to microscope slide and submerged in PSS. White grid crosshair lines were used for locating the sample. Adhesion to the microscope slide allowed the sample to lie flat as shown. All samples were translucent in appearance, and had uniform texture as observed by visual inspection. Indents were made ≥100 μm from the edges of the sample.Figure 2.

Indentation testing was performed with the sample submerged in PSS. C) Optical microscope image of the sample in the reservoir.Nanoindentation Nanoindentation was performed using a TriboIndenter (Hysitron, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with a laboratory noise floor displacement resolution of 1 nm, and force resolution of 100 nN (Fig. 3A). The transducer utilizes a 3-plate capacitor, with the indenter tip attached to the middle plate. As such, the displacement of the tip (actuation of the middle plate in regard to the outer plates) is quantified by changes in capacitance. The generated force (electrostatic actuation) is measured through the displacement of a spring with a known calibrated stiffness (U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology traceable), which acts in accordance with Hooke's law. Force and displacement are regulated by electronic control and continuously measured during each indentation. Figure 3.

B) Optical microscope image of diamond spherical indenter tip. C, D) Diagram of nanoindentation showing contact depths (C) and corresponding load-displacement curve and measurement parameters (D).A nominal 100-μm-radius diamond conospherical fluid cell tip (AA03171104; Hysitron; Fig. 3B, C) was used, as its radius is appropriate for soft samples (∼kPa range). Accordingly, the tip is designed such that there is a minimization of stress concentration, enabling measurement within the linear stress-stain limit (elastic region) of the material (27). The microscope slide with sample was attached to an aluminum block (6×4×2 cm) via adhesive discs (Lift-N-Press; SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA) and loaded into the nanoindentation system. The sample was located using an in situ optical microscope. The TriboIndenter was calibrated to allow indentation at the position identified using the optical microscope. Indents were made in the displacement-control mode of the instrument with a maximum displacement of 4000 nm. A trapezoidal displacement cycle was used with a loading rate of 400 nm/s to maximum displacement, followed by a 5-s hold, followed by an unloading rate of 400 nm/s. All indentations were performed at 25°C with the sample submerged in PSS. The surface of the sample was identified when the tip detected a 7 μN force after passing through the air and the fluid above. Then, a preliminary 500-nm maximum displacement indentation was performed. The force-displacement response was observed to ensure that the tip was in contact with the sample surface. Next, the indenter tip was lifted from the sample surface 2 μm, and the indentation used for measurement of the sample's properties was performed. This surface detection and indentation procedure was repeated 5 times with indents spanning the length of the sample at a spacing of 10–100 μm. A total of 21 samples from GC (n=14) and SF (n=7) mice were tested. To avoid cross contamination, the indenter tip was gently cleansed with an acetone-soaked (99.8%) cotton swab between testing of each sample.Solutions PSS contained (in mM) 145 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.17 MgSO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 5.0 glucose, 2.0 pyruvate, 0.025 EDTA, and 3.0 MOPS, pH 7.4. PSS was supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1 g/100 ml; USB Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA) and passed through a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filter (430015; Corning, Corning, NY, USA). Ca2+-free PSS buffer preparation was identical except for the addition of 2 mM EDTA, the replacement of CaCl2 with 2.0 mM NaCl, and the exclusion of BSA. A5SuT buffer solution contained 10 mM sodium acetate, 9% sucrose, and 0.004% Tween 20, pH 5.Statistical and data analysis The development of spontaneous tone was expressed as the percentage of constriction relative to maximal diameter and was calculated as follows: Spontaneous tone(%)=(IDmax×IDB)/IDmax×100 where IDmax is the maximal inner diameter recorded at a pressure of 100 cmH2O, and IDB is the starting baseline diameter. The effective elastic modulus (Er) of each indent was measured by the method of Oliver and Pharr (28). The method utilizes hertzian elastic contact mechanics with modifications by Sneddon (29) for various rigid punch geometries. The method assumes isotropic and homogeneous elastic or elastic-inelastic behavior of the sample material. The effective elastic modulus is given by: Er=π2SAc where S is the measured contact stiffness determined from the derivative (slope) of the unloading portion of the load-displacement curve (Fig. 3D), and Ac is the contact area at maximum force. Contact stiffness was calculated from the slope of the loading portion of the load-displacement curve (Fig. 3D). This adaptation was suitable due to the absence of inelasticity in the samples. It also minimizes errors encountered on unloading due to adhesion between the tip and sample. IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR, USA) data analysis software was used to determine the effective elastic modulus for each indent. A power law fit was applied to the loading curve, and the derivative was calculated to determine the contact stiffness. The contact area, as a function of indenter displacement (h), was calculated based on the known geometry of the spherical tip with a radius (R) of 100 μm: Ac(h)=2π Rh−πh2 The means ± se of the effective elastic modulus of indents for each sample were calculated. Active myogenic and passive pressure-response curves were evaluated by using 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA to detect differences between (SF vs. GC or HDT vs. CON) and within (pressure) factors. Post hoc analyses were performed with Bonferroni's test for pair-wise comparisons where appropriate. Student's unpaired t tests were used to determine whether differences in developed spontaneous tone, maximal diameter, medial wall thickness, elastic modulus, stiffness, soleus muscle mass, and body mass were significant between groups. All values are presented as means ± se. A value of P < 0.05 was used for significance.RESULTS Body and soleus muscle masses Preflight body mass (20.7±0.4 g) of SF mice was greater (P<0.05) than postflight body mass (18.4±0.5 g). Likewise, body mass (20.8±0.3 g) of GC mice was greater (P<0.05) pre- vs. post-AEM housing (19.5±0.3 g). There was a tendency for postflight body mass of SF mice to be less than that of GC mice (P=0.09). In a subset of right soleus muscles from GC (n=9) and SF (n=7) animals, soleus muscle mass was lower (P<0.05) in SF than GC mice (SF: 4.7±0.2; GC: 6.0±0.4 mg). Pre-HDT body mass (25.8±0.4 g) was not different from the post-HDT body mass (25.5±0.7 g), and likewise, pretreatment body mass of CON mice (26.4±0.5 g) was not different from that at the end of the study (26.6±0.3 g). Pre- and post-treatment body masses of CON animals were also not different from that of the HDT mice. Soleus muscle mass of the HDT animals (9.2±0.8 mg) was lower (P<0.05) than that from the CON mice (14.3±1.2 mg), thus confirming the efficacy of the elevated hindlimb treatment.Vessel characteristics Maximal diameter was greater and spontaneous tone was lower in basilar arteries from SF mice relative to that in GC animals (Table 1). Medial wall thickness was not different between GC and SF groups (Table 1). From the ground-based HDT studies, maximal diameter, medial wall thickness, and spontaneous tone of basilar arteries from HDT mice were not different from those of CON animals (Table 1). Table 1.

Active and passive pressure-diameter responses Basilar arteries from SF mice were less constricted during incremental increases in transmural pressure than those from GC mice (Fig. 4A). Likewise, passive vessel diameter was greater during incremental increases in transmural pressure than that in basilar arteries from GC animals (Fig. 4B). Figure 4.

Values are means ± se; n = number of animals studied.Artery mechanical properties The samples were loaded to a maximum displacement of ∼4000 ± 200 nm. Based on the stiffness of each indent, the effective elastic modulus was determined. Figure 6A shows effective modulus as a function of maximum indentation depth. The GC data ranged from 10 to 450 kPa, while the SF data ranged from 10 to 180 kPa. The maximum displacement for PCAs from both GC and SF mice were similar, with the majority of data points within 4000–4100 nm. The mean elastic modulus of the PCA from SF mice was ∼45 kPa lower than that from GC animals (Fig. 6B). Figure 6. Open in a new tab A) Plot of effective elastic modulus as a function of maximum contact depth for PCAs from GC and SF mice. B) Effective elastic modulus for PCAs from GC and SF. Values are means ± se; n = number of animals studied. *P < 0.05 between groups.PCA load-displacement curves from both GC and SF mice have linear loading segments that are indicative of an elastic response. Representative load-displacement curves for GC and SF samples are plotted in Fig. 7A. The SF PCA loading segment has a lower slope or stiffness than that of the GC PCA and reaches a maximum force of ∼15 μN. The lower resistance to deformation among SF PCAs resulted in a lower stiffness relative to that of GC PCAs (Fig. 7B). PCAs from both GC and SF mice demonstrated nonlinear unloading behavior (Fig. 7A). The upper 20% of the unloading segment has the highest curvature. The curvature is indicative of adhesion effects between the tip and sample and is quite common in nanoindentation of soft biological samples (30). Also, the adhesion force causes the unloading curve to end at a negative force value rather than returning to 0. Figure 7.

Based on experimental results from ground-based studies in rats to simulate microgravity (14, 15, 20), we hypothesized that myogenic vasoconstriction would be enhanced, passive pressure-diameter relation and mechanical stiffness would be unchanged, and medial wall thickness would be greater in cerebral arteries from SF mice. However, contrary to our hypothesis, the results showed that myogenic vasoconstriction was less in cerebral arteries from SF mice (Fig. 4A), passive pressure-diameter response indicated greater vascular distensibility (Fig. 4B), and mechanical testing using nanoindentation revealed that the arteries from SF animals had lower effective elastic modulus (Fig. 6B) and stiffness (Fig. 7B). Gross structural measures demonstrated that maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (Table 1), while medial wall thickness of cerebral arteries was not different between SF and GC animals. These results demonstrate that spaceflight alters vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and gross structural properties of cerebral resistance arteries. Numerous factors are involved in the regulation of cerebral perfusion (4, 5), and many of these factors may be altered in a microgravity environment. As it relates to fluid flow, Ohm's law can be used to estimate the effects of microgravity on brain blood flow according to the equation: CBF=(Pa−Pv)/CVR where CBF is proportional to the Pa and venous pressure (Pv) difference across the brain and is inversely related to the cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) to flow. The loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector normally present on Earth induces a cephalad fluid shift during spaceflight (6). It is believed that this elevates Pa to the head by 20–30 mmHg (6), whereas possible increases in Pv in the head are less certain, given that direct measures of inflight astronaut central Pv show a decrease rather than an increase (31). Thus, any possible rise in Pv of <20–30 mmHg would indicate an elevation in cerebral perfusion pressure. The cerebral circulation, however, is unique in that intracranial pressure (ICP) will determine the pressure difference across the brain (Pa − ICP) when ICP > Pv in the head. Although the extent to which the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector will elevate ICP is presently unknown, it seems unlikely that it would exceed the putative 20- to 30-mmHg rise in Pa in the head. Therefore, the microgravity-induced headward fluid shift should result in either no change or an increase in cerebral perfusion pressure. The other major determinant of cerebral perfusion is CVR, which, according to Poiseuille's law, is predominantly determined by the diameter of resistance arteries. A spaceflight-induced change in basal arterial tone would therefore be a good indicator of possible changes in CVR and, correspondingly, CBF. For example, we and others have shown in HDT rats that increases in spontaneous tone and myogenic vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries (14, 15, 18, 19) correspond to increases in CVR (14) and decreases in CBF (13, 14). The microgravity-induced decrease in active myogenic vasoconstrictor tone across a range of pressures (Fig. 4A) is consistent with a decrease in CVR. Likewise, the decrease in arterial stiffness (Fig. 7B) found in the present study would also indicate that, for any given Pa, CVR would be lower by virtue of a larger diameter in the more distensible resistance arteries. Both the decrease in myogenic vasoconstrictor tone (Fig. 4A) and the increase in arterial distensibility (Fig. 4B) are therefore consistent with a lower CVR and higher CBF during spaceflight. Such a contention is supported by experimental evidence from a chronically instrumented rhesus monkey flown 5 d on the Cosmos 1514 biosatellite (32). A probe that measured Pa and blood flow velocity was implanted around the left common carotid artery ∼55 d before flight. Both mean Pa and carotid flow velocity increased markedly above preflight control levels during the first day of flight. On the second and fifth days of flight, Pa returned to preflight control levels, while carotid flow velocity remained elevated, owing to a significant reduction in vascular resistance (32). Similar results of apparent increases in cerebral perfusion associated with spaceflight have also been reported to occur in humans. With the use of impedance rheoencephalography to assess CBF in cosmonauts, most studies have shown indications of elevated cerebral perfusion during and immediately after spaceflight (33–37). Likewise, transcranial Doppler ultrasound measures of carotid and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity have shown significant elevations in cerebral flow velocity in microgravity (38–40). However, other studies measuring carotid and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity in astronauts have concluded cerebral flow velocity and autoregulation to be unchanged (41–43) or decreased (43, 44). Results from the present study demonstrate that the effects of actual microgravity on mouse cerebral arteries were unlike those of simulated microgravity in HDT rats. These divergent findings are possibly due to species differences between mice and rats or may be attributed to conditions unique to a microgravity environment. To test this possibility, a second set of experiments was conducted to determine the effects of HDT on mouse cerebral artery myogenic vasoconstriction, passive pressure-diameter response, and gross structure. The results demonstrate that HDT in mice has no effect on myogenic vasoconstriction (Fig. 5A), the passive pressure-diameter response (Fig. 5B), or the medial wall thickness and maximal diameter of the basilar artery (Table 1). Thus, there appear to be species-specific differences between rats and mice in both the functional and structural alterations that occur in cerebral arteries during simulated microgravity. Differences in the functional and structural alterations induced in basilar arteries from SF mice and HDT mice could be due to several factors, including the disparity between the animals' age and sex. Differences could also be due to the fact that microgravity uniquely affects the cerebral circulation and that this environmental condition is not adequately mimicked in current ground-based simulations with rodents. Such a conclusion is also supported in studies with humans. For example, Zhang et al. (45) reported that following 2-wk head-down tilt bedrest in humans, middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity was reduced across a range of orthostatic stresses, indicating an impairment of cerebral autoregulation. In contrast, the same laboratory group (46) found that cerebral autoregulation of astronauts during orthostatic stress was unchanged or altered to produce higher CBF velocity during upright tilt after 16 d of spaceflight. Thus, findings from groups studying both ground-based analogs of microgravity and actual microgravity, in humans and rodents, show disparate results of greater vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries (14) and lower perfusion (13, 14, 45) in ground models, whereas there is less cerebral artery vasoconstriction and indications of higher perfusion both during and following spaceflight (present study and ref. 46). At present, it is unknown what factors underlie the alterations in mouse cerebral artery function, mechanics, and structure with spaceflight. One factor that has been hypothesized to alter cerebral perfusion and, consequently, intracranial pressure in astronauts is carbon dioxide (CO2; ref. 3). CO2 is a potent cerebral vasodilator (47–49) and has been shown to interact with cerebral autoregulation to elevate intracranial pressure (50–52). Chronic cerebral artery relaxation during exposure to high levels of CO2 could also potentially affect the intrinsic functional and structural properties of cerebral arteries. The space shuttle and ISS are closed environments with nominal CO2 levels (2.3 to 5.3 mmHg) well above the ambient partial pressure of CO2 (0.23 mmHg) at sea level on Earth (3). Mice from the current study were chronically exposed to these higher levels of CO2 on the space shuttle Atlantis during the STS-135 mission (Fig. 8), and a putative state of chronic relaxation could have contributed to the alterations observed in cerebral arteries. However, high levels of CO2 alone cannot account for the alterations in the intrinsic properties of the cerebral arteries from the SF mice, as conditions for GC mice (i.e., temperature, humidity, and partial pressure of CO2) were maintained the same as those occurring on the space shuttle flight deck. The possibility exists that the chronic vasodilator effects of CO2 with spaceflight could compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, as has been previously hypothesized (53), and make the cerebral circulation susceptible to the same circulating factors previously considered to only affect the peripheral circulation. For example, in HDT rats, the peripheral arterial circulation shows diminished vasoconstriction regardless of whether it is exposed to higher or lower Pa; diminished vasoconstrictor responsiveness has been reported to occur in carotid arteries (54) and the thoracic aorta (55) where Pa is elevated during HDT (7, 13), in mesenteric arteries near the hydrostatic indifference point of rats (56, 57), and in arterial segments of the lower hindlimb region (54, 58) where Pa is reduced with HDT (7). Only the cerebral circulation in HDT rats are not likewise affected (14–18). This impairment of peripheral artery vasoconstrictor function, albeit due to unknown factors, is presumed to be a systemic circulating agent, because impairment of smooth muscle contraction also occurs in the venous circulation (57, 59), as well as in the lymphatic circulation from the head to the hindlimbs (60). Moreover, peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstrictor impairment has also been previously shown to occur in rats and mice flown on the space shuttle (61–63), including mesenteric veins from the same mice of the present study (61). Therefore, we propose that the chronic vasodilator influence of CO2 may compromise the tightness of the junctions between endothelial cells that make up the blood-brain barrier in the cerebral circulation during spaceflight and enable the unknown factors affecting the peripheral circulation to likewise diminish the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries, thereby compromising autoregulation of cerebral perfusion and facilitating elevations in intracranial pressure. Figure 8. Open in a new tab Partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the space shuttle Atlantis immediately before and during the STS-135 mission, on which Atlantis docked with the ISS. The CO2 sensor was located on the orbiter flight deck, located immediately above the middeck where the mice were housed.To our knowledge, the present study is the first to utilize nanoindentation to determine the mechanical properties of small resistance arteries from the microcirculation. The results demonstrate that cerebral arteries from SF mice had a lower effective elastic modulus (Fig. 6B) and were less stiff (Fig. 7B) than arteries from GC mice. Previous work with astronauts has also reported evidence that spaceflight can modify arterial stiffness (64), although this work showed increases in stiffness of peripheral conduit arteries in some astronauts. The effective modulus data from the SF mice of the present study had a small se relative to that of arteries from GC mice. This compactness of flight data indicates possible differences in tissue organization or composition vs. control arteries. This is because nanoindentation is sensitive to tissue structure due to the highly localized probe measuring mechanical properties as a function of depth. The sensitivity of nanoindentation has been previously utilized for large conduit aortic arteries to determine differences in tissue composition and structure (65, 66). It is this sensitivity to structure and composition, as well as surface properties, which contributes to the scatter in nanoindentation data of soft biological materials (65–67). In summary, results from this study demonstrate that spaceflight diminishes myogenic vasoconstrictor tone (Fig. 4A), effective elastic modulus (Fig. 6B), and vascular stiffness (Fig. 7B) and increases distensibility (Fig. 4B) of cerebral arteries. In addition, maximal diameter of cerebral arteries from SF mice was increased, with no change in medial wall thickness. Collectively, these changes in the functional vasoconstrictor and mechanical properties of cerebral arteries suggest that cerebral perfusion may be elevated during spaceflight. Although elevated partial pressure of CO2 in the closed microgravity environment may contribute to alterations in the properties of cerebral arteries, high CO2 levels alone cannot fully account for such changes. Finally, if similar alterations in the properties of cerebral arteries occur in astronauts, elevations in brain blood flow could serve to elevate intracranial pressure and possibly contribute to the visual impairment reported to occur in astronauts (1–3).Acknowledgments These studies were originally flown on space shuttle mission STS-107, on which the orbiter Columbia tragically disintegrated during its return flight to Earth.

In addition, the onset of age-related decreases in bone mineral density can be delayed by regular exercise to enhance bone accrual during skeletal growth and maintenance (30). Beneficial cardiovascular adaptations to exercise include enhanced endothelium-dependent vasodilation of blood vessels (11, 37), decreased blood pressure, and improved blood lipid profiles (34). Exercise also increases muscle strength, which is strongly correlated with increased bone strength (16). Importantly, mechanical loads placed on to the skeleton must exceed a biological threshold in order to stimulate bone-modeling activity (17). However, disuse models employing venous occlusion produce increases in bone mass (4, 5). Regional femur bone blood flow has been demonstrated to increase during acute treadmill exercise in young and old sedentary (SED) animals (12). Further, 10–12 wks of treadmill exercise training resulted in an increase in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) to the femur (12). The femoral PNA is one of the primary resistance arteries controlling perfusion of the femur and is responsible for ~70% of the blood supply to this long bone (6). However, whether this training-induced enhancement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of bone resistance arteries results in greater bone and marrow perfusion during exercise has not been investigated. Therefore, the present study sought to determine whether regional hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow and vascular conductance is elevated during exercise in chronically exercise-trained (ET) rats. Based on the previously observed enhancement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the femoral PNA with exercise training, we hypothesized that the exercise hyperemia in hindlimb bones would be greater in ET rats relative to that in SED animals.MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (Eight edition, 2011). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6–8 mo old) were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). All animals were housed in a temperature controlled (23 ± 2°C) room, maintained on a 12:12 light-dark cycle, and provided with food and water ad libitum. Animals were randomly divided into an ET group (n = 8) and a SED group (n = 8).Exercise training All animals were familiarized with treadmill exercise. The familiarization period consisted of treadmill exercise at 15 m/min with a 0° incline beginning on day one for 5 min/day and progressing to 10 min/day by day five. Blasts of pressurized air and mild electrical shock were used to encourage ambulation on the activated treadmill belt. Animals assigned to the ET group continued to train the following week beginning with 10 min of treadmill exercise at 15 m/min with a 15° incline for 10 min. Exercise duration for ET animals was increased by 10 min each week until animals were exercising 60 min/d, 5 days a week at which point exercise time, intensity, and frequency were maintained for the cumulative training period of 10–12 wks.Surgery Animal body mass was measured on a triple-beam balance. Animals were then anesthetized with isoflurane anesthesia (2–2.5%/O2 balance). A polyethylene catheter (Braintree Scientific) filled with heparinized saline solution (100 U/mL) was implanted into the right carotid artery and the tip was advanced into the ascending aorta. The carotid artery catheter was used for microsphere infusion and to monitor mean arterial pressure (MAP). The carotid artery catheter was guided subcutaneously to a 1 cm puncture wound dorsally located in the cervical region and secured for exteriorization. A separate polyethylene catheter (Braintree Scientific) was implanted into the caudal artery of the tail for reference blood sample withdrawals (10). Each animal was allowed ≥3 hrs of recovery after wound closure and the cessation of anesthesia before experiments to measure tissue blood flow were performed. Previous research demonstrates that cardiovascular dynamics, regional blood flow, and acid-base status recover to normal levels within 3 hrs after anesthesia (15).Determination of tissue blood flow Blood flow measurements in animals from both SED and ET groups were made during rest and during treadmill exercise. During the week preceding blood flow experiments, SED animals were exposed to one week of treadmill acclimatization as described above. All animals were allowed 24–48 hrs of recovery from their last bout of treadmill exercise training or acclimatization prior to the blood flow experiments. For measurement of exercising tissue blood flow, the surgically instrumented animals were placed on a rodent treadmill with a belt speed of ~8 m/min and 15° incline. Belt speed was then increased to 15 m/min. The caudal artery catheter was connected to a 1 mL syringe secured to an infusion-withdrawal pump for withdrawal of a reference blood sample at a rate of ~0.25 mL/min. After 5 min of exercise, 2.0–5.0×105 radiolabeled NEN-TRAC™ microspheres (85Sr or 46Sc randomly selected; 15.5 ± 0.1 µm diameter; PerkinElmer) were infused via the carotid artery catheter. MAP was measured immediately before and after infusion of radiolabeled microspheres via a physiological pressure transducer connected to the carotid artery catheter. Exercise was terminated following complete infusion of radiolabeled microspheres. Reference blood sample withdrawal was stopped ~30 s after the infusion and flush of the radiolabeled microspheres. Identical procedures were employed for measurement of tissue blood flow at rest using energetically distinct radiolabeled microspheres while the animal rested quietly on the rodent treadmill following an ~30 min recovery period from the previous exercising microsphere infusion. The blood flow measurement during exercise was performed prior to the blood flow measurement at rest in order to avoid the effects of the pre-exercise anticipatory response (1).Tissue harvesting After completion of the resting blood flow experiment, animals were euthanized with Beuthanasia®-D Special (~0.6 mL/kg, Schering-Plough Animal Health) administered via the carotid artery catheter. The femur, tibia, and fibula were removed and cleaned of muscle and tendon. The femur and tibia were divided into diaphyseal, diaphyseal marrow, and proximal and distal metaphyseal and epiphyseal portions. In addition to skeletal tissue, both kidneys were removed. Bilateral comparison of blood flow rates between renal tissues provides an index of the adequacy of microsphere mixing in the blood.Measurement of tissue radioactivity and calculation of tissue hemodynamics The masses of all tissues were individually measured on a laboratory balance before being placed into 5 mL polypropylene culture tubes. Masses of the femoral and tibial marrows were determined by weighing the diaphysis before and after the marrow was removed (8, 12, 36). Individual tissue and reference blood sample radioactivity were measured with a gamma counter (Cobra II Auto-Gamma Model 5003E), and minimal radioactivity was checked in the tissue and reference blood samples to ensure sufficient microspheres were present in each sample for accurate blood flow determination. Natural energetic crosstalk from distinct radiolabels was handled by inverse matrix calculation (15) and individual tissue blood flow (mL/min/100 g of tissue) was calculated according to the method of Ishise et al (22). Tissue vascular conductance (mL/min/100 g/mmHg) was then calculated by dividing individual tissue blood flow by mean arterial pressure. Adequate mixing and whole body distribution of microspheres were characterized by a ≤20% difference (9) in calculated blood flow between the left and right kidneys (20).Statistics Independent-samples t-tests were used to investigate differences in body mass, tissue mass, heart mass-to-body mass ratio, and MAP between ET and SED animals. Bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance were evaluated by repeated measures analysis of variance in order to detect differences within (rest vs. exercise) and between (SED vs. ET) factors. Pairwise comparisons between specific levels were made through Scheffe’s post hoc analysis when a significant main effect was found. An alpha of 0.05 delineated significance.RESULTS Body mass, tissue mass, and mean arterial pressure Body mass of SED animals (461 ± 18 g) was greater (P<0.05) than that of ET animals (406 ± 8 g). MAP at rest (SED: 161 ± 8, ET: 160 ± 4 mmHg) and during exercise (SED: 166 ± 5, ET: 160 ± 5 mmHg) were not different between groups. MAP also was not different between resting and exercising conditions within groups. Tibia diaphyseal marrow mass was less in ET rats relative to that in SED animals (Table 1). Other bone and marrow masses were not different between groups (Table 1). Table 1. Bone and marrow tissue mass.

Blood flow and vascular conductance In SED rats, an exercise hyperemia occurred in the femoral diaphysis Fig. 1A) and the tibial diaphysis and marrow (Fig. 2A) during an acute exercise bout. Exercise training did not affect resting blood flow or vascular conductance in any region of the bone and marrow. However, blood flow to the femoral diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow Fig. 1A) and the tibial diaphysis, diaphyseal marrow, and distal epiphysis and metaphysis (Fig. 2A) were increased during an acute exercise bout in ET animals. There was a tendency (P<0.1) for an exercise hyperemia to occur in the tibia proximal epiphysis and metaphysis (Fig. 2A) and fibula (Fig. 3A) of ET animals. An elevation in vascular conductance occurred in SED animals during exercise activity in the femoral diaphysis Fig. 1B) and tibial diaphysis and marrow (Fig. 2B), with a tendency (P<0.1) for an increase in the distal epiphysis and metaphysis of the tibia (Fig. 2B). Vascular conductance in the femoral diaphysis Fig. 1B), tibial diaphysis and marrow (Fig. 2B) and fibula (Fig. 3B) were also elevated during exercise activity in ET animals. The exercise hyperemia in the femoral diaphysis was greater in ET rats relative to SED animals Fig. 1A), and the exercise-induced increase in vascular conductance was greater in the fibula of ET rats compared to that in SED animals.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether exercise training augments regional skeletal blood flow in the hindlimb during exercise activity. We hypothesized that the exercise hyperemia in hindlimb bones would be greater in ET rats relative to that in SED animals. The results demonstrate that in only 1 of 9 bone or bone regions investigated, the femoral diaphysis Fig. 1A), was blood flow higher during exercise in the ET rats compared to that in the SED animals, suggesting chronic exercise training may not have a major impact to elevate bone and marrow blood flow capacity. However, in SED animals, exercise induced an increase in perfusion in only 3 of 9 bone or bone regions tested (i.e., femur diaphysis, tibia diaphysis, tibia diaphyseal marrow), whereas an exercise hyperemia occurred in 7 of 9 bone or bone regions (i.e., femur diaphysis, femur diaphyseal marrow, tibia proximal epiphysis and metaphysis, tibia diaphysis, tibia diaphyseal marrow, tibia distal epiphysis and metaphysis, fibula) in ET rats. These data suggest exercise training may not induce a large increase in the blood flow capacity of bone, but rather serves to enhance perfusion of a broader region of bone during physical activity. To our knowledge, these are the first data to demonstrate an augmentation of bone and marrow blood flow during exercise following a period of regular exercise training. Exercise training is well appreciated for its beneficial cardiovascular effects. For example, removal of the endothelium in rat gracilis muscle arterioles completely abrogated ET-induced improvements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation (28). In the rat abdominal aorta (11) and skeletal muscle microcirculation (37), improvements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation following 10–12 wks of treadmill exercise training served to blunt adrenergic vasoconstriction (11, 13). Exercise has favorable effects on the molecular environment supporting a healthy endothelium as evidenced by improvements in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression (2, 37, 38), increased eNOS Serine 1177 phosphorylation, improved antioxidant enzyme expression (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase), and reduced expression of oxidant generating enzymes such as xanthine oxidase (18). Furthermore, chronic exercise has been demonstrated to increase angiogenesis (18), improve skeletal muscle capillarization (18), and enhance endothelium-dependent vasodilation (32), all of which are thought to contribute to the greater aerobic exercise capacity associated with exercise training (32). Research also demonstrates that treadmill exercise training produces gains in cancellous bone volume that are site-specific (23). For example, observations of increased trabecular bone formation rate at the proximal and distal tibia were accompanied by corresponding changes in cancellous bone volume after 12 wks of treadmill exercise training in rats (23). Prolonged treadmill exercise has also been shown in rats to increase femur bone length, improve measures of tibia bone mineral content, and elevate osteoblast biomarkers osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase, with corresponding decreases in the osteoclast biomarker serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (25). Treadmill exercise training also improves rat tibia bone mechanical properties, such as resistance to failure from peak loading, stiffness, and moment of inertia (3). Although there is a large literature on the effects of exercise training on both cardiovascular function and bone properties, there is little work published in regard to the effects of changes in physical activity on bone perfusion or adaptations of the bone vascular structure and vasomotor properties. For example, recent work has shown that prolonged skeletal disuse in hindlimb unloaded rats induces a narrowing of the maximal diameter of the femur PNA (39) and rarefaction of the microvascular network (14), both of which result in a lower femoral bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance with reloading (39). In contrast, 10–12 wks of treadmill exercise training increases the maximal diameter of the femur PNA and enhances the PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation (12). Such changes in vascular structure and vasomotor properties may contribute to the increases in vascular conductance (Figs. 1B, 2B & 3B) and broader exercise hyperemia in the bone and marrow of ET rats observed in the present study. An acute bout of exercise in SED rats (present study, (12)) and humans (19) has been shown to increase perfusion of bone. Such increases in bone blood flow during chronic bouts of exercise in ET rats likely generate increases in endothelial shear stress in the bone vasculature that facilitate the release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and prostacyclin (PGI2) that each may have important paracrine effects on bone cells (8, 12, 33). For example, NO inhibits osteoclasts (29) and stimulates osteoblast differentiation (21). PGE2 increases the number of osteoblasts and decreases the number of osteoclasts in vivo (26), and PGI2 is a powerful inhibitor of osteoclast mediated bone resorption in culture experiments (7). Thus, increases in blood flow and vascular shear stress during exercise may facilitate advantageous bone modeling responses that are mediated, in part, by endothelium-derived signaling molecules. Increases in regional bone and marrow blood flow during exercise activity may also support the dynamic generation of hydrostatic pressure gradients between the medullary cavity and bone capillary efferents that could enhance bone interstitial fluid flow (31). Mechanical loading of bone, such as occurs during exercise, delivers compressive forces to distinct regions of bone such that bone interstitial fluid can flow from areas of high fluid pressure to areas of low fluid pressure (27, 40). Such fluid flow has been suggested to inhibit osteoclasts, stimulate osteoblasts (41), and increase bone formation (40). Thus, the exercise hyperemia in bones from ET rats could contribute to the positive bone remodeling that occurs in these animals (12, 23, 25). Based on the greater bone and marrow perfusion during exercise in ET rats (Figs. 1A–3A) and previous research demonstrating improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation of bone resistance arteries in ET rats (12), a greater interstitial fluid flow and enhanced release of endothelium-derived NO, PGE2 or PGI2 with training to promote positive bone remodeling seem likely. Indeed, investigators have demonstrated a positive association between endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA with training-induced increases in cancellous bone volume (12). Similar positive associations between endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA and bone volume have also been demonstrated in animal models of old age (36) and postmenopausal (35) osteoporosis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that chronic low-intensity training only increased the exercise hyperemia in 1 of 9 regions tested (i.e., the femoral diaphysis, Fig. 1A) in ET rats above that occurring in SED rats. However, in SED animals acute exercise increased bone and marrow perfusion in 3 of 9 regions tested, whereas an exercise hyperemia occurred in 7 of 9 bone regions in ET animals. These results indicate that exercise training results in a broader region of elevated blood flow in bone and marrow during physical activity. The observed increases in bone blood flow during exercise may also play an important role in generating osteogenic signals within bone via paracrine effects (33) and/or augmentation of bone interstitial fluid flow to signal bone cells (40), which contribute to training-induced increases in bone volume (12). Additional research is required to elucidate a direct role for increased bone blood flow during exercise in augmenting parameters of bone health.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study was supported by grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNX12AL41G) and the National Institutes of Health (AG-31317).Footnotes The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

These data indicate that unloading-induced decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance are not the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries but are associated with reductions in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Keywords: hindlimb unloading, bone blood flow, microcirculation spaceflight and prolonged bed rest have been shown to have adverse effects on multiple organ systems. In the skeleton, chronic unloading of weight-bearing bones uncouples bone remodeling at the whole tissue level with rates of bone resorption elevated while formation rates remain largely unchanged. This uncoupling results in bone loss, a weaker skeleton, and increased risk of fracture in humans (34, 57). Likewise, the cardiovascular system undergoes a deconditioning phenomenon with unloading that impairs its ability to properly regulate arterial pressure during orthostatic stress (7, 58) and putative elevations in intracranial pressure (1, 31, 37) negatively affecting the cerebral circulation (1, 54). There are few studies, however, that have examined the effects of spaceflight on the skeletal circulation, despite mounting evidence that bone perfusion, interstitial fluid flow, and direct vascular-bone cell coupling mechanisms modulate bone remodeling (5, 8, 12, 20, 25, 43, 55, 56). Using hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats as a model for spaceflight and disuse, investigators have reported reduced cancellous bone mineral density, lower bone formation rates, and diminished mineral apposition rates in long bones of adult rats (4, 13). In regard to the skeletal circulation, studies have shown a profound reduction in bone and marrow blood flow during unloading (12, 52) and a blunting of the reloading hyperemia in bone and marrow when the animals resume weight-bearing activity (52). This decrement in the reloading hyperemia is the result of elevations in bone and marrow vascular resistance (52). Several factors could account for the reduced skeletal perfusion and increased vascular resistance with reloading, including 1) a structural remodeling of the resistance vasculature and vascular network, which has been shown to occur in long bones from HU rats (21, 52); 2) an enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of bone resistance arteries; and 3) a diminished vasodilator responsiveness of the resistance vasculature. The purpose of the present study was to test these latter two possibilities. The principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur was selected for study because the PNA is the primary conduit for blood flow to long bones and accounts for ∼30% of the resistance to flow in the rat femur (6, 29). We hypothesized that PNA vasoconstrictor responsiveness would be enhanced and that both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilator responses would be impaired in 2-wk HU animals. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and Procedures All procedures employed in this study were approved by the Florida State University, University of Florida, and Texas A&M University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and conformed to the National Institutes of Health () Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th ed., 2011). Four- to six-mo-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan (Houston, TX) and housed in a temperature-controlled (23 ± 2°C) room with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Water and rat chow were provided ad libitum. When the animals were at least 6 mo of age, they were randomly assigned to either a normal weight-bearing control (CON) group or a HU group. The hindlimbs of the HU groups were elevated to an approximate spinal angle of 40–45° via orthopedic traction tape placed around the proximal two-thirds of the tail in a modification of techniques previously described (12, 14, 52). The hindlimbs were elevated to prevent touching of supportive surfaces while the forelimbs maintained contact with the cage floor. The HU animals were suspended for 2 wk, while CON animals were individually maintained in their normal cage environment; no 0-day controls were investigated. CON and HU rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and euthanized by removal of the myocardium. The upper right and left hindlimbs of the rat (i.e., femora and surrounding musculature) were carefully dissected free and placed in cold (4°C) physiological saline buffer solution (PSS). Using a stereomicroscope, the femoral PNA was identified and isolated as it entered the femur through the femoral foramen as previously shown (19, 45, 46, 52). The isolated PNAs were either used for in vitro experimentation or saved for mRNA analysis. For in vitro experiments, PNAs were transferred to a Lucite chamber containing PSS equilibrated to room air. Each end of the PNA was cannulated with a micropipette (60- to 80-μm-diameter tip) and secured with 11-0 nylon microfilament sutures (Alcon). The microvessel chamber was then transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope whereby the intraluminal diameter could be measured and recorded (45, 46, 52). PNAs were pressurized to 60 cmH2O (44 mmHg) with two hydrostatic pressure reservoirs. This pressure was selected based on previously reported intravascular pressures of 43 ± 1.8 and 46 ± 2.6 mmHg in skeletal muscle resistance arteries of similar size to the PNA in normotensive rats (41). The distance between the cannulating micropipettes was adjusted so that the PNA axial length was straight but not stretched. Leaks in the vessel were detected by closing the valves of the reservoirs and verifying that intraluminal diameter remained constant. PNAs that were free from leaks were warmed to 37°C and allowed to develop spontaneous baseline tone (≥1 h) while those vessels with leaks were discarded.Experimental Design A series of in vitro experiments were performed to investigate the effects of HU on the 1) myogenic, 2) vasoconstrictor, and 3) vasodilator properties of the PNA. Series 1: evaluation of myogenic response. To assess active myogenic vasoconstriction of the PNA, intraluminal pressure was increased by increments of 15 cmH2O by raising the hydrostatic pressure reservoirs simultaneously. The myogenic response was assessed from 0 to 135 cmH2O. Changes in intraluminal diameters were recorded following 3–5 min of each step increase in pressure, which allowed sufficient time for a steady vascular response. The bathing solution was then replaced with a Ca2+-free PSS buffer every 15 min for 1 h. A passive pressure-diameter curve was then generated by the exact protocol utilized for the active myogenic response.Series 2: evaluation of agonist-evoked vasoconstriction. Concentration-diameter relations were determined for vasoconstrictor agonists acting through α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors (norepinephrine, 10−9–10−4 M), α1-adrenergic receptors (phenylephrine, 10−9–10−4 M), α2-adrenergic receptors (clonidine, 10−9–10−6 M), ETA and ETB receptors (endothelin-1, 3 × 10−12–10−8 M), V1-receptors (arginine vasopressin, 10−9–10−4 M), and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (KCl, 10–100 mM). Steady-state changes in intraluminal diameter were recorded following cumulative additions of these agonists to the vessel bath. To avoid possible tachyphylaxis, only one vasoconstrictor response was made per vessel.Series 3a: evaluation of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. To evaluate endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation, intraluminal flow was generated through the PNA lumen by creating pressure gradients between the two cannulating pipettes. This was accomplished by adjusting the height of the hydrostatic reservoirs attached to each pipette as previously described (42). Pressure gradients of 2, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cmH2O were generated, and steady-state changes in intraluminal diameter were recorded 2 min after each step increase in flow. Concentration-diameter relations were then determined for bradykinin, a B2-receptor-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilator agonist. Steady-state changes in intraluminal diameter were recorded following the cumulative addition of bradykinin (10−13–10−7 M) to the vessel bath. In a separate set of PNAs, concentration-diameter relations were determined for acetylcholine, a cholinergic receptor-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilator agonist. Steady-state changes in intraluminal diameter were recorded following the cumulative addition of acetylcholine (10−9–10−4 M) to the vessel bath. Following the initial acetylcholine concentration response, PNAs from CON and HU animals were allowed to reestablish spontaneous tone. Vasodilator responses to acetylcholine were evaluated after a 20-min incubation with one of the following: 1) PSS buffer containing the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME; 10−5 M), 2) PSS buffer containing the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (Indo; 10−5 M), and 3) PSS buffer containing l-NAME (10−5 M) plus Indo (10−5 M).Series 3b: evaluation of endothelium-independent vasodilation. Following the bradykinin response described above, PNAs were washed several times with PSS to allow spontaneous tone to become reestablished. Vasodilator responses to the cumulative addition of sodium nitroprusside (10−10–10−4 M) or adenosine (10−9–10−4 M) were then evaluated. At the conclusion of each series of experiments, arteries were washed and incubated in Ca2+-free PSS for 30–60 min. Twenty microliters of SNP (10−4 M) was then added to the Ca2+-free PSS solution and incubated for 10 min to ensure smooth muscle relaxation. Maximal diameter at an intraluminal pressure of 60 cmH2O was recorded.mRNA Levels Isolated PNAs were snap-frozen and stored at −80°C for later analysis of mRNA levels as described previously (3, 50, 51). PNAs were later pulverized in lysate buffer, and total RNA was extracted using an aqueous and ethanol filter isolation method specified for use in microdissected tissue (RNAqueous-Micro Kit, Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX). Total RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) via the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was then used in the real-time PCR (StepOnePlus; Applied Biosystems) to determine mRNA levels by way of TaqMan gene expression assays and endogenous controls (Applied Biosystems) specific for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), Cu/Zn-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD-1), and 18S ribosomal RNA.Solutions and Drugs The PSS buffer contained (in mM) 145 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.17 MgSO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 5.0 glucose, 2.0 pyruvate, 0.02 EDTA, and 3.0 MOPS with a pH of 7.4. Ca2+-free PSS buffer was identical except that it contained 2.0 mM NaCl instead of 2 mM EDTA and CaCl2. All chemicals and drugs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).Muscle and Bone The right soleus muscle was isolated and weighed from each animal to determine the efficacy of the unloading treatment to induce muscle atrophy in HU rats. In rats used to determine PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine, the right femur was cleaned of soft tissue after isolating the PNA, wrapped in gauze soaked in phosphate buffer solution, and stored at −80°C for later analysis of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD).Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) To estimate the effects of unloading on cortical and cancellous vBMD of the femur, tomographic scans were performed ex vivo on femoral necks using a Stratec XCT Research-M device (Norland, Fort Atkinson, WI) as previously described in detail (4). Two scan slices were taken at the midneck region of the femoral neck. Analyses were performed using STRATEC software (version 5.40B). Values of femoral neck cortical and cancellous vBMD were averaged between the slices to derive a mean value for each animal.Statistical Analysis The development of spontaneous basal tone was expressed as the percent constriction relative to maximal diameter and calculated as follows: spontaneous baseline tone (%)=(Dmax−Db)/Dmax×100 where Dmax is the maximal diameter recorded at the pressure of 60 cmH2O and Db is the steady-state baseline diameter. Active myogenic responses and passive diameter measurements recorded in response to pressure changes were normalized according to the following equation: normalized diameter (%)=(Ds/Dmax)×100 where Ds is the steady state diameter measured after each incremental change in pressure and Dmax is the maximal inner diameter recorded at 135 cmH2O in calcium-free PSS. The data are expressed as normalized diameters to account for differences in vessels size between CON and HU rats. Passive pressure-diameters are also expressed relative to diameters measured at 135 cmH2O in Ca2+-free PSS. Agonist-induced vasoconstrictor responses were expressed as the percent change from baseline diameter according to the following equation: vasoconstriction (%)=(Db−Ds)/Db×100 where Db is the initial baseline measurement recorded prior to the addition of the vasoconstrictor agonist and Ds is the steady-state diameter measured 2 min following administration of each agonist dose. Agonist-induced vasodilator responses were expressed as the percentage of maximal relaxation according to the following formula: vasodilation (%)=(Ds−Db)/(Dmax−Db)×100 where Dmax is the maximal inner diameter recorded at 60 cmH2O in calcium-free PSS, Ds is the steady-state inner diameter recorded after each addition of the vasodilator substance or flow, and Db is the initial baseline inner diameter recorded immediately prior to the first addition of acetylcholine, bradykinin, sodium nitroprusside, adenosine, or initiation of flow. Pressure-response, dose-response, and flow-response curves were evaluated by using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA to detect differences between (CON vs. HU) and within (pressure, dose, or flow) factors. Post hoc analyses were performed with Bonferroni's test for pairwise comparisons where appropriate. Student's unpaired t-tests were used to determine the significance of differences in body mass, soleus muscle mass, vBMD, and PNA spontaneous tone, maximum diameter, and eNOS and SOD-1 mRNA expression. To examine the relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and cancellous vBMD, linear regression analysis was performed. Alpha levels of P ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data are presented as means ± SE.RESULTS Animal, Bone, and PNA Characteristics Body mass of HU rats was ∼8% lower than that of CON animals (Table 1). The mass of soleus muscle, a postural hindlimb muscle composed predominantly of slow-twitch type I fibers (17), was ∼35% lower in HU rats (Table 1), and the soleus muscle-to-body mass ratio was ∼30% lower in HU animals (Table 1). Cortical BMD of the femoral neck was not different between CON and HU rats, while cancellous BMD was lower in HU rats (−18%; Table 1). The reduction in soleus muscle mass and soleus muscle-to-body mass ratio validate the efficacy of the 2-wk hindlimb unloading treatment, while the lower cancellous vBMD in the femoral neck confirms the expected bone loss in the animals studied.

The maximal intraluminal diameter of PNAs from HU rats was smaller than that in CON rats (Table 1).

Likewise, there were no differences in the passive pressure-diameter relations of PNAs from CON and HU rats (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1.

The percent vasoconstriction of PNAs evoked by norepinephrine (Fig. 2A), clonidine (Fig. 2C), KCl (Fig. 3A), endothelin-1 (Fig. 3B), and arginine vasopressin (Fig. 3C) were not different between CON and HU animals. However, the percent vasoconstriction elicited by phenylephrine, the α1-receptor adrenergic agonist, was lower in PNAs from HU rats (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2.

Flow-mediated dilation in PNAs from HU rats was severely blunted relative to that in CON PNAs. The cumulative addition of bradykinin, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, elicited a modest peak dilation (∼25–40%) from both CON and HU rat PNAs; these vasodilator responses were not different between groups (Fig. 4B). Vasodilation to acetylcholine, also an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, was attenuated in PNAs from HU rats relative to that in CON animals (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of the NOS signaling pathway with l-NAME abolished differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation between PNAs from CON and HU rats (Fig. 5A), whereas group differences in acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation remained during COX inhibition with Indo (Fig. 5B). The combined inhibition of the NOS and COX signaling pathways fully suppressed endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the PNA and eliminated group differences (Fig. 5C). PNA eNOS mRNA expression was lower in HU rats relative to that in CON animals (Fig. 6A). However, SOD-1 mRNA expression was not different between groups (Fig. 6B). Endothelium-independent vasodilation to both sodium nitroprusside (Fig. 7A) and adenosine (Fig. 7B) were similar between CON and HU groups. Fig. 4.

The purpose of the present investigation was to assess whether the elevation in bone and marrow vascular resistance is associated with greater vasoconstrictor responsiveness or reduced vasodilator function of the femoral PNA, a resistance artery which is a primary determinant of vascular resistance in long bones (6, 29). The data demonstrate that HU does not enhance constriction through any of the vasoconstrictor mechanisms tested. These include receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses [i.e., α-adrenergic receptors (Fig. 2), ET-receptors (Fig. 3B), and V1-receptors (Fig. 3C)] and non-receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses (Figs. 1A and 3A). The passive pressure-diameter response was also unchanged by HU (Fig. 1B), indicating that alterations in PNA mechanical properties do not account for the higher vascular resistance in 2-wk unloaded bones. Finally, endothelium-independent vasodilation induced by an exogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor (Fig. 7A) and the metabolite adenosine (Fig. 7B) were not impaired by HU. In contrast, endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced through flow (Fig. 4A) and acetylcholine (Fig. 4C), but not bradykinin (Fig. 4B), were attenuated by HU, and this occurred through an impairment of the NOS signaling pathway (Fig. 5). This decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation was associated with a reduction in eNOS mRNA expression (Fig. 6A), but not a change in SOD-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 6B). Collectively, these data demonstrate that HU has little effect on smooth muscle vasoconstrictor, vasodilator, or mechanical function in bone resistance arteries and, consequently, indicate that these are not mechanisms for the higher long bone vascular resistance during either unloading or subsequent reloading. HU-induced decrements in NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the bone resistance vasculature are, however, a mechanism that would function to limit bone and marrow perfusion and elevate vascular resistance during unloading and reloading. Changes in the mechanical and chemical milieu of blood vessels are known to alter the functional, structural, and mechanical properties of arteries (26, 27, 32). Hindlimb unloading in the rat induces a headward fluid shift (12, 23, 47) that diminishes arterial pressure in the hindlimb arteries, as well as eliciting both immediate and gradual decreases in bone and marrow perfusion (12). Such changes in the local environment of bone resistance arteries could impact their intrinsic vasomotor properties and the resistance they generate in regulating bone and marrow blood flow. Previous work has shown that unloading of long bones induces several types of vascular adaptations, including a narrowing of the intraluminal diameter of bone resistance arteries (52) and rarefaction of the bone microvascular network and supporting infrastructure (21, 38). Results from the present study demonstrating a reduction in the maximal PNA diameter (Table 1) are consistent with these observations that the unloading induces a structural remodeling of the bone vascular network. Such structural changes in the bone vasculature, as well as impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the resistance arteries (Fig. 4, A and C), would function to elevate bone vascular resistance and serve to limit the reloading hyperemia and blood flow capacity in bone (52). Colleran et al. (12) proposed that bone loss associated with unloading could be impacted by several cardiovascular factors, including 1) reduced bone interstitial fluid flow subsequent to decrements in bone and marrow blood flow, and 2) impairment of mechanisms directly coupling vascular endothelial cell signaling with bone cell activity (i.e., osteoclasts, osteocytes, and osteoblasts). In regard to this latter mechanism, release of NO and PGI2 from vascular endothelial cells can be modulated in response to increases or decreases in blood flow and shear stress (9, 35). These molecules not only serve as smooth muscle vasodilator agents, but could act directly on bone cells to elicit changes in bone cell activity. For example, NO is a potent inhibitor of osteoclasts (36) and promoter of osteoblastic differentiation (24), while PGI2 is a powerful inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption (10, 44). Such vascular-bone cell interactions could be particularly important in the highly vascularized cancellous bone (2). In support of this notion, studies have shown that both decreases and increases in cancellous bone volume are associated with impairment and enhancement of bone vascular endothelial function, respectively, with aging (46), altered estrogen status (45, 48, 53), and low-impact exercise training (19). Results from the present study of unloading-induced bone loss also demonstrate a relation between cancellous bone mineral density and peak PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 8). Using inhibitors of endothelial cell signaling mechanisms, the data further indicate that NO and PGI2 are active vasodilators in the femoral PNA [i.e., NO and PGI2 account for ∼50% and ∼30% of endothelium-mediated vasodilation, respectively, in CON rats (Figs. 4 and 5)]. Inhibition of NO signaling eliminates differences in vasodilation observed in PNAs from CON and HU rats (Fig. 5A), whereas group differences persist during inhibition of PGI2 (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the NOS signaling pathway in the bone vasculature is the primary mechanism impaired by unloading, and that the resulting attenuation of NO bioavailability could conceivably impact the bone properties. Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Scattergram showing the relation between cancellous volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) of the femoral neck and peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) from control and hindlimb unloaded rats. A significant linear relation (P < 0.05) exists between cancellous BMD and peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation.Previous work has shown that unloading-induced changes in bone properties occur regionally, with the greatest decrement in BMD occurring in the cancellous bone of the femur in HU rats (4, 30). Further, the degree of bone loss that occurs with unloading varies over time (4, 13, 22). Similar observations have been made with regard to the bone and marrow circulation. Colleran et al. (12) reported that with 10 min and 1 wk of HU, blood flow was lower in almost all regions of the femur, whereas with 4 wk of unloading there were further decrements in perfusion of the femoral diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow. Both the diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow are regions of the femur thought to be perfused primarily via the PNA (6). Stabley et al. (52) also reported that following a period of 1 wk of HU, the reloading hyperemia was diminished in only one region of the femur, the distal metaphysis, whereas with 2-wk HU the increase in blood flow with reloading was attenuated in all regions of the femur. These data demonstrate that like the bone itself, there are both regional and temporal effects of unloading on the bone and marrow circulation. In the present study, we have described the effects of unloading on the vasomotor responses of one portion of the bone vasculature at one point in time. Although the PNA is an important site of regulation for long bone and marrow blood flow, it seems likely that regional differences in vascular responsiveness and structure exist in unloaded bones. The bone circulation is one of the most difficult to study in the body, and perhaps for this reason it is also one of the least understood among the various organ systems. Much remains to be learned about adaptations of the bone and marrow vasculature with unloading, and how such changes affect vascular-bone interactions. In contrast to the findings of the present investigation that HU has little effect on the vasoconstrictor properties of resistance arteries in bone, 2 wk of HU and spaceflight have been shown to diminish the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness of arteries from various other regions of the body, including the abdominal (15, 18) and thoracic aortas (18), mesenteric resistance arteries (3, 11), and resistance arteries from the gastrocnemius muscle (14, 51). The one vascular bed that has shown similar functional and structural vascular alterations to that of the femoral PNA is the resistance arteries from the soleus muscle. The soleus muscle is a highly oxidative hindlimb muscle that is tonically active in postural maintenance (17). Consequently, soleus muscle maintains a relatively high blood perfusion rate during standing (12, 17, 33, 52), similar to that of the femoral cancellous bone and marrow. Further, both soleus muscle and femoral cancellous bone and marrow blood flow are reduced during postural unloading to approximately one-tenth of that during standing (12, 40, 52). Soleus muscle resistance arteries from 2-wk HU rats show few changes in the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness (14), but demonstrate impaired NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation, lower eNOS mRNA expression, and reductions in maximal diameter (16, 28, 39, 49). This decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation and remodeling of resistance artery structure underlie elevations in soleus muscle vascular resistance and decreases in the soleus muscle hyperemia during exercise (59). Thus the putative changes in the mechanical and chemical environment during unloading that drive similar functional and structural adaptations to the resistance vasculature of hindlimb long bones and soleus muscle both result in impaired perfusion rates with reloading. In summary, previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and reloading, which correspond to elevations in vascular resistance (12, 52). We hypothesized that the heightened vascular resistance is the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor or diminished vasodilator responsiveness of the bone resistance vasculature. The results demonstrate that vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responsiveness of the PNA smooth muscle cells, as well as the PNA mechanical properties, are not altered by unloading in a manner that would serve to elevate vascular resistance. However, endothelium-dependent vasodilation mediated by flow (Fig. 4A) and acetylcholine (Fig. 4C) were attenuated, and this occurred through an impairment of the vascular endothelial cell NOS signaling pathway (Figs. 5 and 6A). Such changes in the intrinsic vasodilator properties of the bone resistance vasculature, as well as the structural modifications that have been shown to occur in the vasculature of chronically unloaded bone (present study, 21, 52), would function to increase vascular resistance and decrease bone and marrow perfusion in unloaded bones. Such changes in fluid flow through the bone and impairment of endothelial cell NO signaling could contribute to the loss of bone that occurs with unloading, principally in the highly vascularized cancellous bone.GRANTS This study was supported by grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Space Biology (NNX12AL41G and NNX14AQ57G), National Space and Biomedical Research Institute (MA02501), and National Institutes of Health (AG-31317).DISCLOSURES No conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Author contributions: R.D.P. and M.D.D. conception and design of research; R.D.P., B.J.B., and M.R.A. performed experiments; R.D.P., M.R.A., and M.D.D. analyzed data; R.D.P., B.J.B., M.R.A., and M.D.D. interpreted results of experiments; R.D.P. and M.D.D. drafted manuscript; R.D.P., B.J.B., M.R.A., and M.D.D. edited and revised manuscript; R.D.P., B.J.B., M.R.A., and M.D.D. approved final version of manuscript; M.D.D. prepared figures.REFERENCES 1.Alexander DJ, Gibson CR, Hamilton DR, Lee SMC, Mader TH, Otto C, Oubre CM, Pass AF, Platts SH, Scott JM, Smith SM, Stenger MB, Westby CM, Zanello SB.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bone health and cardiovascular function are compromised in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether skeletal vascular control mechanisms are altered during the progression of T2DM in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. Responses of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur from obese ZDF rats with prediabetes, short-term diabetes, and long-term diabetes to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and –independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilation, and KCl, norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstrictor were determined in vitro. Few changes in the PNA vasomotor responses occurred in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions. Endothelium-dependent and –independent vasodilation were reduced, and norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction were enhanced in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes relative to lean age-matched controls. Differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The passive pressure-diameter response of the femoral PNA was also lower across a range of intraluminal pressures with long-term T2DM. Regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance, measured in vivo using radiolabeled microspheres, were lower in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes. These findings suggest that the profound impairment of the bone circulation may contribute to the osteopenia found to occur in long bones with chronic T2DM.

    "introduction": "Introduction The increase in fracture risk observed among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been suggested to be associated with corollaries of the disease, such as peripheral neuropathy, decreased physical fitness, vision loss, and poor balance (Leslie, et al. 2012, Melton, et al. 2008, Schwartz. 2003). Emerging research also suggests a causal link between cardiovascular function and indices of bone health (Farhat & Cauley. 2008, Lampropoulos, et al. 2012, Parfitt. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2012). Cardiovascular disease is a leading complication of T2DM (Grundy, et al. 1999, World Health Organization. 2013), including impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of large conduit arteries (Hogikyan, et al. 1998, Makimattila, et al. 1999, Rossi, et al. 2005, van de Ree, et al. 2001). Previous findings using the obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (Lesniewski, et al. 2008), an animal model of T2DM, demonstrate that an impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the nitric oxide (NO) signaling mechanism effectively changes the balance of vasomotor control in skeletal muscle arterioles to favor vasoconstriction. Decreases in BMD have also been shown to occur in obese ZDF rats with long-term T2DM (Prisby, et al. 2008) and is one basis for the decrease in mechanical strength of long bones in the hindlimb. It was hypothesized that one contributing factor to this decrease in BMD and mechanical strength could be a reduction in bone and marrow blood flow and impairment of coupling mechanisms linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone cell remodeling activity (Prisby, et al. 2008). For example, reduced blood flow to the bone and marrow of the femur occurs in aged rats (Prisby, et al. 2007), and this is accompanied by an impairment of the ability of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) to vasodilate by way of a NO signaling mechanism (Prisby, et al. 2007). In addition, prior experiments with young and old exercise trained rats (Dominguez, et al. 2010) and ovariectomized rats (Prisby, et al. 2012) suggest a coupling of endothelium-dependent vasodilation to measures of bone volume. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether control mechanisms of the skeletal resistance vasculature, including endothelium-dependent vasodilation, are altered during the progression of T2DM when BMD is both increasing and decreasing (Prisby, et al. 2008). We hypothesized that endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA would be higher in pre-diabetic 7-wk old obese ZDF rats when femoral BMD is greater than that in 7-wk old lean ZDF rats, and that endothelium-dependent vasodilation would be impaired in long-term diabetic 20-wk old obese ZDF rats when femoral BMD is reduced. Results from these vascular studies demonstrated that endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the PNA was diminished with long-term diabetes, along with other vascular mechanisms that serve to regulate bone perfusion. Consequently, a secondary purpose of this study was to determine the effects of frank T2DM on hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow and vascular conductance. We hypothesized that bone and marrow perfusion would be lower in long-term diabetes relative to that in 20-wk old lean ZDF animals.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Eighth edition, 2011). Lean (371: +/?) and obese (370: fa/fa) ZDF rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Kingston, NY, USA). Obese ZDF rats are homozygous for the fatty (fa) gene (Truett, et al. 1991) and when fed the Purina 5008 diet manifest obesity and hyperlipidemia (Leonard, et al. 2005). Seven-wk old obese ZDF rats manifest hyperinsulinemia and mild hyperglycemia and have been classified as pre-diabetic. The strain develops more severe hyperglycemia by 13 wks of age (short-term diabetes) and becomes normo- or hypoinsulinemic by 20 wks of age (long-term diabetes) (Etgen & Oldham. 2000, Peterson, et al. 1990). Animals from the present study were provided a Purina 5008 diet and water ad libitum, maintained on a 12:12 light-dark cycle, and studied at 7 wks (lean, n=28; obese, n=29), 13 wks (lean, n=28; obese, n=28), and 20 wks (lean, n=51; obese, n=51) of age to correspond to a pre-diabetic, short-term diabetic, and long-term diabetic state in the obese ZDF rats, respectively. Isolated microvessels Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%/O2 balance), a thoracotomy was performed, and 2 mL of blood was withdrawn via cardiac puncture before excision of the heart. Immediately after euthanasia the hindlimbs were removed and placed into a dissecting bath containing 4°C physiological saline solution (PSS). Femoral PNAs, which regulate ~70% of the blood supply to the femoral bone marrow and cortex (Bridgeman & Brookes. 1996), were isolated, cannulated, and pressurized with PSS at 60 cmH2O (44 mmHg) as previously described (Dominguez, et al. 2010, Prisby, et al. 2007). This pressure was selected based upon intravascular arterial pressures measured within similarly sized skeletal muscle resistance arteries of 43–46 mmHg (Meininger, et al. 1984). Experimental design Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of femoral PNAs (n=14–15/group) was assessed by the cumulative addition of acetylcholine (ACh, 10−9–10−4 mol l−1). To determine the contribution of the NO signaling pathway to endothelium-dependent vasodilation, PNAs were incubated with the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10−5 mol l−1) (Dominguez, et al. 2010, Muller-Delp, et al. 2002, Prisby, et al. 2007), and the ACh dose-response was repeated. To investigate the contribution of prostaglandin signaling to endothelium-dependent vasodilation, PNAs were co-incubated with L-NAME and the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (10−5 mol l−1) (Prisby, et al. 2007), and the ACh dose-response was repeated. Endothelium-independent vasodilator responsiveness was assessed via the cumulative addition of the NO donor sodium nitroprussside (SNP, 10−9–10−4 mol l−1). Lastly, maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness were determined after two 15 min incubations in Ca2+-free PSS supplemented with SNP (10−4 mol l−1) to achieve complete smooth muscle relaxation. Medial wall thickness was recorded as the average of three distinct wall measurements made with the video caliper as previously described (Stabley, et al. 2013). In a separate set of rats (n=13–14/group), vasoconstrictor responses of PNAs to increasing concentrations of potassium chloride (KCl, 10–100 mmol l−1) were determined to investigate the contribution of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Concentrations of NaCl and KCl in PSS were balanced such that bath osmolarity was maintained and the desired isotonic K+ bath concentrations were achieved (Donato, et al. 2005). Vasoconstrictor responses to the cumulative addition of norephinephrine (NE, 10−9–10−4 mol l−1) were recorded to measure the contribution of alpha adrenoreceptors (Delp. 1999). In a separate group of 20-wk old animals (lean, n=11; obese, n=10), the endothelium of PNAs was removed by passing 3–5 mL of air through the lumen as previously described (Donato, et al. 2005). Administration of a bolus dose of ACh (10−5 mol l−1) was used to confirm the successful removal of the endothelium, and measurement of the PNA response to the cumulative addition of NE was determined. Active myogenic responses to stepwise increases in intraluminal pressure were determined by raising the height of both fluid reservoirs in 15 cmH2O increments from 0 cmH2O to 135 cmH2O. Intraluminal pressure was then decreased in 15 cmH2O increments back to 0 cmH2O. Passive myogenic responses to stepwise increases in intraluminal diameter were determined using the steps employed for the active myogenic response describe above except that the vessel bathing solution was replaced with Ca2+-free PSS plus SNP (10−4 mol l−1) as previously described (Delp. 1999). Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) Tomographic scans were performed ex vivo on femoral mid-shafts and distal femora in PBS using a Stratec XCT Research-M device as previously reported (Prisby, et al. 2008). Reported measures of cortical BMD were derived from the femoral mid-shaft and reported total and cancellous BMD were derived from measures of the distal femora. For precision of the measurements, calibration of the Stratec XCT Research-M device was performed prior to scanning by use of a hydroxyapatite standard cone phantom. The distal metaphysis of the femur was scanned 4, 5, and 6 mm from the proximal plateau and the mid-diaphysis was scanned (on center) 8 mm from distal end of the lateral epicondyles. For both the distal metaphysis and mid-diaphysis, values from multiple slices were averaged. Scans were performed at 5 mm/s with voxel resolution of 0.07 × 0.07 × 0.5 mm. Additionally, analyses were performed using cut and peel modes of 3 and 2. According to the manufacturer’s data, machine precision is ±3.0 mg/cm3 for cancellous bone and ±9.0 mg/cm3 for cortical bone. Surgical procedures Blood flow was measured in a separate group of 20-wk old lean (n=12) and obese (n=12) ZDF rats as previously described (Colleran, et al. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2007). Animals were anesthetized with isoflourane (2–2.5%/O2 balance) and a polyethylene catheter filled with heparinized saline solution (100 U/mL) was implanted in the ascending aorta via the right carotid artery. Blood (~300 µL) was collected from this catheter to determine plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. A separate polyethylene catheter was implanted into the caudal artery of the tail for reference blood sample withdrawals (Delp & Armstrong. 1988). Each animal was allowed ≥3 hrs of recovery after wound closure and the cessation of anesthesia before experiments to measure tissue blood flow were performed. Previous research demonstrates that cardiovascular dynamics, regional blood flow, and acid-base status recover to normal levels within 3 hrs after anesthesia (Flaim & Zelis. 1980). Blood flow determination Bone blood flow using radiolabeled microspheres was measured during quiet standing in animals with long-term diabetes and 20 wk old age-matched lean controls as previously described (Colleran, et al. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2007, Stabley, et al. 2013). After completion of the blood flow experiment, animals were euthanized with Beuthanasia®-D Special (~0.6 mL/kg, Schering-Plough Animal Health, Union, NJ, USA) administered via the carotid artery catheter. Hindlimb bones were removed, cleared of muscle and tendon, and divided into regions as previously described (Colleran, et al. 2000, Dominguez, et al. 2010, Prisby, et al. 2007). Individual tissue and reference blood sample radioactivity were determined and individual tissue blood flow (mL/min/100 g) was calculated according to the reference sample microsphere method (Ishise, et al. 1980). Tissue vascular conductance (mL/min/100 g/mmHg) was calculated by dividing individual tissue blood flow by mean arterial pressure. Statistical analyses Vascular responses were calculated and expressed as a percentage of vasoconstriction or vasodilation as follows: %Vasoconstriction=(Db−Ds)/Db×100%Vasodilation=(Ds−Db)/(Dm−Db)×100, where Db was the initial baseline intraluminal diameter measured before experimental intervention, Ds was the steady-state intraluminal diameter measured after agonist addition, and Dm was the maximal diameter recorded at 60 cmH2O. Basal tone was expressed as a percentage of the maximal diameter (Dm) as follows: %Basal tone=(Dm−Db)/Dm×100. The significance of differences in body mass and bone tissue mass were determined via Student’s unpaired t-tests. Pressure-response and concentration-response curves were evaluated by using repeated-measures ANOVA with one within (intraluminal pressure or agonist concentration) and one between (experimental groups) factor. Planned contrasts were conducted at each intraluminal pressure or concentration level to determine whether differences existed between experimental groups (lean vs. obese). Regression analyses were used to individually investigate the relation between peak-endothelium-dependent vasodilation and cancellous BMD in the distal femur and total BMD and cortical BMD in the femur diaphysis. Differences in hindlimb bone blood flow and vascular conductance between experimental groups were determined by one-tailed independent-samples t-tests. An alpha level of 0.05 delineated significance.",

This difference was abolished by inhibition of NOS alone and by co-inhibition of NOS and COX (Fig. 1A). There was no difference in endothelium-dependent vasodilation between short-term diabetic animals and lean control ZDF rats (Fig. 1B). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the PNA in ZDF rats with long-term diabetes was lower than that of lean controls (Fig. 1C), and this difference was abolished with NOS inhibition alone and in combination with COX inhibition.

However, NE-induced vasoconstriction was greater in animals with long-term diabetes at concentrations between 10−7 and 10−6 M (Fig. 3A).

Femoral BMD Total and cortical BMD were the same in pre-diabetic rats versus lean controls, whereas cancellous BMD of the distal femur was greater in the pre-diabetic condition (Table 1). With short-term diabetes, total and cancellous BMD were not different between obese and lean ZDF rats, while cortical BMD was lower in obese ZDF rats (Table 1). Rats in both of these age groups still exhibit skeletal growth, so the effects of factors present in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic states may occur as a result of skeletal growth. In long-term obese ZDF rats, where the animals are more skeletally mature, total, cancellous and cortical BMD were lower than that in lean ZDF animals (Table 1). Relation between endothelium-dependent vasodilation and femoral BMD Cancellous BMD of the femur was positively associated with peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the PNA in prediabetes, short-term diabetes, and long-term diabetes (Figs. 5A–C). In addition, endothelium dependent-vasodilation was positively correlated with total BMD (Fig. 6A) and cortical BMD (Fig. 6B) of the femur in long-term diabetes. Figure 5.

Blood flow, arterial pressure and vascular conductance Blood flow was lower in all regions of the femur (Fig. 7A) and in all other skeletal regions of the hindlimb (see supplemental materials) in 20-wk old ZDF rats with long-term diabetes. Mean arterial pressure was not different between ZDF rats with long-term diabetes (160 ± 6 mmHg) and lean controls (160 ± 4 mmHg). Consequently, vascular conductance was lower in the femur (Fig. 7B) and all regions of the hindlimb skeleton of 20-wk old obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes (see supplemental materials).

    "discussion": "Discussion Previously work has shown a deterioration of both bone health and general cardiovascular function during the progression of T2DM (Grundy, et al. 1999, Leslie, et al. 2012, Prisby, et al. 2008). However, little is known regarding the effects of T2DM on the bone circulation. Thus, the primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether the progression of T2DM through a pre-diabetic, short-term diabetic and more chronic diabetic state alters mechanisms of vascular control in bone resistance arteries. The results show few adverse effects of the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions on the vasodilator or vasoconstrictor properties of the femoral PNA. However, with long-term diabetes the PNA shifts toward a more pro-vasoconstrictor phenotype. This is evidenced by a decrement in endothelium-dependent (Fig. 1C) and –independent (Fig. 2) vasodilation, an enhanced noradrenergic (Fig. 3A) and myogenic (Fig. 4A) vasoconstrictor responsiveness, as well as a decrease in the passive mechanical distensibility (Fig. 4B) of the PNA. Consequently, a secondary purpose of the present study was to determine whether this shift toward a more pro-vasoconstrictor phenotype in the bone resistance vasculature diminishes in vivo bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance. The results demonstrate an impairment of bone and marrow blood flow (Fig. 7A) and vascular conductance (Fig. 7B) with long-term T2DM. Given the potential coupling of bone vascular signaling and blood flow with skeletal remodeling (Farhat & Cauley. 2008, Lampropoulos, et al. 2012, Parfitt. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2012), the present results suggest that the profound impairment of the bone circulation could contribute to the osteopenia found to occur in long bones with chronic T2DM. T2DM is a physiologically devastating disease whose deleterious effects on bone and the cardiovascular system are multifaceted. For example, the hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia associated with T2DM can stimulate mitochondrial free radical production and alter redox balance to promote endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature (Schalkwijk & Stehouwer. 2005, van den Oever, et al. 2010). Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation of conduit arteries is present in adolescents (Naylor, et al. 2011) and adults (Bruno, et al. 2012, Hogikyan, et al. 1998, Kotb, et al. 2012, Makimattila, et al. 1999) with T2DM, and has been shown to be associated with elevated oxidative stress and the uncoupling of endothelial NOS (Pannirselvam, et al. 2002), resulting in diminished NO bioavailability to induce vascular smooth muscle cell relaxation. Although T2DM-induced decreases in conduit artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Makimattila, et al. 1999, Rossi, et al. 2005) do not necessarily reflect changes in the microvasculature (Meyer, et al. 2008), results from the present study also demonstrate endothelial dysfunction in the bone microcirculation with T2DM (Fig. 1C). Further, the results suggest that this is due to an impairment of endothelial NO signaling, as indicated by the elimination of differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation between PNAs from obese ZDF rats and age-matched lean controls when NOS inhibition is present. The enhanced adrenergic vasoconstriction of the femur resistance vasculature in the present results (Fig. 3A) coincides with observations of greater adrenergic vasoconstriction in the forearm of humans with T2DM (Hogikyan, et al. 1999). Such changes in vasoconstrictor responsiveness could be mediated through the α-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway in smooth muscle cells that elicits vasoconstriction, or the modulatory influence of α-adrenergic receptor signaling in endothelial cells that promotes vasodilation. Results in bone resistance arteries indicate the latter effect, since removal of the endothelium abolished differences in PNA responses to NE (Fig. 3B). Previous research with skeletal muscle resistance arteries has shown a similar endothelium-dependent effect on NE-mediated vasoconstriction with long-term diabetes (Lesniewski, et al. 2008). Together, the results of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and NE-mediated vasoconstriction point to a critical role for the endothelium in the transition of the bone resistance arteries to a more pro-vasoconstrictor phenotype with T2DM. Alterations in the bone resistance vasculature with T2DM are not limited to changes in endothelial cell signaling, however. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to SNP is impaired (Fig. 2), active myogenic vasoconstriction is enhanced (Fig. 4A), and the passive distensibility of the PNA is decreased with long-term diabetes (Fig. 4B). Each of these changes would also contribute to greater vasoconstrictor responsiveness, which correspond to reductions in vascular conductance in vivo (Fig. 7B). The decrements in SNP-mediated vasodilation (Fig. 2) of the PNA suggest stiffer bone arteries with long-term diabetes. One potential mechanism for enhanced stiffness is an increase in vascular calcification. Previous work has shown that there is an increased risk for arterial calcification in T2DM (Kreines, et al. 1985), and that vascular calcification in diabetes is associated with decreased muscle blood flow (Christensen. 1968). Several studies also demonstrate positive associations between vascular calcification and osteoporosis or low BMD (Adragao, et al. 2009, Bandeira, et al. 2012, Choi, et al. 2009, Hak, et al. 2000, Hyder, et al. 2009, Reddy, et al. 2008). In particular, iliac artery vascular calcification is positively associated with lumbar spine and femoral neck osteoporosis in men with T2DM (Bandeira, et al. 2012). The association between vascular alterations and bone loss are likely impacted by other factors beyond changes in arterial calcification. Evidence suggests an active role of the vasculature in coupling vascular signaling and bone remodeling (Colleran, et al. 2000, Dominguez, et al. 2010, Prisby, et al. 2012). For instance, the basic multicellular unit (BMU) that drives bone remodeling activity may be regulated via signals from core capillary endothelial cells to constituent osteoblasts and osteoclasts as the BMU advances through bone (Parfitt. 2000). The present results demonstrate that femur BMD is positively associated with endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA in the pre-diabetic (Fig. 5A), short-term diabetic (Fig. 5B), and long-term diabetic (Figs. 5A&6) states. The association between endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA and bone volume has been previously demonstrated among young and old sedentary and exercise trained rats (Dominguez, et al. 2010), as well as among young and old ovariectomized and estrogen replaced animals (Prisby, et al. 2012). Important endothelium-derived signaling molecules involved in local vascular control, including NO, prostacyclin (PGI2), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have also been shown to be important in bone biology (MacIntyre, et al. 1991, Pead & Lanyon. 1989). For example, NO is a potent inhibitor of osteoclast driven bone resorption (MacIntyre, et al. 1991) and has a positive effect on osteoblastic differentiation (Hikiji, et al. 1997), while PGI2 has been shown to be a powerful inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption (Chambers & Ali. 1983) and PGE2 has been reported to increase osteoblast and decrease osteoclast numbers (Jee, et al. 1987). Results from the present study indicate that NO signaling from the vasculature is the more important molecule in the apparent coupling of endothelium-dependent vasodilation to BMD, given that differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in PNAs from obese and lean ZDF rats were abolished by NOS inhibition alone (Figs. 1 A&C). An additional factor impacting the relation between the vasculature and bone health is bone perfusion. Bone blood flow facilitates the generation of differences in hydrostatic pressure between the medullary cavity and bone capillary efferents that drive centrifugal interstitial fluid flow (Montgomery, et al. 1988). Resultant transcortical fluid flow stimulates osteocytes and osteoblasts (Knothe Tate. 2003) and subsequent bone formation (Riddle & Donahue. 2009, Turner. 1999). Thus, the decreases in bone and marrow blood flow found in the present study (Fig. 7A) could also compromise important flow and pressure stimuli that affect bone formation. The selection of an animal model of T2DM is important since no single model will permit the investigation of all disease-related questions (Peterson, et al. 1990). For example, the Goto-Kakizaki rat is a valuable model for investigating effects of T2DM in the absence of a corresponding increase in adiposity (Akash, et al. 2013). Therein, the model fails to replicate the typical clinical T2DM phenotype that includes obesity. The Zucker obese rat is a valuable model of the metabolic syndrome (Kurtz, et al. 1989) with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, but it fails to demonstrate hyperglycemia (Peterson, et al. 1990). The ZDF rat utilized in the present study was originally derived from the Zucker obese rat strain via select inbreeding of animals that spontaneously demonstrated unusually high blood glucose levels (Peterson, et al. 1990). The ZDF rat displays a well-defined T2DM disease progression (Etgen & Oldham. 2000, Kawaguchi, et al. 1999) with deleterious changes in obesity and blood lipid profiles (Leonard, et al. 2005) that correspond with human T2DM. Since glucose and insulin levels have important outcomes on bone health (Inzerillo & Epstein. 2004) and resistance artery function (Lesniewski, et al. 2008), the present study was designed to leverage known changes in ZDF rat T2DM disease progression to investigate their effects on potential bone-vascular interactions. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that few vasomotor alterations occur in the bone resistance vasculature in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic states. However, the femoral PNA shifts toward a more pro-vasoconstrictor phenotype with long-term diabetes, as indicated by decreases in endothelium-dependent (Fig. 1C) and –independent (Fig. 2) vasodilation, enhanced noradrenergic (Fig. 3A) and myogenic (Fig. 4A) vasoconstrictor responsiveness, and a decrease in the passive mechanical distensibility (Fig. 4B). The enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance vasculature was evident in vivo from decreases in bone and marrow blood flow (Fig. 7A) and vascular conductance (Fig. 7B) with long-term T2DM. Given the potential coupling of bone vascular signaling molecules (Figs. 5&6) and bone fluid dynamics with skeletal remodeling (Farhat & Cauley. 2008, Lampropoulos, et al. 2012, Parfitt. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2012), the present results suggest that the impairment of the bone circulation could contribute to the bone loss found to occur during the progression of T2DM.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether skeletal vascular control mechanisms are altered during the progression of T2DM in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. Responses of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur from obese ZDF rats with prediabetes, short-term diabetes, and long-term diabetes to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and –independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilation, and KCl, norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstrictor were determined in vitro. Few changes in the PNA vasomotor responses occurred in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions. Endothelium-dependent and –independent vasodilation were reduced, and norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction were enhanced in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes relative to lean age-matched controls. Differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The passive pressure-diameter response of the femoral PNA was also lower across a range of intraluminal pressures with long-term T2DM. Regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance, measured in vivo using radiolabeled microspheres, were lower in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes. These findings suggest that the profound impairment of the bone circulation may contribute to the osteopenia found to occur in long bones with chronic T2DM. Keywords: Diabetes, Bone blood flow, Endothelium, Vascular conductance, Zucker diabetic fatty ratIntroduction The increase in fracture risk observed among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been suggested to be associated with corollaries of the disease, such as peripheral neuropathy, decreased physical fitness, vision loss, and poor balance (Leslie, et al. 2012, Melton, et al. 2008, Schwartz. 2003). Emerging research also suggests a causal link between cardiovascular function and indices of bone health (Farhat & Cauley. 2008, Lampropoulos, et al. 2012, Parfitt. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2012). Cardiovascular disease is a leading complication of T2DM (Grundy, et al. 1999, World Health Organization. 2013), including impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of large conduit arteries (Hogikyan, et al. 1998, Makimattila, et al. 1999, Rossi, et al. 2005, van de Ree, et al. 2001). Previous findings using the obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (Lesniewski, et al. 2008), an animal model of T2DM, demonstrate that an impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the nitric oxide (NO) signaling mechanism effectively changes the balance of vasomotor control in skeletal muscle arterioles to favor vasoconstriction. Decreases in BMD have also been shown to occur in obese ZDF rats with long-term T2DM (Prisby, et al. 2008) and is one basis for the decrease in mechanical strength of long bones in the hindlimb. It was hypothesized that one contributing factor to this decrease in BMD and mechanical strength could be a reduction in bone and marrow blood flow and impairment of coupling mechanisms linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone cell remodeling activity (Prisby, et al. 2008). For example, reduced blood flow to the bone and marrow of the femur occurs in aged rats (Prisby, et al. 2007), and this is accompanied by an impairment of the ability of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) to vasodilate by way of a NO signaling mechanism (Prisby, et al. 2007). In addition, prior experiments with young and old exercise trained rats (Dominguez, et al. 2010) and ovariectomized rats (Prisby, et al. 2012) suggest a coupling of endothelium-dependent vasodilation to measures of bone volume. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether control mechanisms of the skeletal resistance vasculature, including endothelium-dependent vasodilation, are altered during the progression of T2DM when BMD is both increasing and decreasing (Prisby, et al. 2008). We hypothesized that endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA would be higher in pre-diabetic 7-wk old obese ZDF rats when femoral BMD is greater than that in 7-wk old lean ZDF rats, and that endothelium-dependent vasodilation would be impaired in long-term diabetic 20-wk old obese ZDF rats when femoral BMD is reduced. Results from these vascular studies demonstrated that endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the PNA was diminished with long-term diabetes, along with other vascular mechanisms that serve to regulate bone perfusion. Consequently, a secondary purpose of this study was to determine the effects of frank T2DM on hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow and vascular conductance. We hypothesized that bone and marrow perfusion would be lower in long-term diabetes relative to that in 20-wk old lean ZDF animals.Materials and Methods Animals All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Eighth edition, 2011). Lean (371: +/?) and obese (370: fa/fa) ZDF rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Kingston, NY, USA). Obese ZDF rats are homozygous for the fatty (fa) gene (Truett, et al. 1991) and when fed the Purina 5008 diet manifest obesity and hyperlipidemia (Leonard, et al. 2005). Seven-wk old obese ZDF rats manifest hyperinsulinemia and mild hyperglycemia and have been classified as pre-diabetic. The strain develops more severe hyperglycemia by 13 wks of age (short-term diabetes) and becomes normo- or hypoinsulinemic by 20 wks of age (long-term diabetes) (Etgen & Oldham. 2000, Peterson, et al. 1990). Animals from the present study were provided a Purina 5008 diet and water ad libitum, maintained on a 12:12 light-dark cycle, and studied at 7 wks (lean, n=28; obese, n=29), 13 wks (lean, n=28; obese, n=28), and 20 wks (lean, n=51; obese, n=51) of age to correspond to a pre-diabetic, short-term diabetic, and long-term diabetic state in the obese ZDF rats, respectively.Isolated microvessels Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%/O2 balance), a thoracotomy was performed, and 2 mL of blood was withdrawn via cardiac puncture before excision of the heart. Immediately after euthanasia the hindlimbs were removed and placed into a dissecting bath containing 4°C physiological saline solution (PSS). Femoral PNAs, which regulate ~70% of the blood supply to the femoral bone marrow and cortex (Bridgeman & Brookes. 1996), were isolated, cannulated, and pressurized with PSS at 60 cmH2O (44 mmHg) as previously described (Dominguez, et al. 2010, Prisby, et al. 2007). This pressure was selected based upon intravascular arterial pressures measured within similarly sized skeletal muscle resistance arteries of 43–46 mmHg (Meininger, et al. 1984).Experimental design Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of femoral PNAs (n=14–15/group) was assessed by the cumulative addition of acetylcholine (ACh, 10−9–10−4 mol l−1). To determine the contribution of the NO signaling pathway to endothelium-dependent vasodilation, PNAs were incubated with the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10−5 mol l−1) (Dominguez, et al. 2010, Muller-Delp, et al. 2002, Prisby, et al. 2007), and the ACh dose-response was repeated. To investigate the contribution of prostaglandin signaling to endothelium-dependent vasodilation, PNAs were co-incubated with L-NAME and the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (10−5 mol l−1) (Prisby, et al. 2007), and the ACh dose-response was repeated. Endothelium-independent vasodilator responsiveness was assessed via the cumulative addition of the NO donor sodium nitroprussside (SNP, 10−9–10−4 mol l−1). Lastly, maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness were determined after two 15 min incubations in Ca2+-free PSS supplemented with SNP (10−4 mol l−1) to achieve complete smooth muscle relaxation. Medial wall thickness was recorded as the average of three distinct wall measurements made with the video caliper as previously described (Stabley, et al. 2013). In a separate set of rats (n=13–14/group), vasoconstrictor responses of PNAs to increasing concentrations of potassium chloride (KCl, 10–100 mmol l−1) were determined to investigate the contribution of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Concentrations of NaCl and KCl in PSS were balanced such that bath osmolarity was maintained and the desired isotonic K+ bath concentrations were achieved (Donato, et al. 2005). Vasoconstrictor responses to the cumulative addition of norephinephrine (NE, 10−9–10−4 mol l−1) were recorded to measure the contribution of alpha adrenoreceptors (Delp. 1999). In a separate group of 20-wk old animals (lean, n=11; obese, n=10), the endothelium of PNAs was removed by passing 3–5 mL of air through the lumen as previously described (Donato, et al. 2005). Administration of a bolus dose of ACh (10−5 mol l−1) was used to confirm the successful removal of the endothelium, and measurement of the PNA response to the cumulative addition of NE was determined. Active myogenic responses to stepwise increases in intraluminal pressure were determined by raising the height of both fluid reservoirs in 15 cmH2O increments from 0 cmH2O to 135 cmH2O. Intraluminal pressure was then decreased in 15 cmH2O increments back to 0 cmH2O. Passive myogenic responses to stepwise increases in intraluminal diameter were determined using the steps employed for the active myogenic response describe above except that the vessel bathing solution was replaced with Ca2+-free PSS plus SNP (10−4 mol l−1) as previously described (Delp. 1999).Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) Tomographic scans were performed ex vivo on femoral mid-shafts and distal femora in PBS using a Stratec XCT Research-M device as previously reported (Prisby, et al. 2008). Reported measures of cortical BMD were derived from the femoral mid-shaft and reported total and cancellous BMD were derived from measures of the distal femora. For precision of the measurements, calibration of the Stratec XCT Research-M device was performed prior to scanning by use of a hydroxyapatite standard cone phantom. The distal metaphysis of the femur was scanned 4, 5, and 6 mm from the proximal plateau and the mid-diaphysis was scanned (on center) 8 mm from distal end of the lateral epicondyles. For both the distal metaphysis and mid-diaphysis, values from multiple slices were averaged. Scans were performed at 5 mm/s with voxel resolution of 0.07 × 0.07 × 0.5 mm. Additionally, analyses were performed using cut and peel modes of 3 and 2. According to the manufacturer’s data, machine precision is ±3.0 mg/cm3 for cancellous bone and ±9.0 mg/cm3 for cortical bone.Surgical procedures Blood flow was measured in a separate group of 20-wk old lean (n=12) and obese (n=12) ZDF rats as previously described (Colleran, et al. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2007). Animals were anesthetized with isoflourane (2–2.5%/O2 balance) and a polyethylene catheter filled with heparinized saline solution (100 U/mL) was implanted in the ascending aorta via the right carotid artery. Blood (~300 µL) was collected from this catheter to determine plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. A separate polyethylene catheter was implanted into the caudal artery of the tail for reference blood sample withdrawals (Delp & Armstrong. 1988). Each animal was allowed ≥3 hrs of recovery after wound closure and the cessation of anesthesia before experiments to measure tissue blood flow were performed. Previous research demonstrates that cardiovascular dynamics, regional blood flow, and acid-base status recover to normal levels within 3 hrs after anesthesia (Flaim & Zelis. 1980).Blood flow determination Bone blood flow using radiolabeled microspheres was measured during quiet standing in animals with long-term diabetes and 20 wk old age-matched lean controls as previously described (Colleran, et al. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2007, Stabley, et al. 2013). After completion of the blood flow experiment, animals were euthanized with Beuthanasia®-D Special (~0.6 mL/kg, Schering-Plough Animal Health, Union, NJ, USA) administered via the carotid artery catheter. Hindlimb bones were removed, cleared of muscle and tendon, and divided into regions as previously described (Colleran, et al. 2000, Dominguez, et al. 2010, Prisby, et al. 2007). Individual tissue and reference blood sample radioactivity were determined and individual tissue blood flow (mL/min/100 g) was calculated according to the reference sample microsphere method (Ishise, et al. 1980). Tissue vascular conductance (mL/min/100 g/mmHg) was calculated by dividing individual tissue blood flow by mean arterial pressure.Statistical analyses Vascular responses were calculated and expressed as a percentage of vasoconstriction or vasodilation as follows: %Vasoconstriction=(Db−Ds)/Db×100%Vasodilation=(Ds−Db)/(Dm−Db)×100, where Db was the initial baseline intraluminal diameter measured before experimental intervention, Ds was the steady-state intraluminal diameter measured after agonist addition, and Dm was the maximal diameter recorded at 60 cmH2O. Basal tone was expressed as a percentage of the maximal diameter (Dm) as follows: %Basal tone=(Dm−Db)/Dm×100. The significance of differences in body mass and bone tissue mass were determined via Student’s unpaired t-tests. Pressure-response and concentration-response curves were evaluated by using repeated-measures ANOVA with one within (intraluminal pressure or agonist concentration) and one between (experimental groups) factor. Planned contrasts were conducted at each intraluminal pressure or concentration level to determine whether differences existed between experimental groups (lean vs. obese). Regression analyses were used to individually investigate the relation between peak-endothelium-dependent vasodilation and cancellous BMD in the distal femur and total BMD and cortical BMD in the femur diaphysis. Differences in hindlimb bone blood flow and vascular conductance between experimental groups were determined by one-tailed independent-samples t-tests. An alpha level of 0.05 delineated significance.Results Animal and PNA characteristics Body mass was greater in obese ZDF rats in the pre-diabetic, short-term and long-term diabetic conditions relative to the age-matched lean controls (Table 1). Blood glucose concentration was higher in ZDF rats with short- and long-term diabetes when compared to age-matched lean rats (Table 1), and blood insulin levels were higher in obese ZDF rats during the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetec conditions (Table 1).

PNA vasodilation Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA was greater in pre-diabetic ZDF rats when compared to age-matched lean ZDF animals (Fig. 1A). This difference was abolished by inhibition of NOS alone and by co-inhibition of NOS and COX (Fig. 1A). There was no difference in endothelium-dependent vasodilation between short-term diabetic animals and lean control ZDF rats (Fig. 1B). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the PNA in ZDF rats with long-term diabetes was lower than that of lean controls (Fig. 1C), and this difference was abolished with NOS inhibition alone and in combination with COX inhibition.

However, SNP-mediated vasodilation was attenuated in PNAs from long-term obese ZDF rats relative to lean controls (Fig. 2). Figure 2.

However, there were no differences in vasoconstrictor responses to KCl in PNAs from animals with short-term or long-term diabetes. NE-induced vasoconstriction of the PNA was not different in animals with pre-diabetes or short-term diabetes relative to age-matched lean controls (see supplemental materials). However, NE-induced vasoconstriction was greater in animals with long-term diabetes at concentrations between 10−7 and 10−6 M (Fig. 3A). When the PNAs were denuded of the endothelium, differences in NE-mediated vasoconstriction between obese and lean ZDF rats were abolished (Fig. 3B). Figure 3.

However, active myogenic vasoconstriction was greater in animals with long-term diabetes relative to lean control rats (Fig. 4A), and the passive pressure-diameter responses were lower in long-term diabetic rats compared to lean controls (Fig. 4B). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effects of long-term diabetes on active myogenic vasoconstriction (A) and the passive pressure-diameter relation (B) of the femoral principal nutrient artery. Upward pointing arrow indicates where pressure began to be increased; downward arrow indicates where pressure began to be lowered. Values are means ± SE, n = 13–14/group. *Mean PNA response from 20 wk obese ZDF rats is different from that of 20 wk lean ZDF rats (P<0.05).Femoral BMD Total and cortical BMD were the same in pre-diabetic rats versus lean controls, whereas cancellous BMD of the distal femur was greater in the pre-diabetic condition (Table 1). With short-term diabetes, total and cancellous BMD were not different between obese and lean ZDF rats, while cortical BMD was lower in obese ZDF rats (Table 1). Rats in both of these age groups still exhibit skeletal growth, so the effects of factors present in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic states may occur as a result of skeletal growth. In long-term obese ZDF rats, where the animals are more skeletally mature, total, cancellous and cortical BMD were lower than that in lean ZDF animals (Table 1).Relation between endothelium-dependent vasodilation and femoral BMD Cancellous BMD of the femur was positively associated with peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the PNA in prediabetes, short-term diabetes, and long-term diabetes (Figs. 5A–C). In addition, endothelium dependent-vasodilation was positively correlated with total BMD (Fig. 6A) and cortical BMD (Fig. 6B) of the femur in long-term diabetes. Figure 5.

A significant linear relation (P< 0.05) exists between cancellous BMD and peak PNA vasodilation in each condition.Figure 6.

A significant linear relation (P< 0.05) exists between total and cortical BMD and peak PNA vasodilation.Blood flow, arterial pressure and vascular conductance Blood flow was lower in all regions of the femur (Fig. 7A) and in all other skeletal regions of the hindlimb (see supplemental materials) in 20-wk old ZDF rats with long-term diabetes. Mean arterial pressure was not different between ZDF rats with long-term diabetes (160 ± 6 mmHg) and lean controls (160 ± 4 mmHg). Consequently, vascular conductance was lower in the femur (Fig. 7B) and all regions of the hindlimb skeleton of 20-wk old obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes (see supplemental materials). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Effects of long-term diabetes on regional femoral blood flow (A) and vascular conductance (B). Values are means ± SE, n = 12/group. *Mean is different from age-matched, non-diabetic control animals (P< 0.05).Discussion Previously work has shown a deterioration of both bone health and general cardiovascular function during the progression of T2DM (Grundy, et al. 1999, Leslie, et al. 2012, Prisby, et al. 2008). However, little is known regarding the effects of T2DM on the bone circulation. Thus, the primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether the progression of T2DM through a pre-diabetic, short-term diabetic and more chronic diabetic state alters mechanisms of vascular control in bone resistance arteries. The results show few adverse effects of the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions on the vasodilator or vasoconstrictor properties of the femoral PNA. However, with long-term diabetes the PNA shifts toward a more pro-vasoconstrictor phenotype. This is evidenced by a decrement in endothelium-dependent (Fig. 1C) and –independent (Fig. 2) vasodilation, an enhanced noradrenergic (Fig. 3A) and myogenic (Fig. 4A) vasoconstrictor responsiveness, as well as a decrease in the passive mechanical distensibility (Fig. 4B) of the PNA. Consequently, a secondary purpose of the present study was to determine whether this shift toward a more pro-vasoconstrictor phenotype in the bone resistance vasculature diminishes in vivo bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance. The results demonstrate an impairment of bone and marrow blood flow (Fig. 7A) and vascular conductance (Fig. 7B) with long-term T2DM. Given the potential coupling of bone vascular signaling and blood flow with skeletal remodeling (Farhat & Cauley. 2008, Lampropoulos, et al. 2012, Parfitt. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2012), the present results suggest that the profound impairment of the bone circulation could contribute to the osteopenia found to occur in long bones with chronic T2DM. T2DM is a physiologically devastating disease whose deleterious effects on bone and the cardiovascular system are multifaceted. For example, the hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia associated with T2DM can stimulate mitochondrial free radical production and alter redox balance to promote endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature (Schalkwijk & Stehouwer. 2005, van den Oever, et al. 2010). Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation of conduit arteries is present in adolescents (Naylor, et al. 2011) and adults (Bruno, et al. 2012, Hogikyan, et al. 1998, Kotb, et al. 2012, Makimattila, et al. 1999) with T2DM, and has been shown to be associated with elevated oxidative stress and the uncoupling of endothelial NOS (Pannirselvam, et al. 2002), resulting in diminished NO bioavailability to induce vascular smooth muscle cell relaxation. Although T2DM-induced decreases in conduit artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Makimattila, et al. 1999, Rossi, et al. 2005) do not necessarily reflect changes in the microvasculature (Meyer, et al. 2008), results from the present study also demonstrate endothelial dysfunction in the bone microcirculation with T2DM (Fig. 1C). Further, the results suggest that this is due to an impairment of endothelial NO signaling, as indicated by the elimination of differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation between PNAs from obese ZDF rats and age-matched lean controls when NOS inhibition is present. The enhanced adrenergic vasoconstriction of the femur resistance vasculature in the present results (Fig. 3A) coincides with observations of greater adrenergic vasoconstriction in the forearm of humans with T2DM (Hogikyan, et al. 1999). Such changes in vasoconstrictor responsiveness could be mediated through the α-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway in smooth muscle cells that elicits vasoconstriction, or the modulatory influence of α-adrenergic receptor signaling in endothelial cells that promotes vasodilation. Results in bone resistance arteries indicate the latter effect, since removal of the endothelium abolished differences in PNA responses to NE (Fig. 3B). Previous research with skeletal muscle resistance arteries has shown a similar endothelium-dependent effect on NE-mediated vasoconstriction with long-term diabetes (Lesniewski, et al. 2008). Together, the results of endothelium-dependent vasodilation and NE-mediated vasoconstriction point to a critical role for the endothelium in the transition of the bone resistance arteries to a more pro-vasoconstrictor phenotype with T2DM. Alterations in the bone resistance vasculature with T2DM are not limited to changes in endothelial cell signaling, however. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to SNP is impaired (Fig. 2), active myogenic vasoconstriction is enhanced (Fig. 4A), and the passive distensibility of the PNA is decreased with long-term diabetes (Fig. 4B). Each of these changes would also contribute to greater vasoconstrictor responsiveness, which correspond to reductions in vascular conductance in vivo (Fig. 7B). The decrements in SNP-mediated vasodilation (Fig. 2) of the PNA suggest stiffer bone arteries with long-term diabetes. One potential mechanism for enhanced stiffness is an increase in vascular calcification. Previous work has shown that there is an increased risk for arterial calcification in T2DM (Kreines, et al. 1985), and that vascular calcification in diabetes is associated with decreased muscle blood flow (Christensen. 1968). Several studies also demonstrate positive associations between vascular calcification and osteoporosis or low BMD (Adragao, et al. 2009, Bandeira, et al. 2012, Choi, et al. 2009, Hak, et al. 2000, Hyder, et al. 2009, Reddy, et al. 2008). In particular, iliac artery vascular calcification is positively associated with lumbar spine and femoral neck osteoporosis in men with T2DM (Bandeira, et al. 2012). The association between vascular alterations and bone loss are likely impacted by other factors beyond changes in arterial calcification. Evidence suggests an active role of the vasculature in coupling vascular signaling and bone remodeling (Colleran, et al. 2000, Dominguez, et al. 2010, Prisby, et al. 2012). For instance, the basic multicellular unit (BMU) that drives bone remodeling activity may be regulated via signals from core capillary endothelial cells to constituent osteoblasts and osteoclasts as the BMU advances through bone (Parfitt. 2000). The present results demonstrate that femur BMD is positively associated with endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA in the pre-diabetic (Fig. 5A), short-term diabetic (Fig. 5B), and long-term diabetic (Figs. 5A&6) states. The association between endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA and bone volume has been previously demonstrated among young and old sedentary and exercise trained rats (Dominguez, et al. 2010), as well as among young and old ovariectomized and estrogen replaced animals (Prisby, et al. 2012). Important endothelium-derived signaling molecules involved in local vascular control, including NO, prostacyclin (PGI2), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have also been shown to be important in bone biology (MacIntyre, et al. 1991, Pead & Lanyon. 1989). For example, NO is a potent inhibitor of osteoclast driven bone resorption (MacIntyre, et al. 1991) and has a positive effect on osteoblastic differentiation (Hikiji, et al. 1997), while PGI2 has been shown to be a powerful inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption (Chambers & Ali. 1983) and PGE2 has been reported to increase osteoblast and decrease osteoclast numbers (Jee, et al. 1987). Results from the present study indicate that NO signaling from the vasculature is the more important molecule in the apparent coupling of endothelium-dependent vasodilation to BMD, given that differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in PNAs from obese and lean ZDF rats were abolished by NOS inhibition alone (Figs. 1 A&C). An additional factor impacting the relation between the vasculature and bone health is bone perfusion. Bone blood flow facilitates the generation of differences in hydrostatic pressure between the medullary cavity and bone capillary efferents that drive centrifugal interstitial fluid flow (Montgomery, et al. 1988). Resultant transcortical fluid flow stimulates osteocytes and osteoblasts (Knothe Tate. 2003) and subsequent bone formation (Riddle & Donahue. 2009, Turner. 1999). Thus, the decreases in bone and marrow blood flow found in the present study (Fig. 7A) could also compromise important flow and pressure stimuli that affect bone formation. The selection of an animal model of T2DM is important since no single model will permit the investigation of all disease-related questions (Peterson, et al. 1990). For example, the Goto-Kakizaki rat is a valuable model for investigating effects of T2DM in the absence of a corresponding increase in adiposity (Akash, et al. 2013). Therein, the model fails to replicate the typical clinical T2DM phenotype that includes obesity. The Zucker obese rat is a valuable model of the metabolic syndrome (Kurtz, et al. 1989) with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, but it fails to demonstrate hyperglycemia (Peterson, et al. 1990). The ZDF rat utilized in the present study was originally derived from the Zucker obese rat strain via select inbreeding of animals that spontaneously demonstrated unusually high blood glucose levels (Peterson, et al. 1990). The ZDF rat displays a well-defined T2DM disease progression (Etgen & Oldham. 2000, Kawaguchi, et al. 1999) with deleterious changes in obesity and blood lipid profiles (Leonard, et al. 2005) that correspond with human T2DM. Since glucose and insulin levels have important outcomes on bone health (Inzerillo & Epstein. 2004) and resistance artery function (Lesniewski, et al. 2008), the present study was designed to leverage known changes in ZDF rat T2DM disease progression to investigate their effects on potential bone-vascular interactions. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that few vasomotor alterations occur in the bone resistance vasculature in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic states. However, the femoral PNA shifts toward a more pro-vasoconstrictor phenotype with long-term diabetes, as indicated by decreases in endothelium-dependent (Fig. 1C) and –independent (Fig. 2) vasodilation, enhanced noradrenergic (Fig. 3A) and myogenic (Fig. 4A) vasoconstrictor responsiveness, and a decrease in the passive mechanical distensibility (Fig. 4B). The enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance vasculature was evident in vivo from decreases in bone and marrow blood flow (Fig. 7A) and vascular conductance (Fig. 7B) with long-term T2DM. Given the potential coupling of bone vascular signaling molecules (Figs. 5&6) and bone fluid dynamics with skeletal remodeling (Farhat & Cauley. 2008, Lampropoulos, et al. 2012, Parfitt. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2012), the present results suggest that the impairment of the bone circulation could contribute to the bone loss found to occur during the progression of T2DM.Supplementary Material 1 MS665518-supplement-1.TIF (117KB, TIF) 2 MS665518-supplement-2.TIF (113.7KB, TIF) 3 MS665518-supplement-3.TIF (140.3KB, TIF) 4 MS665518-supplement-4.TIF (132.4KB, TIF) 5 MS665518-supplement-5.docx (17.1KB, docx) 6 MS665518-supplement-6.docx (17.2KB, docx) Acknowledgments Funding This study was supported by grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNX12AL41G) and National Institutes of Health (AG-31317).Footnotes Declaration of interest The authors state that they have no conflicts of interest.

Abstract Conditions during spaceflight, such as the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector, are thought to potentially alter cerebral blood flow and vascular resistance. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of long-term spaceflight on the functional, mechanical, and structural properties of cerebral arteries. Male C57BL/6N mice were flown 30 days in a Bion-M1 biosatellite. Basilar arteries isolated from spaceflight (SF) (n = 6), habitat control (HC) (n = 6), and vivarium control (VC) (n = 16) mice were used for in vitro functional and mechanical testing and histological structural analysis. The results demonstrate that vasoconstriction elicited through a voltage-gated Ca2+ mechanism (30–80 mM KCl) and thromboxane A2 receptors (10−8 − 3 × 10−5 M U46619) are lower in cerebral arteries from SF mice. Inhibition of Rho-kinase activity (1 μM Y27632) abolished group differences in U46619-evoked contractions. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation elicited by acetylcholine (10 μM, 2 μM U46619 preconstriction) was virtually absent in cerebral arteries from SF mice. The pressure-diameter relation was lower in arteries from SF mice relative to that in HC mice, which was not related to differences in the extracellular matrix protein elastin or collagen content or the elastin/collagen ratio in the basilar arteries. Diameter, medial wall thickness, and medial cross-sectional area of unpressurized basilar arteries were not different among groups. These results suggest that the microgravity-induced attenuation of both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties may limit the range of vascular control of cerebral perfusion or impair the distribution of brain blood flow during periods of stress. Keywords: microgravity, vasoconstriction, endothelium-dependent vasodilation, brain blood flow travel and habitation in a microgravity environment represents a unique environmental stress to fluid homeostasis in the body. It has long been thought that the redistribution of fluids and fluid pressures within the cardiovascular system induce adaptations in cardiac and vascular structure and function, but that these adaptations posed no immediate in-flight health risk to cosmonauts and astronauts. However, recently reported changes in visual acuity among astronauts (2, 31, 36) has led to speculation that the fluid pressure redistribution in space and increases in intracranial pressure may be related to the development of this condition. Spaceflight-induced increases in intracranial pressure could occur through several mechanisms, including elevations in arterial, venous, and cerebrospinal fluid pressures as these fluids undergo a cephalad shift with the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector present on Earth. Although cerebral arterial pressure is thought to increase 20–30 mmHg in a microgravity environment (62), this pressure rise has been presumed to be offset by mechanisms of cerebral autoregulation to maintain cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and fluid filtration into the cranium at levels near that occurring on Earth (11, 62). The concept that cerebral perfusion remains unaltered during spaceflight has been challenged by results from the first study to examine isolated cerebral arteries from mice flown for 2 wk on the Space Shuttle (54). These data demonstrated that myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were diminished in basilar arteries from the shuttle mice, and that these arteries were mechanically less stiff and more distensible, resulting in larger intraluminal diameters across a range of physiological pressures. Although vasoconstrictor responses elicited through other mechanisms were not investigated, the finding of diminished myogenic vasoconstrictor tone was contrary to the enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries through a variety of mechanisms in head-down tail-suspended rats (16, 18, 64, 71), a ground-based rodent model to simulate microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shifts (12, 20, 38, 45). On the basis of these findings, the authors hypothesized that microgravity represents a unique environmental stress whereby the cerebral circulation is not adequately modeled with ground-based simulations (54). By using a 30-day mission on the Bion-M1 satellite, the purpose of the present study was 1) to define whether longer duration spaceflight diminishes vasoconstrictor responses and alters the mechanical behavior of mouse cerebral arteries, 2) to extend these observations to examine possible mechanisms for putative changes in vasoconstrictor responsiveness and mechanical properties, and 3) to determine whether spaceflight alters endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries. We hypothesized that vasoconstrictor responses acting through nonreceptor (voltage-gated Ca2+ channels) and receptor (thromboxane A2) mechanisms will be diminished in cerebral arteries from spaceflight (SF) mice relative to that in habitat control (HC) and vivarium control (VC) animals, and that cerebral arteries from SF mice will demonstrate greater distensibility and a corresponding increase in the elastin/collagen ratio. And finally, on the basis of the results of Zuj et al. (74) indicating a diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries in astronauts, we hypothesized that endothelium-dependent vasodilation will be attenuated in cerebral arteries from SF mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS All experimental procedures of the Bion-M1 project were approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of the Russian Federation State Research Center Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP), the Russian Academy of Sciences (protocol No. 319), and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (8th ed., 2011). Animals Pathogenic free male C57BL/6N mice were obtained from the Animal Breeding Facility, Branch of Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Pushchino, Moscow Region, Russia. In total, four groups of mice were used: SF group (n = 6), HC group (n = 6), and two VC groups (n = 8 for each). All groups were age matched, and the animals were 19–20 wk old at the time the experiments were conducted. The SF mice were maintained on 12-h light-dark cycle and provided a pastelike diet containing 74.6% of H2O (Table 1) 2 wk prior to launch. One week prior to launch, the mice were shipped to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Three days prior to launch, the mice were placed in the cylindrical animal module habitats (diameter 98 mm, length 200 mm, approximated volume 1,700 cm3), three animals per habitat. On 19 April 2013, the Bion-M1 biosatellite was launched into orbit via a Soyuz 2-1a rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Bion-M1 capsule flew a 30-day mission and landed in the Orenburg region of Russia. Recovery personnel retrieved the animal module habitats from the biosatellite, and initial health inspections were performed onsite in a field laboratory. The SF mice were then flown to Moscow, Russia, and transported to the IBMP. The animals were killed 13–15 h after landing by cervical dislocation under the supervision of a NASA veterinarian. The brain was removed from the cranium and placed in cold (+4°C) physiological salt solution (PSS). Basilar arteries were dissected from the brain and placed in cold PSS until being mounted for in vitro experimentation. Table 1.

Mice in the first VC group were killed 2 days following experiments with the SF mice. Methods of euthanasia, brain dissection, and basilar artery isolation and experimentation were performed identically to that of the SF group. Following postlanding recovery of the animal module habitats from the Bion-M1 capsule, the habitats were refurbished and readied for housing the HC mice. Housing the HC mice in the animal module habitats was started on 26 July 2013 and lasted for 30 days. Environmental conditions [i.e., temperature, relative humidity, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and carbon dioxide (pCO2)], which were continuously recorded during the Bion-M1 mission, and food content and delivery were replicated on the ground for the HC group. All experimental procedures conducted on SF animals and the first VC group were duplicated on HC animals and the second VC group. The detailed description of housing conditions and environmental parameters in flight, control experiments, and the vivarium have been described by Andreev-Andrievskiy et al. (3).Vasomotor Experiments Segments (1–2 mm length) from the rostral portion of the basilar artery were cut and mounted on two 40-μm stainless steel wires that were connected to a force transducer myograph (Model 410A, DMT, Denmark) and micrometer microdrive for recording of isometric force under precisely controlled wall stretch. Force was recorded at 10 Hz on a PC computer with 14–140M ADC (L-card, Russia) and Powergraph 3.3 software (DISoft, Russia). After mounting, the segment length was measured and the arteries were allowed to equilibrate in PSS for 30 min while the myograph was heated to 37°C. Throughout the experiment, PSS in the myograph vessel chambers was bubbled with a gas mixture (95% O2-5% CO2) to maintain pH at 7.4. Initially, the dependence of wall tension on wall internal circumference for the relaxed preparation (passive length-tension relation) was determined (see Data and Statistical Analysis) from which the diameter, d100, was estimated from when the vessel was relaxed and subjected to a transmural pressure of 100 mmHg. The vessels were then set to 0.9 d100, where maximal contraction is developed (41). The basilar arteries were then activated once with 60 mM KCl and then constricted twice with submaximal concentration of U46619 (2 μM), a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist, which demonstrated reproducible vasoconstrictor response; the bathing solution was replaced three to four times between vasoconstrictor responses and tension returned to baseline levels. During the second contractile response to U46619, a bolus dose of 10 μM acetylcholine was added to the vessel chamber to evaluate endothelium-dependent relaxation. These procedures were followed by a 15-min equilibration period when no vasoconstrictor or vasodilator substances were present in the bathing medium; during this period the bathing solution was changed four times. A dose-response to KCl was then performed by changing the bathing solution every 3 min with solutions containing increasing concentrations of KCl (30 to 80 mM) to determine the effects of spaceflight on the cerebral artery contractile responses to smooth muscle depolarization. Then the bathing solution was replaced four times every 3 min, and the responsiveness of the basilar arteries to the cumulative addition of U46619 was determined. Finally, the bathing solution was similarly replaced four times every 3 min, and the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 (1 μM) was then placed in the bathing solution for 15 min; a second U46619 dose-response was then performed in the presence of Y27632. Preliminary experiments showed that 1 μM Y27632 suppressed agonist-induced constriction by about twofold (data not shown), while greater concentrations of the inhibitor (3 μM) abolish the constriction, similar to that previously reported for murine cerebral arteries (17).Vascular Structure and Elastin-Collagen Content Artery segments were placed in PSS containing 10−4 M sodium nitroprusside to induce smooth muscle relaxation for 15 min. The segments were then fixed in Bouin's solution, placed in optimal cutting temperature compound, and stored at −80°C. Five-micrometer-thick cryosections were cut for analysis of elastin and collagen. Sections were stained with Verhoeff-van Gieson (Scytek Laboratories, ETS-1) for elastin (Verhoeff) and collagen (van Gieson) (22). Elastin and collagen measurements were determined via a color threshold in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). A total pixel measurement for each vessel was done via Image J using a set threshold for all images. Intraluminal circumference and outer medial circumference were measured from each vessel cross section and modeled as concentric circles. Media wall thickness was calculated as the difference between the outer and inner radii and media cross-sectional area as the difference between the outer and inner area.Solutions and Drugs PSS contained (in mM) 120 NaCl, 26 NaHCO, 4.5 KCl, 1.6 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 5.5 D-glucose, 0.025 EDTA, and 5 HEPES with pH 7.4. Isotonic high-KCl solutions were prepared by equimolar substitution of NaCl to KCl. Acetylcholine (A6625; Sigma) and Y27632 (688000; Calbiochem) were dissolved in distilled water; U46619 (16450; Cayman Chemical) stock solution was prepared in dimethylsulphoxide.Data and Statistical Analysis Calculation of passive pressure-diameter response. The vessel was stretched in stepwise manner, and at the end of each step (3 min after the stretching) force value was recorded and then recalculated into wall tension: T = F/2l, where T is the tension (N/m), F is force (mN), and l is the vessel segment length (mm). Transmural pressure values were calculated with the Laplace equation: P = T/r = T/(IC/2π), where r is the inner radius of vessel segment and P is the transmural pressure. Vessel diameter (d) values were obtained from internal circumference (IC), which was calculated at each step from the wires diameter (40 μm) and the distance between them (a): IC = π × 40 + 2 × 40 + 2a. Obtained values were plotted in coordinates d = f(P) and approximated with exponential equation: P = P0 × exp(k × IC), where P0 is the value of P when wires touch, and k is the rate constant. By using this k constant, vessel diameter values were calculated in the range from 40 to 100 mmHg with 10-mmHg steps.Statistical analysis. All dose-response relations are presented as active tension (N/m) or the percent of maximal force. To estimate the sensitivity of basilar arteries to U46619, pD2 (negative logarithm of U46619 concentration that produced 50% of the maximal vasoconstrictor response) was calculated in GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). Responses from the first and second VC groups were compared by a repeated measures ANOVA. Since no differences were observed, data from the two VC groups were pooled (n = 16) for subsequent data analysis. Agonist dose-response curves between groups were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA (SF vs. HC and SF vs. VC). Relaxation to acetylcholine was calculated as the percent relaxation from the preconstricted value elicited by 2 μM U46619. The significance of differences in relaxation responses, body weights, muscle weights, and segment lengths among groups (SF, HC, and VC) were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. All values are means ± SE, and n is the number of animals per group.RESULTS Animal and Muscle Characteristics Preflight and postflight body masses did not differ among groups (Table 2). Absolute and relative soleus and gastrocnemius muscle masses were lower postflight in SF mice relative to that in HC and VC animals (Table 2), thus confirming the influence of the weightless environment during spaceflight.

Vessel Characteristics The axial length of basilar artery segments used for in vitro experimentation did not differ among the three groups (SF: 1.55 ± 0.18 mm; HC: 1.58 ± 0.15 mm; VC: 1.48 ± 0.11 mm). Based on measures from histological sections of unpressurized basilar arteries, diameter (SF: 159 ± 20 μm; HC: 181 ± 23 μm; VC: 174 ± 20 μm), medial wall thickness (SF: 107 ± 20 μm; HC: 80 ± 13 μm; VC: 93 ± 15 μm), and medial cross-sectional area (SF: 98,102 ± 27,344 μm2; HC: 80,922 ± 15,351 μm2; VC: 92,539 ± 23,056 μm2) were not different among groups.Contractile Responses The basilar artery contractile responses elicited by KCl from SF mice were lower compared with that in HC and VC mice (Fig. 1A). When contractile responses to KCl were normalized to the response at the maximal concentration of KCl (80 mM), there were no differences in the sensitivity of responses to KCl between SF and control groups (Fig. 1B).

A: KCl concentration-active tension relations of basilar arteries. B: responses to different concentrations of KCl in percentage from 80 mM KCl response. Values are means ± SE; n = number of animals studied. *P < 0.05 between groups.Contractile responses elicited through the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 were also lower in arteries from the SF group compared with that in the HC and VC groups (Fig. 2A). Arterial sensitivity to U46619, however, did not change with spaceflight, as indicated by the lack of difference in pD2 values between SF (6.39 ± 0.08) and HC (6.56 ± 0.06) or VC (6.41 ± 0.10) groups. In the presence of the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632, the maximal contractile response to U46619 was ∼50% lower in all groups. Importantly, the Rho-kinase inhibition eliminated the between-group differences in the responses to U46619 (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2.

A: concentration-active tension relations of basilar arteries to U46619. B: concentration-response relations in the presence of Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 (1 μM). Inhibition of Rho-kinase led to significant reduction of contractile responses and eliminated the between-group differences. Values are means ± SE; n = number of animals studied. *P < 0.05 between groups.Endothelium-dependent Relaxation To evaluate the influence of spaceflight on endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries, responses of basilar arteries to acetylcholine were compared. Acetylcholine evoked a robust relaxation of basilar arteries from the HC and VC groups, whereas acetylcholine-mediated relaxation was virtually absent in cerebral arteries from SF mice (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Maximum relaxation responses of basilar arteries from HC, VC, and 30-day Bion-M1 SF mice to endothelium stimulation with 10 μM acetylcholine.

The inner diameter of basilar arteries was not different between SF and VC groups. Inner diameter was smaller in basilar arteries from SF mice relative to that in HC mice across the range of transmural pressures, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.076). Basilar artery elastin content did not differ among groups (Fig. 5A), whereas the collagen content was greater in arteries from VC mice relative to that in HC and SF animals (Fig. 5B). The elastin/collagen ratio did not differ among groups (Fig. 5C). Fig. 4.

The primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether a 30-day mission on the Bion-M1 biosatellite diminishes vasoconstrictor responses acting through different mechanisms. The results demonstrate that vasoconstriction elicited through a nonreceptor, voltage-gated Ca2+ mechanism (Fig. 1A) and the thromboxane A2 receptor pathway (Fig. 2A) are diminished in cerebral arteries from SF mice. Furthermore, inhibition of Rho-kinase activity (Fig. 2B) indicates that this signaling pathway is involved in the spaceflight-induced impairment of vasoconstrictor responsiveness. Second, the data demonstrate that endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired in cerebral arteries from SF mice (Fig. 3). Finally, based on previous results that flight on the Space Shuttle reduced cerebral artery stiffness and increased vascular distensibility (54), we hypothesized that the cerebral arteries from the Bion-M1 mice will demonstrate greater distensibility and a corresponding increase in the elastin/collagen ratio. Contrary to our hypothesis, cerebral arteries from SF mice were less distensible than those from HC mice (Fig. 4), and the elastin/collagen ratio did not change with spaceflight (Fig. 5C). These findings suggest that mission duration or environmental factors other than microgravity may modulate alterations in cerebral artery mechanical properties during spaceflight. Vasoconstriction Cerebral blood flow is regulated through a variety of factors that affect the contractile state of vascular smooth muscle cells in cerebral arteries (1, 27, 60). One of these factors is the inherent ability of smooth muscle cells to respond to increases (contraction) and decreases (relaxation) in intravascular (transmural) pressure (14, 61). It is this intrinsic myogenic mechanism of cerebral resistance arteries that largely maintains a constant cerebral blood flow under circumstances of changing intravascular pressure (14, 61). Without such a mechanism, excessive cerebral blood flow and pressure through the microcirculation could rupture small cerebral blood vessels and disrupt the blood-brain barrier (61), such as is thought to occur when the head-to-foot gravity vector on Earth is no longer present (11, 33). The intrinsic tone of cerebral arteries can also be modulated through the influence of extrinsic factors, such as locally released or circulating vasoactive substances (1, 27, 60, 61), which can consequently impact autoregulation of cerebral perfusion. In particular, thromboxane A2 synthesis and its influence on the myogenic tone of cerebral arteries has been observed under normal physiological conditions (19, 55), as well as in various cerebrovascular pathologies (1, 60). The collective findings from the STS-135 shuttle and Bion-M1 biosatellite missions demonstrate that spaceflight impairs cerebral artery smooth muscle contraction through the myogenic stretch-sensing mechanism (54), the thromboxane A2 receptor-mediated mechanism, and the nonreceptor voltage-gated Ca2-channel mechanism. Both the myogenic and U46619 mediated vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries have been shown to function in part through the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway (37, 42, 61). Thus results from the present study demonstrating inhibition of Rho-kinase eliminates differences in vasoconstriction between SF and control groups suggests that a mechanism for diminished cerebral artery smooth muscle contraction during spaceflight is a reduced Ca2+ sensitivity through the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway. It is not apparent, however, that impairment of the RhoA/Rho-kinase mechanism of smooth muscle contraction is the only pathway adversely affected in cerebral arteries by microgravity. This notion is based on several observations. First, KCl-induced vasoconstriction is also impaired by spaceflight (Fig. 1A). KCl is primarily thought to elicit cerebral artery smooth muscle contraction through the Ca2+-calmodulin/myosin light chain kinase signaling mechanism without involvement of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway (14, 37); the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 does not affect KCl-induced response of murine basilar artery (17). Second, spaceflight has been shown to impair the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+-release mechanism in peripheral arteries and veins (9, 13, 51). If such impairment of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism occurs in cerebral arteries, this could account for the diminished KCl-mediated vasoconstriction in the SF mice. Further research will be needed to determine whether other mechanisms of smooth muscle contraction besides the Rho-kinase signaling pathway are impaired in cerebral arteries with spaceflight.Vessel Wall Structure and Mechanics Other factors could also contribute to the diminished vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries, including the remodeling of vessel structure and alterations in the arterial wall mechanical properties. Neither changes in medial wall thickness nor medial cross-sectional area were found to occur in the present study, indicating changes in the gross structural properties of cerebral arteries do not appear to underlie the contractile deficit. The pressure-diameter relation of cerebral arteries was, however, lower in SF mice relative to that in HC animals. Such an apparent increase in vascular stiffness could impair vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries. This change in cerebral artery wall mechanics in SF mice does not appear to be related to a decrease in elastin content, an increase in collagen content, or a decrease in the elastin/collagen ratio. Thus alterations in the content of extracellular matrix proteins do not appear to account for the changes in the mechanical properties of cerebral arteries with spaceflight. Although results from the present study demonstrate a decrease in the pressure-diameter relation with spaceflight, previous work with mice flown on the Space Shuttle show the effective elastic modulus and stiffness of cerebral arteries is reduced with spaceflight while vascular distensibility in the form of the pressure-diameter relation was increased (54). Several factors may account for these divergent results between studies, including the sex and age of the animals studied, time in space, and environmental factors other than microgravity. Considering sex and age, although differences in these variables existed between the groups of mice studied from the Space Shuttle and Bion-M1 missions (shuttle: 11-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice; Bion-M1: 19- to 20-wk-old male C57BL/6N mice), further research is needed to determine whether animal sex or such age differences are sufficient to drive adaptation of cerebral artery mechanical properties in opposite directions. A second possibility is the amount of time the animals spent in space. Animals in the present study were exposed to a microgravity environment for more than twice as long (30 days) as the mice flown on the Space Shuttle (13 days). Evidence is available to suggest that changes in the properties of cerebral arteries could occur in a directionally opposite manner as the duration of spaceflight is extended. For example, Arbeille et al. (4) reported that cerebral vascular resistance in cosmonauts was lower than preflight levels after 15 and 18 days of flight on the Mir Space Station, but returned to preflight levels following 24 days of flight. Likewise, Arbeille et al. (6) reported middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity in cosmonauts was higher following 2–4 days and 2–3 wk of spaceflight, but lower than preflight levels after 5–6 mo of spaceflight. These data are consistent with the notion that for some as yet unknown reason the initial adaptation of cerebral arteries is to increase vascular distensibility, resulting in a lower cerebral vascular resistance and higher perfusion. However, with longer duration flight, vascular distensibility is decreased and correspondingly cerebral perfusion is diminished. A final possibility for the directionally different changes in vascular distensibility with spaceflight is that other environmental factor(s) existed which may cause different adaptations in the mechanical properties of cerebral arteries. For example, the pCO2 in the Space Shuttle docked with the International Space Station (ISS) (∼2.5 mmHg) was approximately 10 times that on Earth at sea level (0.23 mmHg) (2, 54). In contrast, the pCO2 during the Bion-M1 mission (∼0.01 mmHg) was approximately 10-fold lower than that at sea level (3). Because CO2 is such a potent vasodilator in the cerebral circulation (26, 50, 66), chronic increases or decreases in the exposure of cerebral arteries to this vasoactive substance could conceivably affect its mechanical properties. Further study will be necessary to determine the specific impact of chronic changes in pCO2 on cerebral artery mechanics. Another environmental factor that could differentially affect cerebral artery mechanics (and function) is the level of exposure to space radiation (68). The Bion-M1 biosatellite flew at an altitude of 575 km and a 64.9 degree inclination, with the animals receiving a total radiation dose of between 32–72 mGy, depending on their cage placement in the biosatellite (53). This resulted in a daily radiation exposure of 0.5–1.25 mGy/day (53). This level of exposure is approximately sixfold higher than that occurring in the International Space Station, which orbits Earth at an altitude of ∼400 km, and consequently represents the approximate dose that astronauts receive during a 6-mo mission on the International Space Station. Thus the total radiation dose to the Bion-M1 mice was likely much higher than that to the mice flown 13 days on the STS-135 Space Shuttle mission (54). Regardless of the stimulus, a change in cerebral artery mechanics during spaceflight could have important consequences on cerebral perfusion, given that cerebral vascular resistance is a major determinant of cerebral blood flow and, according to Poiseuille's law, is predominantly determined by the diameter of resistance arteries. Thus how factors during spaceflight affect the pressure-diameter relation of cerebral arteries could have a direct impact on cerebral blood flow and, consequently, intracranial pressure.Vasodilatation Little is known regarding the effects of spaceflight on the vasodilator properties of cerebral arteries. Zuj et al. (74) have reported that cerebral vascular reactivity to 10% inspired CO2 was diminished in astronauts following a long-duration stay on the ISS. Cerebral vascular reactivity to acutely inspired CO2 has been suggested to reflect endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway (34, 35, 48). In mice, NO is also a key mediator of cerebral artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation (8). Thus results from the present study of diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the basilar artery provide corroboration of this finding in astronauts. It remains to be determined, however, whether the deficit in endothelium-dependent vasodilation is the result of impaired endothelial cell signaling or diminished smooth muscle cell relaxation to endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). The present results are also consistent with studies of cerebral arteries isolated from head-down tail-suspended rats, a ground-based animal model to simulate microgravity, which have shown diminished endothelial NO synthase (NOS) protein expression (64) and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the NOS mechanism (44, 72, 73).Implications for Cerebral Blood Flow Regulation On the basis of results from the present study of diminished KCl and U46619-evoked cerebral artery vasoconstriction, as well as the previously reported reduction in myogenic vasoconstriction (54), one could surmise that cerebral perfusion is elevated during spaceflight. Indeed, flow-induced constriction, which is mediated through thromboxane A2 receptors in cerebral arteries (55), and myogenic vasoconstriction are important determinants of cerebral autoregulation (29, 42, 55, 61). The notion of higher cerebral blood flow during spaceflight is further supported by results from a chronically instrumented rhesus monkey flown 5 days on the Cosmos 1514 biosatellite, where carotid flow velocity was elevated because of a significant reduction in vascular resistance (46). An additional line of evidence regarding the potential impact of cephalad fluid shifts on cerebral hemodynamics comes from the remodeling of the skull that occurs with spaceflight. In mice, rats, and humans, skull bone volume (70) and mineral density (21, 32, 39) are increased with short duration flight on the Space Shuttle. In this nonload-bearing bone, skeletal remodeling to increase bone density could be in response to increases in cerebral perfusion and consequent elevations in intracranial pressure (28, 57, 70). Despite the evidence to infer elevations in brain blood flow during spaceflight, decrements in cerebral artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation and reductions in vascular distensibility suggest that the effects of spaceflight on cerebral blood flow may not be so clear, as also reflected by studies reporting increases (4, 6, 24, 25, 40, 43, 56, 59, 69), no change (5, 7, 74), or decreases (10, 74) in cerebral perfusion in astronauts and cosmonauts. What does seem apparent is that the range of the cerebral circulation to precisely regulate brain blood flow through vasoconstriction and vasodilation is impaired by spaceflight. Such changes in vascular control mechanisms may not only be reflected through changes in the magnitude of cerebral blood flow, but may adversely impact the redistribution of cerebral blood during periods of stress, such as mental (63, 67), exercise (15, 23), and othostatic (47, 64) stress. In considering whether spaceflight affects regional distribution of cerebral blood flow, one question that arises is whether the effects of microgravity on basilar artery structure and function are limited to this specific cerebral artery or are indicative of changes occurring more globally in the cerebral circulation. Two lines of evidence suggest that the results found in the basilar artery are representative of a larger effect on cerebral arteries. First, in the only other study describing the effects of spaceflight on cerebral arteries, Taylor et al. (54) reported greater distensibility (passive pressure-diameter relation) in basilar arteries and reduced stiffness (load-displacement curve) in posterior communicating arteries from the same animals. These corresponding measures of the mechanical properties of cerebral arteries indicate a broad effect of microgravity on the cerebral circulation. Second, there are numerous studies demonstrating in head-down tail-suspended rats that changes in vascular structure (52, 64, 65), vasoconstrictor responsiveness (18, 52, 64, 71), and endothelium-dependent vasodilator responsiveness (44, 72, 73) similarly occur in basilar arteries and middle cerebral arteries. These studies collectively suggest that the effects of spaceflight on basilar artery structure and function may not be limited to only the vertebrobasilar regions of the brain. In summary, results from the present study demonstrate for the first time that spaceflight diminishes KCl (Fig. 1A) and U46619-evoked (Fig. 2A) cerebral artery vasoconstriction. The reduction in the thromboxane A2 receptor-mediated vasoconstriction appears to occur through a reduced Ca2+ sensitivity mechanism via impairment in the Rho-kinase signaling pathway (Fig. 2B), whereas the reduced KCl-induced constriction likely occurs through some other as yet unknown mechanism. The results also demonstrate that endothelium-dependent vasodilation is attenuated by spaceflight (Fig. 3). Finally, in contrast to a previous report (54), the current results demonstrate that cerebral artery distensibility is attenuated by spaceflight (Fig. 4), although this change in the mechanical properties of the cerebral artery does not appear to be related to the extracellular matrix protein content of the arterial wall (Fig. 5). Collectively, these data suggest that spaceflight impairs the ability of the cerebral circulation to precisely control brain blood flow. Further, we speculate that environmental conditions other than microgravity in the spacecraft may affect structural and functional adaptations of the cerebral arteries. For example, CO2, which is a potent cerebral vasodilator (26, 50, 66) and is known to interact with cerebral autoregulation to elevate intracranial pressure (30, 49, 58), as well as space radiation (68), could account for some of the variability observed with spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery mechanics and astronaut and cosmonaut brain blood flow. Additional research will be required to determine the specific impact of these environmental factors, and whether they contribute to putative elevations in intracranial pressure among astronauts and cosmonauts (2, 31, 36).GRANTS This study was supported by the Russian Federal Space Agency, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and M.V.

    "abstract": "Abstract As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4–5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",

    "methods": "Methods US Astronaut Mortality Rate Study This study consisted of two distinct populations, the deceased astronaut population and the deceased US National Population ages 55–64. A record of deceased US NASA astronauts through 2015 was obtained from NASA Johnson Space Center Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health and NASA website (http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/astrobio_former.html). Records of other NASA-US Air Force astronauts in the X-15, X-20 and Manned Orbital Laboratory programs were obtained from program summaries37. Deceased US astronauts were further grouped into flight (including LEO and Apollo lunar subgroups) or non-flight astronaut samples based on their flight activities; this allowed cause of death comparisons between the flight and non-flight groups. US Astronaut Flight Sample Deceased flight astronauts (n = 43) flew on orbital missions as part of the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Apollo-Soyuz, Skylab and Space Shuttle programs and included pilots, mission commanders, mission specialists and payload specialists. Deceased flight astronauts were further subdivided into two groups, those having flown missions in low Earth orbit (LEO, n = 36) and those having flown missions beyond LEO as part of the Apollo lunar missions (n = 7). Astronauts that perished in the Apollo 1 and STS-51L Challenger accidents but had flown on previous missions (n = 6) were classified as flight astronauts. Those US astronauts that perished in the STS-107 Columbia accident were classified as flight astronauts since all achieved orbital flight. US Astronaut Non-Flight Comparison Sample The first comparison group consisted of deceased astronauts who never flew in space or flew only suborbital flights (n = 41). These individuals included astronauts that completed astronaut training but were never assigned to a specific mission, were assigned to a subsequently cancelled missions, died prior to flying their assigned mission, flew the NASA-US Air Force’s X-15 rocket-powered aircraft, or were designated to fly on the US Air Force’s X-20 Dyna-Soar space plane or Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL). Astronauts that flew the X-15 aircraft never attained orbital spaceflight, and individuals assigned to the X-20 Dyna-Soar and MOL never flew in space as part of these programs due to their cancelation. Of the thirty-one X-15, X-20 and MOL astronauts, nine subsequently flew orbital missions as part of the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. Four of the nine are now deceased and included in the flight group; three are in the LEO group and one is in the Apollo lunar group. Astronauts who perished in the Apollo 1 and STS-51L Challenger accidents who were first-time flyers (n = 4) were categorized as non-flight astronauts for the purpose of this analysis due to not having achieved orbital flight. US National Population Comparison Sample A second comparison population consisted of the general US population. The total number of deaths in 2013 of those dying between 55–64 years of age and the number of deaths from this population subgroup due to CVD, cancer, accidents, and all other causes were used for comparison with that of the flight (including LEO and Apollo lunar subgroups) and non-flight astronaut groups. This population subgroup from the general population was used because the 55–64 year age group most closely approximates the ages of the flight and non-flight astronauts at their time of death (Table 1). Vital Statistics Cause of death was determined from death certificates in all Apollo lunar astronauts, 97% of LEO astronauts, and 49% of non-flight astronauts. In cases where death certificates were not available for review, cause of death was obtained from official NASA biographical sketches (http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/), NASA’s Astronaut Fact Book, obituaries, and other biographical records. The specific cause of death for one LEO astronaut and 6 non-flight astronauts could not be determined from any of the above sources; these astronauts were not included in the analysis for a final sample of 42 flight astronauts and 35 non-flight astronauts. Cause of death was categorized into four main categories: Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, Accident, and All Other Causes. Deaths due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, brain aneurysm, or blood clots were classified as CVD. Deaths attributed to any form of malignant neoplasms were categorized as cancer. Deaths due to unintentional injuries, including orbiter destruction and plane, automobile, motorcycle, boat and bicycle accidents, were categorized as accidents. Any other causes of death were designated in the All Other Causes category and included illnesses such as pneumonia and pancreatitis. All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for the US general population 55–64 years old in 2013 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics21. Animal Studies All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Florida State University, NASA and Brookhaven National Laboratory, conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health () Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Eighth edition, 2011). Forty-four male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), 16 weeks of age, were individually housed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory animal facility at Long Island, New York. Animals were maintained in a controlled environment (12:12 hour light-dark cycle, 24 ± 2 °C) and provided food and water ad libitum. Mice were randomized by body mass to one of four groups: control (Con, n = 11), hindlimb unloaded (HU, n = 11), total body irradiated (TBI, n = 11), and the combined TBI and HU (TBI+HU, n = 11). One week after the conclusion of the unloading treatment for the HU and TBI+HU groups, the mice in all four groups were shipped to Florida State University, individually housed in the animal vivarium under controlled environmental conditions (12:12 hour light-dark cycle, 24 ± 2 °C) and provided food and water ad libitum. Hindlimb Unloading Mice were hindlimb unloaded via tail traction for 14 days according to the methods of Morey-Holton et al. as previously described19,20,38. After the 14-day unloading treatment, animals were released from the unloading apparatus to move freely in standard cages for 6–7 months until the time to conduct the vascular experiments. Control mice were individually housed in their normal cage environment. Whole-Body Irradiation Mice were exposed to a single dose of radiation consisting of 1 Gy of 56Fe ions (600 MeV/nucleon, LET 150 keV/μm in water) at a dose rate of 10cGy/min at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory beamline at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Irradiation of TBI+HU mice took place 3 days after the initiation of hindlimb unloading while the animals remained unloaded. Sham-irradiated mice were handled in an identical fashion but were not irradiated (0 Gy). Isolated Microvessel Studies Experiments were conducted on 2 mice per day over a 5-wk period. These studies commenced after at least 6 months from the time the HU mice were released from the unloading treatment. Animals from each of the four groups were randomly selected for experimentation over the 5-wk experimental period, and one mouse from each group was studied every other experimental day. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5%/O2) and euthanized by excision of the heart. Gastrocnemius muscle feed arteries running along the superficial white portion of the gastrocnemius muscles from the left and right hindlimbs were isolated and either cannulated and prepared for in vitro experimentation or frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C for determination of protein content as previously described20,38. Additionally, the left anterior descending artery and branches off this artery (~90–220 μm inner diameter) were dissected free of the surrounding myocardium, snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C for determination of protein content. Evaluation of Vasomotor Properties In one set of studies, vasodilator responses of feed arteries to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh, 10−9–10−4 M) and endothelium-independent vasodilator Dea-NONOate (10−9–10−4 M) were assessed as previously described20,38. ACh-induced vasodilation was also evaluated following incubation with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10−5 M) and following incubation with the combination of L-NAME with COX inhibitor indomethacin (10−5 M) as previously reported20,38. Maximal diameter and medial wall thickness were determined after a 1-hr incubation period in calcium-free physiological saline buffer solution (PSS) with 10−4 M sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to allow complete smooth muscle cell relaxation. In a second set of vessels, vasoconstrictor responses were assessed through non-receptor (KCl, 10–100 mM), myogenic (increasing intraluminal pressure from 0 cm H2O up to 140 cm H2O, in 20 cm H2O increments), and receptor [α1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE, 10−9–10−4 M)] mechanisms as previously described20,39. Passive pressure-diameter responses were recorded in a similar fashion to that of the active myogenic response after vessels were incubated in calcium-free PSS with 10−4 M SNP for 1 hr. Immunoblot Analysis eNOS, SOD-1, XO and NOX-2 protein content in gastrocnemius feed arteries and coronary arteries were assessed via immunoblot analysis. Arteries were isolated, snap frozen and processed as previously described20,40. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: eNOS (1:150, BD Transduction #610296), Cu/Zn SOD-1 (1:8000, Enzo Life Sciences ADI-SOD-100-F), XO (1:1000, Abcam #109235), NOX-2 (1:1000, Abcam #129068) and β-actin (1:2000, Cell Signaling #4967). Differences in loading were normalized by expressing all data as relative densitometry units of the protein of interest versus β-actin. Statistical Analysis Proportional mortality rates were calculated as the number of deaths from a particular cause divided by the total number of deaths for that particular group or sub-group. The significance of differences in cause-specific deaths between groups was assessed with Fisher’s exact probability test. Due to this test being considered extremely conservative41, a value of P ≤ 0.10 was considered statistically significant42,43. Differences in age at the time of death and other astronaut characteristics were assessed with a one-way ANOVA and Fisher LSD post-hoc tests. For the animal studies, a one-way ANOVA and Fisher LSD post-hoc tests were used to detect differences in body, tissue and vascular characteristics. Vasomotor responses were evaluated using repeated-measures ANOVAs to detect differences between experimental groups and drug doses or pressure changes. All values are presented as means ± SE. A value of P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
    "results": "Results Group Characteristics and Proportional Mortality Rates The group of all flight astronauts was comprised of 5 females and 37 males, of which the LEO astronaut subgroup contained 5 females and 30 males and the Apollo lunar astronaut subgroup was comprised of 7 males. The non-flight astronauts consisted of 3 females and 32 males. Differences in the mean age at the time of selection and the time of death between all flight and non-flight astronauts or among LEO, lunar and non-flight astronauts were not significant (Table 1). Although the duration of Apollo missions ranged from 6.0–12.6 days, several of the lunar astronauts also logged time on Mercury, Gemini and Skylab missions, resulting in a total time in space of ~15 days. The total time in space and the number of missions flown did not differ between LEO and Apollo lunar astronauts (Table 1). Table 1. Astronaut characteristics.

However, when looking at the subgroup analysis the number of deaths due to CVD in Apollo lunar astronauts was almost five times greater than that in the non-flight astronauts (Fig. 1) and four times higher than in LEO astronauts. There were no differences between LEO and non-flight astronauts. All flight and non-flight astronauts that died from cardiovascular-related causes were male. Figure 1.

Relative to this 55–64 year old US population, the proportional mortality rate due to CVD was lower in the non-flight astronauts and LEO astronauts (Fig. 1). Cancer proportional mortality rate was not different between the US population and both flight and non-flight astronauts (Table 2). Proportional mortality due to accidents was higher in both flight and non-flight astronauts compared with the US population (Table 2). Finally, for all other causes of death there was a lower proportional mortality for flight, LEO and non-flight astronauts compared with the US reference population, but no differences between lunar astronauts and the 55–64 year old population (Table 2). Animal and Vessel Characteristics Following a 6–7 month recovery period from exposure to simulated weightlessness and space radiation, total body mass, muscle masses and gastrocnemius muscle feed artery characteristics were not different among groups (Table 3).

Vasodilator Responses There was a significant acetylcholine (ACh) dose by group interaction between the control (Con) and total body irradiated (TBI) groups and the Con and total body irradiated plus hindlimb unloaded (TBI+HU) groups (Fig. 2). The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) reduced ACh-mediated vasodilation in all groups and abolished treatment-associated differences among groups (Fig. 3A). The combined NOS and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition further decreased vasodilator responses with no differences among groups (Fig. 3B). There was no significant dose by group interaction for endothelium-independent vasodilation with Dea-NONOate among groups (Fig. 4). Figure 2.

    "discussion": "Discussion Life on Earth is insulated from the harmful effects of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events through particle deflection by the Earth’s magnetosphere and shielding by Earth’s atmosphere. With the exception of the Apollo lunar missions, manned spaceflight has taken place exclusively in LEO where atmospheric protection from space radiation is essentially absent, but protection by the Earth’s geomagnetic field is present. Under these conditions, it has been broadly assumed that missions in LEO or short excursions to the Moon would not increase the long-term risk for CVD among astronauts16,18. Using non-flight astronauts as a comparison group, the data show that this group had a mortality rate of approximately 9% due to CVD (Fig. 1). The mortality rate for CVD among all US flight astronauts, including both LEO and Apollo lunar astronauts, was not different than that in the non-flight astronauts. However, when considered as a separate group, the Apollo lunar astronauts, the only group of humans to have traveled outside of the Earth’s protective magnetosphere, demonstrate a higher mortality rate due to CVD compared to both the cohort of astronauts that did not travel into space, as well as astronauts who remained in LEO (Fig. 1). These data suggest that human travel into deep space may be more hazardous to cardiovascular health than previously estimated. Astronaut mortality has been reported in four previous studies. In the first by Peterson et al.22, it was reported that of the 20 deceased US astronauts from 1959–1991 the causes of death were due to circulatory disease (10%), cancer (5%), accidents (80%) and other causes (5%). Using the US population as the reference group, it was found that mortality due to CVD was significantly lower in astronauts and accidental deaths were significantly higher22. A subsequent study by Hamm et al.23 focused solely on cancer-specific mortality among astronauts through 1995, and included an additional reference group of Johnson Space Center employees. This comparison group was part of a Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health initiative by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to better assess the occupational health risks of astronauts, since the health characteristics of astronauts and the overall environment in which they train at Johnson Space Center were deemed to be different from that of the general US population24. Results from this study indicated that there was not a significant difference in cancer mortality between astronauts and Johnson Space Center employees or Texas residents living in the area surrounding Johnson Space Center23. In a follow-up study by Hamm et al.25, cause-specific mortality rates beyond just cancer were examined. The only significant difference found was a higher number of accidental deaths among astronauts (69%) relative to Johnson Space Center employees (14%). Finally, in the most recent study published by Reynolds and Day26, the cause-specific mortality rates from 1980–2009 were reported in astronauts and residents of Harris County, Texas, where Johnson Space Center is located. The results indicated a lower risk of death due to CVD and cancer in astronauts versus Harris County residents, and a higher risk of death due to accidents26. Collectively, these studies indicate that the risk of death due to chronic diseases appears to be lower in astronauts, particularly those involving CVD22,26. The current analysis of mortality rates among astronauts differs from these previous studies in several important ways. The first is the reference population used to gauge the significance of cause-specific mortality rates among astronauts. The biomedical characteristics of astronauts are very different from individuals in the general population. According to the Review of NASA’s Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health by the Institute of Medicine24, astronauts have substantially higher incomes, levels of education, general fitness, and lifelong access to medical care, all of which are factors known to contribute to high levels of health and well-being. With such large baseline differences between astronauts and comparison groups, it is difficult to ascertain what specific impact spaceflight might have on astronaut health. For this reason, the Institute of Medicine recommended in 2004 that astronauts who have never flown in space be used as a reference population24; the present study is the first to incorporate non-flight astronauts as a comparison group. Consequently, current results demonstrate that previous conclusions suggesting the risk of death due to CVD is lower among flight astronauts22,26 are no longer tenable. The second unique feature of the present study is that it is the first to examine the long-term mortality risks of spaceflight in LEO and deep space. Exposure to charged particles comprising the galactic cosmic rays in deep space has the potential to elicit a number of complications in biological tissue. Recent work in rodents and cell culture has highlighted the potentially harmful effects of such exposures on the cardiovascular system20,27,28,29,30, which may translate to astronauts engaged in deep space expeditions. While traveling from LEO to the Moon and back, the Apollo lunar astronauts traversed regions of geomagnetically trapped electrons and protons known as the Van Allen belts and, depending on the duration of their mission and the specific activities in which they were engaged (e.g., lunar surface and intravehicular Command and Lunar Module activities), were continuously subjected to varying levels of high-energy cosmic rays31. Fortunately, there were no major solar particle events during any of the Apollo missions. The lunar astronauts also experienced a visual phenomenon of light flashes (~17/hour) when the spacecraft was dark, and tests indicated that the flashes were the result of HZE cosmic rays traversing the retina31,32. Interactions of the galactic cosmic rays with the spacecraft hull will have a large impact on the radiation exposure of astronauts. Charged particles traversing the hull or “shielding” of the ship will incur nuclear interactions that depend on the composition and thickness of the hull material. These interactions will result in fragmentation products and particles of reduced energy but higher LET that contribute to the radiation dose within the spacecraft. The average radiation dose for the seven deceased Apollo crew was 0.59 ± 0.15 cGy (range 0.18–1.14 cGy)31. If we assume representative shielding scenarios (10 g/cm2) for the Apollo Command Module and radiation quality factors drawn from the most recent International Commission on Radiological Protection33, then the average radiation dose from the galactic cosmic rays to the Apollo astronauts would be approximately 0.295 cGy, or roughly half the total dose during their lunar excursions9. Using similar assumptions, astronauts in LEO would receive 50–100 mSv over a 6–12 month stay, of which the galactic cosmic rays would account for approximately two-thirds of this total dose9. Thus, given their mean mission duration of 15.6 days, the deceased LEO astronauts would receive approximately 0.29 cGy, a galactic cosmic ray dose very similar to the Apollo lunar astronauts. Despite virtually identical estimates for galactic cosmic ray exposure, the mortality rate of LEO astronauts for CVD is significantly lower than in Apollo lunar astronauts. Furthermore, LEO astronauts do not exhibit significant differences in mortality compared to non-flight astronauts. Several factors may account for this apparent paradox. First, lunar and LEO galactic cosmic ray dose estimates were made using certain assumptions that are constantly being revised. For instance, if actual shielding levels for the Apollo missions were less than 10 g/cm2, calculated lunar galactic cosmic ray doses may be underestimates. Second, activities on the lunar surface and inside the lightly shielded Lunar Module may also include dose contributions from scattered albedo neutrons, which are relatively insignificant inside a spacecraft. And finally, lunar and deep space exposures will include dose contributions from less energetic and lighter particles. For astronauts in LEO, the relative contribution of particles with energies below the geomagnetic cutoff is lower since they will be deflected by the Earth’s magnetosphere. While it remains uncertain whether differences in absorbed dose profiles can account for the elevated lunar CVD mortality rates reported here, it is equally difficult to disregard this possibility. As a result, these findings highlight the potential adverse impact of charged particles and their unique microdosimetric properties on post-mitotic cellular structures responsible for maintaining longer-term cardiovascular health. The possibility of long-term degenerative effects of deep space travel on cardiovascular function has not been well described or substantiated. Only in the last decade, when multiple spacefaring nations and corporate entities have announced plans to embark on manned exploratory missions to Mars and prolonged habitation on the Moon, has biomedical research been directed towards identifying possible CVD risks associated with the deep space radiation environment. Consequently, there is limited information available on the effects of charged particle HZE radiation on the cardiovascular system. Results from the present study address the question of possible long-lasting interactive effects of simulated weightlessness and space radiation on vascular function. To experimentally address this question, vascular responses of resistance arteries were determined 6–7 months after the cessation of a 14-day hindlimb unloading treatment, a 1 Gy 56Fe irradiation treatment, or a treatment consisting of a combination of the two. Given that the average life-span of male C57BL/6 mice is 878 ± 10 days34, the 6–7 month period represents approximately 23% of animals’ life or roughly the equivalent of 18–20 years in humans. The data show that hindlimb unloading alone had no persistent effect to significantly diminish endothelium-dependent vasodilation, while HZE irradiation alone and in combination with unloading impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 2) through the NO signaling mechanism (Fig. 3). This decrement in NO signaling appears to be mediated primarily through greater NO scavenging by reactive oxygen species, as evidenced by higher vascular protein content (Fig. 5A,B)20,27 and activity27 of XO in peripheral and coronary arteries. These data indicate that the long-lasting effects of simulated weightlessness and space radiation on vascular endothelial function are the result of the radiation exposure and are not due to an interaction with weightlessness. As dysfunction of the vascular endothelium is central to the pathogenesis of vascular disease35,36, such adverse arterial effects could lead to the development of occlusive arterial diseases, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Although results from the present study provide new evidence that even short-term spaceflight beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere may have adverse effects on CVD mortality, there are limitations to consider. First, the sample size for cause-specific deaths among lunar astronauts is small. Therefore, caution must be used in drawing definitive conclusions regarding specific health risks. Second, although deep space radiation seems a likely cause underlying the higher proportional mortality rate due to CVD in Apollo astronauts, it remains unknown what specific factor(s) in the space environment is responsible. And third, although the HZE irradiation used in the animal studies was selected to mimic that which deep space travelers might encounter, the absorbed dose (1 Gy) and the dose rate (single exposure, 10cGy/min) would be higher and faster than that experienced by the Apollo lunar astronauts31. It would be more representative of the space environment to have the radiation exposure occur at a lower dose rate and over an extended time period. Unfortunately, that type of exposure paradigm using 56Fe ions is not currently feasible at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Despite these limitations, results from these animal studies demonstrate that space relevant irradiation induces long-lasting vascular dysfunction of the type known to presage the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease35,36. In summary, results from the present study reveal that Apollo lunar astronauts have a significantly higher mortality rate due to CVD than either the cohort of astronauts who never flew an orbital space mission or astronauts who never flew beyond LEO (Fig. 1). Moreover, the CVD mortality for lunar flight astronauts was higher than that in the age-matched US population, although this difference was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that in spite of the “healthy worker” effect, short-duration deep space travel by this highly educated, trained and physically fit group results in a significantly elevated risk of death from CVD. The major environmental factor that would appear to underlie this phenomenon is deep space radiation. Estimates indicate that the dose of galactic cosmic ray irradiation to which LEO and lunar astronauts were exposed were not greatly different. However, qualitative differences in the absorbed dose profiles resulting from the effect of the Earth’s magnetosphere to deflect less energetic and lighter galactic cosmic ray particles away from Earth may account for the lower CVD mortality rate among LEO astronauts. Animal studies also indicate that while simulated weightlessness and space-relevant irradiation interact to induce early impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation20, the only sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction is that mediated by exposure to HZE particles and not by simulated weightlessness (Fig. 2). If such results translate to the human condition, then long-term dysfunction of the vascular endothelium induced by charged HZE particles could be a major contributor to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in astronauts.",

The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4–5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation. The human experience with spaceflight has shown that space exploration comes with various health risks1,2,3. As humans contemplate manned missions to Mars or prolonged habitation on the Moon, these health risks will rise as the duration of spaceflight increases and as travel goes beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere4,5. During such interplanetary travel, astronauts will be exposed to multiple sources of ionizing radiation, including galactic cosmic rays, solar particle events, and trapped radiation in the Van Allen belts. Protons are the most abundant type of radiation in space, while heavier high atomic number and energy (HZE) ions such as 56Fe produce complex tissue damage to molecules such as DNA that challenges cellular repair and recovery6,7,8,9. Recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated increasing risk for cardiovascular disease resulting from ionizing radiation exposure10,11,12. However, these estimates are largely derived from low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation exposures such as X-rays or gamma rays, which have fundamentally different properties from charged HZE particles comprising the galactic cosmic rays. HZE ions, for example, produce greater adverse effects on cellular physiology through increased genetic alterations and perturbations to redox metabolism, leading to persistent elevations in oxidative stress13,14,15. Despite the potential to be more biologically damaging, the long-term effect of space radiation on cardiovascular health has received little attention16,17,18. Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other causes of death differ in (1) non-flight astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled outside of the Earth’s geomagnetic field and into deep space. A heightened risk for CVD among flight astronauts could be due to the direct effects of space radiation and weightlessness on the arterial vasculature. Using 56Fe ion irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HU), a terrestrial rodent model that simulates the irradiation and musculoskeletal unloading that occurs during deep space travel19,20, the secondary purpose of this study was to determine whether simulated space radiation and weightlessness independently and jointly produce long-lasting vascular dysfunction that could lead to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Results Group Characteristics and Proportional Mortality Rates The group of all flight astronauts was comprised of 5 females and 37 males, of which the LEO astronaut subgroup contained 5 females and 30 males and the Apollo lunar astronaut subgroup was comprised of 7 males. The non-flight astronauts consisted of 3 females and 32 males. Differences in the mean age at the time of selection and the time of death between all flight and non-flight astronauts or among LEO, lunar and non-flight astronauts were not significant (Table 1). Although the duration of Apollo missions ranged from 6.0–12.6 days, several of the lunar astronauts also logged time on Mercury, Gemini and Skylab missions, resulting in a total time in space of ~15 days. The total time in space and the number of missions flown did not differ between LEO and Apollo lunar astronauts (Table 1). Table 1. Astronaut characteristics.

However, when looking at the subgroup analysis the number of deaths due to CVD in Apollo lunar astronauts was almost five times greater than that in the non-flight astronauts (Fig. 1) and four times higher than in LEO astronauts. There were no differences between LEO and non-flight astronauts. All flight and non-flight astronauts that died from cardiovascular-related causes were male. Figure 1.

Relative to this 55–64 year old US population, the proportional mortality rate due to CVD was lower in the non-flight astronauts and LEO astronauts (Fig. 1). Cancer proportional mortality rate was not different between the US population and both flight and non-flight astronauts (Table 2). Proportional mortality due to accidents was higher in both flight and non-flight astronauts compared with the US population (Table 2). Finally, for all other causes of death there was a lower proportional mortality for flight, LEO and non-flight astronauts compared with the US reference population, but no differences between lunar astronauts and the 55–64 year old population (Table 2).Animal and Vessel Characteristics Following a 6–7 month recovery period from exposure to simulated weightlessness and space radiation, total body mass, muscle masses and gastrocnemius muscle feed artery characteristics were not different among groups (Table 3).

With the exception of the Apollo lunar missions, manned spaceflight has taken place exclusively in LEO where atmospheric protection from space radiation is essentially absent, but protection by the Earth’s geomagnetic field is present. Under these conditions, it has been broadly assumed that missions in LEO or short excursions to the Moon would not increase the long-term risk for CVD among astronauts16,18. Using non-flight astronauts as a comparison group, the data show that this group had a mortality rate of approximately 9% due to CVD (Fig. 1). The mortality rate for CVD among all US flight astronauts, including both LEO and Apollo lunar astronauts, was not different than that in the non-flight astronauts. However, when considered as a separate group, the Apollo lunar astronauts, the only group of humans to have traveled outside of the Earth’s protective magnetosphere, demonstrate a higher mortality rate due to CVD compared to both the cohort of astronauts that did not travel into space, as well as astronauts who remained in LEO (Fig. 1). These data suggest that human travel into deep space may be more hazardous to cardiovascular health than previously estimated. Astronaut mortality has been reported in four previous studies. In the first by Peterson et al.22, it was reported that of the 20 deceased US astronauts from 1959–1991 the causes of death were due to circulatory disease (10%), cancer (5%), accidents (80%) and other causes (5%). Using the US population as the reference group, it was found that mortality due to CVD was significantly lower in astronauts and accidental deaths were significantly higher22. A subsequent study by Hamm et al.23 focused solely on cancer-specific mortality among astronauts through 1995, and included an additional reference group of Johnson Space Center employees. This comparison group was part of a Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health initiative by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to better assess the occupational health risks of astronauts, since the health characteristics of astronauts and the overall environment in which they train at Johnson Space Center were deemed to be different from that of the general US population24. Results from this study indicated that there was not a significant difference in cancer mortality between astronauts and Johnson Space Center employees or Texas residents living in the area surrounding Johnson Space Center23. In a follow-up study by Hamm et al.25, cause-specific mortality rates beyond just cancer were examined. The only significant difference found was a higher number of accidental deaths among astronauts (69%) relative to Johnson Space Center employees (14%). Finally, in the most recent study published by Reynolds and Day26, the cause-specific mortality rates from 1980–2009 were reported in astronauts and residents of Harris County, Texas, where Johnson Space Center is located. The results indicated a lower risk of death due to CVD and cancer in astronauts versus Harris County residents, and a higher risk of death due to accidents26. Collectively, these studies indicate that the risk of death due to chronic diseases appears to be lower in astronauts, particularly those involving CVD22,26. The current analysis of mortality rates among astronauts differs from these previous studies in several important ways. The first is the reference population used to gauge the significance of cause-specific mortality rates among astronauts. The biomedical characteristics of astronauts are very different from individuals in the general population. According to the Review of NASA’s Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health by the Institute of Medicine24, astronauts have substantially higher incomes, levels of education, general fitness, and lifelong access to medical care, all of which are factors known to contribute to high levels of health and well-being. With such large baseline differences between astronauts and comparison groups, it is difficult to ascertain what specific impact spaceflight might have on astronaut health. For this reason, the Institute of Medicine recommended in 2004 that astronauts who have never flown in space be used as a reference population24; the present study is the first to incorporate non-flight astronauts as a comparison group. Consequently, current results demonstrate that previous conclusions suggesting the risk of death due to CVD is lower among flight astronauts22,26 are no longer tenable. The second unique feature of the present study is that it is the first to examine the long-term mortality risks of spaceflight in LEO and deep space. Exposure to charged particles comprising the galactic cosmic rays in deep space has the potential to elicit a number of complications in biological tissue. Recent work in rodents and cell culture has highlighted the potentially harmful effects of such exposures on the cardiovascular system20,27,28,29,30, which may translate to astronauts engaged in deep space expeditions. While traveling from LEO to the Moon and back, the Apollo lunar astronauts traversed regions of geomagnetically trapped electrons and protons known as the Van Allen belts and, depending on the duration of their mission and the specific activities in which they were engaged (e.g., lunar surface and intravehicular Command and Lunar Module activities), were continuously subjected to varying levels of high-energy cosmic rays31. Fortunately, there were no major solar particle events during any of the Apollo missions. The lunar astronauts also experienced a visual phenomenon of light flashes (~17/hour) when the spacecraft was dark, and tests indicated that the flashes were the result of HZE cosmic rays traversing the retina31,32. Interactions of the galactic cosmic rays with the spacecraft hull will have a large impact on the radiation exposure of astronauts. Charged particles traversing the hull or “shielding” of the ship will incur nuclear interactions that depend on the composition and thickness of the hull material. These interactions will result in fragmentation products and particles of reduced energy but higher LET that contribute to the radiation dose within the spacecraft. The average radiation dose for the seven deceased Apollo crew was 0.59 ± 0.15 cGy (range 0.18–1.14 cGy)31. If we assume representative shielding scenarios (10 g/cm2) for the Apollo Command Module and radiation quality factors drawn from the most recent International Commission on Radiological Protection33, then the average radiation dose from the galactic cosmic rays to the Apollo astronauts would be approximately 0.295 cGy, or roughly half the total dose during their lunar excursions9. Using similar assumptions, astronauts in LEO would receive 50–100 mSv over a 6–12 month stay, of which the galactic cosmic rays would account for approximately two-thirds of this total dose9. Thus, given their mean mission duration of 15.6 days, the deceased LEO astronauts would receive approximately 0.29 cGy, a galactic cosmic ray dose very similar to the Apollo lunar astronauts. Despite virtually identical estimates for galactic cosmic ray exposure, the mortality rate of LEO astronauts for CVD is significantly lower than in Apollo lunar astronauts. Furthermore, LEO astronauts do not exhibit significant differences in mortality compared to non-flight astronauts. Several factors may account for this apparent paradox. First, lunar and LEO galactic cosmic ray dose estimates were made using certain assumptions that are constantly being revised. For instance, if actual shielding levels for the Apollo missions were less than 10 g/cm2, calculated lunar galactic cosmic ray doses may be underestimates. Second, activities on the lunar surface and inside the lightly shielded Lunar Module may also include dose contributions from scattered albedo neutrons, which are relatively insignificant inside a spacecraft. And finally, lunar and deep space exposures will include dose contributions from less energetic and lighter particles. For astronauts in LEO, the relative contribution of particles with energies below the geomagnetic cutoff is lower since they will be deflected by the Earth’s magnetosphere. While it remains uncertain whether differences in absorbed dose profiles can account for the elevated lunar CVD mortality rates reported here, it is equally difficult to disregard this possibility. As a result, these findings highlight the potential adverse impact of charged particles and their unique microdosimetric properties on post-mitotic cellular structures responsible for maintaining longer-term cardiovascular health. The possibility of long-term degenerative effects of deep space travel on cardiovascular function has not been well described or substantiated. Only in the last decade, when multiple spacefaring nations and corporate entities have announced plans to embark on manned exploratory missions to Mars and prolonged habitation on the Moon, has biomedical research been directed towards identifying possible CVD risks associated with the deep space radiation environment. Consequently, there is limited information available on the effects of charged particle HZE radiation on the cardiovascular system. Results from the present study address the question of possible long-lasting interactive effects of simulated weightlessness and space radiation on vascular function. To experimentally address this question, vascular responses of resistance arteries were determined 6–7 months after the cessation of a 14-day hindlimb unloading treatment, a 1 Gy 56Fe irradiation treatment, or a treatment consisting of a combination of the two. Given that the average life-span of male C57BL/6 mice is 878 ± 10 days34, the 6–7 month period represents approximately 23% of animals’ life or roughly the equivalent of 18–20 years in humans. The data show that hindlimb unloading alone had no persistent effect to significantly diminish endothelium-dependent vasodilation, while HZE irradiation alone and in combination with unloading impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation (Fig. 2) through the NO signaling mechanism (Fig. 3). This decrement in NO signaling appears to be mediated primarily through greater NO scavenging by reactive oxygen species, as evidenced by higher vascular protein content (Fig. 5A,B)20,27 and activity27 of XO in peripheral and coronary arteries. These data indicate that the long-lasting effects of simulated weightlessness and space radiation on vascular endothelial function are the result of the radiation exposure and are not due to an interaction with weightlessness. As dysfunction of the vascular endothelium is central to the pathogenesis of vascular disease35,36, such adverse arterial effects could lead to the development of occlusive arterial diseases, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Although results from the present study provide new evidence that even short-term spaceflight beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere may have adverse effects on CVD mortality, there are limitations to consider. First, the sample size for cause-specific deaths among lunar astronauts is small. Therefore, caution must be used in drawing definitive conclusions regarding specific health risks. Second, although deep space radiation seems a likely cause underlying the higher proportional mortality rate due to CVD in Apollo astronauts, it remains unknown what specific factor(s) in the space environment is responsible. And third, although the HZE irradiation used in the animal studies was selected to mimic that which deep space travelers might encounter, the absorbed dose (1 Gy) and the dose rate (single exposure, 10cGy/min) would be higher and faster than that experienced by the Apollo lunar astronauts31. It would be more representative of the space environment to have the radiation exposure occur at a lower dose rate and over an extended time period. Unfortunately, that type of exposure paradigm using 56Fe ions is not currently feasible at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Despite these limitations, results from these animal studies demonstrate that space relevant irradiation induces long-lasting vascular dysfunction of the type known to presage the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease35,36. In summary, results from the present study reveal that Apollo lunar astronauts have a significantly higher mortality rate due to CVD than either the cohort of astronauts who never flew an orbital space mission or astronauts who never flew beyond LEO (Fig. 1). Moreover, the CVD mortality for lunar flight astronauts was higher than that in the age-matched US population, although this difference was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that in spite of the “healthy worker” effect, short-duration deep space travel by this highly educated, trained and physically fit group results in a significantly elevated risk of death from CVD. The major environmental factor that would appear to underlie this phenomenon is deep space radiation. Estimates indicate that the dose of galactic cosmic ray irradiation to which LEO and lunar astronauts were exposed were not greatly different. However, qualitative differences in the absorbed dose profiles resulting from the effect of the Earth’s magnetosphere to deflect less energetic and lighter galactic cosmic ray particles away from Earth may account for the lower CVD mortality rate among LEO astronauts. Animal studies also indicate that while simulated weightlessness and space-relevant irradiation interact to induce early impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation20, the only sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction is that mediated by exposure to HZE particles and not by simulated weightlessness (Fig. 2). If such results translate to the human condition, then long-term dysfunction of the vascular endothelium induced by charged HZE particles could be a major contributor to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in astronauts.Methods US Astronaut Mortality Rate Study This study consisted of two distinct populations, the deceased astronaut population and the deceased US National Population ages 55–64. A record of deceased US NASA astronauts through 2015 was obtained from NASA Johnson Space Center Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health and NASA website (http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/astrobio_former.html). Records of other NASA-US Air Force astronauts in the X-15, X-20 and Manned Orbital Laboratory programs were obtained from program summaries37. Deceased US astronauts were further grouped into flight (including LEO and Apollo lunar subgroups) or non-flight astronaut samples based on their flight activities; this allowed cause of death comparisons between the flight and non-flight groups.US Astronaut Flight Sample Deceased flight astronauts (n = 43) flew on orbital missions as part of the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Apollo-Soyuz, Skylab and Space Shuttle programs and included pilots, mission commanders, mission specialists and payload specialists. Deceased flight astronauts were further subdivided into two groups, those having flown missions in low Earth orbit (LEO, n = 36) and those having flown missions beyond LEO as part of the Apollo lunar missions (n = 7). Astronauts that perished in the Apollo 1 and STS-51L Challenger accidents but had flown on previous missions (n = 6) were classified as flight astronauts. Those US astronauts that perished in the STS-107 Columbia accident were classified as flight astronauts since all achieved orbital flight.US Astronaut Non-Flight Comparison Sample The first comparison group consisted of deceased astronauts who never flew in space or flew only suborbital flights (n = 41). These individuals included astronauts that completed astronaut training but were never assigned to a specific mission, were assigned to a subsequently cancelled missions, died prior to flying their assigned mission, flew the NASA-US Air Force’s X-15 rocket-powered aircraft, or were designated to fly on the US Air Force’s X-20 Dyna-Soar space plane or Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL). Astronauts that flew the X-15 aircraft never attained orbital spaceflight, and individuals assigned to the X-20 Dyna-Soar and MOL never flew in space as part of these programs due to their cancelation. Of the thirty-one X-15, X-20 and MOL astronauts, nine subsequently flew orbital missions as part of the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. Four of the nine are now deceased and included in the flight group; three are in the LEO group and one is in the Apollo lunar group. Astronauts who perished in the Apollo 1 and STS-51L Challenger accidents who were first-time flyers (n = 4) were categorized as non-flight astronauts for the purpose of this analysis due to not having achieved orbital flight.US National Population Comparison Sample A second comparison population consisted of the general US population. The total number of deaths in 2013 of those dying between 55–64 years of age and the number of deaths from this population subgroup due to CVD, cancer, accidents, and all other causes were used for comparison with that of the flight (including LEO and Apollo lunar subgroups) and non-flight astronaut groups. This population subgroup from the general population was used because the 55–64 year age group most closely approximates the ages of the flight and non-flight astronauts at their time of death (Table 1).Vital Statistics Cause of death was determined from death certificates in all Apollo lunar astronauts, 97% of LEO astronauts, and 49% of non-flight astronauts. In cases where death certificates were not available for review, cause of death was obtained from official NASA biographical sketches (http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/), NASA’s Astronaut Fact Book, obituaries, and other biographical records. The specific cause of death for one LEO astronaut and 6 non-flight astronauts could not be determined from any of the above sources; these astronauts were not included in the analysis for a final sample of 42 flight astronauts and 35 non-flight astronauts. Cause of death was categorized into four main categories: Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, Accident, and All Other Causes. Deaths due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, brain aneurysm, or blood clots were classified as CVD. Deaths attributed to any form of malignant neoplasms were categorized as cancer. Deaths due to unintentional injuries, including orbiter destruction and plane, automobile, motorcycle, boat and bicycle accidents, were categorized as accidents. Any other causes of death were designated in the All Other Causes category and included illnesses such as pneumonia and pancreatitis. All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for the US general population 55–64 years old in 2013 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics21.Animal Studies All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Florida State University, NASA and Brookhaven National Laboratory, conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health () Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Eighth edition, 2011). Forty-four male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), 16 weeks of age, were individually housed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory animal facility at Long Island, New York. Animals were maintained in a controlled environment (12:12 hour light-dark cycle, 24 ± 2 °C) and provided food and water ad libitum. Mice were randomized by body mass to one of four groups: control (Con, n = 11), hindlimb unloaded (HU, n = 11), total body irradiated (TBI, n = 11), and the combined TBI and HU (TBI+HU, n = 11). One week after the conclusion of the unloading treatment for the HU and TBI+HU groups, the mice in all four groups were shipped to Florida State University, individually housed in the animal vivarium under controlled environmental conditions (12:12 hour light-dark cycle, 24 ± 2 °C) and provided food and water ad libitum.Hindlimb Unloading Mice were hindlimb unloaded via tail traction for 14 days according to the methods of Morey-Holton et al. as previously described19,20,38. After the 14-day unloading treatment, animals were released from the unloading apparatus to move freely in standard cages for 6–7 months until the time to conduct the vascular experiments. Control mice were individually housed in their normal cage environment.Whole-Body Irradiation Mice were exposed to a single dose of radiation consisting of 1 Gy of 56Fe ions (600 MeV/nucleon, LET 150 keV/μm in water) at a dose rate of 10cGy/min at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory beamline at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Irradiation of TBI+HU mice took place 3 days after the initiation of hindlimb unloading while the animals remained unloaded. Sham-irradiated mice were handled in an identical fashion but were not irradiated (0 Gy).Isolated Microvessel Studies Experiments were conducted on 2 mice per day over a 5-wk period. These studies commenced after at least 6 months from the time the HU mice were released from the unloading treatment. Animals from each of the four groups were randomly selected for experimentation over the 5-wk experimental period, and one mouse from each group was studied every other experimental day. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5%/O2) and euthanized by excision of the heart. Gastrocnemius muscle feed arteries running along the superficial white portion of the gastrocnemius muscles from the left and right hindlimbs were isolated and either cannulated and prepared for in vitro experimentation or frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C for determination of protein content as previously described20,38. Additionally, the left anterior descending artery and branches off this artery (~90–220 μm inner diameter) were dissected free of the surrounding myocardium, snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C for determination of protein content.Evaluation of Vasomotor Properties In one set of studies, vasodilator responses of feed arteries to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh, 10−9–10−4 M) and endothelium-independent vasodilator Dea-NONOate (10−9–10−4 M) were assessed as previously described20,38. ACh-induced vasodilation was also evaluated following incubation with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10−5 M) and following incubation with the combination of L-NAME with COX inhibitor indomethacin (10−5 M) as previously reported20,38. Maximal diameter and medial wall thickness were determined after a 1-hr incubation period in calcium-free physiological saline buffer solution (PSS) with 10−4 M sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to allow complete smooth muscle cell relaxation. In a second set of vessels, vasoconstrictor responses were assessed through non-receptor (KCl, 10–100 mM), myogenic (increasing intraluminal pressure from 0 cm H2O up to 140 cm H2O, in 20 cm H2O increments), and receptor [α1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE, 10−9–10−4 M)] mechanisms as previously described20,39. Passive pressure-diameter responses were recorded in a similar fashion to that of the active myogenic response after vessels were incubated in calcium-free PSS with 10−4 M SNP for 1 hr.Immunoblot Analysis eNOS, SOD-1, XO and NOX-2 protein content in gastrocnemius feed arteries and coronary arteries were assessed via immunoblot analysis. Arteries were isolated, snap frozen and processed as previously described20,40. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: eNOS (1:150, BD Transduction #610296), Cu/Zn SOD-1 (1:8000, Enzo Life Sciences ADI-SOD-100-F), XO (1:1000, Abcam #109235), NOX-2 (1:1000, Abcam #129068) and β-actin (1:2000, Cell Signaling #4967). Differences in loading were normalized by expressing all data as relative densitometry units of the protein of interest versus β-actin.Statistical Analysis Proportional mortality rates were calculated as the number of deaths from a particular cause divided by the total number of deaths for that particular group or sub-group. The significance of differences in cause-specific deaths between groups was assessed with Fisher’s exact probability test. Due to this test being considered extremely conservative41, a value of P ≤ 0.10 was considered statistically significant42,43. Differences in age at the time of death and other astronaut characteristics were assessed with a one-way ANOVA and Fisher LSD post-hoc tests. For the animal studies, a one-way ANOVA and Fisher LSD post-hoc tests were used to detect differences in body, tissue and vascular characteristics. Vasomotor responses were evaluated using repeated-measures ANOVAs to detect differences between experimental groups and drug doses or pressure changes. All values are presented as means ± SE. A value of P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Additional Information How to cite this article: Delp, M. D. et al.

    "abstract": "Abstract Coronary microvascular function and blood flow responses during acute exercise are impaired in the aged heart but can be restored by exercise training. Coronary microvascular resistance is directly dependent on vascular smooth muscle function in coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized that age impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that exercise training restores contractile function and reverses age-induced phenotypic alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and old Fischer 344 rats underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. At the end of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile function were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular smooth muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle in the arteriolar wall. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training improved contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and expression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from old rats. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype. Late-life exercise training reverses contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and restores a young phenotype to the vascular smooth muscle.

Copyright © 2018 the American Physiological Society  Copyright notice ID: 5866446 PMID: 29025901 Abstract Coronary microvascular function and blood flow responses during acute exercise are impaired in the aged heart but can be restored by exercise training. Coronary microvascular resistance is directly dependent on vascular smooth muscle function in coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized that age impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that exercise training restores contractile function and reverses age-induced phenotypic alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and old Fischer 344 rats underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. At the end of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile function were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular smooth muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle in the arteriolar wall. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training improved contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and expression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from old rats. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype. Late-life exercise training reverses contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and restores a young phenotype to the vascular smooth muscle. Keywords: adiponectin, contractile phenotype, secretory phenotype, vascular smooth muscle, vasoconstrictionINTRODUCTION Coronary blood flow regulation is achieved by multiple regulatory responses of the coronary resistance vasculature, including myogenic vasoconstriction and flow-induced and metabolic vasodilation (28, 51). Previous work from our laboratory (13) indicates that age impairs coronary blood flow responses to acute exercise, and this reduction of functional hyperemia is accompanied by diminished vasodilatory and contractile responses of coronary resistance arterioles (11, 17, 24, 35). Age-induced loss of vasodilatory function in coronary arterioles is largely attributable to increased oxidant stress and loss of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation that can be restored with exercise training (17, 18, 24, 36). Similarly, Hanna et al. (11) reported that exercise training reversed age-induced impairment of myogenic responsiveness and attenuated age-related remodeling in coronary arterioles of aged rats; however, the cellular mechanisms that underlie age- and exercise training-induced alterations of vascular smooth muscle function in coronary arterioles have not been identified. Vascular smooth muscle remodeling, involving cell proliferation and hypertrophy, is well-documented in large conduit arteries with age and disease (45); however, the impact of aging on vascular smooth muscle proliferation in coronary arterioles has not been investigated. Similarly, the vascular smooth muscle of aged large arteries has been shown to convert to a phenotype characterized by increased secretion of proteins and molecules that promote vascular degeneration through chronic inflammation and extracellular matrix degradation (45, 49); however, whether a phenotypic switch occurs in the vascular smooth muscle of aged coronary arterioles is not known. Dedifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells lose myofilaments and their contractile ability while also exhibiting a high rate of proliferation and production of extracellular matrix proteins (42, 45), alterations that could contribute to age-induced contractile dysfunction in the coronary microvasculature (11). In this study, we investigated whether the vascular smooth muscle of aging coronary arterioles transitions to a secretory phenotype that manifests in contractile dysfunction. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that adiponectin inhibits proliferation and promotes differentiation and maintenance of a contractile phenotype in vascular smooth muscle (3, 6, 8); therefore, we also investigated whether age and/or exercise training alter adiponectin signaling in coronary arterioles.METHODS Animals. Young (3–4 mo) and old (20–21 mo) male Fisher 344 rats were obtained from the National Institute on Aging. All rats were housed in a temperature/light-controlled environment and given access to standard rat chow and water ad libitum. Rats were randomly assigned to young sedentary (n = 44), young exercise-trained (n = 30), old sedentary (n = 39), or old exercise-trained (n = 29) groups. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at University of Florida and Florida State University and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (8th ed., 2011).Exercise training. Rats were habituated to treadmill exercise by walking on the treadmill at 15 m/min (0° incline), 5 min/day, for 3 days. Exercise-trained rats underwent 10–12 wk of treadmill exercise training. Exercise-trained rats exercised on the treadmill at 15 m/min (15° incline), 5 days/wk, for 10–12 wk. The duration of exercise was increased during the initial 4 wk until a 60-min duration was reached. The rats continued to exercise 5 days/wk for 60 min/day for the remainder of the 10- to 12-wk training period (11). Only rats that completed the entire 10-wk training protocol were studied. Exercise-trained rats were euthanized ≥24 h after the last exercise bout to exclude acute effects of exercise (37). To determine the efficacy of the training protocol, the soleus muscle was stored at −80°C for determination of citrate synthase activity, a mitochondrial enzyme and marker of muscle oxidative potential, according to the method of Srere (38).Body composition. Body composition was assessed using time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance with a lean fat analyzer (Bruker Optics, The Woodlands, TX) at 10 wk. The method was described previously (41). Two measurements were performed from each animal, and the average was reported.Microvessel preparation. Rats were weighed and anesthetized with 3% isoflurane-O2 mix and killed by excision of the heart, which was immediately placed in cold (4°C), filtered physiological saline solution (PSS) containing 145 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.0 mM CaCl2, 1.17 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 5.0 mM glucose, 2.0 mM pyruvate, 0.02 mM EDTA, 3.0 mM MOPS buffer, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Coronary resistance arterioles were isolated from the left anterior descending artery distribution. In some arterioles, the endothelium was removed by passing 5 ml of air through the lumen without causing damage to vascular smooth muscle. Arterioles were then cannulated on pipettes and pressurized to 60 cmH2O (corresponding to an intraluminal pressure of 40–50 mmHg) in a Lucite chamber that contained warm (37°C), filtered PSS. The chamber was then placed on an inverted microscope equipped with a video camera and micrometer to measure intraluminal diameter. Coronary arterioles with no leaks were warmed to 37°C and allowed to equilibrate for ~1 h or until developing ≥15% spontaneous tone. The bathing solution was changed every 20 min during the course of each experiment. Lack of vasodilation to 50 µM acetylcholine confirmed removal of the endothelium. At the end of all experiments, arterioles were placed in Ca2+-free PSS with 100 µM sodium nitroprusside to determine maximal diameter. Development of spontaneous tone was expressed as the percentage constriction relative to maximal diameter and calculated as follows: spontaneous tone (%)=(Dmax−Ds)/Dmax×100, where Dmax is the maximal inner diameter recorded at a pressure of 60 cmH2O under Ca2+-free conditions and Ds is the steady-tone baseline diameter.Evaluation of vasoconstrictor responsiveness. To determine receptor-independent and -dependent vasoconstrictor responsiveness, concentration-response curves to K+ and the thromboxane analog, U46619 (1e−9 to 1e−4 M), were assessed. Responses to U46619 were assessed in both denuded and intact coronary arterioles. Reponses to depolarizing concentrations of K+ (10–100 mM, isotonic substitution for Na+) were assessed in denuded coronary arterioles as previously described (35).Immunohistochemistry. To determine whether aging and exercise training alter smooth muscle cell phenotype, coronary arterioles were cannulated, pressurized to 60 cmH2O, warmed to 37°C, incubated in Ca2+-free PSS and 100 µM sodium nitroprusside for 1 h, and then fixed in 50% Bouin solution. Fixed arterioles were frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound and stored at −80°C until use. Five-micrometer sections of coronary arterioles were cut on a cryostat. After washing with PSS, arteriolar sections were blocked using 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies against smooth muscle α-actin (1:50; cat. no. ab18147; Abcam) and phospho-histone H3 (PHH3; 1:100; #9701; Cell Signaling Technology) at 4°C for overnight. After washing, species-specific anti-IgG (Texas Red, cat. no. ab7059, Abcam; FITC, cat. no. ab6785, Abcam) were added at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. After final washing and blotting of any excess PSS, mounting media containing 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; cat. no. P36962; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was applied to identify TA-rich regions of DNA in nuclei, and images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (BX43; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The area of smooth muscle α-actin staining was determined via color threshold using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). DAPI-stained nuclei were identified by a MATLAB program based on a threshold value for intensity and size. Nuclei specifically within the smooth muscle cross-sectional area (smooth muscle nuclei) were identified by superimposing DAPI and smooth muscle-stained images. Proliferating smooth muscle nuclei were determined based on positive staining for PHH3 via color threshold. Proliferating state was assessed by calculating the ratio of PHH3-positive smooth muscle nuclei to total number of smooth muscle nuclei. The average of the values obtained from analysis of four consecutive cross-sections per vessel was calculated and used for statistical analysis.Adiponectin receptor 1. To determine whether age and exercise training alter expression of adiponectin receptor 1 subtype in coronary arterioles, 5-µm frozen cross-sections of arterioles were thawed and washed with phosphate-buffered saline before adding the blocking solution of 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the arterioles were incubated with primary antibodies against adiponectin receptor 1 (Anti-Adiponectin Receptor 1; 1:50; cat. no. ab126611; Abcam) at 4°C overnight. After PBS washes, species-specific anti-IgG (FITC; cat. no. ab6785; Abcam) was added at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, DAPI (cat. no. P36962; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added, and images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (BX43; Olympus). To exclude adventitial staining, a region of interest for adiponectin receptor 1 staining was established manually using ImageJ after isolating the images for green fluorescence only. For each section, the average pixel intensity in the region of interest was obtained (ImageJ). Background subtraction was performed by subtracting the average pixel intensity obtained in an adjacent section from the same vessel that had treated in the same manner as the stained sections but in the absence of primary or secondary antibody. The average of the values obtained from analysis of three to five cross-sections per vessel was calculated and used for statistical analysis.Immunoblotting. The differentiation state of smooth muscle cells was determined by assessing expression of smooth muscle-specific contractile proteins smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms 1 (SM1) and 2 (SM2) in coronary arterioles (20, 22). The levels of downstream effectors of adiponectin, AMP-activated kinase (2, 6, 8, 14, 29, 32, 39) and ribosomal protein S6 (12, 33), were assessed. Coronary arterioles (n = 5/rat) branching from the left anterior descending artery were dissected and stored at −80°C until use. Pooled vessels from each rat were lysed in 25 µl of 1× sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6 M urea, 160 mM DTT, 0.1% bromophenol blue) and loaded (10-µg total protein) to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins then were transferred to Hybond ECL membranes (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). After 1-h blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies for the following proteins: SM1 (0.6 µg/ml), SM2 (0.6 µg/ml), S6 ribosomal protein (1:250; #2217; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (1:250; #2215; Cell Signaling Technology), AMP-activated kinase-α (AMPK; 1:250; #2532; Cell Signaling Technology), and β-actin (1:250; #4967; Cell Signaling Technology). After washing, membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000; #7074; Cell Signaling Technology) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Peroxidase activity was determined using SuperSignal West Femto (Pierce), and images were analyzed using ImageJ. Loading differences were normalized by expressing all data as relative densitometry units of the protein of interest vs. β-actin.Adiponectin ELISA. To determine whether aging and exercise training alter global circulating level of adiponectin, ELISA (cat. no. 22-ADPRT-E01; ALPCO) was used for quantitative determination of adiponectin in rat serum. Blood was collected in serum separator tubes from the tail vein at the time of death. Serum was obtained by centrifuge at 4°C for 5 min and kept in −80°C until use. ELISA was performed following manufacturer’s instruction, and the plate was read on SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices).Data analysis and statistics. Vasoconstrictor responses were expressed as percentage constriction according to the following formula: constriction (%)=[(Db–Ds)/Db]×100, where Db is the baseline diameter immediately before addition of the first dose of vasoconstrictor agonist and Ds is the steady-state diameter measured after addition of each dose. Vessel responses to U46619 and K+ were evaluated using three-way ANOVA (age, exercise training, and dose/time) with repeated measurement (dose/time). Group differences in animal and vessel characteristics, body composition, circulating adiponectin, and values obtained from immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses were assessed by two-way ANOVA (age and exercise training). Post hoc analyses were performed using Bonferroni test for pairwise comparisons if either significant main effects or significant interactions were found. Statistical significance was defined as P ≤ 0.05. All data are presented as means ± SE.RESULTS Animal and vessel characteristics. Body weight increased with age (Table 1). Exercise training reduced body weight in both young and old rats. Both heart weight and left ventricular weight increased with age (Table 1). Heart weight-to-body weight ratio increased with exercise training in young and old rats. Exercise training increased soleus muscle citrate synthase activity by 20.9% in young rats [23.2 ± 1.1 vs. 19.1 ± 0.5 µmol·min−1·g−1; young exercise-trained group (YET) vs. young sedentary group (YSED)] and by 30.3% [18.5 ± 0.9 vs. 13.6 ± 0.7 µmol·min−1·g−1; old exercise-trained group (OET) vs. old sedentary group (OSED)] in old rats, confirming the efficacy of the exercise training regimen, as previously demonstrated (11, 36). Coronary arterioles that were <150 µm in diameter were isolated from the left ventricular free wall in all rats, and there were no significant differences in arteriolar diameters between groups. Spontaneous tone, assessed before addition of any contractile agents, did not differ between arterioles from young and old rats. Exercise training enhanced spontaneous tone in both young and old rats, consistent with our (11) previously reported observations. Table 1.

Vasoconstrictor responses to U46619. To determine initially the effects of aging and exercise training on contractile function of coronary arterioles, we assessed vasoconstrictor responses to the thromboxane analog, U46619, in intact coronary arterioles. Aging abolished vasoconstrictor responses to U46619 (Fig. 1A). Exercise training completely restored vasoconstrictor responses to U46619 in intact coronary arterioles from old rats, whereas contractile responsiveness to U46619 was reduced after exercise training in intact arterioles from young rats (Fig. 1A). To assess specifically contractile responses of the vascular smooth muscle, we evaluated contractile responses to U46619 in coronary arterioles denuded of endothelium. Removal of the endothelium reduced contractile responses to U46619 in arterioles from YSED rats but did not affect contractile responses in arterioles from OSED rats (Fig. 1, A vs. B). As in intact arterioles, aging nearly eliminated contractile responses to U46619 (Fig. 1B), and exercise training reversed the age-induced loss of U46619-mediated contractile responses of smooth muscle (Fig. 1B). In denuded arterioles from young rats, exercise training tended to reduce responsiveness to low concentrations of U46619, but the overall concentration-response relationship was not different between arterioles from YSED and YET rats. These data are consistent with an age-induced reduction of contractile responses in arteriolar smooth muscle and a training-induced reversal of this loss of contractile function. Fig. 1.

Values are means ± SE; n = no. of rats. *Effect of age (P ≤ 0.05). †Effect of exercise training (P ≤ 0.05).Vasoconstrictor responses to KCl. To assess the effects of age and exercise training on receptor-independent vasoconstriction of the smooth muscle in coronary arterioles, we evaluated constrictor responses to increasing concentrations of potassium chloride (KCl; substituted for sodium chloride to maintain osmolarity and ionic balance). Aging decreased vasoconstrictor responses to KCl in denuded coronary arterioles from OSED rats relative to YSED rats (Fig. 2). In arterioles from old rats, exercise training restored vasoconstriction to KCl to a level not different from that of arterioles from YSED rats. In arterioles from young rats, exercise training did not alter responsiveness to KCl. These data further indicate that aging reduces contractile function of coronary arterioles, independent of membrane receptor signaling. Fig. 2.

With age, vascular smooth muscle in coronary arterioles displayed a synthetic, dedifferentiated phenotype. Smooth muscle myosin, SM1, decreased in coronary arterioles with age (Fig. 3A). Exercise training increased SM1 protein levels in arterioles from old rats, although a significant difference persisted between SM1 proteins in arterioles from YET and OET rats. SM2 levels were similar among all four groups of rats (Fig. 3B). Age increased levels of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) in coronary arterioles (Fig. 4A). Exercise training decreased the level of rpS6 in arterioles from old rats (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation of rpS6 also increased with age but was reduced by exercise training in arterioles from old rats (Fig. 4B). Exercise training did not change total or phosphorylated rpS6 in arterioles from young rats. Fig. 3.

Figure 5A shows representative cross-sections of coronary arterioles demonstrating DAPI-stained nuclei (a, e, i, and m), smooth muscle α-actin staining (b, f, j, and n), and phospho-histone H3-stained nuclei (PHH3; c, g, k, and o). Aging reduced the number of nuclei per cross-sectional unit of vascular smooth muscle (Fig. 5B). After exercise training, the age-related difference in number of nuclei in the media of the arteriolar wall was no longer detectable (Fig. 5B). Aging increased smooth muscle cell proliferation (Fig. 5C). Exercise training decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation in arterioles from old but not young rats (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5.

During the 10-wk training period, YSED rats gained weight, whereas OSED rats lost weight (Fig. 6A). Compared with YSED rats, YET gained significantly less weight (Fig. 6A). OET rats lost significantly more weight compared with OSED in the 10-wk training period (Fig. 6A). Fat mass and percentage of fat mass increased with age (Fig. 6, B and C). Absolute lean mass increased with age (Fig. 6D), but percentage of lean mass decreased with age (Fig. 6E). Exercise training reduced the percentage of fat mass (Fig. 6C) and increased the percentage of lean mass in both young and old rats (Fig. 6E). Fig. 6.

Values are means ± SE; n = no. of rats. *Effect of age (P ≤ 0.05). †Effect of exercise training (P ≤ 0.05).Age decreased circulating adiponectin (Fig. 7A). Exercise training increased circulating adiponectin in both young and old rats (Fig. 7A). Expression of AMPK, which is activated by adiponectin in vascular smooth muscle (8), was decreased by >50% in denuded coronary arterioles from aged rats (Fig. 7B). Exercise training increased AMPK levels in coronary arterioles from old rats Fig. 7B); however, the levels in arterioles from old exercise-trained rats did not reach those of arterioles from young rats. Exercise training did not alter AMPK levels in arterioles from young rats (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7. Open in a new tab A: circulating adiponectin in YSED, OSED, YET, and OET rats.

AU, arbitrary units.Age decreased R1 adiponectin receptor subtype (AdipoR1) receptor levels (Fig. 7, C and D). Exercise training did not alter AdipoR1 levels in coronary arterioles from old rats. Surprisingly, exercise training decreased AdipoR1 levels in coronary arterioles from young rats (Fig. 7, C and D).DISCUSSION Our (11, 23, 35) previous work has shown that myogenic constriction and contractile responses to endothelin are impaired in coronary arterioles with advancing age. Our current findings confirm that contractile responses of coronary arterioles decline with age, but the loss of contractile function can be restored with late-life exercise training. Age reduces both thromboxane receptor-mediated vasoconstriction and receptor-independent constriction mediated by depolarizing concentrations of potassium chloride. Additionally, both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent vasoconstrictor responses were improved after late-life exercise training, suggesting that exercise training restores function of the intracellular contractile mechanisms in the vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles. These effects of age and exercise training on vasoconstrictor responses were also present in denuded arterioles, supporting the conclusion that late-life exercise training alters contractile function of arteriolar smooth muscle independent of changes in the endothelium. Importantly, our data indicate that an age-induced shift away from a differentiated, contractile smooth muscle phenotype toward a secretory, synthetic phenotype underlies contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles, but this phenotypic shift can be reversed by late-life exercise training. Here, we confirm our (11) previous work in which we found that exercise training reversed age-related thickening of the medial wall in coronary arterioles and ameliorated myogenic responses of coronary arterioles from aged rats. We (11) reported that age induces remodeling of the coronary arteriolar wall as evidenced by an increase in wall-to-lumen ratio that is accompanied by reduced wall stiffness but without a change in the collagen-to-elastin ratio. We now report that with age, the vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles undergoes a loss of contractile protein expression and an increase in expression of ribosomal protein S6, a key synthetic protein, suggesting that the increase in wall thickness that occurs with age in these arterioles results from a phenotypic switch in which the vascular smooth muscle cells lose contractile stiffness and become increasingly synthetic and hypertrophic. In large arteries, a similar phenotypic switch to a synthetic, secretory phenotype of vascular smooth muscle occurs with age and is accompanied by increased medial proliferation (10, 43, 44, 46); however, in large arteries, increased collagen secretion is a significant contributor to the age-related increase in wall stiffness (16). Importantly, in resistance arterioles that are critical for regulation of coronary blood flow distribution, the switch from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype in the vascular smooth muscle corresponds to a loss of functional contractility, possibly contributing to the microvascular dysfunction that occurs in the coronary circulation with age (13). The previously reported medial thickening and reduction of stiffness in aged coronary arterioles (11) may result, in part, from a shift to a synthetic phenotype that lacks stiffness due to a reduction of contractile elements in the smooth muscle cells, per se (Fig. 3). The level of contractile protein SM1 was reduced in coronary arterioles by aging. Dedifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells in a synthetic state demonstrate an extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and a large Golgi complex, synthesizing extracellular matrix proteins and new proteins for cell proliferation (4). In addition to decreasing contractile protein expression, aging increased the levels of rpS6, an important regulator of protein synthesis and cell size (33), and also increased phosphorylation of rpS6 in the vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles. Late-life exercise training reversed these age-induced phenotypic changes in the smooth muscle and restored contractile function in aged arterioles. Indolfi et al. (15) demonstrated that exercise training reduced vascular smooth muscle proliferation and restenosis of common carotid arteries after balloon angioplasty and stenting; however, to our knowledge, this is the first report that exercise training can restore a differentiated, contractile phenotype in the smooth muscle of the aged vascular wall. In our (11) previous work, the increase in wall-to-lumen ratio that occurred with age was reversed by exercise training. In humans, bicycle exercise training has been reported to induce a significant and gradual decrease in wall thickness and wall-to-lumen ratio in both the femoral and carotid arteries, suggesting that exercise training can lead to remodeling of the arterial wall through a systemic mechanism (40). It is possible that age- and exercise training-induced changes in blood pressure could contribute to vascular remodeling; however, we (13) have previously found that neither age nor exercise training altered blood pressure in Fischer 344 rats. Therefore, to investigate one potential systemic mechanism that may contribute to the age- and exercise training-induced phenotypic shifts in the vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles, we studied circulating adiponectin and its downstream effector, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Kim et al. (19) demonstrated that increased body weight and increased abdominal visceral fat were important predictors of decreased serum adiponectin concentration in nondiabetic, obese aged subjects. In both humans and in animal models, weight loss and exercise training increase circulating adiponectin (9, 21, 27, 47). This inverse relationship between body fat and circulating adiponectin was confirmed by our results in which body fat increased in old rats, whereas circulating adiponectin decreased with advancing age. In accordance with reports in the literature, we found that exercise training reduced body fat but increased circulating adiponectin in both young and old rats. Adiponectin is produced in various tissues, including adipose tissue, cardiac myocytes, aorta, and vascular smooth muscle (8, 25, 30, 39). Adiponectin has been reported to induce differentiation of vascular smooth muscle via AMPKα2-mediated inhibition of molecular target of rapamycin and its effector, S6 kinase-1, which phosphorylates rpS6 (8). Adiponectin attenuates transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblast-like cells that contribute to vascular calcification and arterial plaque formation (50) through its action on the AMPK-molecular target of rapamycin signaling, and serum adiponectin levels negatively correlate with the degree of coronary artery calcification (26). We found that AMPK protein levels decreased in coronary arterioles with age, suggesting that the age-related reduction in systemic adiponectin as well as reduced AMPK signaling may contribute to the phenotypic changes that occurred in vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles with age. Two adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, as well as T-cadherin bind adiponectin and are expressed in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle (1, 34). AdipoR1 is upregulated by exercise training in soleus muscle of obese rats (5). Exercise training-induced hippocampal neurogenesis has been linked to adiponectin signaling through AdipoR1 (48). In contrast, deficiency of AdipoR1 did not affect vascular recovery from peripheral ischemia, whereas mice deficient in AdipoR2 displayed a marked impairment of revascularization in hindlimb ischemia (31). Our results indicate that a decrease in AdipoR1 occurred with age in the wall of coronary arterioles; however, exercise training did not increase AdipoR1 in wall of coronary arterioles from old rats. Surprisingly, AdipoR1 levels decreased with exercise training in coronary arterioles from young rats. It is possible that these age- and exercise training-induced changes in AdipoR1 occur in conjunction with changes in AdipoR2, which we did not investigate. It is also possible that the high levels of circulating adiponectin that were found in young, exercise-trained rats leads to downregulation and/or altered distribution of AdipoR1 in the vascular wall. These arteriolar cross-sections contain both endothelium and vascular smooth muscle, and the levels of AdipoR1 in these respective cells may change in a directionally similar manner with age and exercise. Alternatively, the changes in AdipoR1 levels may be directionally opposite in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle and may be related to the reduction of endothelium-mediated constriction to U46619 that occurred with exercise training in arterioles from young, but not old, rats. Future work will need to address the role of local adiponectin signaling in arterioles and cell-specific adaptations of adiponectin signaling that occur in arterioles with age and exercise training. In summary, age impairs contractile responses of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the arteriolar smooth muscle toward a secretory, synthetic phenotype in which expression of contractile proteins is reduced. Late-life exercise training reverses contractile impairment and restores a younger, contractile phenotype to the smooth muscle of coronary arterioles. Reduction of circulating adiponectin and decreased local adiponectin signaling may contribute to phenotypic changes that occur in the smooth muscle of coronary arterioles with age and exercise training.GRANTS This study was supported by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Grants R01-HL-077224 (J.

    "abstract": "Abstract Astronauts are reported to have experienced some impairment in visual acuity during their mission on the International Space Station (ISS) and after they returned to Earth. There is emerging evidence that changes in vision may involve alterations in ocular structure and function. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 12) were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) “Kibo” facility on the ISS. The flight mice lived either under an ambient microgravity condition (µg) or in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1 g artificial gravity (µg + 1 g). Habitat control (HC) and vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the µg group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups (p < 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in µg mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more significant changes in regulated protein expression in the µg group relative to that in the µg + 1 g group. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes. These retinal cellular responses may affect blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, visual acuity, and impact the potential risk of developing late retinal degeneration.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Approximately 30% of astronauts on short-term (~2 week) Space Shuttle flights and 60% on long-duration (~6 month) missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are reported to have experienced some impairment in distant or near visual acuity [1]. Previous studies of rodents also show that environmental conditions associated with spaceflight and simulated microgravity induce alterations in retinal structure and function [2,3,4]. Retinal damage and degeneration can occur as a result of multiple factors, including aging, ischemia, fluctuation in oxygen tension, oxidative stress, and increased intraocular pressure. Our previous data from Space Shuttle studies showed a significant increase of apoptosis in retinal cells of flight mice compared to ground controls [2], which could lead to morphologic changes and impairment of retinal function. However, the pathophysiological consequences and cellular mechanisms of stress stimuli, especially those associated with a spaceflight environment, in facilitating retinal damage are less studied and remain unclear. Data on the response of biochemical systems to altered gravity is very limited in animal studies [5]. Some lines of evidence suggest that one of the mechanisms involved in response to spaceflight, including changes in the gravity vector, is likely due to oxidative stress [2,6,7]. Studies have shown that exposure to microgravity during spaceflights is associated with elevations in oxidative stress and production of lipid peroxidation in both humans and rodents [8,9]. However, our knowledge about the duration or dose of microgravity exposure needed to induce oxidative stress or alterations in retinal structure and function is extremely limited. For example, one study has shown that even transient exposure to microgravity produced by parabolic flight can cause alterations in retinal vasculature to occur [1]. One means to address the impact of microgravity conditions is through the application of artificial gravity (AG) during spaceflight. Creating AG by centrifugal force makes it possible to have a partial gravity or Earth-like gravity (1 g) control in space, where all other environmental conditions associated with spaceflight are present. A newly developed mouse habitat cage unit (HCU) by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been installed in the Centrifuge-equipped Biological Experiment Facility (CBEF) on board the ISS [10]. This rodent centrifugation capability provides opportunities to compare the effectiveness of AG prescription under spaceflight conditions. Since the HCU can reproduce Earth-like gravity, it can be used to test the effectiveness of AG to mitigate the effects of microgravity on physiological systems [11]. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of spaceflight on oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells and to identify spaceflight-induced changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the application of 1 g AG during spaceflight could mitigate any detrimental effects of microgravity on the retina. We hypothesized that spaceflight would induce elevations in oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells, as well as alter ocular proteins associated with apoptosis, cell repair, inflammation and metabolic function. We further hypothesized that the application of 1 g AG would mitigate these changes.",
    "methods": "4. Material and Methods 4.1. Spaceflight and Mouse Condition Twelve male 9-week old C57BL/6 male mice, obtained from a US breeding colony, were launched 18 July 2016, at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a SpaceX-9 rocket for the 35-day MHU-1 mission to the ISS. The animals were housed in the mouse HCU located in the JAXA “Kibo” facility on the ISS. The 12 flight mice were subdivided into two groups. The first group of flight mice (n = 6) were exposed to ambient microgravity conditions (µg group), while the second group of flight mice (n = 6) were exposed to continuous artificial Earth gravity (µg + 1 g group) while they were in the HCU. AG was achieved through the use of a short-arm centrifuge for the duration of their stay on the ISS. The flight mice were then returned live to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 26 August 2016. It took approximately 40 h for the mice to be recovered in the Pacific Ocean, brought to shore and transported to the testing and processing laboratory located in San Diego, California on 28 August 2016. The spaceflight mice were then euthanized and their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. Ground control mouse studies were completed in Japan after the return of the flight mice. Control mice (habitat controls, n = 6; vivarium controls, n = 6) were acquired on 31 August 2016 from a breeding colony in Japan and shipped to the JAXA animal facility in Tsukuba, Japan. HC mice were acclimated to the water lixit system and the same special food bar diet as the space flown mice were fed. They were first housed in the transportation cage unit (TCU) to simulate launch and flight to the ISS, and then placed in the HCUs to simulate the housing conditions experienced by µg mice on the ISS. They were again placed in the TCU to simulate the return to Earth flight. The control mouse dissections took place on 3 November 2016. Control mouse eye tissue was then shipped to the US for analysis. All mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. A detailed description of the flight schedule and mouse information has been previously reported [11]. The Loma Linda University (LLU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was consulted, but no protocol was required since only archived frozen and fixed tissues were obtained after euthanasia. However, animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Tsukuba (No. 16-048), Explora Biolabs (Study Number: EB15-010) on 23 May 2016, JAXA (Protocol Number: 016-014B) on 2 June 2016 and NASA (Protocol Number: NAS-15-004-Y1) on 31 May 2016, and the research with vertebrate animals are done in strict accordance with guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America. 4.2. Dissecting and Preservation of Mouse Eyes after Spaceflight Within 2 days of splashing down, mice were euthanized and their eyes were harvested. The posterior half of the right eyecup containing the retina layer, optic disc and a short segment of the optic nerve was placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. 4.3. Immunohistochemistry Assays and Histology Six µm sections were cut through each eye, and sections were roughly 100 µm apart providing 10 sections per eye for analysis. To characterize apoptosis, 5 sections were subjected to a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized in Histo-Clear, then permeabilized in proteinase K solution. Stained sections were evaluated using the DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (catalog no. G3250, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (catalog no: DL-11721, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) at a 1:100 dilution for 30 min at room temperature to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). Sections were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ, USA). TUNEL-positive cells were identified by green fluorescence, vascular endothelium were identified with red fluorescence. TUNEL-positive cells that were laid within red lectin-labeled endothelium were identified as TUNEL-positive endothelial cells. For quantitative analysis, the total number of TUNEL-positive endothelial cells in the retina were determined in 5 sections of each eye. The area of the retina was measured on digital microphotographs using ImageJ counting plugin 1.41 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), and the density profiles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic positive cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. Immunofluorescence staining for an oxidative damage marker on ocular sections was also performed using an anti-4-HNE antibody. Five sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody (catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) at 4 °C for 2 h followed by a donkey anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. A21206, Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. To determine 4-HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on each section and calculated using ImageJ software. Once the green channel was separated from the red channel in an image, fluorescence intensities from the areas of interest were measured using the integral/density feature in the ImageJ program and data were extracted and averaged within the group. Fluorescence was averaged across 5 retinas per group in retinal nuclear layers. Data were normalized with respect to controls. The values were represented as fold changes over controls. 4.4. Mass Spectrometry Protein expression profiles of ocular tissue containing the retina were determined in eighteen mice (n = 6/group) from three sample groups: µg, µg + 1 g, and HC, using high resolution mass spectrometry. Five micrograms of protein lysate were resolved by a 4–20% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE (Life Technologies Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). The gel was sliced into 24 gel slices that were 2 mm thick for each sample. Gel slices were destained in 50% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA), 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), followed by reduction in 10 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (Pierce, Dallas, TX, USA) and alkylation in 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel slices were then dehydrated in acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by addition of 100 ng porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega Corp.) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 37 °C for 12–16 h. Peptide products were then acidified in 0.1% formic acid (Pierce). Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase Jupiter Proteo resin (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) on a 100 × 0.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity Ultra Performance LC™ (UPLC™) system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Peptides were eluted using a 30 min gradient from 97:3 to 60:40 buffer A:B ratio. (Buffer A = 0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile; buffer B = 0.1% formic acid, 90% acetonitrile). Eluted peptides were ionized by electrospray (1.9 kV) followed by MS/MS analysis using collision-induced dissociation on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS data were acquired using the Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance spectrometry (FTMS) analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 60,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 m/z. MS/MS data were acquired for the top 15 peaks from each MS scan using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with a normalized collision energy of 35.0. 4.5. Data Analysis Proteins were identified by searching the UniProtKB database (2017-03 release; restricted to Mus musculus; 81,557 entries) using the Andromeda search engine in MaxQuant (version 1.5.7.4, Max Planck Institute of biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Search parameters were as follows: trypsin digestion with up to three missed cleavages; fixed modification of carbamidomethyl of cysteine; variable modifications of oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus; first search set to 5 ppm precursor ion tolerance and the main search was set to 3 ppm; selected label-free quantitation with iBAQ with a minimum ratio of 1. A contaminants database was used for the first search to identify commonly identified contaminants. The MaxQuant iBAQ values for each sample were converted to relative iBAQ (riBAQ) intensities by dividing the iBAQ intensity for each protein by the sum of all iBAQ intensities for all proteins identified in the sample. The median of all relative iBAQ intensities for each sample was then used to normalize between the samples. The adjusted riBAQ intensities were then imported into Perseus (version 1.5.6.0, Max Planck Institute of biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Perseus was used to log2 transform the data and impute the missing values using a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2 standard deviations. Non-parametric Mann–Whitney U tests were used to compare habitat control with the µg and µg + 1 g groups separately. The p-values were corrected by Benjamini–Hochberg to account for multiple testing. Fold changes were also calculated for each comparison. Proteins that were significant by the FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and that had a fold change greater than 2 were considered to be differentially expressed. The heat maps were generated using the Euclidean distance metric and the data was standardized by the mean and standard deviation before performing hierarchical clustering with pheatmap R package (maintained by Raivo Kolde, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Volcano plots were generated using R. These proteins were then analyzed using the IPA pathway analysis. 4.6. Statistical Analysis The results obtained from all experiments were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc multiple-comparison test (Sigma Plot for Windows, version 13.0; Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Data are shown as mean ± standard error (SEM).",
    "results": "2. Results 2.1. Apoptosis in Retinal Endothelial Cells Following Spaceflight Immunocytochemical analysis by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that spaceflight conditions induced significant apoptosis in the retinal endothelial cells (Figure 1A) relative to that in the habitat and vivarium control conditions and in the AG (µg + 1 g) condition. Our quantitative assessment revealed that the density of apoptotic cells in the retina was the highest in the µg group, and was 64% greater than that in the habitat control group (Figure 1B). Figure 1. Open in a new tab (A) Apoptosis based on terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining of 9-week old male C57BL/6 mouse retinal tissue. Groups (n = 6): Vivarium control, habitat control, µg, and µg + 1 g. TUNEL-positive cells were identified with green fluorescence, the endothelium was stained with lectin (red).

The vessel was stained with tomato lectin (green). Scale bar = 50 µm; (D) the averages fluorescence intensity for 4-HNE activity were measured and calculated using the ImageJ program. Fluorescence was averaged across 5 retinas per group. Values are represented with mean + SEM. No significant differences among groups were detected. 2.2. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) Immunoreactivity Following Spaceflight Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in lipid peroxidation and membrane lipids are among the major targets of ROS. The occurrence of lipid peroxidation was evaluated with immunohistochemistry with an antibody against 4-HNE, which is an indicative marker of oxidative damage to the retina (Figure 1C). There were no significant differences among groups in the level of 4-HNE immunoreactivities (Figure 1D). 2.3. Proteomics on Mouse Ocular Tissue Protein expression profile analysis were focused on comparisons between flight groups vs habitat control (HC). Analyzing the proteomic changes induced by flight conditions vs the HC group is more relevant for determining the effects of weightlessness and AG since HC mice were placed in the same flight hardware (cages) used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were matched to that during spaceflight. Five micrograms of protein from each eyecup sample was resolved by 4–20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Tris-Gly gel electrophoresis, visualized by Coomassie stain, in-gel trypsin digested, and analyzed by LC/MS on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. Figure 2A shows a gel image depicting one representative sample for each of the three sample groups. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Proteins identified from µg, μg + 1 g, and habitat controls (HC) by high-resolution mass spectrometry. (A) Five micrograms of protein was resolved by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by Coomassie-staining. Eyecups contain retinal layers were used for proteomic analysis. Samples were analyzed with six biological replicates. Each gel lane was sliced into 24 equivalent sections. Protein in each gel slice was digested in-gel with trypsin and identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry; (B) a Venn diagram represents the number of total proteins identified from each group. Seventy-six percent of the proteins were identified in all three groups.A MaxQuant database search (restricted to Mus musculus) identified a total of 4179 proteins from all 18 samples. A Venn diagram indicates that we identified 3174 (76%) common proteins in all groups and, therefore, differences between the groups are reflective of the intensities of the proteins detected (Figure 2B) [12]. A small percentage of proteins were uniquely identified in each of the µg + 1 g, µg, and HC samples and may reflect specific changes within each group. The MS1 precursor intensities were converted to relative iBAQ intensities by dividing the iBAQ intensity by the sum of all iBAQ intensities in the sample [13]. The samples were normalized based on the median relative iBAQ intensities for each sample, log2 transformed, and missing values were imputed based on the normal distribution. The log2 normalized iBAQ intensities were used for analyses. We identified 250 and 171 significantly differentiating proteins comparing the µg versus HC and µg + 1 g versus HC sample groups, respectively, based on a Mann–Whitney U test with a false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value < 0.05. A hierarchical cluster was generated for both comparisons (Figure 3) and visually representing the significant protein intensities for each sample group. We further filtered the list of significant proteins by using a fold change >2 threshold. By using a p-value and a protein expression threshold, we were able to identify the top significant proteins. These top significant proteins are seen in the heat maps as the clusters of proteins with the largest changes in intensity (yellow to blue) (Figure 3). Volcano plots were used to visualize all identified proteins and highlight the significant proteins for each comparison in the study using R studio (Figure 4). The y-axis consists of −log10 p-values based on the Mann–Whitney U FDR adjusted p-values, while the x-axis consists of the log2 fold change. The vertical lines indicate up- and down expression using a fold change >2 threshold. The horizontal line indicates a p-value of 0.05. We identified 77 and 23 significant proteins based on these two criteria for the µg versus HC and µg + 1 g versus HC, respectively. Figure 3.

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the log2 normalized iBAQ intensities for significantly differentiating proteins was performed using the Euclidean distance metric with oheatmap R package. The hierarchical cluster was generated for comparison and visually represents the significant protein intensities for each sample group. The intensities were standardized by the mean and standard deviation before clustering. Proteins were considered significant based on Mann–Whitney U FDR corrected p-value < 0.05.Figure 4.

(A) µg versus HC: 77 significant run in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA); (B) µg + 1 g versus HC: 23 significant run in IPA. Volcano plots were generated based on fold-change of protein levels using the log2 normalized iBAQ intensities from six biological replicates. The x-axis indicates a log2 fold-change and the y-axis indicates −log10 p-value based on a Mann–Whitney U test with a FDR adjusted p-value. The horizontal line indicates a p-value < 0.05 and the vertical lines represent a fold-change >2.These differentially expressed proteins were then analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) [14]. There were significant changes in canonical pathways and upstream regulators in the pathway analysis for flight groups compared to the HC controls. Our proteomic analysis identified only 33 upstream regulator proteins based on the Z-scores used to predict either activation (Z-score > 0) or inhibition (Z-score < 0) in the µg + 1 g animals compared to HC mice that involves disease development, molecular/cellular function and cell signaling, while 60 regulators were identified in the µg group compared to HC mice. IPA analysis revealed many key pathways are affected that are responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, mitochondrial function, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation when comparing the µg group with HC group. Pathways were considered significant based on the Fisher exact test with a −log10 p-value > 1.3 (corresponds to a p-value < 0.05). Significantly affected canonical pathways between µg + 1 g vs. HC or µg group vs HC or are shown in Figure 5A,B, respectively. There were also significant changes in regulated protein expression in the pathway analysis for µg or µg + 1 g groups compared to HC group or µg group vs. µg + 1 g group. There was very little overlap of significantly regulated protein between µg vs. HC and µg + 1 g vs. HC. In the µg group, there was significant alteration in functions related to overall organismal survival, cellular assembly and metabolism. Significant increased or decreased protein expression levels are summarized and listed in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Figure 5.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion The current study demonstrates that spaceflight induces apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells. We also identified spaceflight-induced changes in proteomic profiles and pathways in the ocular tissue. The results indicate that spaceflight induces changes in neuronal structure, cellular organization, mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation and inflammation which, in turn, may lead to tissue injury and late neurodegeneration. This study is the first to investigate the role of AG provided by centrifugation during spaceflight as a countermeasure for mitigating putative effects of microgravity on ocular structure and function. In our study, several oxidative stress-related signaling pathways are significantly altered in the µg group, which includes fatty acid β-oxidation I, fatty acid activation and α-adrenergic pathway. However, we did not find a significant change in an oxidative stress marker for lipid peroxidation, 4-HNE when measured two days after splash-down. In our previous space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) study, the level of HNE protein was significantly elevated in the retina after spaceflight compared to controls [2]. This is not surprising as these two flight conditions are different. Female C57BL/6 mice were flown in the STS-135 for 13-day mission, and within 3–5 h of landing, eyes were removed for analysis. In the current study, male mice were flown to the ISS for a 35-day mission, and the mice were euthanized at about 40 h after splashing down. Differences in gender, mission duration and recovery time might contribute to their dynamic stress response. The level of oxidative stress can be affected by their stress reaction to a prolonged flight in space and in the period of re-adaptation to the normal gravity after landing [15]. Another possible explanation for the lack of significant change in 4-HNE in the current study is that spaceflight might elicit protective effects in the central nervous system (CNS) by inhibiting some gravity-initiated stress signaling pathway. Of all the proteins significantly altered by spaceflight, the Cap-Gly domain containing linker protein 2 (CLIP2), also known as CLIP-115, was significantly down-regulated in both µg and µg + 1 g groups. This protein is found predominantly in the CNS, where it likely plays a role in the normal structure and function of nerve cells. Within cells, this protein is thought to regulate cell cytoskeleton function that helps to determine cell shape, size, and movement [16,17,18,19,20]. Figure 6A illustrates CLIP2 in the network of proteins responsible for cellular assembly and organization, cell signaling and interaction as defined by IPA in response to spaceflight. Figure 6.

Red = up-regulated (p < 0.05). Grey = un-changed. Green = down-regulated. (A,B) are generated with IPA software. More detailed description of the legends (squares, circles, etc.) can be found at the Ingenuity Systems website. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) had the highest fold changes in flight mice (µg group) compared to HC. This protein binds to methylated DNA and regulates chromatin structure and transcription [21,22]. MECP2 is most abundantly produced in the brain where it is expressed primarily in post-mitotic neurons [23]. Previous work has also shown MECP2 mediated epigenetic regulation of senescent endothelial progenitor cells and promoted apoptosis [24]. Furthermore, a recent study provides evidence that elevated MECP2 in mice causes neurodegeneration [25]. Figure 6B shows the regulative role of MECP2 in a network of proteins that involves cell death and survival. The data from this study indicates that adding 1 g on the ISS is effective in reducing the endothelial cell damage and increasing cellular organization and function compared to the µg group. Another study of the same animals used in our present study also showed that 1 g AG served to maintain femur bone density and soleus/gastrocnemius muscle mass similar to that in the ground control group, whereas significant decreases in bone density and muscle mass occurred in the flight mice without centrifuge [10]. These studies provide evidence that in-flight AG can mitigate some of the effects of weightlessness during spaceflight. Further investigation will be needed to define the relationship between gravitational dose/time and physiological response by assessing retinal physiological endpoints and function. More rodent centrifugation studies on board the ISS are also needed to provide comprehensive information to compare the effectiveness of the AG prescription in other physiological systems during weightless conditions.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions The current data demonstrate that spaceflight induces apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells of the retina. Such changes to vasculature endothelial cells could serve to impair barrier function of the BRB and compromise the fidelity of intraocular pressure regulation. Study results also show acute changes in the protein expression profile of space-flown and centrifuged mouse retina. Diverse spaceflight-induced alterations in protein-expression profiles suggest broader changes in eye structure and function. If such alterations occur in the eyes of astronauts, these changes could contribute to acute and sustained modifications in astronauts’ visual acuity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the possible mechanism(s) by which changes in protein-expression profiles are mediated and their structural and functional consequences.",

Copyright notice ID: 6165321 PMID: 30154332 Abstract Astronauts are reported to have experienced some impairment in visual acuity during their mission on the International Space Station (ISS) and after they returned to Earth. There is emerging evidence that changes in vision may involve alterations in ocular structure and function. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 12) were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) “Kibo” facility on the ISS. The flight mice lived either under an ambient microgravity condition (µg) or in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1 g artificial gravity (µg + 1 g). Habitat control (HC) and vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the µg group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups (p < 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in µg mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more significant changes in regulated protein expression in the µg group relative to that in the µg + 1 g group. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes. These retinal cellular responses may affect blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, visual acuity, and impact the potential risk of developing late retinal degeneration. Keywords: spaceflight, ocular tissue, microgravity, artificial gravity, apoptosis, proteomics, oxidative stress1. Introduction Approximately 30% of astronauts on short-term (~2 week) Space Shuttle flights and 60% on long-duration (~6 month) missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are reported to have experienced some impairment in distant or near visual acuity [1]. Previous studies of rodents also show that environmental conditions associated with spaceflight and simulated microgravity induce alterations in retinal structure and function [2,3,4]. Retinal damage and degeneration can occur as a result of multiple factors, including aging, ischemia, fluctuation in oxygen tension, oxidative stress, and increased intraocular pressure. Our previous data from Space Shuttle studies showed a significant increase of apoptosis in retinal cells of flight mice compared to ground controls [2], which could lead to morphologic changes and impairment of retinal function. However, the pathophysiological consequences and cellular mechanisms of stress stimuli, especially those associated with a spaceflight environment, in facilitating retinal damage are less studied and remain unclear. Data on the response of biochemical systems to altered gravity is very limited in animal studies [5]. Some lines of evidence suggest that one of the mechanisms involved in response to spaceflight, including changes in the gravity vector, is likely due to oxidative stress [2,6,7]. Studies have shown that exposure to microgravity during spaceflights is associated with elevations in oxidative stress and production of lipid peroxidation in both humans and rodents [8,9]. However, our knowledge about the duration or dose of microgravity exposure needed to induce oxidative stress or alterations in retinal structure and function is extremely limited. For example, one study has shown that even transient exposure to microgravity produced by parabolic flight can cause alterations in retinal vasculature to occur [1]. One means to address the impact of microgravity conditions is through the application of artificial gravity (AG) during spaceflight. Creating AG by centrifugal force makes it possible to have a partial gravity or Earth-like gravity (1 g) control in space, where all other environmental conditions associated with spaceflight are present. A newly developed mouse habitat cage unit (HCU) by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been installed in the Centrifuge-equipped Biological Experiment Facility (CBEF) on board the ISS [10]. This rodent centrifugation capability provides opportunities to compare the effectiveness of AG prescription under spaceflight conditions. Since the HCU can reproduce Earth-like gravity, it can be used to test the effectiveness of AG to mitigate the effects of microgravity on physiological systems [11]. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of spaceflight on oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells and to identify spaceflight-induced changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the application of 1 g AG during spaceflight could mitigate any detrimental effects of microgravity on the retina. We hypothesized that spaceflight would induce elevations in oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells, as well as alter ocular proteins associated with apoptosis, cell repair, inflammation and metabolic function. We further hypothesized that the application of 1 g AG would mitigate these changes.2. Results 2.1. Apoptosis in Retinal Endothelial Cells Following Spaceflight Immunocytochemical analysis by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that spaceflight conditions induced significant apoptosis in the retinal endothelial cells (Figure 1A) relative to that in the habitat and vivarium control conditions and in the AG (µg + 1 g) condition. Our quantitative assessment revealed that the density of apoptotic cells in the retina was the highest in the µg group, and was 64% greater than that in the habitat control group (Figure 1B). Figure 1. Open in a new tab (A) Apoptosis based on terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining of 9-week old male C57BL/6 mouse retinal tissue. Groups (n = 6): Vivarium control, habitat control, µg, and µg + 1 g. TUNEL-positive cells were identified with green fluorescence, the endothelium was stained with lectin (red). The nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). In the control retinal tissue, only sparse TUNEL-positive cells were found.

The vessel was stained with tomato lectin (green). Scale bar = 50 µm; (D) the averages fluorescence intensity for 4-HNE activity were measured and calculated using the ImageJ program. Fluorescence was averaged across 5 retinas per group. Values are represented with mean + SEM. No significant differences among groups were detected.2.2. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) Immunoreactivity Following Spaceflight Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in lipid peroxidation and membrane lipids are among the major targets of ROS. The occurrence of lipid peroxidation was evaluated with immunohistochemistry with an antibody against 4-HNE, which is an indicative marker of oxidative damage to the retina (Figure 1C). There were no significant differences among groups in the level of 4-HNE immunoreactivities (Figure 1D). 2.3. Proteomics on Mouse Ocular Tissue Protein expression profile analysis were focused on comparisons between flight groups vs habitat control (HC). Analyzing the proteomic changes induced by flight conditions vs the HC group is more relevant for determining the effects of weightlessness and AG since HC mice were placed in the same flight hardware (cages) used in flight and environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were matched to that during spaceflight. Five micrograms of protein from each eyecup sample was resolved by 4–20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Tris-Gly gel electrophoresis, visualized by Coomassie stain, in-gel trypsin digested, and analyzed by LC/MS on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. Figure 2A shows a gel image depicting one representative sample for each of the three sample groups. Figure 2.

(A) Five micrograms of protein was resolved by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by Coomassie-staining. Eyecups contain retinal layers were used for proteomic analysis. Samples were analyzed with six biological replicates. Each gel lane was sliced into 24 equivalent sections. Protein in each gel slice was digested in-gel with trypsin and identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry; (B) a Venn diagram represents the number of total proteins identified from each group. Seventy-six percent of the proteins were identified in all three groups.A MaxQuant database search (restricted to Mus musculus) identified a total of 4179 proteins from all 18 samples. A Venn diagram indicates that we identified 3174 (76%) common proteins in all groups and, therefore, differences between the groups are reflective of the intensities of the proteins detected (Figure 2B) [12]. A small percentage of proteins were uniquely identified in each of the µg + 1 g, µg, and HC samples and may reflect specific changes within each group. The MS1 precursor intensities were converted to relative iBAQ intensities by dividing the iBAQ intensity by the sum of all iBAQ intensities in the sample [13]. The samples were normalized based on the median relative iBAQ intensities for each sample, log2 transformed, and missing values were imputed based on the normal distribution. The log2 normalized iBAQ intensities were used for analyses. We identified 250 and 171 significantly differentiating proteins comparing the µg versus HC and µg + 1 g versus HC sample groups, respectively, based on a Mann–Whitney U test with a false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value < 0.05. A hierarchical cluster was generated for both comparisons (Figure 3) and visually representing the significant protein intensities for each sample group. We further filtered the list of significant proteins by using a fold change >2 threshold. By using a p-value and a protein expression threshold, we were able to identify the top significant proteins. These top significant proteins are seen in the heat maps as the clusters of proteins with the largest changes in intensity (yellow to blue) (Figure 3). Volcano plots were used to visualize all identified proteins and highlight the significant proteins for each comparison in the study using R studio (Figure 4). The y-axis consists of −log10 p-values based on the Mann–Whitney U FDR adjusted p-values, while the x-axis consists of the log2 fold change. The vertical lines indicate up- and down expression using a fold change >2 threshold. The horizontal line indicates a p-value of 0.05. We identified 77 and 23 significant proteins based on these two criteria for the µg versus HC and µg + 1 g versus HC, respectively. Figure 3.

(A) Significant proteins between the µg versus habitat controls (HC). 250 Significant proteins based on false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted (p < 0.05); (B) significant proteins between µg + 1 g versus HC. 171 Significant proteins based on FDR adjusted (p < 0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the log2 normalized iBAQ intensities for significantly differentiating proteins was performed using the Euclidean distance metric with oheatmap R package. The hierarchical cluster was generated for comparison and visually represents the significant protein intensities for each sample group. The intensities were standardized by the mean and standard deviation before clustering. Proteins were considered significant based on Mann–Whitney U FDR corrected p-value < 0.05.Figure 4.

(A) µg versus HC: 77 significant run in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA); (B) µg + 1 g versus HC: 23 significant run in IPA. Volcano plots were generated based on fold-change of protein levels using the log2 normalized iBAQ intensities from six biological replicates. The x-axis indicates a log2 fold-change and the y-axis indicates −log10 p-value based on a Mann–Whitney U test with a FDR adjusted p-value. The horizontal line indicates a p-value < 0.05 and the vertical lines represent a fold-change >2.These differentially expressed proteins were then analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) [14]. There were significant changes in canonical pathways and upstream regulators in the pathway analysis for flight groups compared to the HC controls. Our proteomic analysis identified only 33 upstream regulator proteins based on the Z-scores used to predict either activation (Z-score > 0) or inhibition (Z-score < 0) in the µg + 1 g animals compared to HC mice that involves disease development, molecular/cellular function and cell signaling, while 60 regulators were identified in the µg group compared to HC mice. IPA analysis revealed many key pathways are affected that are responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, mitochondrial function, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation when comparing the µg group with HC group. Pathways were considered significant based on the Fisher exact test with a −log10 p-value > 1.3 (corresponds to a p-value < 0.05). Significantly affected canonical pathways between µg + 1 g vs. HC or µg group vs HC or are shown in Figure 5A,B, respectively. There were also significant changes in regulated protein expression in the pathway analysis for µg or µg + 1 g groups compared to HC group or µg group vs. µg + 1 g group. There was very little overlap of significantly regulated protein between µg vs. HC and µg + 1 g vs. HC. In the µg group, there was significant alteration in functions related to overall organismal survival, cellular assembly and metabolism. Significant increased or decreased protein expression levels are summarized and listed in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Figure 5.

Discussion The current study demonstrates that spaceflight induces apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells. We also identified spaceflight-induced changes in proteomic profiles and pathways in the ocular tissue. The results indicate that spaceflight induces changes in neuronal structure, cellular organization, mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation and inflammation which, in turn, may lead to tissue injury and late neurodegeneration. This study is the first to investigate the role of AG provided by centrifugation during spaceflight as a countermeasure for mitigating putative effects of microgravity on ocular structure and function. In our study, several oxidative stress-related signaling pathways are significantly altered in the µg group, which includes fatty acid β-oxidation I, fatty acid activation and α-adrenergic pathway. However, we did not find a significant change in an oxidative stress marker for lipid peroxidation, 4-HNE when measured two days after splash-down. In our previous space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) study, the level of HNE protein was significantly elevated in the retina after spaceflight compared to controls [2]. This is not surprising as these two flight conditions are different. Female C57BL/6 mice were flown in the STS-135 for 13-day mission, and within 3–5 h of landing, eyes were removed for analysis. In the current study, male mice were flown to the ISS for a 35-day mission, and the mice were euthanized at about 40 h after splashing down. Differences in gender, mission duration and recovery time might contribute to their dynamic stress response. The level of oxidative stress can be affected by their stress reaction to a prolonged flight in space and in the period of re-adaptation to the normal gravity after landing [15]. Another possible explanation for the lack of significant change in 4-HNE in the current study is that spaceflight might elicit protective effects in the central nervous system (CNS) by inhibiting some gravity-initiated stress signaling pathway. Of all the proteins significantly altered by spaceflight, the Cap-Gly domain containing linker protein 2 (CLIP2), also known as CLIP-115, was significantly down-regulated in both µg and µg + 1 g groups. This protein is found predominantly in the CNS, where it likely plays a role in the normal structure and function of nerve cells. Within cells, this protein is thought to regulate cell cytoskeleton function that helps to determine cell shape, size, and movement [16,17,18,19,20]. Figure 6A illustrates CLIP2 in the network of proteins responsible for cellular assembly and organization, cell signaling and interaction as defined by IPA in response to spaceflight. Figure 6.

More detailed description of the legends (squares, circles, etc.) can be found at the Ingenuity Systems website.Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) had the highest fold changes in flight mice (µg group) compared to HC. This protein binds to methylated DNA and regulates chromatin structure and transcription [21,22]. MECP2 is most abundantly produced in the brain where it is expressed primarily in post-mitotic neurons [23]. Previous work has also shown MECP2 mediated epigenetic regulation of senescent endothelial progenitor cells and promoted apoptosis [24]. Furthermore, a recent study provides evidence that elevated MECP2 in mice causes neurodegeneration [25]. Figure 6B shows the regulative role of MECP2 in a network of proteins that involves cell death and survival. The data from this study indicates that adding 1 g on the ISS is effective in reducing the endothelial cell damage and increasing cellular organization and function compared to the µg group. Another study of the same animals used in our present study also showed that 1 g AG served to maintain femur bone density and soleus/gastrocnemius muscle mass similar to that in the ground control group, whereas significant decreases in bone density and muscle mass occurred in the flight mice without centrifuge [10]. These studies provide evidence that in-flight AG can mitigate some of the effects of weightlessness during spaceflight. Further investigation will be needed to define the relationship between gravitational dose/time and physiological response by assessing retinal physiological endpoints and function. More rodent centrifugation studies on board the ISS are also needed to provide comprehensive information to compare the effectiveness of the AG prescription in other physiological systems during weightless conditions.4. Material and Methods 4.1. Spaceflight and Mouse Condition Twelve male 9-week old C57BL/6 male mice, obtained from a US breeding colony, were launched 18 July 2016, at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a SpaceX-9 rocket for the 35-day MHU-1 mission to the ISS. The animals were housed in the mouse HCU located in the JAXA “Kibo” facility on the ISS. The 12 flight mice were subdivided into two groups. The first group of flight mice (n = 6) were exposed to ambient microgravity conditions (µg group), while the second group of flight mice (n = 6) were exposed to continuous artificial Earth gravity (µg + 1 g group) while they were in the HCU. AG was achieved through the use of a short-arm centrifuge for the duration of their stay on the ISS. The flight mice were then returned live to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 26 August 2016. It took approximately 40 h for the mice to be recovered in the Pacific Ocean, brought to shore and transported to the testing and processing laboratory located in San Diego, California on 28 August 2016. The spaceflight mice were then euthanized and their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. Ground control mouse studies were completed in Japan after the return of the flight mice. Control mice (habitat controls, n = 6; vivarium controls, n = 6) were acquired on 31 August 2016 from a breeding colony in Japan and shipped to the JAXA animal facility in Tsukuba, Japan. HC mice were acclimated to the water lixit system and the same special food bar diet as the space flown mice were fed. They were first housed in the transportation cage unit (TCU) to simulate launch and flight to the ISS, and then placed in the HCUs to simulate the housing conditions experienced by µg mice on the ISS. They were again placed in the TCU to simulate the return to Earth flight. The control mouse dissections took place on 3 November 2016. Control mouse eye tissue was then shipped to the US for analysis. All mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. A detailed description of the flight schedule and mouse information has been previously reported [11]. The Loma Linda University (LLU) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was consulted, but no protocol was required since only archived frozen and fixed tissues were obtained after euthanasia. However, animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Tsukuba (No. 16-048), Explora Biolabs (Study Number: EB15-010) on 23 May 2016, JAXA (Protocol Number: 016-014B) on 2 June 2016 and NASA (Protocol Number: NAS-15-004-Y1) on 31 May 2016, and the research with vertebrate animals are done in strict accordance with guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America.4.2. Dissecting and Preservation of Mouse Eyes after Spaceflight Within 2 days of splashing down, mice were euthanized and their eyes were harvested. The posterior half of the right eyecup containing the retina layer, optic disc and a short segment of the optic nerve was placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C prior to use. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays.4.3. Immunohistochemistry Assays and Histology Six µm sections were cut through each eye, and sections were roughly 100 µm apart providing 10 sections per eye for analysis. To characterize apoptosis, 5 sections were subjected to a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized in Histo-Clear, then permeabilized in proteinase K solution. Stained sections were evaluated using the DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system kit (catalog no. G3250, Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The same sections were then incubated with DyLight 594 Lycopersicon esculantum-Lectin (catalog no: DL-11721, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) at a 1:100 dilution for 30 min at room temperature to stain the endothelium. Nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). Sections were examined using a BZ-X710 All-in-One inverted fluorescence microscope with structural illumination (Keyence Corp., Elmwood Park, NJ, USA). TUNEL-positive cells were identified by green fluorescence, vascular endothelium were identified with red fluorescence. TUNEL-positive cells that were laid within red lectin-labeled endothelium were identified as TUNEL-positive endothelial cells. For quantitative analysis, the total number of TUNEL-positive endothelial cells in the retina were determined in 5 sections of each eye. The area of the retina was measured on digital microphotographs using ImageJ counting plugin 1.41 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), and the density profiles were expressed as mean number of apoptotic positive cells/mm2. The mean of the density profile measurements across 5 retina sections per eye was used as a single experimental value. Immunofluorescence staining for an oxidative damage marker on ocular sections was also performed using an anti-4-HNE antibody. Five sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody (catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA) at 4 °C for 2 h followed by a donkey anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. A21206, Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. To determine 4-HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on each section and calculated using ImageJ software. Once the green channel was separated from the red channel in an image, fluorescence intensities from the areas of interest were measured using the integral/density feature in the ImageJ program and data were extracted and averaged within the group. Fluorescence was averaged across 5 retinas per group in retinal nuclear layers. Data were normalized with respect to controls. The values were represented as fold changes over controls.4.4. Mass Spectrometry Protein expression profiles of ocular tissue containing the retina were determined in eighteen mice (n = 6/group) from three sample groups: µg, µg + 1 g, and HC, using high resolution mass spectrometry. Five micrograms of protein lysate were resolved by a 4–20% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE (Life Technologies Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). The gel was sliced into 24 gel slices that were 2 mm thick for each sample. Gel slices were destained in 50% methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA), 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), followed by reduction in 10 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (Pierce, Dallas, TX, USA) and alkylation in 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel slices were then dehydrated in acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by addition of 100 ng porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega Corp.) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 37 °C for 12–16 h. Peptide products were then acidified in 0.1% formic acid (Pierce). Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase Jupiter Proteo resin (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) on a 100 × 0.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity Ultra Performance LC™ (UPLC™) system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Peptides were eluted using a 30 min gradient from 97:3 to 60:40 buffer A:B ratio. (Buffer A = 0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile; buffer B = 0.1% formic acid, 90% acetonitrile). Eluted peptides were ionized by electrospray (1.9 kV) followed by MS/MS analysis using collision-induced dissociation on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS data were acquired using the Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance spectrometry (FTMS) analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 60,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 m/z. MS/MS data were acquired for the top 15 peaks from each MS scan using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with a normalized collision energy of 35.0.4.5. Data Analysis Proteins were identified by searching the UniProtKB database (2017-03 release; restricted to Mus musculus; 81,557 entries) using the Andromeda search engine in MaxQuant (version 1.5.7.4, Max Planck Institute of biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Search parameters were as follows: trypsin digestion with up to three missed cleavages; fixed modification of carbamidomethyl of cysteine; variable modifications of oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus; first search set to 5 ppm precursor ion tolerance and the main search was set to 3 ppm; selected label-free quantitation with iBAQ with a minimum ratio of 1. A contaminants database was used for the first search to identify commonly identified contaminants. The MaxQuant iBAQ values for each sample were converted to relative iBAQ (riBAQ) intensities by dividing the iBAQ intensity for each protein by the sum of all iBAQ intensities for all proteins identified in the sample. The median of all relative iBAQ intensities for each sample was then used to normalize between the samples. The adjusted riBAQ intensities were then imported into Perseus (version 1.5.6.0, Max Planck Institute of biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Perseus was used to log2 transform the data and impute the missing values using a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2 standard deviations. Non-parametric Mann–Whitney U tests were used to compare habitat control with the µg and µg + 1 g groups separately. The p-values were corrected by Benjamini–Hochberg to account for multiple testing. Fold changes were also calculated for each comparison. Proteins that were significant by the FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and that had a fold change greater than 2 were considered to be differentially expressed. The heat maps were generated using the Euclidean distance metric and the data was standardized by the mean and standard deviation before performing hierarchical clustering with pheatmap R package (maintained by Raivo Kolde, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Volcano plots were generated using R. These proteins were then analyzed using the IPA pathway analysis. 4.6. Statistical Analysis The results obtained from all experiments were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc multiple-comparison test (Sigma Plot for Windows, version 13.0; Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Data are shown as mean ± standard error (SEM).5. Conclusions The current data demonstrate that spaceflight induces apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells of the retina. Such changes to vasculature endothelial cells could serve to impair barrier function of the BRB and compromise the fidelity of intraocular pressure regulation. Study results also show acute changes in the protein expression profile of space-flown and centrifuged mouse retina. Diverse spaceflight-induced alterations in protein-expression profiles suggest broader changes in eye structure and function. If such alterations occur in the eyes of astronauts, these changes could contribute to acute and sustained modifications in astronauts’ visual acuity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the possible mechanism(s) by which changes in protein-expression profiles are mediated and their structural and functional consequences.Acknowledgements This is the first NASA-JAXA collaboration for rodent tissue sharing and is promoted under the “Japan-U.S. Open Platform Partnership Program (JP-US OP3)”.

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Mechanical forces and sympathetic influences are key determinants of vascular structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and skin. Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and saphenous) were examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion and glyoxylic acid staining. Results: HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery diameter was not affected. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls. Conclusion: HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight. Keywords: microgravity, hindlimb unloading, rat, small arteries, remodeling, sympathetic innervation, noradrenaline, serotonin",
    "introduction": "Introduction The vascular system is constantly exposed to mechanical forces such as transmural pressure and shear stress, the latter of which is created by flowing blood on the endothelial cell lining of the vessel. Prolonged changes in these factors govern gross structural remodeling of blood vessels, which in turn affects their functional characteristics. For example, previous work has shown that chronic increases in transmural pressure induce hypertrophy of the vascular wall and increases in vessel contractility, while decreases in pressure result in the opposite changes (Folkow, 1982). Chronic increases in shear stress, in turn, lead to structural increases in maximal diameter, whereas decreases in shear result in a narrowing of the vessel lumen (Langille, 1993; Pourageaud and De Mey, 1997). The cardiovascular system of all terrestrial inhabitants is adapted to the gravitational field of the Earth and changes significantly in conditions of weightlessness (Watenpaugh and Hargens, 1996). Importantly, redistribution of transmural pressures and flows within the arterial vasculature during space flight or simulated microgravity is known to initiate different adaptations in vessels from different anatomic regions (Zhang, 2001, 2013). In humans, exposure to long term head-down bed rest was shown to reduce intimal-medial thickness and lumen diameter of arterial vessels in lower extremities, in contrast to upper extremity and cranial arteries (Bleeker et al., 2005; Platts et al., 2009). The model of hindlimb unloading (HU) in rats is commonly used to study the mechanisms of microgravity effects on different body systems, including vasculature (Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). Even relatively small change in hydrostatic pressure gradient, as observed in the rat body with this model (Colleran et al., 2000), results in different vascular alterations in rostral and caudal parts of the body. Similar to microgravity effects in human vascular system, rat hindlimb arteries commonly demonstrate wall thinning and lumen reduction, in contrast to cranial arteries (Wilkerson et al., 1999; Delp et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2004; Stabley et al., 2013). Data from the literature also provide the evidence that transmural pressure shifts cannot explain all effects of simulated microgravity on vascular characteristics, because vascular alterations in HU rats may differ in functionally different vascular beds within the same part of the body. This was shown in studies of vascular dimensions and reactivity of arterioles from postural (soleus) and phasic (gastrocnemius) hindlimb muscles (Delp et al., 2000), as well as arterioles from white (glycolytic) and red (oxidative) parts from the same gastrocnemius muscle (Heaps and Bowles, 2002) of HU rats. Obviously, such diverse effects of HU on the arterial vasculature within and among postural and phasic muscles are largely the result of differential alterations in muscle activity and blood flow during the conditions of disuse (McDonald et al., 1992). Structural and functional changes in the vascular bed could also result from the influence of sympathetic nervous system. In addition to acute control of vessel diameter and blood flow, neurotransmitters from the sympathetic nerves exert a trophic effect on the vasculature (Bevan, 1984; Puzdrova et al., 2014; Adeoye et al., 2015). The severity of trophic sympathetic influence in certain vascular bed may depend on the density of its innervation and/or on the efferent sympathetic traffic it receives. In addition, the state of the vascular neuroeffector apparatus has been shown to depend on the prevailing level of transmural pressure and, therefore, may be affected in the conditions of microgravity (Monos et al., 2001; Zhang, 2001; Puzdrova et al., 2009). In contrast to the skeletal muscle circulation, the cutaneous circulation is regulated by a smaller contribution from metabolic vasomotor mechanisms and a higher role of sympathetic control, including a greater sympathetic vasoconstriction of small cutaneous arteries relative to that in skeletal muscle (Tarasova et al., 2003). However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the effects of simulated microgravity via HU on the structural and functional properties of cutaneous arteries, nor contrasted these effects in the forelimb and hindlimb circulations. Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis that HU exerts diverse effects on the neurovascular density, structural properties, and functional vasoconstrictor responsiveness of skeletal muscle and cutaneous feed arteries in the rat forelimb and hindlimb regions.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods All the procedures were conducted in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (Eighth edition, 2011). The procedures were approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences (protocol N224). Animals Male Wistar rats (2.5–3-month-old) were obtained from the breeder of the Institute of Biomedical Problems and housed in laboratory animal unit at the Faculty of Biology, M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University in controlled conditions of temperature (22–24°C) and light-dark cycle (12–12 h) with ad libitum access to water and standard chow diet (Laboratorkorm, Russia). After 1-week acclimatization to the environment, the rats were randomly assigned to the cage control (n = 10) and HU (n = 10) groups. In HU group, the hindlimbs of the rat were elevated with a hook attached to the proximal third of the tail with adhesive material. The hook was connected by a harness to a swivel apparatus at the top of the cage. The height of the hindquarter elevation was adjusted to prevent the hindlimbs from touching the supporting surfaces, resulting in a suspension angle of 35–40°. The forelimbs maintained the contact with the floor surface, which allowed the animals full range of motion. The animals were housed individually in cages of 50 cm × 50 cm × 50 cm. Animals remained under HU or control conditions for a total of 14 days. This duration of HU was shown to provide the stable changes in muscle weight and blood flow in rats (McDonald et al., 1992). No signs of ischemia or damage of the tail skin were observed during HU. After 2 weeks of HU, the animals were sacrificed by decapitation under CO2 anesthesia and the arteries were dissected free from surrounding tissue. Two arteries were isolated from the forelimb (deep brachial artery and median artery) and two arteries from the hindlimb (sural artery and saphenous artery). These feed arteries provide blood flow to skeletal muscle (brachial and sural arteries) and predominantly to the skin (median and saphenous arteries). Brachial and median arteries were dissected from the right forelimb for myography experiments. Sural arteries from right and left hindlimbs were used for myography experiments and histochemical examination, respectively. Right saphenous artery from each rat was used for wire myography (distal part) and histochemical examination (proximal part), while the artery from the left hindlimb was studied in perfusion experiments. Wire Myography Two neighboring segments with a length of 2 mm were cut from each type of artery and mounted in wire myograph system (DMT, Denmark, 410A or 620 model) for isometric force recoding at well-defined internal circumferences. Endothelium was gently removed from one of the segments by rubbing with a rat whisker. The preparations were kept at 37°C in physiological salt solution containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 4.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.0 MgSO4, 1.6 CaCl2, 5.5 D-glucose, 0.025 EDTA, and 5 HEPES, equilibrated with gas mixture 5% CO2 + 95% O2 to maintain pH 7.4. Force readings were continuously recorded at 10 Hz sampling rate using E14-140 analog-to-digital data converter (L-Card, Russia) and PowerGraph 3.3 software (DISoft, Russia). Fully relaxed arterial segments were gradually stretched to d100, the inner diameter equivalent to a transmural pressure of 100 mmHg, and then set to 0.9d100, where maximal active force is developed (Mulvany and Halpern, 1977). The arteries were activated three times with noradrenaline (10−6 M, Sigma). Functional integrity of the endothelium was checked by application of acetylcholine (10−6 M, Sigma) on top of noradrenaline-induced contraction (3 × 10−7 M). Endothelium-intact preparations relaxed in response to acetylcholine by at least 50% of the precontraction level and the relaxation response of endothelium-denuded preparations was not larger than 10%. The experimental protocol included consecutively performed concentration-response relationships to noradrenaline (10−8 – 3 × 10−5 М, Sigma) and serotonin (3 × 10−8 – 3 × 10−5 М, Sigma) with 30-min washout interval between them. The agonists were given cumulatively in half-log increments. The responses to noradrenaline were studied in the presence of propranolol (10−6 M, Sigma), to prevent relaxation mediated by β-adrenoceptors. During data analysis, active force values were calculated by subtracting the passive force value (recorded in the preparation with fully relaxed smooth muscle) from all recorded force values (before the first and at each noradrenaline or serotonin concentration). Then, respective values of active wall tension were calculated as T=F/2l, where T is tension, F is active force and l is the segment length. The concentration-response relationships were fitted to a sigmoidal function with variable slope using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (La Jolla, CA, USA) to calculate pD2 values (the negative logarithm of EC50). Inner diameter of each artery (d100) was estimated from its passive length-tension relationship. Constant-Pressure Perfusion A segment of the saphenous artery was isolated, placed into the tissue bath, and cannulated at both ends. The vessel fragment length between the cannulae was about 5–6 mm. Krebs-Henseleit physiological salt solution was used for perfusion and superfusion (NaCl 119 mM, KCl 4.7 mM, CaCl2 2.5 mM, MgSO4 1.17 mM, NaHCO3 25 mM, KH2PO4 1.18 mM, D-glucose 5.5 mM, EDTA 0.026 mM, 37°C, and 95% O2 + 5% CO2). Artery was perfused under a constant pressure; input and output pressures were measured continuously using two pressure transducers (BLPR2, World Precision Instruments, USA) and kept at 60 and 50 mmHg, respectively. Volume flow rate was measured with 1N type transducer connected to transit-time flowmeter (Transonic Systems Inc., USA). All parameters were permanently recorded at 20 Hz sampling rate using E14-140 analog-to-digital data converter (L-Card, Russia) and PowerGraph 3.3 software (DISoft, Russia). Intramural nerves were stimulated with rectangular electric pulses of changing polarity, with amplitude of 200–300 mA and 0.2 ms duration. All the effects of electrical stimulation could be blocked by tetrodotoxin (3 μM, Sigma), thus indicating the neurogenic origin of the response. Electric pulse frequency was 4, 8, or 12 Hz, the stimulation lasted for 30 s, and 3-min intervals were applied between the stimulations. Data analysis was performed using a custom program working under MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., USA). The constrictor response was evaluated as a relative change of the intralumen diameter (D), which was calculated by Poiseuille equation: D=l·Q/ΔP4, l, length of the vessel segment between canulae; Q, volume flow rate; and ΔP, the difference between input and output pressures. Glyoxylic Acid Staining for Periarterial Adrenergic Innervation Segments of saphenous and sural arteries were cut lengthwise and placed in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.2) supplemented with 2% glyoxylic acid, 10% sucrose, and 0.03% Pontamine Sky Blue (Puzdrova et al., 2009). After a 30-min incubation, the preparation was flattened on the slide with the adventitia upward, dried (30 min in jet of warm air and 5 min at 100°C), and overlaid with mineral oil and covered with a cover glass. A LUMAM R3 microscope (LOMO, USSR; eyepiece ×7, objective lens ×40) was used for visualization. The exciting light wavelength was 380–440 nm; the luminescence wavelength was 480–700 nm. The plexus density was estimated with a grid that covered a field of 300 × 300 μm on the preparation and consisted of 24 rows, each containing 22–23 round markers (the ratio of marker diameter to space between markers was 1:2.5). Counting was performed in three randomly selected fields and the results were averaged. Statistical Data Analysis Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0. The normality of the data distribution was confirmed using D’Agostino-Pearson test. Unpaired Student’s t-test or Repeated Measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used, as appropriate. Statistical significance was reached at p < 0.05. All data are given as mean ± S.E.M. and n represents the number of animals.",
    "results": "Results Body Weight At the beginning of the experiment, body weights of rats from control and HU groups were 316 ± 6 g (n = 10) and 310 ± 9 g (n = 10), respectively (p > 0.05). Within 2 weeks, control group increased body weight to 376 ± 14 g (n = 10) and HU group to 353 ± 6 g (n = 10). No difference in body weight was observed between the two experimental groups at the end of the experiment (p > 0.05, control vs. HU). Inner Diameter of the Arteries Both forelimb arteries from HU rats had larger inner diameters compared to the respective arteries from control rats (Table 1). However, when calculated as percentage of the mean value in control group, the increment of diameter in the brachial artery was more prominent compared to the median artery: 22.5 ± 3.0 and 10.2 ± 3.8%, respectively (p < 0.05).

In contrast, sural arteries of HU rats demonstrated a decrease of inner diameter (by 17.9 ± 4.7%) compared to the arteries of control rats (Table 1). The diameter of saphenous artery was not affected by HU (Table 1). Contractile Responses of Forelimb Arteries Contractile responses of brachial arteries were greater in HU rats compared to that in control rats. This was observed when endothelium-intact segments of brachial arteries were exposed to noradrenaline (Figure 1A) or serotonin (Figure 1B). Endothelium removal did not change the differences in brachial artery contractile responses between HU and control rats (Figures 1C,D). Most prominent effects of HU on brachial artery contractility were observed when the agonists were applied in near-maximal to maximal concentrations. The sensitivity of endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded brachial artery preparations to vasoconstrictors was not altered by HU (Table 2). Figure 1.

This decrease was observed in both endothelium-intact (Figures 3A,B) and endothelium-denuded (Figures 3C,D) segments of sural artery from HU rats compared to control rats. Again, most prominent effect of HU on contractile responses was observed with the higher concentrations of the agonists, while the sensitivity of sural arteries to contractile stimuli was not altered by HU (Table 2).

Sympathetic Neurotransmission in Saphenous Artery In control rats, adrenergic fiber plexus was dense in the saphenous artery, but sparse in the sural artery (Figure 5A).

In the absence of nerve stimulation, solution flow rate values did not differ in control and HU rats: 3.9 ± 0.18 and 4.1 ± 0.18 ml/min, respectively. The relative decreases of arterial inner diameter caused by 8 and 12 Hz stimulation were lower in HU rats compared to that in controls (Figure 5C).",
    "discussion": "Discussion The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 2 weeks of simulated microgravity on skeletal muscle and skin feed arteries from the rat forelimb and hindlimb regions. We hypothesized that HU exerts diverse effects on the sympathetic innervation density, structural properties, and functional vasoconstrictor responsiveness of skeletal muscle and cutaneous feed arteries. The data indicate that HU induces increases in maximal lumen diameter and vasoconstrictor responsiveness in forelimb skeletal muscle arteries, but decreases in these structural and functional properties in hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. In the cutaneous vasculature of the forelimbs and hindlimbs, alterations in the structure and vasoconstrictor properties either did not occur or were of smaller magnitude than that occurring in the skeletal muscle arteries from the same region of the body. Exposure to HU also diminished sympathetic nerve density and impaired vasoconstriction induced by sympathetic nerve stimulation in hindlimb cutaneous, but not skeletal muscle arteries. However, vasoconstrictor responses of hindlimb cutaneous arteries to direct smooth muscle stimulation by vasoconstrictor agonists exhibited greater sensitivity in the HU rats. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the complexity of vascular adaptations to simulated microgravity is much greater than previously described. Vascular alterations not only differentially occur between regions of the body, but also within those regions, and can be functionally related to physical alterations in sympathetic nerve density and gross structural remodeling of resistance arteries. Both the forelimbs and hindlimbs of the rat perform functions of support and locomotion, which suggest these two different anatomical regions of the body share similar inherent characteristics that include skeletal muscle and cutaneous circulations. Additionally, systemic humoral influences would not differ in forelimb and hindlimb arteries of the same rat. Alterations in nerve traffic during HU exposure would also likely be equalized between the same-type arteries in the forelimbs and hindlimbs, since functional specialization of efferent sympathetic pathways is organotypic rather than somatotopic (Jänig and McLachlan, 1992; Jänig and Häbler, 2003). Therefore, the design of this study allowed us to separate adaptive arterial responses to the anti-orthostatic body position and redistribution of support and muscle activity from other effects associated with the HU model, including social isolation, restraint, and the development of neuroendocrine stress (Tsvirkun et al., 2012). Hindlimb Unloading Induces Contrasting Structural and Functional Adaptations in Forelimb and Hindlimb Skeletal Muscle Arteries HU exposure resulted in divergent alterations of forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries, i.e., lumen diameter and wall contractility (maximal active tension) increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb. The changes in contractility were independent of the vascular endothelium and not associated with the change in smooth muscle sensitivity to contractile stimulation by noradrenaline or serotonin. These data point to non-specific amplification of smooth muscle contractile responses in forelimb arteries, presumably resulting from smooth muscle hypertrophy and media wall thickening. In contrast, non-specific attenuation of smooth muscle contractile responses takes place in hindlimb arteries, presumably resulting from smooth muscle atrophy and a thinning of the medial wall (Delp et al., 2000). Previous work has shown that HU in rats is associated with ~10 mmHg gradient between aortic and hindlimb arterial pressures (Colleran et al., 2000). Therefore, arterial transmural pressure in HU rats is elevated in the forelimb region and reduced in the hindlimbs; this pressure differential presumably governs the divergent alterations in media thickness (Wilkerson et al., 1999; Stabley et al., 2012). The mechanisms which mediate the effects of transmural pressure on media remodeling may include the secretion of angiotensin II from vascular smooth muscle cells with further stimulation of MAPK cascades (Eskildsen-Helmond and Mulvany, 2003). Importantly, HU was shown to stimulate the activity of vascular renin-angiotensin system in cranial arteries, but depress it in femoral arteries (Bao et al., 2007; Zhang, 2013). In support of the present data, wall thickness and medial cross-section area were shown to be diminished in resistance arteries associated with the anterior tibial (Sun et al., 2004) and gastrocnemius (Delp et al., 2000) muscles in the hindlimbs of HU rats. In addition, chronic increases in blood flow/shear stress in loaded forelimb muscles and chronic decreases in unloaded hindlimb muscles induce divergent changes in maximal passive diameter of arteries (Delp et al., 2000; Stabley et al., 2013). Similar results have also been found in human models used to simulate microgravity. For instance, long-duration (up to 60 days) head-down bed rest has been reported to reduce intimal-medial thickness in the anterior tibial artery (Platts et al., 2009), as well as lumen diameter of the femoral artery and its branch (Bleeker et al., 2005). Therefore, these results indicate that the gross structural adaptations of skeletal muscle arteries in HU rats and humans undergoing head-down bed rest are mainly induced by the influence of mechanical forces. In both the forelimbs and hindlimbs, cutaneous arteries were less affected by HU, as compared to skeletal muscle arteries from the same region of the body. These results may be attributed to several factors. First, cutaneous blood flow would not be as greatly affected by changes in postural support and low level physical activity as that of the skeletal muscle, particularly given the rapid and profound changes in skeletal muscle vascular resistance associated with increases and decreases in muscle activity (Delp, 1999). Second, the profile of blood pressure changes within the cutaneous vasculature may differ from that within the skeletal muscle vascular tree. A prominent constriction of proximal cutaneous arteries during sympathetic activation (Tarasova et al., 2003) would decrease transmural pressure in more distal arteries (Abboud and Eckstein, 1966) and protect them from redistribution of transmural pressure during HU. Hindlimb Unloading Had Diverse Effects in Two Functionally Different Vascular Beds of the Rat Hindlimb In the hindlimb, 2-week exposure to HU impaired sympathetic nerve-mediated vasoconstriction while enhancing the sensitivity of smooth muscle to the adrenergic agonist noradrenaline in cutaneous arteries. The higher constrictor sensitivity of cutaneous arteries was also observed after endothelium removal and with the application of the non-adrenergic agonist serotonin, pointing to its independence of the type of activated receptors in smooth muscle cells. These data suggest the development of non-specific hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to constrictor stimulation, which may result from the deficiency in its sympathetic control. This suggestion is based on several observations from the present and earlier published studies: (1) the higher sensitivity to constrictors was observed in densely innervated saphenous artery but not in the sparsely innervated sural artery; (2) HU reduced the density of adrenergic plexus in saphenous arteries; and (3) denervated vessels are well-known to become hyper-sensitive to various constrictor agonists and high-K+ depolarization (Bevan, 1984; Bentzer et al., 1997; Tarasova et al., 2006). Post-denervation hyper-sensitivity occurs without changes in total density or affinity of post-junctional α1-adrenoceptors (Dalessandri et al., 1991; Taki et al., 2004), indicating its mechanisms of effect are downstream to the receptors and may include depolarization of smooth muscle cells (Fleming, 1999), facilitation of L-type Ca2+-channel-dependent signaling (Heumann et al., 2016), Ca2+-sensitization of smooth muscle contractile machinery (Puzdrova et al., 2014), and altered cell-to-cell coupling (Slovut et al., 2004). Taken together, these observations allow the conclusion that the shortage of sympathetic influences may govern functional remodeling of arteries subjected to gravitational unloading. In our opinion, the effect of HU on saphenous artery sympathetic innervation is due in part to a drop in transmural pressure in hindlimb arteries during long-term anti-orthostasis (Colleran et al., 2000). It is well-known that the functional state of postganglionic nerve fibers and the density of sympathetic innervation is controlled by target tissue-derived trophic factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF) (Creedon and Tuttle, 1991; Thrasivoulou and Cowen, 1995). For example, it has been shown that NGF secretion by vascular smooth muscle cells in cell culture increases with stretch (Clemow et al., 2000). Presumably, the production of NGF under in vivo conditions is also dependent on the stretch induced by the transmural pressure. A chronic decrease in transmural pressure in the saphenous artery of HU rats could suppress NGF production and, therefore, result in the decrease of adrenergic nerve plexus density. We have shown previously that chronic hindquarter hypotension (induced by partial occlusion of the abdominal aorta distal to the renal arteries) has negative effects on sympathetic innervation of the rat saphenous artery (Tarasova et al., 2006). Interestingly, an opposite change of innervation density was demonstrated in the rat saphenous artery after the 2-week experimental orthostatic body position (Monos et al., 2001). Results from the present study thus indicate that chronic decreases in transmural pressure worsens sympathetic vasomotor control at the prejunctional level, but at the same time, increases vessel reactivity to noradrenaline, a principal transmitter of the sympathetic nerves. Further work should be conducted to determine whether noradrenaline release during activation of the sympathetic nerves in skin arteries differs between control and HU rats to better characterize how sympathetic neural control of peripheral resistance is altered. In contrast to cutaneous arteries, we did not find any effect of transmural pressure changes on the adrenergic nerve plexus in the sural artery, probably due to the already low density of its innervation in control rats. However, we suggest that such effects of pressure to decrease the innervation density at distal part of skeletal muscle arterial tree may occur, since the more distal resistance arteries have a higher density of innervation. Indeed, a decrease in the innervation density was observed in hindlimb muscle arterioles in rats after a 4-week HU (Zhang, 2001). This suggestion is supported by our findings of a reduced integral response of perfused rat hindlimb vascular bed to the stimulation of sympathetic nerves (Rodionov et al., 1999). Our findings indicate that the precision in which the sympathetic nervous system controls peripheral resistance and cutaneous perfusion is compromised in HU rats. Importantly, a decreased vascular sensitivity to sympathetic influences has been observed in humans following space flight (Fu et al., 2002). A smaller increase in lower limb arterial resistance was observed in cosmonauts during infight and postflight lower body negative pressure (LBNP) test (Herault et al., 2000). In contrast, forelimb subcutaneous vascular response to LBNP was more pronounced after 10-day-long space flight than during preflight (Gabrielsen et al., 1995). Although the present study is limited to an animal model used to simulate spaceflight, it provides a mechanistic explanation of the link between the state of sympathetic vascular control with the prevailing changes in transmural pressure thought to occur in astronauts and cosmonauts.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion A novel result of this study is that simulated microgravity differentially affects the skin and skeletal muscle arteries in the hindlimb. Functional alterations in the vasoconstrictor responses of sparsely innervated skeletal muscle arteries appear to primarily result from the direct effects of physical forces acting on smooth muscle or endothelial cells to induce a gross structural remodeling of these arteries. However, functional changes in the densely innervated cutaneous arteries appear to be mainly governed by the effect of transmural pressure on periarterial sympathetic innervation. If similar adaptations occur in the peripheral vasculature of human cosmonauts and astronauts, such changes could underlie the weaker arterial vasoconstriction during activation of the sympathetic nerves, as well as serve as a mechanism of reduced vascular resistance and orthostatic intolerance following a return to Earth.",

Copyright notice ID: 7339929 PMID: 32695017 Abstract Introduction: Mechanical forces and sympathetic influences are key determinants of vascular structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and skin. Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and saphenous) were examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion and glyoxylic acid staining. Results: HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery diameter was not affected. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls. Conclusion: HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight. Keywords: microgravity, hindlimb unloading, rat, small arteries, remodeling, sympathetic innervation, noradrenaline, serotoninIntroduction The vascular system is constantly exposed to mechanical forces such as transmural pressure and shear stress, the latter of which is created by flowing blood on the endothelial cell lining of the vessel. Prolonged changes in these factors govern gross structural remodeling of blood vessels, which in turn affects their functional characteristics. For example, previous work has shown that chronic increases in transmural pressure induce hypertrophy of the vascular wall and increases in vessel contractility, while decreases in pressure result in the opposite changes (Folkow, 1982). Chronic increases in shear stress, in turn, lead to structural increases in maximal diameter, whereas decreases in shear result in a narrowing of the vessel lumen (Langille, 1993; Pourageaud and De Mey, 1997). The cardiovascular system of all terrestrial inhabitants is adapted to the gravitational field of the Earth and changes significantly in conditions of weightlessness (Watenpaugh and Hargens, 1996). Importantly, redistribution of transmural pressures and flows within the arterial vasculature during space flight or simulated microgravity is known to initiate different adaptations in vessels from different anatomic regions (Zhang, 2001, 2013). In humans, exposure to long term head-down bed rest was shown to reduce intimal-medial thickness and lumen diameter of arterial vessels in lower extremities, in contrast to upper extremity and cranial arteries (Bleeker et al., 2005; Platts et al., 2009). The model of hindlimb unloading (HU) in rats is commonly used to study the mechanisms of microgravity effects on different body systems, including vasculature (Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016). Even relatively small change in hydrostatic pressure gradient, as observed in the rat body with this model (Colleran et al., 2000), results in different vascular alterations in rostral and caudal parts of the body. Similar to microgravity effects in human vascular system, rat hindlimb arteries commonly demonstrate wall thinning and lumen reduction, in contrast to cranial arteries (Wilkerson et al., 1999; Delp et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2004; Stabley et al., 2013). Data from the literature also provide the evidence that transmural pressure shifts cannot explain all effects of simulated microgravity on vascular characteristics, because vascular alterations in HU rats may differ in functionally different vascular beds within the same part of the body. This was shown in studies of vascular dimensions and reactivity of arterioles from postural (soleus) and phasic (gastrocnemius) hindlimb muscles (Delp et al., 2000), as well as arterioles from white (glycolytic) and red (oxidative) parts from the same gastrocnemius muscle (Heaps and Bowles, 2002) of HU rats. Obviously, such diverse effects of HU on the arterial vasculature within and among postural and phasic muscles are largely the result of differential alterations in muscle activity and blood flow during the conditions of disuse (McDonald et al., 1992). Structural and functional changes in the vascular bed could also result from the influence of sympathetic nervous system. In addition to acute control of vessel diameter and blood flow, neurotransmitters from the sympathetic nerves exert a trophic effect on the vasculature (Bevan, 1984; Puzdrova et al., 2014; Adeoye et al., 2015). The severity of trophic sympathetic influence in certain vascular bed may depend on the density of its innervation and/or on the efferent sympathetic traffic it receives. In addition, the state of the vascular neuroeffector apparatus has been shown to depend on the prevailing level of transmural pressure and, therefore, may be affected in the conditions of microgravity (Monos et al., 2001; Zhang, 2001; Puzdrova et al., 2009). In contrast to the skeletal muscle circulation, the cutaneous circulation is regulated by a smaller contribution from metabolic vasomotor mechanisms and a higher role of sympathetic control, including a greater sympathetic vasoconstriction of small cutaneous arteries relative to that in skeletal muscle (Tarasova et al., 2003). However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the effects of simulated microgravity via HU on the structural and functional properties of cutaneous arteries, nor contrasted these effects in the forelimb and hindlimb circulations. Therefore, this study tested the hypothesis that HU exerts diverse effects on the neurovascular density, structural properties, and functional vasoconstrictor responsiveness of skeletal muscle and cutaneous feed arteries in the rat forelimb and hindlimb regions.Materials and Methods All the procedures were conducted in accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (Eighth edition, 2011). The procedures were approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences (protocol N224). Animals Male Wistar rats (2.5–3-month-old) were obtained from the breeder of the Institute of Biomedical Problems and housed in laboratory animal unit at the Faculty of Biology, M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University in controlled conditions of temperature (22–24°C) and light-dark cycle (12–12 h) with ad libitum access to water and standard chow diet (Laboratorkorm, Russia). After 1-week acclimatization to the environment, the rats were randomly assigned to the cage control (n = 10) and HU (n = 10) groups. In HU group, the hindlimbs of the rat were elevated with a hook attached to the proximal third of the tail with adhesive material. The hook was connected by a harness to a swivel apparatus at the top of the cage. The height of the hindquarter elevation was adjusted to prevent the hindlimbs from touching the supporting surfaces, resulting in a suspension angle of 35–40°. The forelimbs maintained the contact with the floor surface, which allowed the animals full range of motion. The animals were housed individually in cages of 50 cm × 50 cm × 50 cm. Animals remained under HU or control conditions for a total of 14 days. This duration of HU was shown to provide the stable changes in muscle weight and blood flow in rats (McDonald et al., 1992). No signs of ischemia or damage of the tail skin were observed during HU. After 2 weeks of HU, the animals were sacrificed by decapitation under CO2 anesthesia and the arteries were dissected free from surrounding tissue. Two arteries were isolated from the forelimb (deep brachial artery and median artery) and two arteries from the hindlimb (sural artery and saphenous artery). These feed arteries provide blood flow to skeletal muscle (brachial and sural arteries) and predominantly to the skin (median and saphenous arteries). Brachial and median arteries were dissected from the right forelimb for myography experiments. Sural arteries from right and left hindlimbs were used for myography experiments and histochemical examination, respectively. Right saphenous artery from each rat was used for wire myography (distal part) and histochemical examination (proximal part), while the artery from the left hindlimb was studied in perfusion experiments.Wire Myography Two neighboring segments with a length of 2 mm were cut from each type of artery and mounted in wire myograph system (DMT, Denmark, 410A or 620 model) for isometric force recoding at well-defined internal circumferences. Endothelium was gently removed from one of the segments by rubbing with a rat whisker. The preparations were kept at 37°C in physiological salt solution containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 4.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.0 MgSO4, 1.6 CaCl2, 5.5 D-glucose, 0.025 EDTA, and 5 HEPES, equilibrated with gas mixture 5% CO2 + 95% O2 to maintain pH 7.4. Force readings were continuously recorded at 10 Hz sampling rate using E14-140 analog-to-digital data converter (L-Card, Russia) and PowerGraph 3.3 software (DISoft, Russia). Fully relaxed arterial segments were gradually stretched to d100, the inner diameter equivalent to a transmural pressure of 100 mmHg, and then set to 0.9d100, where maximal active force is developed (Mulvany and Halpern, 1977). The arteries were activated three times with noradrenaline (10−6 M, Sigma). Functional integrity of the endothelium was checked by application of acetylcholine (10−6 M, Sigma) on top of noradrenaline-induced contraction (3 × 10−7 M). Endothelium-intact preparations relaxed in response to acetylcholine by at least 50% of the precontraction level and the relaxation response of endothelium-denuded preparations was not larger than 10%. The experimental protocol included consecutively performed concentration-response relationships to noradrenaline (10−8 – 3 × 10−5 М, Sigma) and serotonin (3 × 10−8 – 3 × 10−5 М, Sigma) with 30-min washout interval between them. The agonists were given cumulatively in half-log increments. The responses to noradrenaline were studied in the presence of propranolol (10−6 M, Sigma), to prevent relaxation mediated by β-adrenoceptors. During data analysis, active force values were calculated by subtracting the passive force value (recorded in the preparation with fully relaxed smooth muscle) from all recorded force values (before the first and at each noradrenaline or serotonin concentration). Then, respective values of active wall tension were calculated as T=F/2l, where T is tension, F is active force and l is the segment length. The concentration-response relationships were fitted to a sigmoidal function with variable slope using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (La Jolla, CA, USA) to calculate pD2 values (the negative logarithm of EC50). Inner diameter of each artery (d100) was estimated from its passive length-tension relationship.Constant-Pressure Perfusion A segment of the saphenous artery was isolated, placed into the tissue bath, and cannulated at both ends. The vessel fragment length between the cannulae was about 5–6 mm. Krebs-Henseleit physiological salt solution was used for perfusion and superfusion (NaCl 119 mM, KCl 4.7 mM, CaCl2 2.5 mM, MgSO4 1.17 mM, NaHCO3 25 mM, KH2PO4 1.18 mM, D-glucose 5.5 mM, EDTA 0.026 mM, 37°C, and 95% O2 + 5% CO2). Artery was perfused under a constant pressure; input and output pressures were measured continuously using two pressure transducers (BLPR2, World Precision Instruments, USA) and kept at 60 and 50 mmHg, respectively. Volume flow rate was measured with 1N type transducer connected to transit-time flowmeter (Transonic Systems Inc., USA). All parameters were permanently recorded at 20 Hz sampling rate using E14-140 analog-to-digital data converter (L-Card, Russia) and PowerGraph 3.3 software (DISoft, Russia). Intramural nerves were stimulated with rectangular electric pulses of changing polarity, with amplitude of 200–300 mA and 0.2 ms duration. All the effects of electrical stimulation could be blocked by tetrodotoxin (3 μM, Sigma), thus indicating the neurogenic origin of the response. Electric pulse frequency was 4, 8, or 12 Hz, the stimulation lasted for 30 s, and 3-min intervals were applied between the stimulations. Data analysis was performed using a custom program working under MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., USA). The constrictor response was evaluated as a relative change of the intralumen diameter (D), which was calculated by Poiseuille equation: D=l·Q/ΔP4, l, length of the vessel segment between canulae; Q, volume flow rate; and ΔP, the difference between input and output pressures.Glyoxylic Acid Staining for Periarterial Adrenergic Innervation Segments of saphenous and sural arteries were cut lengthwise and placed in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.2) supplemented with 2% glyoxylic acid, 10% sucrose, and 0.03% Pontamine Sky Blue (Puzdrova et al., 2009). After a 30-min incubation, the preparation was flattened on the slide with the adventitia upward, dried (30 min in jet of warm air and 5 min at 100°C), and overlaid with mineral oil and covered with a cover glass. A LUMAM R3 microscope (LOMO, USSR; eyepiece ×7, objective lens ×40) was used for visualization. The exciting light wavelength was 380–440 nm; the luminescence wavelength was 480–700 nm. The plexus density was estimated with a grid that covered a field of 300 × 300 μm on the preparation and consisted of 24 rows, each containing 22–23 round markers (the ratio of marker diameter to space between markers was 1:2.5). Counting was performed in three randomly selected fields and the results were averaged.Statistical Data Analysis Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0. The normality of the data distribution was confirmed using D’Agostino-Pearson test. Unpaired Student’s t-test or Repeated Measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used, as appropriate. Statistical significance was reached at p < 0.05. All data are given as mean ± S.E.M. and n represents the number of animals.Results Body Weight At the beginning of the experiment, body weights of rats from control and HU groups were 316 ± 6 g (n = 10) and 310 ± 9 g (n = 10), respectively (p > 0.05). Within 2 weeks, control group increased body weight to 376 ± 14 g (n = 10) and HU group to 353 ± 6 g (n = 10). No difference in body weight was observed between the two experimental groups at the end of the experiment (p > 0.05, control vs. HU).Inner Diameter of the Arteries Both forelimb arteries from HU rats had larger inner diameters compared to the respective arteries from control rats (Table 1). However, when calculated as percentage of the mean value in control group, the increment of diameter in the brachial artery was more prominent compared to the median artery: 22.5 ± 3.0 and 10.2 ± 3.8%, respectively (p < 0.05).

In contrast, sural arteries of HU rats demonstrated a decrease of inner diameter (by 17.9 ± 4.7%) compared to the arteries of control rats (Table 1). The diameter of saphenous artery was not affected by HU (Table 1).Contractile Responses of Forelimb Arteries Contractile responses of brachial arteries were greater in HU rats compared to that in control rats. This was observed when endothelium-intact segments of brachial arteries were exposed to noradrenaline (Figure 1A) or serotonin (Figure 1B). Endothelium removal did not change the differences in brachial artery contractile responses between HU and control rats (Figures 1C,D). Most prominent effects of HU on brachial artery contractility were observed when the agonists were applied in near-maximal to maximal concentrations. The sensitivity of endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded brachial artery preparations to vasoconstrictors was not altered by HU (Table 2). Figure 1.

Contractile responses of median artery segments to noradrenaline and serotonin were not different in HU rats compared to control rats regardless of the presence of the endothelium (Figure 2). The sensitivity of median artery segments to both vasoconstrictors was also similar in control and HU rats (Table 2). Figure 2.

This decrease was observed in both endothelium-intact (Figures 3A,B) and endothelium-denuded (Figures 3C,D) segments of sural artery from HU rats compared to control rats. Again, most prominent effect of HU on contractile responses was observed with the higher concentrations of the agonists, while the sensitivity of sural arteries to contractile stimuli was not altered by HU (Table 2). Figure 3. Open in a new tab HU decreases contractile responses of skeletal muscle feed arteries from the rat hindlimb.

HU did not alter saphenous artery maximum contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin (Figure 4), but rather elevated the sensitivity of this artery to vasoconstrictors (Table 2). Figure 4.

HU had no effect on innervation density in the sural artery (Figure 5A) but decreased it by about 20% in the saphenous artery (Figures 5A,B). Figure 5. Open in a new tab HU worsens sympathetic control in skin but not skeletal muscle feed arteries from rat hindlimb.

(C) Constrictor responses of isobarically perfused saphenous arteries from control (n = 5) and HU (n = 5) rats to electrical field stimulation of intramural nerves with graded frequencies. * p < 0.05 HU vs. control.The effects of HU on sympathetic control of the saphenous artery were studied with the use of perfusion technique. In the absence of nerve stimulation, solution flow rate values did not differ in control and HU rats: 3.9 ± 0.18 and 4.1 ± 0.18 ml/min, respectively. The relative decreases of arterial inner diameter caused by 8 and 12 Hz stimulation were lower in HU rats compared to that in controls (Figure 5C).Discussion The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 2 weeks of simulated microgravity on skeletal muscle and skin feed arteries from the rat forelimb and hindlimb regions. We hypothesized that HU exerts diverse effects on the sympathetic innervation density, structural properties, and functional vasoconstrictor responsiveness of skeletal muscle and cutaneous feed arteries. The data indicate that HU induces increases in maximal lumen diameter and vasoconstrictor responsiveness in forelimb skeletal muscle arteries, but decreases in these structural and functional properties in hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. In the cutaneous vasculature of the forelimbs and hindlimbs, alterations in the structure and vasoconstrictor properties either did not occur or were of smaller magnitude than that occurring in the skeletal muscle arteries from the same region of the body. Exposure to HU also diminished sympathetic nerve density and impaired vasoconstriction induced by sympathetic nerve stimulation in hindlimb cutaneous, but not skeletal muscle arteries. However, vasoconstrictor responses of hindlimb cutaneous arteries to direct smooth muscle stimulation by vasoconstrictor agonists exhibited greater sensitivity in the HU rats. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the complexity of vascular adaptations to simulated microgravity is much greater than previously described. Vascular alterations not only differentially occur between regions of the body, but also within those regions, and can be functionally related to physical alterations in sympathetic nerve density and gross structural remodeling of resistance arteries. Both the forelimbs and hindlimbs of the rat perform functions of support and locomotion, which suggest these two different anatomical regions of the body share similar inherent characteristics that include skeletal muscle and cutaneous circulations. Additionally, systemic humoral influences would not differ in forelimb and hindlimb arteries of the same rat. Alterations in nerve traffic during HU exposure would also likely be equalized between the same-type arteries in the forelimbs and hindlimbs, since functional specialization of efferent sympathetic pathways is organotypic rather than somatotopic (Jänig and McLachlan, 1992; Jänig and Häbler, 2003). Therefore, the design of this study allowed us to separate adaptive arterial responses to the anti-orthostatic body position and redistribution of support and muscle activity from other effects associated with the HU model, including social isolation, restraint, and the development of neuroendocrine stress (Tsvirkun et al., 2012). Hindlimb Unloading Induces Contrasting Structural and Functional Adaptations in Forelimb and Hindlimb Skeletal Muscle Arteries HU exposure resulted in divergent alterations of forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries, i.e., lumen diameter and wall contractility (maximal active tension) increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb. The changes in contractility were independent of the vascular endothelium and not associated with the change in smooth muscle sensitivity to contractile stimulation by noradrenaline or serotonin. These data point to non-specific amplification of smooth muscle contractile responses in forelimb arteries, presumably resulting from smooth muscle hypertrophy and media wall thickening. In contrast, non-specific attenuation of smooth muscle contractile responses takes place in hindlimb arteries, presumably resulting from smooth muscle atrophy and a thinning of the medial wall (Delp et al., 2000). Previous work has shown that HU in rats is associated with ~10 mmHg gradient between aortic and hindlimb arterial pressures (Colleran et al., 2000). Therefore, arterial transmural pressure in HU rats is elevated in the forelimb region and reduced in the hindlimbs; this pressure differential presumably governs the divergent alterations in media thickness (Wilkerson et al., 1999; Stabley et al., 2012). The mechanisms which mediate the effects of transmural pressure on media remodeling may include the secretion of angiotensin II from vascular smooth muscle cells with further stimulation of MAPK cascades (Eskildsen-Helmond and Mulvany, 2003). Importantly, HU was shown to stimulate the activity of vascular renin-angiotensin system in cranial arteries, but depress it in femoral arteries (Bao et al., 2007; Zhang, 2013). In support of the present data, wall thickness and medial cross-section area were shown to be diminished in resistance arteries associated with the anterior tibial (Sun et al., 2004) and gastrocnemius (Delp et al., 2000) muscles in the hindlimbs of HU rats. In addition, chronic increases in blood flow/shear stress in loaded forelimb muscles and chronic decreases in unloaded hindlimb muscles induce divergent changes in maximal passive diameter of arteries (Delp et al., 2000; Stabley et al., 2013). Similar results have also been found in human models used to simulate microgravity. For instance, long-duration (up to 60 days) head-down bed rest has been reported to reduce intimal-medial thickness in the anterior tibial artery (Platts et al., 2009), as well as lumen diameter of the femoral artery and its branch (Bleeker et al., 2005). Therefore, these results indicate that the gross structural adaptations of skeletal muscle arteries in HU rats and humans undergoing head-down bed rest are mainly induced by the influence of mechanical forces. In both the forelimbs and hindlimbs, cutaneous arteries were less affected by HU, as compared to skeletal muscle arteries from the same region of the body. These results may be attributed to several factors. First, cutaneous blood flow would not be as greatly affected by changes in postural support and low level physical activity as that of the skeletal muscle, particularly given the rapid and profound changes in skeletal muscle vascular resistance associated with increases and decreases in muscle activity (Delp, 1999). Second, the profile of blood pressure changes within the cutaneous vasculature may differ from that within the skeletal muscle vascular tree. A prominent constriction of proximal cutaneous arteries during sympathetic activation (Tarasova et al., 2003) would decrease transmural pressure in more distal arteries (Abboud and Eckstein, 1966) and protect them from redistribution of transmural pressure during HU.Hindlimb Unloading Had Diverse Effects in Two Functionally Different Vascular Beds of the Rat Hindlimb In the hindlimb, 2-week exposure to HU impaired sympathetic nerve-mediated vasoconstriction while enhancing the sensitivity of smooth muscle to the adrenergic agonist noradrenaline in cutaneous arteries. The higher constrictor sensitivity of cutaneous arteries was also observed after endothelium removal and with the application of the non-adrenergic agonist serotonin, pointing to its independence of the type of activated receptors in smooth muscle cells. These data suggest the development of non-specific hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to constrictor stimulation, which may result from the deficiency in its sympathetic control. This suggestion is based on several observations from the present and earlier published studies: (1) the higher sensitivity to constrictors was observed in densely innervated saphenous artery but not in the sparsely innervated sural artery; (2) HU reduced the density of adrenergic plexus in saphenous arteries; and (3) denervated vessels are well-known to become hyper-sensitive to various constrictor agonists and high-K+ depolarization (Bevan, 1984; Bentzer et al., 1997; Tarasova et al., 2006). Post-denervation hyper-sensitivity occurs without changes in total density or affinity of post-junctional α1-adrenoceptors (Dalessandri et al., 1991; Taki et al., 2004), indicating its mechanisms of effect are downstream to the receptors and may include depolarization of smooth muscle cells (Fleming, 1999), facilitation of L-type Ca2+-channel-dependent signaling (Heumann et al., 2016), Ca2+-sensitization of smooth muscle contractile machinery (Puzdrova et al., 2014), and altered cell-to-cell coupling (Slovut et al., 2004). Taken together, these observations allow the conclusion that the shortage of sympathetic influences may govern functional remodeling of arteries subjected to gravitational unloading. In our opinion, the effect of HU on saphenous artery sympathetic innervation is due in part to a drop in transmural pressure in hindlimb arteries during long-term anti-orthostasis (Colleran et al., 2000). It is well-known that the functional state of postganglionic nerve fibers and the density of sympathetic innervation is controlled by target tissue-derived trophic factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF) (Creedon and Tuttle, 1991; Thrasivoulou and Cowen, 1995). For example, it has been shown that NGF secretion by vascular smooth muscle cells in cell culture increases with stretch (Clemow et al., 2000). Presumably, the production of NGF under in vivo conditions is also dependent on the stretch induced by the transmural pressure. A chronic decrease in transmural pressure in the saphenous artery of HU rats could suppress NGF production and, therefore, result in the decrease of adrenergic nerve plexus density. We have shown previously that chronic hindquarter hypotension (induced by partial occlusion of the abdominal aorta distal to the renal arteries) has negative effects on sympathetic innervation of the rat saphenous artery (Tarasova et al., 2006). Interestingly, an opposite change of innervation density was demonstrated in the rat saphenous artery after the 2-week experimental orthostatic body position (Monos et al., 2001). Results from the present study thus indicate that chronic decreases in transmural pressure worsens sympathetic vasomotor control at the prejunctional level, but at the same time, increases vessel reactivity to noradrenaline, a principal transmitter of the sympathetic nerves. Further work should be conducted to determine whether noradrenaline release during activation of the sympathetic nerves in skin arteries differs between control and HU rats to better characterize how sympathetic neural control of peripheral resistance is altered. In contrast to cutaneous arteries, we did not find any effect of transmural pressure changes on the adrenergic nerve plexus in the sural artery, probably due to the already low density of its innervation in control rats. However, we suggest that such effects of pressure to decrease the innervation density at distal part of skeletal muscle arterial tree may occur, since the more distal resistance arteries have a higher density of innervation. Indeed, a decrease in the innervation density was observed in hindlimb muscle arterioles in rats after a 4-week HU (Zhang, 2001). This suggestion is supported by our findings of a reduced integral response of perfused rat hindlimb vascular bed to the stimulation of sympathetic nerves (Rodionov et al., 1999). Our findings indicate that the precision in which the sympathetic nervous system controls peripheral resistance and cutaneous perfusion is compromised in HU rats. Importantly, a decreased vascular sensitivity to sympathetic influences has been observed in humans following space flight (Fu et al., 2002). A smaller increase in lower limb arterial resistance was observed in cosmonauts during infight and postflight lower body negative pressure (LBNP) test (Herault et al., 2000). In contrast, forelimb subcutaneous vascular response to LBNP was more pronounced after 10-day-long space flight than during preflight (Gabrielsen et al., 1995). Although the present study is limited to an animal model used to simulate spaceflight, it provides a mechanistic explanation of the link between the state of sympathetic vascular control with the prevailing changes in transmural pressure thought to occur in astronauts and cosmonauts.Conclusion A novel result of this study is that simulated microgravity differentially affects the skin and skeletal muscle arteries in the hindlimb. Functional alterations in the vasoconstrictor responses of sparsely innervated skeletal muscle arteries appear to primarily result from the direct effects of physical forces acting on smooth muscle or endothelial cells to induce a gross structural remodeling of these arteries. However, functional changes in the densely innervated cutaneous arteries appear to be mainly governed by the effect of transmural pressure on periarterial sympathetic innervation. If similar adaptations occur in the peripheral vasculature of human cosmonauts and astronauts, such changes could underlie the weaker arterial vasoconstriction during activation of the sympathetic nerves, as well as serve as a mechanism of reduced vascular resistance and orthostatic intolerance following a return to Earth.Data Availability Statement The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.Ethics Statement The animal study was reviewed and approved by Biomedical Ethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences.Author Contributions OT, AB, VG, MD, and OV conceived and designed the study.
