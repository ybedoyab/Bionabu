    "abstract": "Abstract There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n=11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The adult skeleton undergoes continuous bone remodeling, a sequential process that involves bone resorption followed by bone formation. Bone mineral density (BMD), a commonly used index of bone mass in adults, is maintained over time when bone formation is efficiently coupled to the prevailing rate of bone resorption. Bone loss occurs when there is an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption where resorption predominates. Bone loss is a common occurrence among astronauts during long-duration spaceflight. The reduction of BMD is generally associated with an increase in biochemical markers of bone resorption with no change in biochemical markers in bone formation.1–3 These findings suggest that spaceflight results in a defect in the coupling of bone formation to bone resorption.4 The precise mechanism for this is unknown. Bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) has generated considerable recent interest as a putative negative regulator of bone formation.5 Fat accumulates in bone marrow during prolonged bed rest,6 a ground-based human model for spaceflight. Although fat accumulation in bone marrow has not been verified in astronauts, an increase in MAT has been observed in rodents following spaceflight.7,8 Adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stromal cells. Based primarily on cell culture studies, some investigators have concluded that increased adipocyte differentiation inevitably occurs at the expense of osteoblast differentiation.9–11 If correct, then the increase in bone marrow adiposity during spaceflight may reflect a shift in the differentiation program of stromal cells from osteoblasts to adipocytes. This may prevent normal coupling of bone formation to the prevailing level of bone resorption and thus have a causative role in the negative bone remodeling balance. The anticipated consequence of this mechanism is reduced generation of osteoblasts. There is an alternative, non-mutually exclusive mechanism by which increased MAT can negatively influence bone metabolism. More than 50 adipocyte-derived adipokines, growth factors, and proinflammatory cytokines have been identified, including interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). IL-1β inhibits bone formation and stimulates bone resorption,12 and mRNA levels for IL-1β were shown to be increased in tibia in rats flown aboard STS-62 (ref. 13). Thus, factors produced in bone marrow during spaceflight could reduce bone formation by (1) slowing the rate of osteoblast appearance onto bone surfaces, (2) increasing the rate of osteoblast disappearance from bone surfaces, or (3) inhibiting osteoblast activity. One or both mechanisms could perpetuate a cycle where increasing MAT would lead to progressive bone loss during prolonged spaceflight. The present study, using archived vertebrae from rats flown on STS-62, utilized a novel approach to challenge these mechanisms by evaluating the association between bone resorption, MAT accumulation, and osteoblast kinetics in sexually mature ovariectomized (OVX) rats subjected to a 14-day spaceflight.",

    "discussion": "Discussion Fourteen days of spaceflight resulted in reduced cancellous bone in the lumbar vertebrae of OVX rats. The bone loss was associated with increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter and decreased preflight fluorochrome label length. In addition, spaceflight resulted in increased vertebral MAT due to increased adipocyte number and adipocyte size. In contrast, spaceflight had no effect on indices of osteoblast differentiation, turnover, or activity. Lumbar vertebrae were not available from animals killed on the day of launch. As baseline bone measurements were not obtained, it is possible that the lower cancellous bone in the flight animals was due to reduced accrual of cancellous bone during flight. However, this possibility is remote as it is well established that cancellous bone does not increase following OVX in 3-month-old rats.14 Therefore, the lower cancellous bone in the flight rats likely represents bone loss over and above that due to OVX. This conclusion is further supported by the previously documented reduction in cancellous bone in tibia in the same animals where baseline bones were available for analysis.15 On the basis of the increase in osteoclast perimeter and reduced length of the preflight fluorochrome label, the cancellous bone loss during spaceflight occurred as a consequence of increased bone resorption. OVX rats experience greatly elevated cancellous bone turnover and fluorochrome label resorption as clearly illustrated by the presence of osteoclasts adjacent to the preflight label (Figure 4). Increased resorption of a preflight fluorochrome label during spaceflight was previously reported in tibia in same animals.15 Furthermore, Vico et al.16 reported increased osteoclast numbers in pregnant rats following a 5-day spaceflight. We are unaware of other studies investigating the effects of spaceflight on bone metabolism in female rats. The effects of spaceflight on MAT have not been studied in detail. Spaceflight was reported to increase MAT in growing male rats but adipocyte number and size were not determined in these studies.7,8,17 In the present study, the increase in MAT was primarily due to an increase in number of adipocytes. We interpret this as evidence that spaceflight results in increased differentiation of progenitor cells to adipocytes. There was, however, an increase in size that contributed to the overall increase in adiposity. This may be relevant because increased adipocyte size is associated with adipocyte dysfunction.18 Spaceflight had no effect on mineral apposition rate, suggesting that the activity of osteoblasts present on bone surfaces at launch was not altered. Spaceflight had no effect on bone perimeter with osteoblasts adjacent to fluorochrome label, suggesting that the interval during which osteoblasts deposit matrix onto bone surfaces was not altered. Last, spaceflight did not alter the extent of bone perimeter lined by osteoblasts with no adjacent label. We interpret this as evidence that spaceflight did not alter the rate of appearance of new osteoblasts onto bone surface. These results are consistent with and extend those of Cavolina et al., where no changes in osteoblast perimeter, bone formation or expression of genes related to osteoblast function were observed following spaceflight.15 In addition, spaceflight increased interferon gamma (IFNγ) expression in tibia in these animals.12 IFNγ is produced by mesenchymal cells as well as innate and adaptive cells in the immune system and has been reported to increase bone formation and inhibit fat infiltration into bone marrow in OVX mice.19 Taken together, these findings indicate that MAT influx during spaceflight does not reduce osteoblast differentiation, activity or lifespan. Potentially, this is due to counter regulatory increases in cytokines that oppose adipogenesis and promote osteoblastogenesis. OVX typically results in increased turnover of cancellous bone. OVX-induced bone loss is limited to skeletal sites, such as the proximal tibial metaphysis and lumbar vertebra, where the increase in bone formation is inadequate to compensate for the increase in bone resorption.20,21 In contrast, spaceflight resulted in an increase in bone resorption with no increase in bone formation in lumbar vertebra and in proximal tibia metaphysis.15 These findings support the possibility that lineage redirection of stromal cells to adipocytes during spaceflight contributes to defective coupling of bone formation to increased bone resorption. The effects of spaceflight on cancellous bone turnover may be influenced by endocrine status. Bone turnover in normal female rats has not been evaluated following spaceflight. However, OVX and ovary-intact rats have been evaluated following hindlimb unloading, a ground-based model that replicates some of the skeletal effects of spaceflight.22 Although hindlimb unloading resulted in bone loss in OVX as well as ovary-intact rats, the cellular mechanisms were not identical. Specifically, cancellous bone loss in OVX rats was predominantly due to increased bone resorption, whereas bone loss in ovary-intact rats was due to a combination of increased bone resorption and reduced bone formation.23,24 A reduction in estrogen signaling in the skeleton results in increased bone turnover and cancellous bone loss.25 Reproductive changes during or post flight have not been systematically studied in women, but in female adult mice spaceflight induced cessation of cycling, loss of corpora lutea, and reduced estrogen receptor mRNA levels in the uterus.26 Most spaceflight studies have been performed using growing male rats. Reduced bone formation from decreased osteoblast number and activity has been observed in these animals.8,27–29 Although no spaceflight experiments comparing gender have been conducted, direct comparison of the skeletal response of normal male and female rats approaching skeletal maturity (6 months old) to hindlimb unloading did not detect gender differences.23 Therefore, it seems more likely high cancellous bone turnover rate and/or change in endocrine status induced by OVX modifies how bone cells respond to microgravity. This is in agreement with previous studies reporting that estrogen regulates the rate of bone turnover independent of gravitational loading. The difference in response may be important because endocrine status could influence the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent bone loss during long-duration spaceflight.21 In summary, we conclude that the increase in MAT during short-duration spaceflight does not impair osteoblast activity, reduce the interval osteoblasts are present on bone surfaces or decrease generation of new osteoblasts. These findings argue against the hypothesis that increased MAT produces factors that suppress bone formation. Although increased MAT did not impact osteoblast kinetics or bone formation, it is important to note that bone formation did not increase during spaceflight to compensate for the increase in bone resorption. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, osteoblast precursors are diverted to adipocytes instead of osteoblasts during spaceflight.",

This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, osteoblast precursors are diverted to adipocytes instead of osteoblasts during spaceflight.Materials and methods Experimental design The experimental protocol was approved by the NASA Animal Care and Use Committee, and animals were maintained in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Twelve-week-old female Fischer 344 rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA) were used in the study. The rats were OVX 14 days prior to launch and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (n=12 per group): (1) ground-based control (ground control) or (2) spaceflight (flight). The flight animals were flown on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-62) for 14 days. All animals were housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM) with 6 rats per AEM. The AEMs were maintained at 28 °C. Food (Teklad L356 food bars; Teklad, Madison, WI, USA) and water were provided ad libitum to all animals. Rats received one calcein injection (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) one day prior to launch to label mineralizing bone matrix. The rats were killed by decapitation on the day of landing and bones were collected and placed in 70% ethanol for analysis.Histomorphometry Second lumbar vertebrae from 11 rats per group were available for evaluation. The bones were prepared for histological analysis as described.30 In brief, specimens were dehydrated in increased concentrations of ethanol and embedded in a mixture of methyl methacrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate (in a 12.5:1 ratio). Five-micrometer-thin sections were then cut on a microtome (model 2065, Reichert-Jung, Heidelberg, Germany) and stained with toluidine blue (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA). The staining technique allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and fluorochrome label. The effects of spaceflight on bone resorption and osteoblast turnover (Figure 4) were evaluated using a novel approach. Specifically, the preflight fluorochrome label was used to identify bone perimeter undergoing mineralization in preflight animals experiencing normal weight bearing. Because preflight fluorochrome label perimeter is assumed to be similar in the rats randomly assigned to a group (ground control or flight), post-flight differences in label length represent intergroup differences in bone resorption during flight. In turn, the perimeter bounded by preflight label with adjacent osteoblasts represents continuous bone formation throughout the duration of flight (Figure 4a), whereas fluorochrome label with no adjacent osteoblasts reflects sites undergoing bone mineralization at the time of label administration but not subsequently (ceased bone formation; Figure 4b). In contrast, bone perimeter bounded by osteoblasts with no adjacent label represents sites where bone formation was newly initiated during flight (i.e., following administration of the preflight label; Figure 4c). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Photomicrographs depicting continuous bone formation (fluorochrome label with adjacent osteoblasts) (a), ceased bone formation (fluorochrome label with no adjacent osteoblasts) (b), and newly initiated bone formation (osteoblasts with no adjacent fluorochrome label) (c). Also shown are the distance between a fluorochrome label and osteoblast-lined perimeter used to calculate mineral apposition rate (MAR) (a), an osteoclast resorbing label (b), and marrow adipocytes (c).Cell and fluorochrome data were simultaneously collected by viewing the sections under combined visible light and ultraviolet light using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Atlanta, GA, USA). Endpoints evaluated included bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, area of total tissue evaluated occupied by cancellous bone, %), fluorochrome label length (length/tissue area, mm/mm2) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %). Fluorochrome-based indices of bone formation included measurements of continuous bone formation during flight (percentage of bone lined with osteoblasts associated with the single label; %), ceased bone formation during flight (percentage of bone perimeter with label not associated with osteoblasts, %), newly initiated bone formation during flight (percentage of osteoblast perimeter not associated with label, %) and mineral apposition rate (mean distance between the fluorochrome marker and osteoblast-lined perimeter divided by number of days between the label injection and killing (15 days), μm/day). MAT (% tissue area) and adipocyte number (#/mm2) were measured and adipocyte size (μm2) was determined by dividing MAT by adipocyte number.Statistical analysis Mean responses were compared using independent two-sample t-tests (ground control versus flight). The required conditions for valid use of t-tests were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance and the Anderson–Darling test for normality. When the assumption of equal variance was violated, Welch’s two-sample t-test was used for comparisons.31 When the assumption for normality was violated, the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test was performed. The Hochberg adjustment method was used to control for multiple comparisons by maintaining the familywise error rate at 5% (Hochberg 1988). Differences were considered statistically significant at P<0.05. All data are expressed as mean±s.e.Acknowledgments This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Program (DGE-0956280) and a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNX12AL24G).

    "title": "Role of oestrogen receptor signaling in skeletal response to leptin in female ob/ob mice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and axial bone growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice (p < 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.01). Spearman’s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ERα in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ERα antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ERβ antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work. Keywords: estrogen receptor, leptin, skeletal longitudinal growth, growth plate, endochondral bone formation",
    "introduction": "Introduction Leptin, a protein encoded by obese gene (ob), has been shown to have regulative effects on longitudinal bone growth, spongiosa maturation, and bone turnover between cortical and cancellous bones (1). The mammalian second growth spurt period occurs at puberty. One of the characterizations for the growth spurt is rapid skeletal longitudinal growth. Results in a clinical investigation, in order to clarify the relationship between anthropometric data and concentrations of serum leptin in the catch-up growth procedure, showed that increasing leptin concentrations might trigger catch-up growth in children recovering from malnutrition (2). Furthermore, leptin was considered as an important facilitator in early puberty (3). In addition, findings of leptin deficiency in mice and humans leading to abnormal bone development suggested that leptin plays a novel role in the linear growth of bone (4–7). Endochondral bone formation is the key procedure for growth plate (GP), in which GP chondrocytes undergo a series of organized procedures including proliferation, maturation, hypertrophic differentiation, and calcification (8–10). These complex and delicate programs of endochondral bone formation are responsible for the skeletal elongation. The femoral GP of ob/ob mice is abnormal combined with poorly organized collagen fibril and decreased the expression level of type X collagen (7). Further lab investigations showed that leptin could enhance the proliferation and differentiation of GP chondrocytes ex vivo (11). Additional leptin treatment increased condyle height in an organ model (12). Importantly, supplementation of leptin to ob/ob mice could reverse the defects in femoral GP and bone morphology (7, 12, 13). However, interesting different growth patterns have been shown in ob/ob mice with a shorter femora length and a longer vertebral length than wild-type (WT) mice (7), while the underlying mechanism of this contrasting phenotypes still remains unclear. Although leptin played an important role in the abnormal skeletal bone growth, leptin was a multiple-effect hormone, affecting energy metabolism, appetite, thermogenesis, immune system, and neuroendocrine (14, 15), each of which could independently determine the growth pattern of skeletal bone longitudinal growth (16). Leptin is responsible for the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and leptin deficiency directly leads to a reduced level of estrogen in ob/ob mice (17). Estrogen and its receptor (ERα and ERβ) signaling pathway played an essential role in skeletal growth, and the absence of estrogen in rats presented an accelerated bone elongation as compared with that in normal female rats (18, 19). Effects of different ERs (α and β) on the axial and appendicular bone elongation were distinct, which were proved by ER knock-out mice. ERα knock-out mice showed a decreasing bone growth, while mice with inactivation of ERβ had increased appendicular bone growth (20–22). Our previous study also showed that blocking different ERs presented opposite effects on the appendicular longitudinal growth (23). Recently, a crosstalk effect between leptin and ERs in the endochondral bone formation has been reported in our previous study (24), and a stage-specific effect of leptin on the ER expression was obvious during the hypertrophic differentiation stage in a model of chondrocyte differentiation in vitro (25). The integration of estrogen and leptin signaling, which is responsible for contrasting growth patterns in appendicular and axial longitudinal growth via ERs, is still unknown. Therefore, we hypothesize that leptin deficiency may influence the ER expression in axial and appendicular GP in vivo, contributing to the contrasting phenotypes of skeletal growth in ob/ob mice. The current study was designed to determine the role of ERs in the skeletal longitudinal growth of leptin deficiency mice. We examine the femur and spinal GP using densitometric, histomorphometric, and immunohistochemical techniques to expand our current understanding of how the absence of leptin affects axial and appendicular growth.",
    "methods": "Methods and Materials Animals Three-week-old female B6/JGpt-Lepem1Cd25/Gpt mice on the C57BL/6 background (ob/ob mice, n = 6/group) and 3-week-old female C57BL/6 (n = 6/group) mice were purchased from Nanjing GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. Animals were housed and kept in 12-h daylight and nightlight conditions with standard mouse feed and sterile water. Our animal protocol was approved by the animal experiment ethical committee of Peking University People’s Hospital. Experimental Procedures In total, 24 C57BL/6 mice and 24 ob/ob mice were purchased from GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China) and were randomly divided into eight groups. In the first stage, C57BL/6 was used as WT (n = 6), ob/ob mouse was used as ob/ob (n = 6). These two groups of mice did not receive any drug treatment and were euthanized for tissue collection. In order to determine the role of ERs in skeletal growth of ob/ob mice, the second stage was performed as follows: WT, ob/ob control (ob/ob + ctrl), ob/ob mice treated with methyl-piperidino-pyrazole, an ERα-selective antagonist (ob/ob + MPP), and ob/ob mice were treated with 4-(2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo(1,5-a)pyrimidin-3-yl)phenol, an ERβ-selective antagonist (ob/ob + PHTPP). After 1 week of adaptive feeding, mice were treated with different kinds of ER antagonists during the puberty of female mice (4 to 10 weeks). The control group ob/ob mice were subcutaneously injected with 100 μl of saline solution. The MPP group mice and PHTPP group mice were intraperitoneally injected with MPP [0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1‰ dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] and PHTPP (0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1‰ DMSO), respectively, according to previous studies (23, 26). All the groups received injections at 5 days/week for 6 weeks. The body weight of each mouse was recorded every week. X-Ray Radiography Image At the end of each stage, X-ray radiography (Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) was used to get the images of all mice, which were in the prone position. Femur length and spine (L1–L6) length were quantified using ImageJ software (, Bethesda, MD). The femur length was recorded as appendicular length, and the spine length was recorded as axial length. Tissue Sample Length Measurements and Collection After euthanasia, the femur and lumbar L5 vertebrae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24 h. Ten percent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used for decalcification of these bone tissues for at least 3 weeks. After decalcification, the femur and spine were embedded in paraffin for future histological analysis. Quantitative Histology of Axial and Appendicular Growth Plate Using H&E Staining H&E staining and the quantitative analysis of GP were performed according to previous studies (23). Briefly, 4-μm-thick two nonconsecutive sections were made from paraffin of femur and lumbar (L5 vertebrae) tissues of each mouse and were then deparaffinized with xylene, followed by staining with H&E according to the manual protocol. The quantitative analysis was carried out by measuring the GP under the ×10 magnification using Nikon Eclipse microscope (Nikon, Japan). The height of GP was recorded by the mean values of 20 measurements per section. Furthermore, the height of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones was analyzed by 20 columns in each section and was recorded as an average. ImageJ (, Bethesda, MD) was used to measure the height of the femur and lumbar GP height in a blind method. Immunohistochemistry For immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, the traverse sections were baked for 50 min at 60°C, then rehydrated in xylene and graded ethanol, and finally washed with water, with 5 min in each step. Sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 in order to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity; then phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used for washing. After retrieval and blocking, these sections incubated with rabbit antibody of anti-Collagen II (1:200, Affinity, USA, Catalog AF0135), anti-Collagen X (1:250, Affinity, USA, Catalog DF13214), anti-Aggrecan (1:200, Abcam, USA, Catalog ab216965), and anti-MMP13 (1:250, Affinity, USA, Catalog AF5355) at 4°C overnight. After being washed with PBS thrice, these slides were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, these slides were incubated in ABC complex for 30 min. Staining was detected with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxide substrate solution for 3 min, followed by rinsing in distilled water. The sections were dehydrated by graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted with permount medium after counterstaining with Gill’s hematoxylin solution for 3 min. The results were analyzed and photographed by a digital microscope (Nikon, Japan). TUNEL Assay (Apoptosis Analysis) The TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche, USA). Briefly, the apoptotic GP cells were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxy UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) IHC. The DAB method was used to detect the staining. The positive cells were counted within the GP and presented as a percentage of the total cells. Quantification of Immunohistochemistry Staining The semiquantitative analysis method was used to evaluate the intensity of these immunoreactivity, measured by histological score (HSCORE) according to our previous study (23). The average results were addressed in a ×40 image. Briefly, the immunohistochemical localization was evaluated in a semiquantitative fashion focused on the intensity of staining area. The immunoreactive intensity of COL II, aggrecan, COL X, MMP13, ERα, and ERβ was assessed semiquantitatively according to categories of intensity: 0, no staining; 1, weak but detectable staining; 2, moderate or distinct staining; and 3, intense staining. In each field, the staining area was evaluated by summing the percentages of the area. The total score of each group was calculated as follows: HSCORE = Σi I × Pi (i represents the score of intensity, and Pi is the corresponding percentage of the areas). Femur Growth Plate Harvest and RNA Extraction The distal femur or vertebrae were median incised using a surgical blade, and the GP can be seen under the field of a microscope. Micro-forcep was used to harvest the GP tissue. The harvested GP tissues were immediately placed in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). A homogenizer was used to make the homogenized GP. Then, the total RNA was extracted according to our previous studies (23, 25). NanoDrop spectrophotometer was used to quantify RNA, and 0. 5 μg was reverse transcribed into cDNA. Real-Time Quantitative PCR Gene expression was evaluated by qPCR using a Roche LightCycler® 480II (Roche Diagnostics). PCR amplification was performed with TB green premix Ex Taq (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The forward and reverse primer sequences were as follows: ERα: 5′-CCTCCCGCCTTCTACAGGT-3′ and 5′-CACACGGCACAGTAGCGAG-3′; ERβ: 5′-CTGTGCCTCTTCTCACAAGGA-3′ and 5′-TGCTCCAAGGGTAGGATGGAC-3′; β-actin: 5′-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′. The progress of qPCR contained two steps: first, an initial 30 s of heating to 95°C and then 20 cycles consisting of 5 s at 95°C followed by 20 s at 60°C. The ΔΔCt method was used to evaluate the transcript levels, and data were normalized for input based on β-actin and expressed relative to mice in the control group. Western Blotting Analysis The distal femur or vertebrae were median incised using a surgical blade, and the GP can be seen under the field of a microscope. All GP tissues were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China), and the protein concentration was analyzed using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China). The tissue lysates (35 μg) were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using electrophoresis, and then the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After being blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with primary anti-ERα (1:1,000, affinity, USA, Catalog No. AF6058), anti-ERβ (1:1,000, affinity, USA, Catalog No. AF6469), and GAPDH (1:5,000, ProteinTech, China, Catalog No. 10494-1-AP) at 4°C overnight. After being washed thrice with PBS, the membranes were incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody. Finally, the membranes were determined by Bio-Rad ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA) and were quantified by ImageJ software. Statistical Analysis All the data were presented as mean ± SD. The unpaired t-test was used to analyze the differences in parameters between WT and ob/ob mice, the differences between control group and treated groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA methods, and post-hoc analysis was carried out with Bonferroni’s test. Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed to correlate the HSCORE of ERα and limb/spine length. A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS (IBM, 22.0, USA) software.",
    "results": "Results At the end of mice’s puberty, X-ray was performed to collect images of the femur and lumbar spine. As shown in Figure 1 , the femur of ob/ob mice was shorter than that of WT mice, and the lumbar length of ob/ob mice was longer than that of WT mice, which suggested that leptin deficiency mice had the contrasting phenotypes between femoral and lumbar spinal growth compared with those of WT mice. H&E staining of femoral and vertebral sections was used to investigate the thickness of GP in WT mice and ob/ob mice. The body weight ( Figure 1D ) of ob/ob mice was higher than that of WT mice at the beginning of the experiment (4-week-old mice), which was in line with the phenotype of obese ob/ob mice. The femur GP height of ob/ob mice was thinner than that of WT mice ( Figures 2A, B ), while the spinal GP of ob/ob mice was thicker than that of WT mice ( Figures 2F, G ). Additional histological analysis for the proliferative zone and hypertrophic zone of femur GP showed that both zones were decreased in the ob/ob mice compared with WT mice ( Figure 2C ), while the ratio of hypertrophic/proliferative zone of femoral GP was higher in ob/ob mice than in WT mice ( Figures 2D, E ). Located at the spinal GP, the proliferative zone in ob/ob mice was thicker than that of WT mice. However, there was no difference in the hypertrophic/proliferative zone ratio between ob/ob and WT mice ( Figures 2G – J ). Figure 1.

During the terminal differentiation procedure, GP hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis with calcification of cartilaginous matrix followed by deposition of new bone. The positive number of TUNEL (+) chondrocytes at the hypertrophic zone were evaluated using a percentage of the total number of cells in the hypertrophic zone. At the end of our experiment (12-week-old WT mice), the mean percentage of apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells among the femur GP hypertrophic chondrocytes was 14.38 ( Figure 3A ). However, in 12-week-old ob/ob control mice, the percentage of apoptotic vertebral GP chondrocytes in the hypertrophic zone was greater (35.1%). The apoptosis rate in the vertebral GP chondrocytes of ob/ob mice was lower than that of WT mice ( Figure 3B ). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Comparison of femur (A) and spinal (B) growth plate apoptosis between wild type mice and ob/ob mice using TUNEL method, and percentages of positive cells were calculated. Black arrow determines the positive cell, and red arrow determines negative cell. Scale bar: 20μm; n=6 in each group, ***P < 0.001. The above results showed that ob/ob mice have opposite growth pattern between axial and appendicular growth compared with that of WT mice at the end of pubertal time. To determine the proliferation and hypertrophy fate of GP chondrocytes in the femur and spine, we performed IHC staining with proliferative marker (collagen II and aggrecan) and hypertrophic marker (collagen X and MMP13) on the femur and spinal GP ( Figure 4 ). Collagen II and aggrecan were decreased in the femur GP of ob/ob mice compared with those of WT mice ( Figure 4 ). Interestingly, we found that the expression of collagen II and aggrecan was higher in the spinal GP of ob/ob mice compared with the WT mice or the femur GP of ob/ob mice ( Figure 5 ). Similarly, the expression of collagen X and MMP13 was also decreased in the femur GP of ob/ob mice, while the hypertrophic markers were highly expressed in the spinal GP of ob/ob mice. Overall, the reverse expression pattern of differentiation and hypertrophic markers demonstrated that leptin deficiency decreased the femur length via decreasing the expression of proliferative and hypertrophic marker genes and increasing the spinal length by enhancing these markers’ expression.

Previous studies have reported that ERs (α and β) play an important role in regulating the longitudinal bone growth. To further investigate mechanisms of contrasting growth phenotype of axial and appendicular growth, the Western blotting (WB), IHC, and qPCR methods were used to determine whether an opposite expression pattern of ERs existed in the femur and spinal GP ( Figure 6 ). Interestingly, we found that the expression level of ERα was not only decreased in the femur GP of ob/ob mice. The spinal GP of ob/ob mice highly expressed the ERα compared with spinal GP of WT mice or the femur GP of ob/ob mice. In addition, the results of Spearman’s analysis showed that axial length and appendicular length were positively correlated with the expression level of ERα ( Figures 5L, M ). Collectively, the region-specific expression of ERα in the spinal and femur GP of ob/ob mice may play a role in the reverse growth pattern between axial and appendicular bone growth. Figure 6.

In order to determine the role of ERα in skeletal growth pattern of ob/ob mice, ERα and ERβ antagonists (MPP and PHTPP) were used. As shown in Figure 7 , in the WT mice, blocking ERα led to a decreased femur length, and blocking ERβ resulted in an increased femur length compared with that in the non-treated WT mice. Furthermore, ER antagonists did not present regulative effects on the spinal length. The results of H&E staining, as shown in Figure 7 , also showed that blocking ERα resulted in a thinner femur GP, and blocking ERβ increased the thickness of femur GP compared with that in non-treated WT mice, while ER antagonists did not influence the vertebral GP. These data were in line with our previous study (23). However, in ob/ob mice, any kind of ER antagonists did not present regulatory effects on the femur length and GP. Collectively, these data demonstrated that the absence of leptin might disturb the regulatory effects of ERs on the femur growth pattern. Precision mechanisms of region-specific ERα expression in femoral and vertebral GP in ob/ob mice still need to be explored in the future. Figure 7.

    "discussion": "Discussion Although the contrasting phenotypes in bone of the limb and spine were observed in leptin deficiency mice, the reason and mechanisms remain unclear and need to be explored. The current study provides further evidence for the effects of leptin deficiency on the contrasting phenotypes on axial and appendicular bone growth, in which leptin deficiency results in region-specific expression of ERα at the femoral and vertebral GP in ob/ob female mice. According to the axial and appendicular bone length results, we showed that ob/ob mice have a shorter femur length and a longer spinal length than WT mice. IHC staining results also showed opposite results of proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral and spinal GP of ob/ob mice. Expression of ERs using IHC, WB, and qPCR methods demonstrated that femur GP has a lower level of ERα, and spinal GP has a higher level of ERα in ob/ob mice compared with those of WT mice. No differences were observed in the expression of ERβ of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice. Spearman’s analysis showed that body length was positively correlated with the expression level of ERα. Antagonists of ERs showed a different regulatory effect on femur length in WT mice, but blocking different ERs did not present regulatory effects on the skeletal longitudinal growth in ob/ob mice. Taken together, our data suggested that the contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of spine and limb induced by leptin deficiency may partially attribute to region-specific expression of ERα in the femoral and spinal GP. Leptin deficiency also blunted the regulatory effects of ER antagonists on the longitudinal growth in ob/ob mice. Still, the underlying mechanisms of the cross talk between leptin and ER signaling need to be studied in the future. Puberty was the second growth peak in mammals. Except for the secondary sexual characteristics, body longitudinal growth was one of the important markers of the puberty (27). In addition to the regulation of metabolism and reproduction, leptin was reportedly important for the skeletal bone growth (12). Recently, leptin deficiency has been shown to lead to a shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length compared with WT mice using the 6-month-old and prepubertal female ob/ob mice (7, 28, 29). Supplementation of leptin has been shown to increase femoral length in ob/ob mice, but it could not achieve absolute re-established length as compared with WT mice (28, 30). In the present study, we confirmed that leptin deficiency induced a shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length in the post-pubertal (12-week old) ob/ob mice compared with WT mice, which suggested that the absence of leptin may be the primary factor for the contrasting growth pattern between limb and spine during the whole life of ob/ob female mice. Previous studies have shown that leptin receptor was expressed in cartilaginous skeletal growth centers, articular cartilage, and osteoblasts (31, 32). Our previous study also showed that leptin receptor was expressed in the femur and spinal GP (33). The in situ expression of leptin receptor at the GP supported that leptin directly affected the GP. GP thickness was an important histological marker for the longitudinal bone growth (34). Here, we focused on the GPs and found that the femoral GP was thinner than that of WT mice, and the spinal GP was thicker than that of WT mice. Leptin deficiency decreased the proliferative zone and hypertrophic zone height in the femoral GP compared with the WT mice, but the ratio of hypertrophic/proliferative zone was higher in ob/ob mice. The contrasting GP patterns of the femur and vertebrae were in line with the general femoral and spinal length observation. As we know, endochondral ossification was the major process that contributed to skeletal bone longitudinal growth (9). During this procedural transition from cartilage to bone, the potential abilities of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy were important for GP thickness and were further responsible for longitudinal bone growth (35). Chondrocytes in different phases of GP secreted unique matrix proteins. Collagen II and aggrecan were used as the markers of GP cellular proliferation. Meanwhile, collagen X and MMP13 were the typical features of GP hypertrophy (36–38). The results of our study demonstrated that leptin deficiency decreased the expression of extracellular matrix marker proteins in femur GP as compared with those in the WT mice, which was in line with the results of Tuner and colleagues (28). Interestingly, the extracellular matrix makers were at a higher level in the spinal GP as compared with those in the spinal GP of WT mice and the femur GP of ob/ob mice. Collectively, the results of the extracellular matrix maker expression patterns in femoral and spinal GP support the contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of the limb and spine. To explore the mechanism of this interesting phenomenon, we further focused on the expression of ERs in the femoral and spinal GP. Estrogen was a key hormone in puberty of female mammals, and it was also an important factor that may influence the process of skeletal bone line growth (36). ERs mediated cellular response of estrogen, and previous studies using different global ER knock-out mouse models have suggested that ERα and ERβ presented opposing effects on longitudinal bone growth in female mice (20, 22, 39). ERβ knock-out adult mice have increased skeletal length compared with WT female mice, while ERα knock-out mice presented decreased longitudinal bone growth (20, 22). A previous study has shown that the expression level of ERs (especially ERα) was high at the arcuate nucleus in ob/ob mice (40). Furthermore, in our previous studies (24, 25), there were cross-talk effects between leptin and ERs in vitro. However, no reports have been focused on the expression pattern of ERs located at the spinal and femoral GP in ob/ob mice in vivo. In the present study, our data first showed that the expression level of ERα was lower in the femoral GP of ob/ob mice compared with the WT mice, and the level of ERα was higher in the spinal GP of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice or the femoral GP of ob/ob mice. In addition, there were no significant changes in ERβ located at the femoral and spinal GP. ERα was considered as a growth promoter in the skeletal development (20, 39). These interesting findings of our study may partially explain the mechanisms of contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of limb and spine. Low expression of ERα in femoral GP resulted in short limbs, and high expression of ERα in spinal GP resulted in long vertebrae. The expression level of ERα was positively correlated with axial and appendicular bone length according to the results of Spearman’s analysis. Furthermore, ER antagonists were used to determine the role of ERα in regulating the longitudinal bone growth. In line with our previous study (23), the present data showed that ERα blocking directly resulted in decreasing appendicular longitudinal growth, whereas ERβ blocking led to increasing appendicular longitudinal growth in the WT mice. However, selective ER antagonists did not present regulative effects on the longitudinal growth of the ob/ob mice. Taken together, our results show that leptin deficiency directly induced the different expression patterns of ERα at femoral and vertebral GP and low serum estradiol level in ob/ob mice during puberty, and the regulative effects of ER antagonists were disturbed by the absence of leptin. Given the complex effects of leptin deficiency in regulating the bone growth, more specific mechanisms are needed to be explored. In conclusion, we found that leptin deficiency presented contrasting phenotypes in axial and appendicular growth of ob/ob mice at the end of puberty, with reduced level of proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral GP and an increased level of these markers in spinal GP. Furthermore, we first found a significant change of expression of ERα located at femoral and spinal GP (lower in femoral GP and higher in spinal GP as compared with that in WT mice). These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with the formation of contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in the ob/ob mice. However, further studies are needed to clarify the relation between ERs and leptin in regulating endochondral ossification.",

Copyright notice ID: 8671758 PMID: 34925230 Abstract The absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and axial bone growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice (p < 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.01). Spearman’s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ERα in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ERα antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ERβ antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work. Keywords: estrogen receptor, leptin, skeletal longitudinal growth, growth plate, endochondral bone formationIntroduction Leptin, a protein encoded by obese gene (ob), has been shown to have regulative effects on longitudinal bone growth, spongiosa maturation, and bone turnover between cortical and cancellous bones (1). The mammalian second growth spurt period occurs at puberty. One of the characterizations for the growth spurt is rapid skeletal longitudinal growth. Results in a clinical investigation, in order to clarify the relationship between anthropometric data and concentrations of serum leptin in the catch-up growth procedure, showed that increasing leptin concentrations might trigger catch-up growth in children recovering from malnutrition (2). Furthermore, leptin was considered as an important facilitator in early puberty (3). In addition, findings of leptin deficiency in mice and humans leading to abnormal bone development suggested that leptin plays a novel role in the linear growth of bone (4–7). Endochondral bone formation is the key procedure for growth plate (GP), in which GP chondrocytes undergo a series of organized procedures including proliferation, maturation, hypertrophic differentiation, and calcification (8–10). These complex and delicate programs of endochondral bone formation are responsible for the skeletal elongation. The femoral GP of ob/ob mice is abnormal combined with poorly organized collagen fibril and decreased the expression level of type X collagen (7). Further lab investigations showed that leptin could enhance the proliferation and differentiation of GP chondrocytes ex vivo (11). Additional leptin treatment increased condyle height in an organ model (12). Importantly, supplementation of leptin to ob/ob mice could reverse the defects in femoral GP and bone morphology (7, 12, 13). However, interesting different growth patterns have been shown in ob/ob mice with a shorter femora length and a longer vertebral length than wild-type (WT) mice (7), while the underlying mechanism of this contrasting phenotypes still remains unclear. Although leptin played an important role in the abnormal skeletal bone growth, leptin was a multiple-effect hormone, affecting energy metabolism, appetite, thermogenesis, immune system, and neuroendocrine (14, 15), each of which could independently determine the growth pattern of skeletal bone longitudinal growth (16). Leptin is responsible for the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and leptin deficiency directly leads to a reduced level of estrogen in ob/ob mice (17). Estrogen and its receptor (ERα and ERβ) signaling pathway played an essential role in skeletal growth, and the absence of estrogen in rats presented an accelerated bone elongation as compared with that in normal female rats (18, 19). Effects of different ERs (α and β) on the axial and appendicular bone elongation were distinct, which were proved by ER knock-out mice. ERα knock-out mice showed a decreasing bone growth, while mice with inactivation of ERβ had increased appendicular bone growth (20–22). Our previous study also showed that blocking different ERs presented opposite effects on the appendicular longitudinal growth (23). Recently, a crosstalk effect between leptin and ERs in the endochondral bone formation has been reported in our previous study (24), and a stage-specific effect of leptin on the ER expression was obvious during the hypertrophic differentiation stage in a model of chondrocyte differentiation in vitro (25). The integration of estrogen and leptin signaling, which is responsible for contrasting growth patterns in appendicular and axial longitudinal growth via ERs, is still unknown. Therefore, we hypothesize that leptin deficiency may influence the ER expression in axial and appendicular GP in vivo, contributing to the contrasting phenotypes of skeletal growth in ob/ob mice. The current study was designed to determine the role of ERs in the skeletal longitudinal growth of leptin deficiency mice. We examine the femur and spinal GP using densitometric, histomorphometric, and immunohistochemical techniques to expand our current understanding of how the absence of leptin affects axial and appendicular growth.Methods and Materials Animals Three-week-old female B6/JGpt-Lepem1Cd25/Gpt mice on the C57BL/6 background (ob/ob mice, n = 6/group) and 3-week-old female C57BL/6 (n = 6/group) mice were purchased from Nanjing GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. Animals were housed and kept in 12-h daylight and nightlight conditions with standard mouse feed and sterile water. Our animal protocol was approved by the animal experiment ethical committee of Peking University People’s Hospital.Experimental Procedures In total, 24 C57BL/6 mice and 24 ob/ob mice were purchased from GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China) and were randomly divided into eight groups. In the first stage, C57BL/6 was used as WT (n = 6), ob/ob mouse was used as ob/ob (n = 6). These two groups of mice did not receive any drug treatment and were euthanized for tissue collection. In order to determine the role of ERs in skeletal growth of ob/ob mice, the second stage was performed as follows: WT, ob/ob control (ob/ob + ctrl), ob/ob mice treated with methyl-piperidino-pyrazole, an ERα-selective antagonist (ob/ob + MPP), and ob/ob mice were treated with 4-(2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo(1,5-a)pyrimidin-3-yl)phenol, an ERβ-selective antagonist (ob/ob + PHTPP). After 1 week of adaptive feeding, mice were treated with different kinds of ER antagonists during the puberty of female mice (4 to 10 weeks). The control group ob/ob mice were subcutaneously injected with 100 μl of saline solution. The MPP group mice and PHTPP group mice were intraperitoneally injected with MPP [0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1‰ dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] and PHTPP (0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1‰ DMSO), respectively, according to previous studies (23, 26). All the groups received injections at 5 days/week for 6 weeks. The body weight of each mouse was recorded every week.X-Ray Radiography Image At the end of each stage, X-ray radiography (Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) was used to get the images of all mice, which were in the prone position. Femur length and spine (L1–L6) length were quantified using ImageJ software (, Bethesda, MD). The femur length was recorded as appendicular length, and the spine length was recorded as axial length.Tissue Sample Length Measurements and Collection After euthanasia, the femur and lumbar L5 vertebrae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24 h. Ten percent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used for decalcification of these bone tissues for at least 3 weeks. After decalcification, the femur and spine were embedded in paraffin for future histological analysis.Quantitative Histology of Axial and Appendicular Growth Plate Using H&E Staining H&E staining and the quantitative analysis of GP were performed according to previous studies (23). Briefly, 4-μm-thick two nonconsecutive sections were made from paraffin of femur and lumbar (L5 vertebrae) tissues of each mouse and were then deparaffinized with xylene, followed by staining with H&E according to the manual protocol. The quantitative analysis was carried out by measuring the GP under the ×10 magnification using Nikon Eclipse microscope (Nikon, Japan). The height of GP was recorded by the mean values of 20 measurements per section. Furthermore, the height of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones was analyzed by 20 columns in each section and was recorded as an average. ImageJ (, Bethesda, MD) was used to measure the height of the femur and lumbar GP height in a blind method.Immunohistochemistry For immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, the traverse sections were baked for 50 min at 60°C, then rehydrated in xylene and graded ethanol, and finally washed with water, with 5 min in each step. Sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 in order to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity; then phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used for washing. After retrieval and blocking, these sections incubated with rabbit antibody of anti-Collagen II (1:200, Affinity, USA, Catalog AF0135), anti-Collagen X (1:250, Affinity, USA, Catalog DF13214), anti-Aggrecan (1:200, Abcam, USA, Catalog ab216965), and anti-MMP13 (1:250, Affinity, USA, Catalog AF5355) at 4°C overnight. After being washed with PBS thrice, these slides were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, these slides were incubated in ABC complex for 30 min. Staining was detected with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) peroxide substrate solution for 3 min, followed by rinsing in distilled water. The sections were dehydrated by graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted with permount medium after counterstaining with Gill’s hematoxylin solution for 3 min. The results were analyzed and photographed by a digital microscope (Nikon, Japan).TUNEL Assay (Apoptosis Analysis) The TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche, USA). Briefly, the apoptotic GP cells were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxy UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) IHC. The DAB method was used to detect the staining. The positive cells were counted within the GP and presented as a percentage of the total cells.Quantification of Immunohistochemistry Staining The semiquantitative analysis method was used to evaluate the intensity of these immunoreactivity, measured by histological score (HSCORE) according to our previous study (23). The average results were addressed in a ×40 image. Briefly, the immunohistochemical localization was evaluated in a semiquantitative fashion focused on the intensity of staining area. The immunoreactive intensity of COL II, aggrecan, COL X, MMP13, ERα, and ERβ was assessed semiquantitatively according to categories of intensity: 0, no staining; 1, weak but detectable staining; 2, moderate or distinct staining; and 3, intense staining. In each field, the staining area was evaluated by summing the percentages of the area. The total score of each group was calculated as follows: HSCORE = Σi I × Pi (i represents the score of intensity, and Pi is the corresponding percentage of the areas).Femur Growth Plate Harvest and RNA Extraction The distal femur or vertebrae were median incised using a surgical blade, and the GP can be seen under the field of a microscope. Micro-forcep was used to harvest the GP tissue. The harvested GP tissues were immediately placed in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). A homogenizer was used to make the homogenized GP. Then, the total RNA was extracted according to our previous studies (23, 25). NanoDrop spectrophotometer was used to quantify RNA, and 0. 5 μg was reverse transcribed into cDNA.Real-Time Quantitative PCR Gene expression was evaluated by qPCR using a Roche LightCycler® 480II (Roche Diagnostics). PCR amplification was performed with TB green premix Ex Taq (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The forward and reverse primer sequences were as follows: ERα: 5′-CCTCCCGCCTTCTACAGGT-3′ and 5′-CACACGGCACAGTAGCGAG-3′; ERβ: 5′-CTGTGCCTCTTCTCACAAGGA-3′ and 5′-TGCTCCAAGGGTAGGATGGAC-3′; β-actin: 5′-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′. The progress of qPCR contained two steps: first, an initial 30 s of heating to 95°C and then 20 cycles consisting of 5 s at 95°C followed by 20 s at 60°C. The ΔΔCt method was used to evaluate the transcript levels, and data were normalized for input based on β-actin and expressed relative to mice in the control group.Western Blotting Analysis The distal femur or vertebrae were median incised using a surgical blade, and the GP can be seen under the field of a microscope. All GP tissues were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China), and the protein concentration was analyzed using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China). The tissue lysates (35 μg) were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using electrophoresis, and then the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After being blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with primary anti-ERα (1:1,000, affinity, USA, Catalog No. AF6058), anti-ERβ (1:1,000, affinity, USA, Catalog No. AF6469), and GAPDH (1:5,000, ProteinTech, China, Catalog No. 10494-1-AP) at 4°C overnight. After being washed thrice with PBS, the membranes were incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody. Finally, the membranes were determined by Bio-Rad ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA) and were quantified by ImageJ software.Statistical Analysis All the data were presented as mean ± SD. The unpaired t-test was used to analyze the differences in parameters between WT and ob/ob mice, the differences between control group and treated groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA methods, and post-hoc analysis was carried out with Bonferroni’s test. Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed to correlate the HSCORE of ERα and limb/spine length. A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS (IBM, 22.0, USA) software.Results At the end of mice’s puberty, X-ray was performed to collect images of the femur and lumbar spine. As shown in Figure 1 , the femur of ob/ob mice was shorter than that of WT mice, and the lumbar length of ob/ob mice was longer than that of WT mice, which suggested that leptin deficiency mice had the contrasting phenotypes between femoral and lumbar spinal growth compared with those of WT mice. H&E staining of femoral and vertebral sections was used to investigate the thickness of GP in WT mice and ob/ob mice. The body weight ( Figure 1D ) of ob/ob mice was higher than that of WT mice at the beginning of the experiment (4-week-old mice), which was in line with the phenotype of obese ob/ob mice. The femur GP height of ob/ob mice was thinner than that of WT mice ( Figures 2A, B ), while the spinal GP of ob/ob mice was thicker than that of WT mice ( Figures 2F, G ). Additional histological analysis for the proliferative zone and hypertrophic zone of femur GP showed that both zones were decreased in the ob/ob mice compared with WT mice ( Figure 2C ), while the ratio of hypertrophic/proliferative zone of femoral GP was higher in ob/ob mice than in WT mice ( Figures 2D, E ). Located at the spinal GP, the proliferative zone in ob/ob mice was thicker than that of WT mice. However, there was no difference in the hypertrophic/proliferative zone ratio between ob/ob and WT mice ( Figures 2G – J ). Figure 1.

The positive number of TUNEL (+) chondrocytes at the hypertrophic zone were evaluated using a percentage of the total number of cells in the hypertrophic zone. At the end of our experiment (12-week-old WT mice), the mean percentage of apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells among the femur GP hypertrophic chondrocytes was 14.38 ( Figure 3A ). However, in 12-week-old ob/ob control mice, the percentage of apoptotic vertebral GP chondrocytes in the hypertrophic zone was greater (35.1%). The apoptosis rate in the vertebral GP chondrocytes of ob/ob mice was lower than that of WT mice ( Figure 3B ). Figure 3.

Scale bar: 20μm; n=6 in each group, ***P < 0.001.The above results showed that ob/ob mice have opposite growth pattern between axial and appendicular growth compared with that of WT mice at the end of pubertal time. To determine the proliferation and hypertrophy fate of GP chondrocytes in the femur and spine, we performed IHC staining with proliferative marker (collagen II and aggrecan) and hypertrophic marker (collagen X and MMP13) on the femur and spinal GP ( Figure 4 ). Collagen II and aggrecan were decreased in the femur GP of ob/ob mice compared with those of WT mice ( Figure 4 ). Interestingly, we found that the expression of collagen II and aggrecan was higher in the spinal GP of ob/ob mice compared with the WT mice or the femur GP of ob/ob mice ( Figure 5 ). Similarly, the expression of collagen X and MMP13 was also decreased in the femur GP of ob/ob mice, while the hypertrophic markers were highly expressed in the spinal GP of ob/ob mice. Overall, the reverse expression pattern of differentiation and hypertrophic markers demonstrated that leptin deficiency decreased the femur length via decreasing the expression of proliferative and hypertrophic marker genes and increasing the spinal length by enhancing these markers’ expression.

To further investigate mechanisms of contrasting growth phenotype of axial and appendicular growth, the Western blotting (WB), IHC, and qPCR methods were used to determine whether an opposite expression pattern of ERs existed in the femur and spinal GP ( Figure 6 ). Interestingly, we found that the expression level of ERα was not only decreased in the femur GP of ob/ob mice. The spinal GP of ob/ob mice highly expressed the ERα compared with spinal GP of WT mice or the femur GP of ob/ob mice. In addition, the results of Spearman’s analysis showed that axial length and appendicular length were positively correlated with the expression level of ERα ( Figures 5L, M ). Collectively, the region-specific expression of ERα in the spinal and femur GP of ob/ob mice may play a role in the reverse growth pattern between axial and appendicular bone growth. Figure 6.

As shown in Figure 7 , in the WT mice, blocking ERα led to a decreased femur length, and blocking ERβ resulted in an increased femur length compared with that in the non-treated WT mice. Furthermore, ER antagonists did not present regulative effects on the spinal length. The results of H&E staining, as shown in Figure 7 , also showed that blocking ERα resulted in a thinner femur GP, and blocking ERβ increased the thickness of femur GP compared with that in non-treated WT mice, while ER antagonists did not influence the vertebral GP. These data were in line with our previous study (23). However, in ob/ob mice, any kind of ER antagonists did not present regulatory effects on the femur length and GP. Collectively, these data demonstrated that the absence of leptin might disturb the regulatory effects of ERs on the femur growth pattern. Precision mechanisms of region-specific ERα expression in femoral and vertebral GP in ob/ob mice still need to be explored in the future. Figure 7.

The current study provides further evidence for the effects of leptin deficiency on the contrasting phenotypes on axial and appendicular bone growth, in which leptin deficiency results in region-specific expression of ERα at the femoral and vertebral GP in ob/ob female mice. According to the axial and appendicular bone length results, we showed that ob/ob mice have a shorter femur length and a longer spinal length than WT mice. IHC staining results also showed opposite results of proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral and spinal GP of ob/ob mice. Expression of ERs using IHC, WB, and qPCR methods demonstrated that femur GP has a lower level of ERα, and spinal GP has a higher level of ERα in ob/ob mice compared with those of WT mice. No differences were observed in the expression of ERβ of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice. Spearman’s analysis showed that body length was positively correlated with the expression level of ERα. Antagonists of ERs showed a different regulatory effect on femur length in WT mice, but blocking different ERs did not present regulatory effects on the skeletal longitudinal growth in ob/ob mice. Taken together, our data suggested that the contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of spine and limb induced by leptin deficiency may partially attribute to region-specific expression of ERα in the femoral and spinal GP. Leptin deficiency also blunted the regulatory effects of ER antagonists on the longitudinal growth in ob/ob mice. Still, the underlying mechanisms of the cross talk between leptin and ER signaling need to be studied in the future. Puberty was the second growth peak in mammals. Except for the secondary sexual characteristics, body longitudinal growth was one of the important markers of the puberty (27). In addition to the regulation of metabolism and reproduction, leptin was reportedly important for the skeletal bone growth (12). Recently, leptin deficiency has been shown to lead to a shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length compared with WT mice using the 6-month-old and prepubertal female ob/ob mice (7, 28, 29). Supplementation of leptin has been shown to increase femoral length in ob/ob mice, but it could not achieve absolute re-established length as compared with WT mice (28, 30). In the present study, we confirmed that leptin deficiency induced a shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length in the post-pubertal (12-week old) ob/ob mice compared with WT mice, which suggested that the absence of leptin may be the primary factor for the contrasting growth pattern between limb and spine during the whole life of ob/ob female mice. Previous studies have shown that leptin receptor was expressed in cartilaginous skeletal growth centers, articular cartilage, and osteoblasts (31, 32). Our previous study also showed that leptin receptor was expressed in the femur and spinal GP (33). The in situ expression of leptin receptor at the GP supported that leptin directly affected the GP. GP thickness was an important histological marker for the longitudinal bone growth (34). Here, we focused on the GPs and found that the femoral GP was thinner than that of WT mice, and the spinal GP was thicker than that of WT mice. Leptin deficiency decreased the proliferative zone and hypertrophic zone height in the femoral GP compared with the WT mice, but the ratio of hypertrophic/proliferative zone was higher in ob/ob mice. The contrasting GP patterns of the femur and vertebrae were in line with the general femoral and spinal length observation. As we know, endochondral ossification was the major process that contributed to skeletal bone longitudinal growth (9). During this procedural transition from cartilage to bone, the potential abilities of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy were important for GP thickness and were further responsible for longitudinal bone growth (35). Chondrocytes in different phases of GP secreted unique matrix proteins. Collagen II and aggrecan were used as the markers of GP cellular proliferation. Meanwhile, collagen X and MMP13 were the typical features of GP hypertrophy (36–38). The results of our study demonstrated that leptin deficiency decreased the expression of extracellular matrix marker proteins in femur GP as compared with those in the WT mice, which was in line with the results of Tuner and colleagues (28). Interestingly, the extracellular matrix makers were at a higher level in the spinal GP as compared with those in the spinal GP of WT mice and the femur GP of ob/ob mice. Collectively, the results of the extracellular matrix maker expression patterns in femoral and spinal GP support the contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of the limb and spine. To explore the mechanism of this interesting phenomenon, we further focused on the expression of ERs in the femoral and spinal GP. Estrogen was a key hormone in puberty of female mammals, and it was also an important factor that may influence the process of skeletal bone line growth (36). ERs mediated cellular response of estrogen, and previous studies using different global ER knock-out mouse models have suggested that ERα and ERβ presented opposing effects on longitudinal bone growth in female mice (20, 22, 39). ERβ knock-out adult mice have increased skeletal length compared with WT female mice, while ERα knock-out mice presented decreased longitudinal bone growth (20, 22). A previous study has shown that the expression level of ERs (especially ERα) was high at the arcuate nucleus in ob/ob mice (40). Furthermore, in our previous studies (24, 25), there were cross-talk effects between leptin and ERs in vitro. However, no reports have been focused on the expression pattern of ERs located at the spinal and femoral GP in ob/ob mice in vivo. In the present study, our data first showed that the expression level of ERα was lower in the femoral GP of ob/ob mice compared with the WT mice, and the level of ERα was higher in the spinal GP of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice or the femoral GP of ob/ob mice. In addition, there were no significant changes in ERβ located at the femoral and spinal GP. ERα was considered as a growth promoter in the skeletal development (20, 39). These interesting findings of our study may partially explain the mechanisms of contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of limb and spine. Low expression of ERα in femoral GP resulted in short limbs, and high expression of ERα in spinal GP resulted in long vertebrae. The expression level of ERα was positively correlated with axial and appendicular bone length according to the results of Spearman’s analysis. Furthermore, ER antagonists were used to determine the role of ERα in regulating the longitudinal bone growth. In line with our previous study (23), the present data showed that ERα blocking directly resulted in decreasing appendicular longitudinal growth, whereas ERβ blocking led to increasing appendicular longitudinal growth in the WT mice. However, selective ER antagonists did not present regulative effects on the longitudinal growth of the ob/ob mice. Taken together, our results show that leptin deficiency directly induced the different expression patterns of ERα at femoral and vertebral GP and low serum estradiol level in ob/ob mice during puberty, and the regulative effects of ER antagonists were disturbed by the absence of leptin. Given the complex effects of leptin deficiency in regulating the bone growth, more specific mechanisms are needed to be explored. In conclusion, we found that leptin deficiency presented contrasting phenotypes in axial and appendicular growth of ob/ob mice at the end of puberty, with reduced level of proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral GP and an increased level of these markers in spinal GP. Furthermore, we first found a significant change of expression of ERα located at femoral and spinal GP (lower in femoral GP and higher in spinal GP as compared with that in WT mice). These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with the formation of contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in the ob/ob mice. However, further studies are needed to clarify the relation between ERs and leptin in regulating endochondral ossification.Data Availability Statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.

    "abstract": "Abstract Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover. Keywords: bone formation and resorption, cartilage, histology, ob/ob, osteoclast",
    "introduction": "Introduction The appetite regulatory hormone leptin is produced by adipose tissue (Zhang, et al. 1994), circulates in levels proportional to total adiposity (Considine, et al. 1996), and may act to couple skeletal metabolism to energy availability (Gat-Yablonski, et al. 2004; Hamrick 2004; Iwaniec, et al. 2007; Steppan, et al. 2000; Turner, et al. 2013; Turner, et al. 2014). Long bones in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are shorter, biomechanically weaker, and exhibit lower overall bone mass and greater marrow adiposity compared to wild type (WT) mice (Ealey, et al. 2006; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Lindenmaier, et al. 2016; Steppan et al. 2000; Turner et al. 2014). However, differences in cancellous bone volume fraction between ob/ob and WT mice vary depending upon skeletal site and age. Leptin treatment in leptin-deficient mice normalizes bone volume and microarchitecture (Iwaniec et al. 2007) by increasing bone formation (Bartell, et al. 2011; Hamrick, et al. 2005; Kalra, et al. 2009; Steppan et al. 2000; Turner et al. 2013) and resorption (Bartell et al. 2011; Philbrick, et al. 2015; Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014), and increasing longitudinal bone growth (Gat-Yablonski et al. 2004; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Philbrick et al. 2015; Turner et al. 2013). Leptin treatment also normalizes bone marrow adiposity by reducing marrow adipocyte number and size (Lindenmaier et al. 2016). Taken together, these findings indicate that leptin affects bone marrow adiposity and skeletal growth, maturation, and turnover balance. Calcified cartilage provides a structural template for growing long bones during endochondral ossification and is normally replaced by bone during skeletal maturation. However, long bones of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice retain cartilage within cortical and cancellous bone compartments into adulthood resulting in a mild osteopetrotic skeletal phenotype (Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). Osteopetrosis is broadly characterized into two major subtypes, osteoclast-poor and osteoclast-rich (Sobacchi, et al. 2013). Mutations and/or factors that inhibit osteoclast formation are responsible for osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis. In contrast, mutations or factors that reduce osteoclast activity but do not inhibit osteoclast formation are responsible for the osteoclast-rich form of the disease. Both forms of osteopetrosis result in reduced bone resorption (Arruda, et al. 2016; Unnanuntana, et al. 2011). Severe osteopetrosis is fatal while mild forms, such as that noted in ob/ob mice, result in decreased bone quality. Furthermore, some forms of osteopetrosis are self-limiting; abnormally high quantities of cartilage are initially present in bone during rapid growth but the cartilage is eventually replaced as skeletal growth slows with age (Cielinski and Marks 1994). At present, it is unclear whether the mild osteopetrosis observed in growing ob/ob mice is self-limiting. Osteoclast perimeter in ob/ob mice is equal to or greater than in WT mice (Hamrick, et al. 2004; Philbrick et al. 2015; Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). In contrast, serum levels of carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTx, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption) are generally much lower and fluorochrome label retention in bone (a histomorphometric index of local bone resorption) is higher in ob/ob mice compared to WT mice, providing strong complementary evidence that leptin deficiency results in reduced bone resorption (Bartell et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). Theoretically, excessive bone formation could contribute to mild osteopetrosis. However, bone formation is impaired by leptin deficiency (Bartell et al. 2011; Hamrick et al. 2005; Philbrick, et al. 2017; Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014), indicating that lower osteoclastic activity is responsible for the condition in ob/ob mice. Osteoclast-rich forms of osteopetrosis can be induced by loss of function mutations in genes coding for proteins such as protease cathepsin K or chloride transporter ClCN7 required for osteoclastic activity but not for osteoclast formation and survival (Del Fattore, et al. 2008). Additionally, drugs that inhibit bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates, have been shown to induce osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis in children (Whyte, et al. 2003). The mechanism for leptin regulation of osteoclast activity has yet to be established but likely involves coordinated actions of the hormone on multiple genes that in concert regulate osteoclast activity. In support, gene profiling has established that leptin deficiency results in altered expression of several genes related to osteoclast differentiation and function (Turner et al. 2014). In the present investigation, we queried the extent to which osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) WT and ob/ob male mice. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy in 2-month-old ob/ob mice to restore leptin signaling and evaluated the bone response 7 months later. rAAV gene therapy has been used as an experimental strategy for life-long restoration of leptin signaling in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (Iwaniec et al. 2007; Iwaniec, et al. 2009; Kalra et al. 2009).",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals Male C57BL/6J (B6) mice and ob/ob mice on a B6 genetic background were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). Mice were maintained in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were housed individually in a temperature (22°C) and light-controlled (lights on 6am – 6pm) room. Food (standard mouse chow) and water were available ad libitum to all animals. Study 1: Effects of Age and Leptin Status on Bone and Cartilage in Femur Study 1 was performed in WT and ob/ob mice to determine the distribution of cartilage in femurs in animals sacrificed at 2 (n=10/group), 4 (n=5/group), and 6 (n=3-5/group) months of age. Two-month-old mice are rapidly growing while skeletal maturity is reached between 4 and 6 months of age. Study 2: Effect of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy on Bone and Cartilage in ob/ob Mice Study 2 was performed in ob/ob mice to determine if the osteopetrotic skeletal phenotype persists in aged mice and, if so, whether long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy normalizes skeletal maturation. Two-month-old ob/ob mice were randomized into one of three treatment groups: (1) untreated control (n=7), (2) rAAV-Leptin (rAAV-Lep, n=9), or rAAV-GFP (control vector encoding green fluorescent protein, n=7). The mice were maintained for 7 months post-vector administration. The effects of treatment on hypothalamic leptin gene expression, food intake, body weight, circulating metabolic hormone levels, bone microarchitecture, and bone marrow adiposity have been reported elsewhere (Boghossian, et al. 2007; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Lindenmaier et al. 2016). Construction and packaging of recombinant adenovirus vectors (rAAV) rAAV-Lep and rAAV-GFP vectors were constructed and packaged as described (Beretta, et al. 2002). In brief, the vector pTR-CBA-Ob EcoRI fragment of pCR-rOb containing rat leptin cDNA was subcloned into rAAV vector plasmid pAAVβGEnh after deleting the EcoRI fragment carrying the β-glucoronidase cDNA sequence. The control vector, rAAV-GFP, was similarly constructed to encode the GFP gene.Vector administration For vector administration, the mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, ip), placed on a Kopf stereotaxic apparatus with mouse adapter for intracerebroventricular (icv) injection, and injected icv with either rAAV-Lep (9 × 107 particles) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 107 particles). This dose was shown to normalize body weight in ob/ob mice (Ueno, et al. 2004; Ueno, et al. 2006). The coordinates employed for microinjector placement in the 3rd cerebroventricle were 0.3 mm posterior to bregma, 0.0 lateral to midline, and 4.2 mm below the dura (Boghossian, et al. 2006).Tissue collection and analyses Mice were anesthetized with either isoflurane delivered in oxygen (Study 1) or sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg; ip) (Study 2) and killed by exsanguination. Femora were excised, cleaned of soft tissue, placed in 10% formalin for 24 hrs, and stored in 70% ethanol until processing. Distal femora were prepared for histomorphometric evaluation as described (Iwaniec, et al. 2008). In brief, undecalcified femora were dehydrated and embedded in modified methyl methacrylate. Frontal sections, 4 μm thick, were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2065) and affixed to gel-coated slides. One slide was stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counter stained with toluidine blue (pH 2.5) to identify osteoclasts and cartilage matrix, respectively. Cartilage matrix was identified by metachromatic staining of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. A second slide was stained using the Von Kossa method and counter stained with tetrachrome to identify osteoblasts and verify that linear growth had ceased in the femur in 6-month-old mice: the presence of bone bridging across the growth plate was used as an index of termination of longitudinal bone growth (Martin, et al. 2003). Cartilage was measured in cancellous bone in the distal femur epiphysis and metaphysis and in cortical bone in the femoral diaphysis. The entire cancellous envelope was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis. The region of interest in the distal femur metaphysis was located 0.25-0.85 mm proximal to the growth plate and 0.05 mm from cortical bone. Cortical bone was evaluated 4.4-5.6 mm proximal to the growth plate. Measurements of cartilage included metachromatic stained area and chondrocyte area in the epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis. Measurements excluded growth plate and articular cartilage matrix. Osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %) and osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter, %) were also determined in the epiphysis. Measurements were done at either 20 or 40x using the Osteomeasure Histomorphometry System (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA). Histomorphometric data are reported using standard 2-dimensional nomenclature (Dempster, et al. 2013).Statistics Mean responses for bone and cartilage area fraction were compared between WT and ob/ob mice at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months using analysis of covariance (age modeled as a quantitative variable with linear structure) or two-way analysis of variance (age modeled as a categorical variable). Goodness of fit assessment from scatterplots, Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and Anderson-Darling tests of normality, and model selection from Akaike’s information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and likelihood ratio tests were used to determine a linear model and evaluate contributions from interactions and main effects. Linear models containing different variance parameters across age and/or genotype groups were used to accommodate heterogeneous variance. Mean responses for bone and cartilage fraction, and osteoblast and osteoclast perimeter were compared between the ob/ob, ob/ob + rAAV-GFP, and ob/ob + rAAV-Lep groups using one-way analysis of variance, with t-tests used to make pairwise comparisons. The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used when only the normality assumption was violated, in which case the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for two-group comparisons. A modified F test was used when variances were distinct, with Welch’s two-sample t-test used for two-group comparisons (Welch 1951). The Benjamini and Hochberg (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Trends are reported when P < 0.1. All data are presented as mean ± SE. Data analysis was performed using R version 3.2.2.",
    "results": "Results Study 1: Effects of Age and Leptin Status on Bone and Cartilage in Femur The effects of age and leptin status on cancellous bone area fraction in the femoral epiphysis and metaphysis and on cartilage retention in the femoral epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis in WT and ob/ob mice are shown in Figure 1. Cancellous bone area fraction decreased with age in epiphysis (Figure 1A) and metaphysis (Figure 1C). The rate of decrease was not affected by genotype (interaction not significant). However, cancellous bone area fraction was lower in the epiphysis and tended to be lower (P < 0.1) in the metaphysis in ob/ob mice compared to WT mice. Cartilage area fraction also decreased with age in the femoral epiphysis (Figure 1B) and metaphysis (Figure 1D), irrespective of genotype. Cartilage area fraction was higher in ob/ob compared to WT mice at both sites. Negligible levels of cartilage matrix were observed in the diaphysis of WT mice (Figure 1E). In contrast, cartilage matrix was present in the diaphysis of ob/ob mice and significant changes with age were not detected. Figure 1.

By 4 months of age, little cartilage remained in femur epiphysis, metaphysis, or diaphysis in WT mice. In contrast, cartilage is clearly evident at all 3 sites in ob/ob mice. Bone bridging across the growth plate, indicative of cessation of longitudinal growth, was evident in 6-month-old WT and ob/ob mice (Figure 3) but not in 2-month-old or 4-month-old mice, verifying cessation of linear growth by 6 months of age in both genotypes.

Study 2: Effect of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy on Bone and Cartilage in ob/ob Mice The effects of long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on cancellous bone area fraction in the femoral epiphysis and metaphysis and cartilage retention in the femoral epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis in ob/ob mice are shown in Figure 4. There was a tendency (P < 0.1) for cancellous bone area fraction to be higher in the epiphysis of rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated control mice (Figure 4A). Differences in cancellous bone area fraction were not detected with treatment in the femoral metaphysis (Figure 4C). Cartilage matrix was present in the epiphysis (Figure 4B), metaphysis (Figure 4D), and diaphysis (Figure 4E) in untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated control mice. Treatment with rAAV-Lep resulted in lower cartilage area fraction in the epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis in comparison to untreated mice, lower cartilage area fraction in the metaphysis in comparison to rAAV-GFP mice and a tendency (P < 0.1) for lower cartilage area fraction in the epiphysis and diaphysis in comparison to rAAV-GFP mice. Significant differences between untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated mice were not detected for any of the endpoints evaluated. Photomicrographs illustrating the distribution of cartilage matrix in representative 9-month-old untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice are shown in Figure 5. Figure 4.

Note the presence of cartilage matrix in epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis of untreated mice (A, D, and G, respectively) and rAAV-GFP-treated mice (B, E, and H, respectively) and its absence in rAAV-Lep-treated mice (C, F, and I, respectively).The effects of long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on cellular indices of cancellous bone turnover in the femoral epiphysis are shown in Figure 6. Osteoclast perimeter (Figure 6A) and osteoblast perimeter (Figure 6B) were higher in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated mice.

    "discussion": "Discussion Compared to WT mice, more extracellular cartilage matrix was present in cancellous compartments (metaphysis and epiphysis) of distal femur in ob/ob mice. Cartilage matrix decreased with increasing age in both WT and ob/ob mice but, in marked contrast to WT mice, cartilage continued to be present in the epiphysis and metaphysis in skeletally mature 6-month-old ob/ob mice. Minimal or no cartilage matrix was found in the diaphysis of WT mice. In contrast, cartilage matrix was present in the diaphysis in ob/ob mice, but unlike at cancellous sites, did not decrease with age. Long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy in growing ob/ob mice reduced cartilage matrix at all skeletal sites evaluated. Lack of differences between rAAV-Lep and rAAV-GFP-treated mice provides strong evidence that increased leptin levels and not differences arising from the application of gene therapy were responsible for the skeletal changes observed. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage in the epiphysis in rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice was associated with increased bone turnover (increased osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters). Bone resorption is reduced in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice due to impaired osteoclast function (Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). Bone formation is also reduced in leptin-signaling-deficient mice due to reduced osteoblast-lined bone perimeter and reduced osteoblast activity (Turner et al. 2013). We hypothesized that the resulting reduction in turnover of primary spongiosa was the primary cause for prolonged retention of cartilage within the skeleton in ob/ob mice (Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). This hypothesis is supported by the current study. The slower matrix turnover in the epiphysis compared to metaphysis was positively associated with longer retention of cartilage matrix. In addition, a reduction in cartilage in the epiphysis following hypothalamic leptin gene therapy was associated with increased bone turnover. A similar relationship was previously observed for the metaphysis (Turner et al. 2013). Osteoclasts play a key role in endochondral ossification. Osteoclasts are essential for (1) generation of primary spongiosa by directing vascular invasion into the growth plate and (2) replacement of mineralized cartilage matrix by bone to form secondary spongiosa (Odgren, et al. 2016). Cartilage matrix is prevalent in distal femur in 2-month-old WT mice because the rate of cartilage matrix deposition during longitudinal growth exceeds the capacity of matrix turnover to replace cartilage with bone. However, longitudinal bone growth slows with age and in male B6 mice ceases between 4 and 6 months of age (Glatt, et al. 2007; Hoshi, et al. 2004). Cessation of linear bone growth in small rodents is due to the formation of bony bridges across growth plate cartilage precluding further elongation (Martin, et al. 2003). In the current study, bony bridges were observed in the distal femur growth plate at 6 months of age in WT as well as ob/ob mice. The age range for longitudinal growth cessation corresponds to the disappearance of cartilage matrix from cancellous compartments. Endochondral ossification is disrupted in long bones of ob/ob mice, resulting in shorter bones, abnormal cancellous architecture, and delayed replacement of cartilage matrix in primary spongiosa by bone matrix (Turner et al. 2013). In concordance with Kishida et al. (Kishida, et al. 2005), we noted disorganized growth plate architecture in the leptin-deficient mice. Furthermore, prior studies demonstrated that thinning of the proliferative zone of the growth plate is associated with reduced longitudinal bone growth rate (Philbrick et al. 2015). Chondrocytes express the leptin receptor (Kishida et al. 2005; Steppan et al. 2000) and leptin was shown to exert positive actions affecting growth plate organization and growth plate expansion (Gat-Yablonski et al. 2004; Kishida et al. 2005). Hypertrophic chondrocytes contribute to programed removal of cartilage matrix by secretion of factors such as TNFSF11 (RANKL), MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), MMP13 (collagenase 3), and HMGB1 (high-mobility group protein 1) that mediate vascular invasion and are altered by leptin status (Koskinen, et al. 2011; Mackie, et al. 2011; Schroeter, et al. 2012; Xiong, et al. 2011). Thus, impaired chondrocyte function may contribute to the defect in osteoclast activity in ob/ob mice. Cortical bone in the femoral diaphysis develops by secondary intramembranous ossification. The presence of cartilage within the diaphysis of ob/ob mice represents a pathological condition likely contributing to the lower biomechanical strength reported in ob/ob and db/db mice (Ealey et al. 2006; Henriksen, et al. 2011; Tuukkanen, et al. 2000; Williams, et al. 2011). Haversian (intracortical) bone remodeling is absent in mice. This may explain why cartilage matrix trapped in the distal femur diaphysis in ob/ob mice did not decline in quantity as the mice aged. Leptin deficiency results in hypogonadism, hyperphagia, insulin resistance, and morbid obesity. These metabolic and endocrine abnormalities could indirectly influence bone metabolism and thus contribute to skeletal defects observed in ob/ob mice (Turner, et al. 2017). Indeed, normalization of food intake, weight gain, and blood glucose levels in ob/ob mice actually exaggerated the abnormal skeletal phenotype (Turner et al. 2014), while estrogen receptor blockade did not impair the skeletal response of ob/ob mice to leptin (Turner et al. 2017). Additionally, leptin exerted actions on the skeleton at levels having minimal impact on either energy metabolism or gonadal function (Philbrick et al. 2017). Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that leptin acts on the skeleton to regulate bone growth and turnover. Leptin deficiency also results in hypocalcemia (Ishida, et al. 1988; Ozata, et al. 1999), retinopathy (Kondo and Kahn 2004), hearing loss (Lee, et al. 2008), and tooth defects (Batt 1978, 1992). These abnormalities may be due, at least in part, to reduced osteoclast function. In support, defective bone resorption associated with osteopetrosis was shown to lead to impaired tooth eruption, and impaired hearing and vision (Kocher and Kasser 2003). Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy normalized bone microarchitecture in growing ob/ob mice by increasing bone growth and turnover (Iwaniec et al. 2007; Kalra et al. 2009; Turner et al. 2013). In the current study, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy promoted maturation of cancellous bone in distal femur. Infusion of leptin into the hypothalamus was initially reported to be antiosteogenic (Ducy, et al. 2000) but subsequent studies failed to confirm this finding (Bartell et al. 2011; Hamrick et al. 2005). Specifically, the latter studies reported that leptin infusion into the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice increased bone formation, bone mineral density, and expression of osteogenic genes (Bartell et al. 2011; Hamrick et al. 2005). In support, we observed that increasing hypothalamic leptin levels by gene therapy increased histomorphometric, biochemical, and gene expression markers of bone formation in ob/ob mice (Turner, et al. 2015). In addition to increased bone formation, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoclast perimeter, an index of bone resorption, suggesting that leptin regulates bone turnover as well as bone accrual. In summary, whereas cartilage matrix was absent within bone in 6-month-old WT mice, ob/ob mice retained cartilage matrix to varying degrees at all anatomical sites evaluated. Long-duration hypothalamic rAAV-Lep gene therapy in ob/ob mice increased bone turnover, resulting in substantial reduction in cartilage matrix within bone. Our findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is site-specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.",

Copyright notice ID: 5771473 MSID: MS925100 PMID: 29191939 The publisher's version of this article is available at J Endocrinol Abstract Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover. Keywords: bone formation and resorption, cartilage, histology, ob/ob, osteoclastIntroduction The appetite regulatory hormone leptin is produced by adipose tissue (Zhang, et al. 1994), circulates in levels proportional to total adiposity (Considine, et al. 1996), and may act to couple skeletal metabolism to energy availability (Gat-Yablonski, et al. 2004; Hamrick 2004; Iwaniec, et al. 2007; Steppan, et al. 2000; Turner, et al. 2013; Turner, et al. 2014). Long bones in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are shorter, biomechanically weaker, and exhibit lower overall bone mass and greater marrow adiposity compared to wild type (WT) mice (Ealey, et al. 2006; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Lindenmaier, et al. 2016; Steppan et al. 2000; Turner et al. 2014). However, differences in cancellous bone volume fraction between ob/ob and WT mice vary depending upon skeletal site and age. Leptin treatment in leptin-deficient mice normalizes bone volume and microarchitecture (Iwaniec et al. 2007) by increasing bone formation (Bartell, et al. 2011; Hamrick, et al. 2005; Kalra, et al. 2009; Steppan et al. 2000; Turner et al. 2013) and resorption (Bartell et al. 2011; Philbrick, et al. 2015; Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014), and increasing longitudinal bone growth (Gat-Yablonski et al. 2004; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Philbrick et al. 2015; Turner et al. 2013). Leptin treatment also normalizes bone marrow adiposity by reducing marrow adipocyte number and size (Lindenmaier et al. 2016). Taken together, these findings indicate that leptin affects bone marrow adiposity and skeletal growth, maturation, and turnover balance. Calcified cartilage provides a structural template for growing long bones during endochondral ossification and is normally replaced by bone during skeletal maturation. However, long bones of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice retain cartilage within cortical and cancellous bone compartments into adulthood resulting in a mild osteopetrotic skeletal phenotype (Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). Osteopetrosis is broadly characterized into two major subtypes, osteoclast-poor and osteoclast-rich (Sobacchi, et al. 2013). Mutations and/or factors that inhibit osteoclast formation are responsible for osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis. In contrast, mutations or factors that reduce osteoclast activity but do not inhibit osteoclast formation are responsible for the osteoclast-rich form of the disease. Both forms of osteopetrosis result in reduced bone resorption (Arruda, et al. 2016; Unnanuntana, et al. 2011). Severe osteopetrosis is fatal while mild forms, such as that noted in ob/ob mice, result in decreased bone quality. Furthermore, some forms of osteopetrosis are self-limiting; abnormally high quantities of cartilage are initially present in bone during rapid growth but the cartilage is eventually replaced as skeletal growth slows with age (Cielinski and Marks 1994). At present, it is unclear whether the mild osteopetrosis observed in growing ob/ob mice is self-limiting. Osteoclast perimeter in ob/ob mice is equal to or greater than in WT mice (Hamrick, et al. 2004; Philbrick et al. 2015; Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). In contrast, serum levels of carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTx, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption) are generally much lower and fluorochrome label retention in bone (a histomorphometric index of local bone resorption) is higher in ob/ob mice compared to WT mice, providing strong complementary evidence that leptin deficiency results in reduced bone resorption (Bartell et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). Theoretically, excessive bone formation could contribute to mild osteopetrosis. However, bone formation is impaired by leptin deficiency (Bartell et al. 2011; Hamrick et al. 2005; Philbrick, et al. 2017; Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014), indicating that lower osteoclastic activity is responsible for the condition in ob/ob mice. Osteoclast-rich forms of osteopetrosis can be induced by loss of function mutations in genes coding for proteins such as protease cathepsin K or chloride transporter ClCN7 required for osteoclastic activity but not for osteoclast formation and survival (Del Fattore, et al. 2008). Additionally, drugs that inhibit bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates, have been shown to induce osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis in children (Whyte, et al. 2003). The mechanism for leptin regulation of osteoclast activity has yet to be established but likely involves coordinated actions of the hormone on multiple genes that in concert regulate osteoclast activity. In support, gene profiling has established that leptin deficiency results in altered expression of several genes related to osteoclast differentiation and function (Turner et al. 2014). In the present investigation, we queried the extent to which osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) WT and ob/ob male mice. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy in 2-month-old ob/ob mice to restore leptin signaling and evaluated the bone response 7 months later. rAAV gene therapy has been used as an experimental strategy for life-long restoration of leptin signaling in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (Iwaniec et al. 2007; Iwaniec, et al. 2009; Kalra et al. 2009).Materials and Methods Animals Male C57BL/6J (B6) mice and ob/ob mice on a B6 genetic background were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). Mice were maintained in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were housed individually in a temperature (22°C) and light-controlled (lights on 6am – 6pm) room. Food (standard mouse chow) and water were available ad libitum to all animals.Study 1: Effects of Age and Leptin Status on Bone and Cartilage in Femur Study 1 was performed in WT and ob/ob mice to determine the distribution of cartilage in femurs in animals sacrificed at 2 (n=10/group), 4 (n=5/group), and 6 (n=3-5/group) months of age. Two-month-old mice are rapidly growing while skeletal maturity is reached between 4 and 6 months of age.Study 2: Effect of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy on Bone and Cartilage in ob/ob Mice Study 2 was performed in ob/ob mice to determine if the osteopetrotic skeletal phenotype persists in aged mice and, if so, whether long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy normalizes skeletal maturation. Two-month-old ob/ob mice were randomized into one of three treatment groups: (1) untreated control (n=7), (2) rAAV-Leptin (rAAV-Lep, n=9), or rAAV-GFP (control vector encoding green fluorescent protein, n=7). The mice were maintained for 7 months post-vector administration. The effects of treatment on hypothalamic leptin gene expression, food intake, body weight, circulating metabolic hormone levels, bone microarchitecture, and bone marrow adiposity have been reported elsewhere (Boghossian, et al. 2007; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Lindenmaier et al. 2016). Construction and packaging of recombinant adenovirus vectors (rAAV) rAAV-Lep and rAAV-GFP vectors were constructed and packaged as described (Beretta, et al. 2002). In brief, the vector pTR-CBA-Ob EcoRI fragment of pCR-rOb containing rat leptin cDNA was subcloned into rAAV vector plasmid pAAVβGEnh after deleting the EcoRI fragment carrying the β-glucoronidase cDNA sequence. The control vector, rAAV-GFP, was similarly constructed to encode the GFP gene.Vector administration For vector administration, the mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, ip), placed on a Kopf stereotaxic apparatus with mouse adapter for intracerebroventricular (icv) injection, and injected icv with either rAAV-Lep (9 × 107 particles) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 107 particles). This dose was shown to normalize body weight in ob/ob mice (Ueno, et al. 2004; Ueno, et al. 2006). The coordinates employed for microinjector placement in the 3rd cerebroventricle were 0.3 mm posterior to bregma, 0.0 lateral to midline, and 4.2 mm below the dura (Boghossian, et al. 2006).Tissue collection and analyses Mice were anesthetized with either isoflurane delivered in oxygen (Study 1) or sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg; ip) (Study 2) and killed by exsanguination. Femora were excised, cleaned of soft tissue, placed in 10% formalin for 24 hrs, and stored in 70% ethanol until processing. Distal femora were prepared for histomorphometric evaluation as described (Iwaniec, et al. 2008). In brief, undecalcified femora were dehydrated and embedded in modified methyl methacrylate. Frontal sections, 4 μm thick, were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2065) and affixed to gel-coated slides. One slide was stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counter stained with toluidine blue (pH 2.5) to identify osteoclasts and cartilage matrix, respectively. Cartilage matrix was identified by metachromatic staining of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. A second slide was stained using the Von Kossa method and counter stained with tetrachrome to identify osteoblasts and verify that linear growth had ceased in the femur in 6-month-old mice: the presence of bone bridging across the growth plate was used as an index of termination of longitudinal bone growth (Martin, et al. 2003). Cartilage was measured in cancellous bone in the distal femur epiphysis and metaphysis and in cortical bone in the femoral diaphysis. The entire cancellous envelope was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis. The region of interest in the distal femur metaphysis was located 0.25-0.85 mm proximal to the growth plate and 0.05 mm from cortical bone. Cortical bone was evaluated 4.4-5.6 mm proximal to the growth plate. Measurements of cartilage included metachromatic stained area and chondrocyte area in the epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis. Measurements excluded growth plate and articular cartilage matrix. Osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %) and osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter, %) were also determined in the epiphysis. Measurements were done at either 20 or 40x using the Osteomeasure Histomorphometry System (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA). Histomorphometric data are reported using standard 2-dimensional nomenclature (Dempster, et al. 2013).Statistics Mean responses for bone and cartilage area fraction were compared between WT and ob/ob mice at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months using analysis of covariance (age modeled as a quantitative variable with linear structure) or two-way analysis of variance (age modeled as a categorical variable). Goodness of fit assessment from scatterplots, Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and Anderson-Darling tests of normality, and model selection from Akaike’s information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and likelihood ratio tests were used to determine a linear model and evaluate contributions from interactions and main effects. Linear models containing different variance parameters across age and/or genotype groups were used to accommodate heterogeneous variance. Mean responses for bone and cartilage fraction, and osteoblast and osteoclast perimeter were compared between the ob/ob, ob/ob + rAAV-GFP, and ob/ob + rAAV-Lep groups using one-way analysis of variance, with t-tests used to make pairwise comparisons. The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used when only the normality assumption was violated, in which case the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for two-group comparisons. A modified F test was used when variances were distinct, with Welch’s two-sample t-test used for two-group comparisons (Welch 1951). The Benjamini and Hochberg (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Trends are reported when P < 0.1. All data are presented as mean ± SE. Data analysis was performed using R version 3.2.2.Results Study 1: Effects of Age and Leptin Status on Bone and Cartilage in Femur The effects of age and leptin status on cancellous bone area fraction in the femoral epiphysis and metaphysis and on cartilage retention in the femoral epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis in WT and ob/ob mice are shown in Figure 1. Cancellous bone area fraction decreased with age in epiphysis (Figure 1A) and metaphysis (Figure 1C). The rate of decrease was not affected by genotype (interaction not significant). However, cancellous bone area fraction was lower in the epiphysis and tended to be lower (P < 0.1) in the metaphysis in ob/ob mice compared to WT mice. Cartilage area fraction also decreased with age in the femoral epiphysis (Figure 1B) and metaphysis (Figure 1D), irrespective of genotype. Cartilage area fraction was higher in ob/ob compared to WT mice at both sites. Negligible levels of cartilage matrix were observed in the diaphysis of WT mice (Figure 1E). In contrast, cartilage matrix was present in the diaphysis of ob/ob mice and significant changes with age were not detected. Figure 1.

Data are mean ± SE; n = 10/group for 2-month-old mice, n = 5/group for 4-month-old mice, n = 3 and 5/group for 6-month-old WT and ob/ob mice, respectively.Photomicrographs illustrating the distribution of cartilage matrix in the femoral epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis in representative 4-month-old WT and ob/ob mice are shown in Figure 2. By 4 months of age, little cartilage remained in femur epiphysis, metaphysis, or diaphysis in WT mice. In contrast, cartilage is clearly evident at all 3 sites in ob/ob mice. Bone bridging across the growth plate, indicative of cessation of longitudinal growth, was evident in 6-month-old WT and ob/ob mice (Figure 3) but not in 2-month-old or 4-month-old mice, verifying cessation of linear growth by 6 months of age in both genotypes.

Whereas cartilage matrix was rare in the epiphysis in WT mice (A), cartilage matrix and chondrocytes were readily visible in the epiphysis of ob/ob mice (B). Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice also exhibited a highly disorganized growth plate architecture, characterized by irregular margins and width (B). Cartilage was rare in the metaphysis and diaphysis of WT mice (C and E, respectively), but present at both sites in ob/ob mice (D and F).Figure 3.

The bony bridges are indicative of cessation of longitudinal growth.Study 2: Effect of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy on Bone and Cartilage in ob/ob Mice The effects of long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on cancellous bone area fraction in the femoral epiphysis and metaphysis and cartilage retention in the femoral epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis in ob/ob mice are shown in Figure 4. There was a tendency (P < 0.1) for cancellous bone area fraction to be higher in the epiphysis of rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated control mice (Figure 4A). Differences in cancellous bone area fraction were not detected with treatment in the femoral metaphysis (Figure 4C). Cartilage matrix was present in the epiphysis (Figure 4B), metaphysis (Figure 4D), and diaphysis (Figure 4E) in untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated control mice. Treatment with rAAV-Lep resulted in lower cartilage area fraction in the epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis in comparison to untreated mice, lower cartilage area fraction in the metaphysis in comparison to rAAV-GFP mice and a tendency (P < 0.1) for lower cartilage area fraction in the epiphysis and diaphysis in comparison to rAAV-GFP mice. Significant differences between untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated mice were not detected for any of the endpoints evaluated. Photomicrographs illustrating the distribution of cartilage matrix in representative 9-month-old untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice are shown in Figure 5. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Effects of long-duration (7 months) hypothalamic leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) on cancellous bone area fraction in distal femur epiphysis (A) and metaphysis (C) and cartilage retention in cancellous bone in distal femur epiphysis (B) and metaphysis (D) and in cortical bone in femur diaphysis (E) in male ob/ob mice. Data are mean ± SE; n = 7-9/group, adifferent from untreated, P < 0.05, a*P < 0.1; bdifferent rAAV-GFP, P < 0.05, b*P < 0.1.Figure 5. Open in a new tab Photomicrographs of the distal femur epiphysis (A, B, C), metaphysis (D, E, F), and diaphysis (G, H, I) in representative 9-month-old untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated and rAAV-Lep-treated male ob/ob mice at 7 months post-vector administration. Note the presence of cartilage matrix in epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis of untreated mice (A, D, and G, respectively) and rAAV-GFP-treated mice (B, E, and H, respectively) and its absence in rAAV-Lep-treated mice (C, F, and I, respectively).The effects of long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on cellular indices of cancellous bone turnover in the femoral epiphysis are shown in Figure 6. Osteoclast perimeter (Figure 6A) and osteoblast perimeter (Figure 6B) were higher in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated mice. Significant differences in either osteoclast perimeter or osteoblast perimeter were not detected between untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated controls. Figure 6.

Data are mean ± SE; n = 7-9/group. adifferent from untreated, P < 0.05; bdifferent from rAAV-GFP, P < 0.05.Discussion Compared to WT mice, more extracellular cartilage matrix was present in cancellous compartments (metaphysis and epiphysis) of distal femur in ob/ob mice. Cartilage matrix decreased with increasing age in both WT and ob/ob mice but, in marked contrast to WT mice, cartilage continued to be present in the epiphysis and metaphysis in skeletally mature 6-month-old ob/ob mice. Minimal or no cartilage matrix was found in the diaphysis of WT mice. In contrast, cartilage matrix was present in the diaphysis in ob/ob mice, but unlike at cancellous sites, did not decrease with age. Long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy in growing ob/ob mice reduced cartilage matrix at all skeletal sites evaluated. Lack of differences between rAAV-Lep and rAAV-GFP-treated mice provides strong evidence that increased leptin levels and not differences arising from the application of gene therapy were responsible for the skeletal changes observed. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage in the epiphysis in rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice was associated with increased bone turnover (increased osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters). Bone resorption is reduced in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice due to impaired osteoclast function (Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). Bone formation is also reduced in leptin-signaling-deficient mice due to reduced osteoblast-lined bone perimeter and reduced osteoblast activity (Turner et al. 2013). We hypothesized that the resulting reduction in turnover of primary spongiosa was the primary cause for prolonged retention of cartilage within the skeleton in ob/ob mice (Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). This hypothesis is supported by the current study. The slower matrix turnover in the epiphysis compared to metaphysis was positively associated with longer retention of cartilage matrix. In addition, a reduction in cartilage in the epiphysis following hypothalamic leptin gene therapy was associated with increased bone turnover. A similar relationship was previously observed for the metaphysis (Turner et al. 2013). Osteoclasts play a key role in endochondral ossification. Osteoclasts are essential for (1) generation of primary spongiosa by directing vascular invasion into the growth plate and (2) replacement of mineralized cartilage matrix by bone to form secondary spongiosa (Odgren, et al. 2016). Cartilage matrix is prevalent in distal femur in 2-month-old WT mice because the rate of cartilage matrix deposition during longitudinal growth exceeds the capacity of matrix turnover to replace cartilage with bone. However, longitudinal bone growth slows with age and in male B6 mice ceases between 4 and 6 months of age (Glatt, et al. 2007; Hoshi, et al. 2004). Cessation of linear bone growth in small rodents is due to the formation of bony bridges across growth plate cartilage precluding further elongation (Martin, et al. 2003). In the current study, bony bridges were observed in the distal femur growth plate at 6 months of age in WT as well as ob/ob mice. The age range for longitudinal growth cessation corresponds to the disappearance of cartilage matrix from cancellous compartments. Endochondral ossification is disrupted in long bones of ob/ob mice, resulting in shorter bones, abnormal cancellous architecture, and delayed replacement of cartilage matrix in primary spongiosa by bone matrix (Turner et al. 2013). In concordance with Kishida et al. (Kishida, et al. 2005), we noted disorganized growth plate architecture in the leptin-deficient mice. Furthermore, prior studies demonstrated that thinning of the proliferative zone of the growth plate is associated with reduced longitudinal bone growth rate (Philbrick et al. 2015). Chondrocytes express the leptin receptor (Kishida et al. 2005; Steppan et al. 2000) and leptin was shown to exert positive actions affecting growth plate organization and growth plate expansion (Gat-Yablonski et al. 2004; Kishida et al. 2005). Hypertrophic chondrocytes contribute to programed removal of cartilage matrix by secretion of factors such as TNFSF11 (RANKL), MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), MMP13 (collagenase 3), and HMGB1 (high-mobility group protein 1) that mediate vascular invasion and are altered by leptin status (Koskinen, et al. 2011; Mackie, et al. 2011; Schroeter, et al. 2012; Xiong, et al. 2011). Thus, impaired chondrocyte function may contribute to the defect in osteoclast activity in ob/ob mice. Cortical bone in the femoral diaphysis develops by secondary intramembranous ossification. The presence of cartilage within the diaphysis of ob/ob mice represents a pathological condition likely contributing to the lower biomechanical strength reported in ob/ob and db/db mice (Ealey et al. 2006; Henriksen, et al. 2011; Tuukkanen, et al. 2000; Williams, et al. 2011). Haversian (intracortical) bone remodeling is absent in mice. This may explain why cartilage matrix trapped in the distal femur diaphysis in ob/ob mice did not decline in quantity as the mice aged. Leptin deficiency results in hypogonadism, hyperphagia, insulin resistance, and morbid obesity. These metabolic and endocrine abnormalities could indirectly influence bone metabolism and thus contribute to skeletal defects observed in ob/ob mice (Turner, et al. 2017). Indeed, normalization of food intake, weight gain, and blood glucose levels in ob/ob mice actually exaggerated the abnormal skeletal phenotype (Turner et al. 2014), while estrogen receptor blockade did not impair the skeletal response of ob/ob mice to leptin (Turner et al. 2017). Additionally, leptin exerted actions on the skeleton at levels having minimal impact on either energy metabolism or gonadal function (Philbrick et al. 2017). Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that leptin acts on the skeleton to regulate bone growth and turnover. Leptin deficiency also results in hypocalcemia (Ishida, et al. 1988; Ozata, et al. 1999), retinopathy (Kondo and Kahn 2004), hearing loss (Lee, et al. 2008), and tooth defects (Batt 1978, 1992). These abnormalities may be due, at least in part, to reduced osteoclast function. In support, defective bone resorption associated with osteopetrosis was shown to lead to impaired tooth eruption, and impaired hearing and vision (Kocher and Kasser 2003). Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy normalized bone microarchitecture in growing ob/ob mice by increasing bone growth and turnover (Iwaniec et al. 2007; Kalra et al. 2009; Turner et al. 2013). In the current study, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy promoted maturation of cancellous bone in distal femur. Infusion of leptin into the hypothalamus was initially reported to be antiosteogenic (Ducy, et al. 2000) but subsequent studies failed to confirm this finding (Bartell et al. 2011; Hamrick et al. 2005). Specifically, the latter studies reported that leptin infusion into the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice increased bone formation, bone mineral density, and expression of osteogenic genes (Bartell et al. 2011; Hamrick et al. 2005). In support, we observed that increasing hypothalamic leptin levels by gene therapy increased histomorphometric, biochemical, and gene expression markers of bone formation in ob/ob mice (Turner, et al. 2015). In addition to increased bone formation, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoclast perimeter, an index of bone resorption, suggesting that leptin regulates bone turnover as well as bone accrual. In summary, whereas cartilage matrix was absent within bone in 6-month-old WT mice, ob/ob mice retained cartilage matrix to varying degrees at all anatomical sites evaluated. Long-duration hypothalamic rAAV-Lep gene therapy in ob/ob mice increased bone turnover, resulting in substantial reduction in cartilage matrix within bone. Our findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is site-specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.Acknowledgments We thank Dr. S.P.

    "abstract": "Abstract Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is essential for normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC50 infusion rates of 7–17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC50, 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion with 12 ng/h leptin increased expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone’s CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions. Keywords: animal model, bone formation, osteoblasts, neuroendocrine, bone histomorphometry",
    "introduction": "Introduction Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is produced primarily by adipocytes and secreted into the vascular circulation in proportion to fat stored in adipose depots (Jequier 2002). Leptin receptors are widely expressed in peripheral tissues and the adipokine can act directly on a variety of cells to regulate their differentiation and metabolism (Anubhuti and Arora 2008; Sainz, et al. 2015). Additionally, the hormone is transported across the blood brain barrier (BBB) where it functions to regulate appetite and energy expenditure (Banks, et al. 1996). Leptin signaling is required for normal bone growth in rodents. Absence of leptin signaling in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice or leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice and fa/fa rats results in a plethora of skeletal abnormalities, the most common of which are reduced bone length, bone- and bone compartment-specific alterations in cancellous bone volume fraction, reduced cortical thickness, and reduced cortical and total bone mass (Ealey, et al. 2006; Gat-Yablonski and Phillip 2008; Hamrick, et al. 2004; Williams, et al. 2011). At the cellular level, these abnormalities are associated with impaired endochondral ossification, lower bone formation due to reductions in osteoblast number and activity, and mild osteopetrosis due to impaired osteoclast function (Kishida, et al. 2005; Turner, et al. 2013). Not surprisingly, bone mechanical properties are often reduced and bone regeneration impaired in leptin signaling-deficient rodents (Hamann, et al. 2014; Hamann, et al. 2013; Khan, et al. 2013; Picke, et al. 2015; Wallner, et al. 2015). Leptin receptors are expressed on many mesenchymal and hematopoietic lineage-derived cells residing in bone and cartilage, suggesting that the hormone may act locally to regulate skeletal metabolism. However, leptin-deficient rodents also develop morbid obesity, reduced core body temperature, elevated corticosteroid levels, insulin resistance, and hypogonadism, each of which, alone or in combination, may influence bone metabolism through leptin-independent pathways (Iwaniec, et al. 2009; Lindstrom 2007; Saito and Bray 1983). Indeed, equalization of weight gain, blood glucose levels, and energy balance of ob/ob to that of wild type (WT) mice worsened the skeletal phenotype associated with leptin deficiency (Turner, et al. 2014). Thus, the skeletal phenotype of leptin-deficient mice is likely due to perturbation in multiple pathways. Understanding the precise role of leptin in regulating bone growth and maturation is important because in humans low leptin levels are associated with low peak bone mass which in turn is associated with increased fracture risk (Farr and Khosla 2015). A saturable transport mechanism is required for leptin to cross the BBB (Banks et al. 1996). As a consequence, leptin levels in peripheral circulation are typically over 10 times greater than the levels within the brain. The existence of this concentration gradient suggests higher occupancy of leptin receptor in peripheral tissues than brain (Scatchard 1948). We therefore determined the relative responsiveness of bone and other target tissues to circulating leptin levels. This was accomplished by performing a 12-day dose-response study in which physiologically relevant concentrations of the hormone were continuously infused into ob/ob mice using sc implanted osmotic pumps to model leptin production by adipose tissue.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Experimental design Six-week-old female ob/ob and homozygous WT (+/+) littermate mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The animals were placed at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) immediately upon arrival at Oregon State University and maintained singly housed on a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle. Thermoneutral housing was used to avoid mild cold stress associated with standard room temperature (Iwaniec, et al. 2016; Kokolus, et al. 2013). The ob/ob mice were randomized by weight into one of 6 treatment groups (n=8 mice/group) with leptin delivered at a dose rate of 0 (vehicle), 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.5, or 10 μg/d (equivalent to 0, 4, 12, 40, 140 or 400 ng/h or approximately equivalent to 0, 2.7, 8.2, 27, 96, and 274 μg/kg/d at treatment initiation based on a mean starting ob/ob mouse weight of 36.5 g). Vehicle (20 mM Tris-HCL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or mouse leptin (498-OB-05M, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was infused using sc-implanted osmotic pumps (Alzet Model 1002, Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) for the 12-day duration of study. WT mice (n=9) were untreated. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to all animals. Body weight was recorded on days −2, 0 (pump implantation), 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Food records were started on day −2, one day after arrival/placement into thermoneutral housing. Food intake was recorded on days −1, 3, 6, 10, and 12. Fluorochromes were administered at 9 (declomycin), 4 (calcein) and 1 (calcein) d prior to necropsy to label mineralizing bone and cartilage as described (Turner et al. 2014). Mice were fasted overnight prior to necropsy, bled by cardiac puncture, and glucose measured using a glucometer (Life Scan, Inc., Milpitas, CA). Uteri and abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) were excised and weighed. Femora were removed, fixed for 24h in 10% buffered formalin and stored in 70% ethanol for microcomputed tomography and histomorphometric analysis. Tibiae and hypothalami were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80ºC for mRNA analysis. Serum chemistry Serum leptin was measured using Mouse Leptin Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), serum osteocalcin was measured using Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and serum CTx-1 was measured using Mouse C terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTx-1) ELISA kit (Life Sciences Advanced Technologies, St. Petersburg, FL) according to the respective manufacturer’s protocol. Intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for all ELISA assays were within the manufactures’ reported CVs of ≤ 5% for osteocalcin and leptin and ≤ 10% for CTx-1. Microcomputed Tomography Microcomputed tomography (μCT) was used for nondestructive 3-dimensional evaluation of cancellous bone volume and architecture. Femora were scanned in 70% ethanol using a Scanco μCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 x 12 x 12 μm (55 kVp x-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. Bone segmentation was conducted at a threshold of 245 (scale, 0–1000) determined empirically. Forty-two consecutive slices (504 μm) of cancellous bone, 45 slices (540 μm) proximal to the growth plate, were evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis. Direct cancellous bone measurements included cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume, %), trabecular number (mm−1), and trabecular thickness (μm). Histomorphometry The methods used to measure longitudinal bone growth and static and dynamic bone histomorphometry have been described (Iwaniec, et al. 2008) with modifications for mice (Turner et al. 2013). In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and xylene, and embedded undecalcified in modified methyl methacrylate. Longitudinal sections (4 μm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2065) and affixed to slides precoated with 1% gelatin solution. One section/animal was stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St Louis) and used for cell-based measurements. One section/animal was mounted unstained for measurement of fluorochrome labels. All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. Cell-based measurements included osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter, %) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %). Fluorochrome-based measurements of bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single label normalized to bone perimeter, %), 2) mineral apposition rate (the distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3 day interlabel interval, μm/d), 3) bone formation rate (bone formation rate/bone perimeter: calculated by multiplying mineralizing perimeter by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter, μm2/μm/y), and longitudinal bone growth (distance between the growth plate-metaphyseal junction and the declomycin label deposited in the primary spongiosa divided by the 9 day interval between label administration and necropsy, μm/day). All bone histomorphometric data are reported using standard 2-dimensional nomenclature (Dempster, et al. 2013). EC50 Calculation The EC50 for each response variable was the calculated dose required to achieve ½ of the maximum observed response. Gene expression Total RNA from tibia and hypothalamus were isolated from 5–6 mice/group and individually analyzed. Tibiae were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and further homogenized in Trizol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Hypothalamus was directly homogenized in Trizol. Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Life Technologies). The expression of 84 genes related to JAK/STAT signaling was determined for hypothalamus and bone using the mouse JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway RT2 Profiler PCR Array (PAMM-039Y) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The expression of 84 genes related to neurotransmitter receptors in hypothalamus and 84 genes related to bone formation and bone resorption in tibia was determined using the Mouse “Neurotransmitter Receptors” RT2 Profiler PCR Array (PAMM-060Z) and Mouse “Osteoporosis” RT2 Profiler PCR Array (PAMM-170Z), respectively. Gene expression in hypothalamus was normalized to Hsp90ab1 and in tibia was normalized to GAPDH. Relative quantification was determined (ΔΔCt method) using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software version 3.5 (Qiagen). Fold-change was calculated using vehicle-treated ob/ob mice as the control. Venn diagrams comparing the overlap of significantly (P < 0.05) differentially expressed genes with a ≥ 1.2-fold differential expression in ob/ob mice treated with 12 ng/h leptin and ob/ob mice treated with 140 ng/h leptin compared to ob/ob mice treated with vehicle were generated with BioVenn (Hulsen, et al. 2008). Statistical Analysis Mean responses were compared between six groups (vehicle control group and groups receiving leptin at 4, 12, 40, 140 or 400 ng/h) using separate one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A modified F test was used when the assumption of equal variance was violated, with Welch’s two-sample t-test used for pairwise comparisons (Welch 1955). The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used when only the normality assumption was violated, in which case the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for pairwise comparisons. The required conditions for valid use of ANOVA were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and the Anderson-Darling test of normality. The Benjamini and Hochberg method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). Mean food intake (g/d) for the ob/ob vehicle group was compared to the five ob/ob groups that received leptin (4, 12, 40, 140, and 400 ng/h) using longitudinal data collected one day prior to pump implantation (−1) and on days 3, 6, 10, and 12 post implantation. In addition, a comparison of mean body weight (g) for these groups was made using longitudinal data collected on days −2, 0 (pump implantation), and 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 post implantation. Multivariate linear regression models were fit using predictor variables for leptin group, time (treated as categorical and continuous), and the group by time interaction with different covariance structures, namely independence, unstructured, and compound symmetric and autoregressive of order 1 with equal and unequal variance over time. Linear mixed models with random intercepts and slopes were also considered. Model selection was performed using the Bayesian information criterion and likelihood ratio tests. Data analysis was performed using R version 2.12 (Team 2015).",
    "results": "Results The dose-response effects of leptin administration on serum leptin and indices related to energy metabolism in ob/ob mice are shown in Fig. 1. Leptin was consistently detected in serum of ob/ob mice when infused at 40 ng/h, achieved values similar to WT mice at 140 ng/h, and was elevated compared to WT mice at 400 ng/h (Fig. 1A). Thermogenesis is regulated by a combination of sensory and sympathetic inputs while appetite and pituitary hormone release (e.g., GnRH) are regulated by leptin through a hypothalamic relay. We therefore measured UCP-1 gene expression (Fig. 1B) as an index of non-shivering thermogenesis, and food intake (Fig. 1C and D) as an index of appetite. We measured body weight (Fig. 1E), abdominal white adipose tissue weight (Fig. 1F), and blood glucose (Fig. 1G) as additional endpoints related to energy metabolism. Finally, we measured uterine weight (Fig. 1H) as an index of GnRH release (Gibson, et al. 1994). UCP-1 gene expression in BAT, food intake over the treatment interval, and body weight change over the treatment interval were significantly affected at a leptin dose of 12 ng/h, corresponding to serum leptin at or below the detection limit of the immunoassay (0.5 ng/ml), whereas changes in other endpoints, including abdominal WAT weight, blood glucose levels, and uterine weight, required 40 ng/h or higher dose rates before achieving statistical significance. As expected (Iwaniec et al. 2016), transfer of mice from room temperature to thermoneutral housing resulted in a dramatic reduction in food intake (Figure 1C), with no impact on body weight in vehicle-treated mice. Depending on endpoint measured, the EC50 of leptin for indices of energy metabolism required dose rates of 40 – 80 ng/h (Figure 2A), corresponding to serum leptin levels between 2 and 6 ng/ml. Specifically, the EC50 was 80 ng/h for UCP-1 gene expression, 53 ng/h for cumulative food intake, 40 ng/h for body weight change, 66 ng/h for WAT weight, 68 ng/h for blood glucose, and 57 ng/h for uterine weight.

Please note the expected dramatic decrease in food intake in ob/ob mice associated with transfer from room temperature to thermoneutral housing (Iwaniec et al. 2016).

Open in a new tab The apparent half maximum effects (EC50) of leptin on indices of energy metabolism (A) and bone formation (B). Depending on endpoint measured, the half maximum effects of leptin on indices of energy metabolism were detected at dose rates of 40–80 ng/h whereas the half maximum effects of leptin on indices of bone formation were detected at dose rates of 7–25 ng/h. The vertical dotted lines indicate the range in EC50. Longitudinal bone growth rate (Fig. 3A), osteoblast perimeter (Fig. 3B), mineralizing perimeter (Fig. 3C), mineral apposition rate (Fig. 3D), bone formation rate (Fig. 3E), serum osteocalcin (Fig. 3F), osteoclast perimeter (Fig. 3G), and serum CTx-1 (Fig. 3H) were determined as indices of bone growth and turnover in distal femur metaphysis. Depending upon endpoint measured, positive effects of leptin were first observed for bone growth and formation parameters at rates of 4–12 ng/h. Significant differences in osteoclast perimeter were not detected with treatment, but serum CTx-1 was increased at leptin infusion rates of 140 and 400 ng/h. Representative micrographs illustrating the low dose (12 ng/h) effects of leptin on bone formation are shown in Fig. 2I-J. The low turnover of cancellous bone in ob/ob mice is illustrated by presence of declomycin label (administered 9 d prior to sacrifice) whereas extensive double calcein label (administered 4 d and 1 d prior to sacrifice) and the absence of declomycin label in ob/ob mice treated with leptin is indicative of high turnover (Turner et al. 2013). With the exception of trabecular thickness which was increased at and above leptin infusion rates of 40 ng/h (Fig. 1K), differences in cancellous bone microarchitecture (bone volume fraction, trabecular number, connectivity density or trabecular spacing) were not detected with treatment (data not shown). This was expected, given the short duration (12 days) of study. Depending on endpoint measured, the EC50 for leptin on indices of bone formation ranged from 7–25 ng/h (Fig 2B), corresponding to serum leptin levels of < 1 ng/ml. Specifically, the half maximum response occurred at 25 ng/h for longitudinal bone growth rate, 17 ng/h for osteoblast perimeter, 7 ng/h for mineralizing perimeter, 12 ng/h for mineral apposition rate, 10 ng/h for bone formation rate, 12 ng/h for serum osteocalcin, and 7 ng/h for trabecular thickness. The EC50 was not determined for osteoclast perimeter because no significant changes were detected. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Effects of 12 days of sc leptin infusion on longitudinal bone growth (A), indices of bone formation consisting of osteoblast perimeter (B), mineralizing perimeter (C), mineral apposition rate (D), bone formation rate (E), and serum osteocalcin (F), and indices of bone resorption consisting of osteoclast perimeter (G) and serum CTx-1 (H) in female ob/ob mice (n=8/group).

Effects of leptin on trabecular thickness, an index of bone microarchitecture, is shown in K. Data are mean ± SE. aDifferent from vehicle-treated ob/ob mice (ob/ob 0), P<0.05. WT is shown as a reference group. To verify the apparent dose-selective actions of leptin on hypothalamus and bone, we profiled changes in gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus in animals receiving leptin at 12 ng/h (a dose rate that increased longitudinal bone growth and bone formation but had minimal effect on energy metabolism) and 140 ng/h (a dose rate that affected both bone and energy metabolism), and compared these to vehicle-treated ob/ob controls using pathway-focused gene expression PCR arrays. Because leptin binds to its receptor to activate Jak/Stat signaling, we profiled genes related to activation of Jak/Stat signaling in hypothalamus and tibia. Functional outcomes of leptin treatment in hypothalamus and bone include increased neuronal signaling and increased bone growth and turnover, respectively. We therefore analyzed the effects of leptin on the expression of genes involved in neurotransmitter receptors in hypothalamus, and osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function in tibia. Differential gene expression was defined as P < 0.05 and a fold change of ≥ 1.2. As shown in the Venn diagrams (Fig. 4), leptin infusion at the dose rate of 12 ng/h had minimal effects on either Jak/Stat signaling genes or neurotransmitter receptor genes in hypothalamus (Fig. 4A and 4C). Only 2 genes and 5 genes, respectively were differentially expressed compared to ob/ob controls. In contrast, there were robust changes in Jak/Stat signaling genes (Fig. 4B) and bone cell-related genes (Fig. 4D) in tibia. A total of 25 genes involved in Jak/Stat signaling (Fig. 4B) and 21 genes involved in osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function (Fig. 4D) were differentially expressed in the tibia in ob/ob mice infused with leptin at a dose rate of 12 ng/h compared to vehicle-treated ob/ob controls. The 140 ng/h leptin dose resulted in robust changes in gene expression in hypothalamus and further increases in number of differentially expressed genes in tibia. All genes differentially expressed (P < 0.05) in response to leptin in hypothalamus and tibia, regardless of fold change, are identified in Tables 1–4. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Venn diagrams showing the number of genes in hypothalamus (A and C) and tibia (B and D) that were differentially expressed (meeting criteria of p < 0.05 and fold-change of ≥ 1.2) in ob/ob mice (n=5) treated with 12 ng/h leptin (light gray) and ob/ob mice (n=5) treated with 140 ng/h leptin (dark gray) compared to ob/ob mice treated with vehicle (n=6). RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays were used to quantify expression of transcripts associated with JAK/STAT signaling (A and B), neurotransmitter receptors (C), and genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function (D). Please note the paucity of differentially expressed genes in the hypothalamus compared to tibia in mice infused with leptin at a dose rate of 12 ng/h (2 versus 25 for Jak/Stat signaling and 5 versus 21 for neurotransmitter/bone metabolism). Also note the increases in differentially expressed genes, particularly in hypothalamus, in mice infused with leptin at a dose rate of 140 ng/h. The higher dose rate results in blood leptin levels in ob/ob mice similar to WT mice. Table 1.

    "discussion": "Discussion This study was performed to determine the dose response effects of leptin on bone and energy metabolism. The results demonstrate that leptin acts on the skeleton at dose rates having minimal impact on energy metabolism. Specifically, leptin increased osteoblast perimeter, mineralizing perimeter, and bone formation rate at an infusion rate of 4 ng/h, and mineral apposition rate and longitudinal growth rate at an infusion rate of 12 ng/h. Leptin increased UCP-1 gene expression and decreased food intake and rate of body weight gain at an infusion rate of 12 ng/h. These dose rates (4 and 12 ng/h) resulted in serum leptin levels below or at the detection limit of the serum leptin immunoassay (0.5 ng/ml) and were insufficient to affect uterine weight, cumulative food intake, hyperglycemia, or abdominal WAT weight. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC50 ranging from 7–17 ng/h whereas higher leptin levels (EC50 of 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. Due to the short duration of study, few changes in bone microarchitecture were anticipated or detected. However, consistent with increased bone formation, a significant increase in trabecular thickness was noted in the leptin-treated mice. Few studies have investigated the dose-response effects of leptin. However, similar to the current findings, no effects of low sc infusion rates of leptin (<40 ng/h) for 12 days on terminal body weight, fat depots, and uterine weight were reported (Harris, et al. 1998; Trotter-Mayo and Roberts 2008). Higher doses (200 ng/h) of sc leptin were shown to be required to reduce body weight in WT mice and even higher doses (500 ng/h) were required to deplete fat stores (Halaas, et al. 1997). The precise mechanisms mediating the physiological actions of leptin on bone are uncertain. Delivery of leptin gene into the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice reversed the skeletal abnormalities in bone architecture associated with leptin deficiency (Iwaniec, et al. 2007). Also, once daily direct delivery of high concentrations of the hormone into the hypothalamus increased bone formation (Bartell, et al. 2011). In contrast, continuous infusion of high concentrations of leptin into the hypothalamus was reported to be antiosteogenic (Ducy, et al. 2000). Direct administration of leptin or the leptin gene into the hypothalamus was originally interpreted as evidence that leptin acts indirectly through a hypothalamic relay to regulate bone metabolism (Ducy et al. 2000; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Kalra, et al. 2009; Takeda, et al. 2002). However, this conclusion is predicated on intracerebroventricular (icv) leptin remaining within the central nervous system. This assumption is not well supported because there is ample evidence indicating that icv leptin readily enters peripheral circulation. Using tracer methodology, Maness et al. (Maness, et al. 1998) investigated the fate of leptin after icv administration and found that efflux of leptin from the brain occurred with reabsorption of the cerebrospinal fluid into the blood. Efflux was not saturable and the amount of leptin in peripheral circulation after icv injection actually equaled or exceeded levels seen 20 minutes following iv administration (Maness et al. 1998). The authors concluded that icv leptin achieves exposure levels in the brain at least 300 times higher than when delivered iv, but efficient reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid into the blood introduces leptin into peripheral circulation where the hormone can bind to receptors on target cells. This conclusion is also supported by Trotter-Mayo and Roberts (Trotter-Mayo and Roberts 2008) who compared ip and icv delivery of leptin (8 ng/h) and demonstrated that leptin delivered icv enters peripheral circulation and activates leptin receptors on thymocytes. In similar light, adoptive transfer of leptin-resistant db/db bone marrow into WT mice (db/db→WT) was shown to mimic the effects of leptin deficiency on bone without impacting centrally-mediated actions of leptin on energy metabolism (Turner et al. 2013). Importantly, icv leptin dose rates administered to ob/ob mice in bone studies described above have equaled or exceeded the dose rate (8 ng/h) used by Trotter-Mayo and Roberts (Trotter-Mayo and Roberts 2008) and would have resulted in hypothalamic leptin levels unlikely to be achieved physiologically. Thus, the exquisite sensitivity of bone to low blood levels of leptin reported in the current study combined with the knowledge that leptin is transported out of the brain into peripheral circulation following icv infusion question whether the skeletal response to icv leptin is entirely due to actions mediated centrally. The long form of the leptin receptor (LepRb) belongs to gp130 family of cytokine receptors and binding of leptin to LepRb activates the Jak/Stat intracellular signaling pathways (Nanjappa V 2011). The robust differential expression of genes related to Jak/Stat signaling in bone following sc administration of low dose leptin (12 ng/h) provides strong evidence that leptin acts directly on one or more target cells in mouse long bones. Although the present study does not identify the precise leptin target cells in bone, osteoblast lineage cells are candidates. Osteoblasts are reported to express leptin receptors and analysis of the osteoblast transcriptome supports a role for peripheral leptin signaling in bone cell function (Grundberg, et al. 2008). Leptin has also been shown to activate multiple pathways, including Jak/Stat, in cultured osteoblast lineage cells (Burguera, et al. 2006; Gordeladze, et al. 2002; Lee, et al. 2002; Yang, et al. 2014). In marked contrast to its actions on gene expression in tibia, leptin at 12 ng/h had minimal effects on genes related to Jak/Stat signaling in hypothalamus. However, higher levels of leptin (140 ng/h; resulting in serum leptin levels in ob/ob mice similar to that of WT mice) were associated with robust changes in gene expression in hypothalamus. In addition to the differential dose response, there was relatively little overlap in the genes regulated in tibia and hypothalamus and when there was overlap (e.g., Smads 1, 2 and 5), the genes were often differentially expressed in opposite directions. Taken together, these findings indicate that leptin targets Jak/Stat signaling in tibia as well as hypothalamus. In the present study, sc leptin administration resulted in increased mRNA levels for bone and cartilage matrix proteins in tibia of ob/ob mice, a finding in agreement with the increase in bone formation and longitudinal bone growth and in agreement with previous studies evaluating bone metabolism in ob/ob mice (Bartell et al. 2011; Kishida et al. 2005; Turner et al. 2014). Additionally, a very low level of sc leptin replacement (12 ng/h) in ob/ob mice increased expression of genes related to BMP signaling, including Bmp 7 and Smad 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. We have previously shown that leptin deficiency results in altered expression of TGFβ1, β2 and β3, BMP 2, 3 and 6, and BMPr1a (Turner et al. 2014). Although Stat3-mediated activation of BMP/Smad signaling has been demonstrated in neural stem cells (Fukuda, et al. 2007) and BMPr1 was shown to regulate development of hypothalamic circuits critical for feeding behavior (Peng, et al. 2012), leptin-mediated BMP signaling in bone has received little attention. After crossing the BBB, leptin binds to and activates receptors residing on POMC and AgRP/NPY-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. POMC neurons are anorexigenic and stimulated by leptin while AgRP/NPY neurons are orexigenic and inhibited by leptin. These arcuate nucleus neurons project directly to nuclei in several sites which play important roles in leptin-mediated regulation of feeding behavior (Cone 2005; Gautron and Elmquist 2011). The present study demonstrates that leptin modulates expression of a group of genes related to neurotransmission in the hypothalamus. Particularly notable were the increases in expression in dopamine receptor D5 (Drd5), bombesin receptor subtype 3 (Brs3), alpha-1D adrenergic receptor (Adra1d), serotonin receptor 2A (Htr2a), and serotonin receptor 4 (Htr4). However, these changes were not apparent at leptin levels that increased longitudinal bone growth and osteoblast number and activity. Bone resorption is reduced in ob/ob mice, as reflected by delayed skeletal maturation (delayed replacement of calcified cartilage by bone), prolonged retention of fluorochrome labels deposited into mineralizing bone, and low serum levels of CTx-1, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption (Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). Osteoclast perimeter is not reduced, suggesting that leptin deficiency impairs osteoclast activity rather than reducing the number of osteoclasts (Turner et al. 2014). Compared to age-matched WT mice, serum CTx-1 levels in the present study were very low in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Leptin treatment increased serum CTx-1 but only at higher dose rates, which suggests that the positive effects of physiological doses of leptin on bone formation are not coupled to the hormone’s actions to increase bone resorption. Leptin acts through the CNS as a permissive factor for release of the neurohormone GnRH from the pituitary (Barkan, et al. 2005), which in turn stimulates an increase in estrogen secretion from the ovaries. Estrogen deficiency induced by hypogonadism typically results in increases in bone elongation and turnover in growing rodents (Turner, et al. 1994), a response that may be antagonized by leptin. Near normalization of ovarian hormone production, as ascertained by increased uterine weight, corresponded to serum leptin levels comparable to those found in WT mice and was associated with plateauing of leptin-induced increases in indices of bone growth and turnover. Additional research will be necessary to determine whether the increased estrogen levels act to oppose the stimulatory effects of leptin. Diabetes is closely associated with morbid obesity which may be due, in part, to development of leptin resistance (Gunnarsson 1983; Khan, et al. 2001; Schwartz, et al. 1996). Diabetes is also associated with decreased bone turnover (Pietschmann, et al. 2010). In the present study, performed in mice that are both leptin-deficient and diabetic, bone formation was increased at leptin levels having minimal impact on blood glucose levels. ob/ob mice and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice and fa/fa rats are often used as models for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the present study agree with prior work suggesting that the low bone formation rate in these models is due to leptin signaling deficiency and not diabetes per se (Turner et al. 2014). Leptin can increase UCP-1 by multiple mechanisms. The increased UCP-1 mRNA level in BAT induced by leptin in the present study is in agreement with prior studies (Cusin, et al. 1998; Ukropec, et al. 2006) and suggests that a combination of reduced energy intake and increased thermogenesis contributed to the dose-response effects of leptin to reduce weight gain. The importance of increased thermogenesis is consistent with studies where hypothalamic leptin gene therapy was shown to induce weight loss and maintain lower body weight in ob/ob mice and normal rodents with mild or no hypophagia (Boghossian, et al. 2007; Kalra et al. 2009). In summary, we interpret the above as evidence that osteoblasts and growth plate cartilage cells are exquisitely sensitive to low circulating levels of leptin. The present findings, combined with results from earlier studies investigating adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice→WT mice, strongly support the hypothesis that bone formation is positively regulated by leptin through peripheral signaling. The saturable transport system, which limits delivery of leptin from the hormone’s origin in peripheral adipose tissue to the hypothalamus, may function to guarantee that adequate energy is available for important anabolic processes such as bone growth and turnover and that these actions are dissociable from the actions of the hormone to reduce appetite and increase thermogenesis. Such a mechanism would serve to insure optimal energy availability for anabolic processes to proceed to support adequate growth.",

Copyright notice ID: 5288125 MSID: MS843552 PMID: 28057869 The publisher's version of this article is available at J Endocrinol Abstract Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is essential for normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC50 infusion rates of 7–17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC50, 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion with 12 ng/h leptin increased expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone’s CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions. Keywords: animal model, bone formation, osteoblasts, neuroendocrine, bone histomorphometryIntroduction Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is produced primarily by adipocytes and secreted into the vascular circulation in proportion to fat stored in adipose depots (Jequier 2002). Leptin receptors are widely expressed in peripheral tissues and the adipokine can act directly on a variety of cells to regulate their differentiation and metabolism (Anubhuti and Arora 2008; Sainz, et al. 2015). Additionally, the hormone is transported across the blood brain barrier (BBB) where it functions to regulate appetite and energy expenditure (Banks, et al. 1996). Leptin signaling is required for normal bone growth in rodents. Absence of leptin signaling in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice or leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice and fa/fa rats results in a plethora of skeletal abnormalities, the most common of which are reduced bone length, bone- and bone compartment-specific alterations in cancellous bone volume fraction, reduced cortical thickness, and reduced cortical and total bone mass (Ealey, et al. 2006; Gat-Yablonski and Phillip 2008; Hamrick, et al. 2004; Williams, et al. 2011). At the cellular level, these abnormalities are associated with impaired endochondral ossification, lower bone formation due to reductions in osteoblast number and activity, and mild osteopetrosis due to impaired osteoclast function (Kishida, et al. 2005; Turner, et al. 2013). Not surprisingly, bone mechanical properties are often reduced and bone regeneration impaired in leptin signaling-deficient rodents (Hamann, et al. 2014; Hamann, et al. 2013; Khan, et al. 2013; Picke, et al. 2015; Wallner, et al. 2015). Leptin receptors are expressed on many mesenchymal and hematopoietic lineage-derived cells residing in bone and cartilage, suggesting that the hormone may act locally to regulate skeletal metabolism. However, leptin-deficient rodents also develop morbid obesity, reduced core body temperature, elevated corticosteroid levels, insulin resistance, and hypogonadism, each of which, alone or in combination, may influence bone metabolism through leptin-independent pathways (Iwaniec, et al. 2009; Lindstrom 2007; Saito and Bray 1983). Indeed, equalization of weight gain, blood glucose levels, and energy balance of ob/ob to that of wild type (WT) mice worsened the skeletal phenotype associated with leptin deficiency (Turner, et al. 2014). Thus, the skeletal phenotype of leptin-deficient mice is likely due to perturbation in multiple pathways. Understanding the precise role of leptin in regulating bone growth and maturation is important because in humans low leptin levels are associated with low peak bone mass which in turn is associated with increased fracture risk (Farr and Khosla 2015). A saturable transport mechanism is required for leptin to cross the BBB (Banks et al. 1996). As a consequence, leptin levels in peripheral circulation are typically over 10 times greater than the levels within the brain. The existence of this concentration gradient suggests higher occupancy of leptin receptor in peripheral tissues than brain (Scatchard 1948). We therefore determined the relative responsiveness of bone and other target tissues to circulating leptin levels. This was accomplished by performing a 12-day dose-response study in which physiologically relevant concentrations of the hormone were continuously infused into ob/ob mice using sc implanted osmotic pumps to model leptin production by adipose tissue.Materials and Methods Experimental design Six-week-old female ob/ob and homozygous WT (+/+) littermate mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The animals were placed at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) immediately upon arrival at Oregon State University and maintained singly housed on a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle. Thermoneutral housing was used to avoid mild cold stress associated with standard room temperature (Iwaniec, et al. 2016; Kokolus, et al. 2013). The ob/ob mice were randomized by weight into one of 6 treatment groups (n=8 mice/group) with leptin delivered at a dose rate of 0 (vehicle), 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.5, or 10 μg/d (equivalent to 0, 4, 12, 40, 140 or 400 ng/h or approximately equivalent to 0, 2.7, 8.2, 27, 96, and 274 μg/kg/d at treatment initiation based on a mean starting ob/ob mouse weight of 36.5 g). Vehicle (20 mM Tris-HCL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or mouse leptin (498-OB-05M, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was infused using sc-implanted osmotic pumps (Alzet Model 1002, Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) for the 12-day duration of study. WT mice (n=9) were untreated. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to all animals. Body weight was recorded on days −2, 0 (pump implantation), 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Food records were started on day −2, one day after arrival/placement into thermoneutral housing. Food intake was recorded on days −1, 3, 6, 10, and 12. Fluorochromes were administered at 9 (declomycin), 4 (calcein) and 1 (calcein) d prior to necropsy to label mineralizing bone and cartilage as described (Turner et al. 2014). Mice were fasted overnight prior to necropsy, bled by cardiac puncture, and glucose measured using a glucometer (Life Scan, Inc., Milpitas, CA). Uteri and abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) were excised and weighed. Femora were removed, fixed for 24h in 10% buffered formalin and stored in 70% ethanol for microcomputed tomography and histomorphometric analysis. Tibiae and hypothalami were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80ºC for mRNA analysis.Serum chemistry Serum leptin was measured using Mouse Leptin Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), serum osteocalcin was measured using Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and serum CTx-1 was measured using Mouse C terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTx-1) ELISA kit (Life Sciences Advanced Technologies, St. Petersburg, FL) according to the respective manufacturer’s protocol. Intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for all ELISA assays were within the manufactures’ reported CVs of ≤ 5% for osteocalcin and leptin and ≤ 10% for CTx-1.Microcomputed Tomography Microcomputed tomography (μCT) was used for nondestructive 3-dimensional evaluation of cancellous bone volume and architecture. Femora were scanned in 70% ethanol using a Scanco μCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 x 12 x 12 μm (55 kVp x-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. Bone segmentation was conducted at a threshold of 245 (scale, 0–1000) determined empirically. Forty-two consecutive slices (504 μm) of cancellous bone, 45 slices (540 μm) proximal to the growth plate, were evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis. Direct cancellous bone measurements included cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume, %), trabecular number (mm−1), and trabecular thickness (μm).Histomorphometry The methods used to measure longitudinal bone growth and static and dynamic bone histomorphometry have been described (Iwaniec, et al. 2008) with modifications for mice (Turner et al. 2013). In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and xylene, and embedded undecalcified in modified methyl methacrylate. Longitudinal sections (4 μm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2065) and affixed to slides precoated with 1% gelatin solution. One section/animal was stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St Louis) and used for cell-based measurements. One section/animal was mounted unstained for measurement of fluorochrome labels. All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. Cell-based measurements included osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter, %) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %). Fluorochrome-based measurements of bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single label normalized to bone perimeter, %), 2) mineral apposition rate (the distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3 day interlabel interval, μm/d), 3) bone formation rate (bone formation rate/bone perimeter: calculated by multiplying mineralizing perimeter by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter, μm2/μm/y), and longitudinal bone growth (distance between the growth plate-metaphyseal junction and the declomycin label deposited in the primary spongiosa divided by the 9 day interval between label administration and necropsy, μm/day). All bone histomorphometric data are reported using standard 2-dimensional nomenclature (Dempster, et al. 2013).EC50 Calculation The EC50 for each response variable was the calculated dose required to achieve ½ of the maximum observed response.Gene expression Total RNA from tibia and hypothalamus were isolated from 5–6 mice/group and individually analyzed. Tibiae were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and further homogenized in Trizol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Hypothalamus was directly homogenized in Trizol. Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Life Technologies). The expression of 84 genes related to JAK/STAT signaling was determined for hypothalamus and bone using the mouse JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway RT2 Profiler PCR Array (PAMM-039Y) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The expression of 84 genes related to neurotransmitter receptors in hypothalamus and 84 genes related to bone formation and bone resorption in tibia was determined using the Mouse “Neurotransmitter Receptors” RT2 Profiler PCR Array (PAMM-060Z) and Mouse “Osteoporosis” RT2 Profiler PCR Array (PAMM-170Z), respectively. Gene expression in hypothalamus was normalized to Hsp90ab1 and in tibia was normalized to GAPDH. Relative quantification was determined (ΔΔCt method) using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software version 3.5 (Qiagen). Fold-change was calculated using vehicle-treated ob/ob mice as the control. Venn diagrams comparing the overlap of significantly (P < 0.05) differentially expressed genes with a ≥ 1.2-fold differential expression in ob/ob mice treated with 12 ng/h leptin and ob/ob mice treated with 140 ng/h leptin compared to ob/ob mice treated with vehicle were generated with BioVenn (Hulsen, et al. 2008).Statistical Analysis Mean responses were compared between six groups (vehicle control group and groups receiving leptin at 4, 12, 40, 140 or 400 ng/h) using separate one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A modified F test was used when the assumption of equal variance was violated, with Welch’s two-sample t-test used for pairwise comparisons (Welch 1955). The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used when only the normality assumption was violated, in which case the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for pairwise comparisons. The required conditions for valid use of ANOVA were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and the Anderson-Darling test of normality. The Benjamini and Hochberg method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). Mean food intake (g/d) for the ob/ob vehicle group was compared to the five ob/ob groups that received leptin (4, 12, 40, 140, and 400 ng/h) using longitudinal data collected one day prior to pump implantation (−1) and on days 3, 6, 10, and 12 post implantation. In addition, a comparison of mean body weight (g) for these groups was made using longitudinal data collected on days −2, 0 (pump implantation), and 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 post implantation. Multivariate linear regression models were fit using predictor variables for leptin group, time (treated as categorical and continuous), and the group by time interaction with different covariance structures, namely independence, unstructured, and compound symmetric and autoregressive of order 1 with equal and unequal variance over time. Linear mixed models with random intercepts and slopes were also considered. Model selection was performed using the Bayesian information criterion and likelihood ratio tests. Data analysis was performed using R version 2.12 (Team 2015).Results The dose-response effects of leptin administration on serum leptin and indices related to energy metabolism in ob/ob mice are shown in Fig. 1. Leptin was consistently detected in serum of ob/ob mice when infused at 40 ng/h, achieved values similar to WT mice at 140 ng/h, and was elevated compared to WT mice at 400 ng/h (Fig. 1A). Thermogenesis is regulated by a combination of sensory and sympathetic inputs while appetite and pituitary hormone release (e.g., GnRH) are regulated by leptin through a hypothalamic relay. We therefore measured UCP-1 gene expression (Fig. 1B) as an index of non-shivering thermogenesis, and food intake (Fig. 1C and D) as an index of appetite. We measured body weight (Fig. 1E), abdominal white adipose tissue weight (Fig. 1F), and blood glucose (Fig. 1G) as additional endpoints related to energy metabolism. Finally, we measured uterine weight (Fig. 1H) as an index of GnRH release (Gibson, et al. 1994). UCP-1 gene expression in BAT, food intake over the treatment interval, and body weight change over the treatment interval were significantly affected at a leptin dose of 12 ng/h, corresponding to serum leptin at or below the detection limit of the immunoassay (0.5 ng/ml), whereas changes in other endpoints, including abdominal WAT weight, blood glucose levels, and uterine weight, required 40 ng/h or higher dose rates before achieving statistical significance. As expected (Iwaniec et al. 2016), transfer of mice from room temperature to thermoneutral housing resulted in a dramatic reduction in food intake (Figure 1C), with no impact on body weight in vehicle-treated mice. Depending on endpoint measured, the EC50 of leptin for indices of energy metabolism required dose rates of 40 – 80 ng/h (Figure 2A), corresponding to serum leptin levels between 2 and 6 ng/ml. Specifically, the EC50 was 80 ng/h for UCP-1 gene expression, 53 ng/h for cumulative food intake, 40 ng/h for body weight change, 66 ng/h for WAT weight, 68 ng/h for blood glucose, and 57 ng/h for uterine weight.

Please note the expected dramatic decrease in food intake in ob/ob mice associated with transfer from room temperature to thermoneutral housing (Iwaniec et al. 2016). Data are mean ± SE. aDifferent from vehicle-treated ob/ob mice (ob/ob), P<0.05. WT is shown as a reference group.Figure 2. Open in a new tab The apparent half maximum effects (EC50) of leptin on indices of energy metabolism (A) and bone formation (B). Depending on endpoint measured, the half maximum effects of leptin on indices of energy metabolism were detected at dose rates of 40–80 ng/h whereas the half maximum effects of leptin on indices of bone formation were detected at dose rates of 7–25 ng/h. The vertical dotted lines indicate the range in EC50.Longitudinal bone growth rate (Fig. 3A), osteoblast perimeter (Fig. 3B), mineralizing perimeter (Fig. 3C), mineral apposition rate (Fig. 3D), bone formation rate (Fig. 3E), serum osteocalcin (Fig. 3F), osteoclast perimeter (Fig. 3G), and serum CTx-1 (Fig. 3H) were determined as indices of bone growth and turnover in distal femur metaphysis. Depending upon endpoint measured, positive effects of leptin were first observed for bone growth and formation parameters at rates of 4–12 ng/h. Significant differences in osteoclast perimeter were not detected with treatment, but serum CTx-1 was increased at leptin infusion rates of 140 and 400 ng/h. Representative micrographs illustrating the low dose (12 ng/h) effects of leptin on bone formation are shown in Fig. 2I-J. The low turnover of cancellous bone in ob/ob mice is illustrated by presence of declomycin label (administered 9 d prior to sacrifice) whereas extensive double calcein label (administered 4 d and 1 d prior to sacrifice) and the absence of declomycin label in ob/ob mice treated with leptin is indicative of high turnover (Turner et al. 2013). With the exception of trabecular thickness which was increased at and above leptin infusion rates of 40 ng/h (Fig. 1K), differences in cancellous bone microarchitecture (bone volume fraction, trabecular number, connectivity density or trabecular spacing) were not detected with treatment (data not shown). This was expected, given the short duration (12 days) of study. Depending on endpoint measured, the EC50 for leptin on indices of bone formation ranged from 7–25 ng/h (Fig 2B), corresponding to serum leptin levels of < 1 ng/ml. Specifically, the half maximum response occurred at 25 ng/h for longitudinal bone growth rate, 17 ng/h for osteoblast perimeter, 7 ng/h for mineralizing perimeter, 12 ng/h for mineral apposition rate, 10 ng/h for bone formation rate, 12 ng/h for serum osteocalcin, and 7 ng/h for trabecular thickness. The EC50 was not determined for osteoclast perimeter because no significant changes were detected. Figure 3.

Effects of leptin on trabecular thickness, an index of bone microarchitecture, is shown in K. Data are mean ± SE. aDifferent from vehicle-treated ob/ob mice (ob/ob 0), P<0.05. WT is shown as a reference group.To verify the apparent dose-selective actions of leptin on hypothalamus and bone, we profiled changes in gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus in animals receiving leptin at 12 ng/h (a dose rate that increased longitudinal bone growth and bone formation but had minimal effect on energy metabolism) and 140 ng/h (a dose rate that affected both bone and energy metabolism), and compared these to vehicle-treated ob/ob controls using pathway-focused gene expression PCR arrays. Because leptin binds to its receptor to activate Jak/Stat signaling, we profiled genes related to activation of Jak/Stat signaling in hypothalamus and tibia. Functional outcomes of leptin treatment in hypothalamus and bone include increased neuronal signaling and increased bone growth and turnover, respectively. We therefore analyzed the effects of leptin on the expression of genes involved in neurotransmitter receptors in hypothalamus, and osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function in tibia. Differential gene expression was defined as P < 0.05 and a fold change of ≥ 1.2. As shown in the Venn diagrams (Fig. 4), leptin infusion at the dose rate of 12 ng/h had minimal effects on either Jak/Stat signaling genes or neurotransmitter receptor genes in hypothalamus (Fig. 4A and 4C). Only 2 genes and 5 genes, respectively were differentially expressed compared to ob/ob controls. In contrast, there were robust changes in Jak/Stat signaling genes (Fig. 4B) and bone cell-related genes (Fig. 4D) in tibia. A total of 25 genes involved in Jak/Stat signaling (Fig. 4B) and 21 genes involved in osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function (Fig. 4D) were differentially expressed in the tibia in ob/ob mice infused with leptin at a dose rate of 12 ng/h compared to vehicle-treated ob/ob controls. The 140 ng/h leptin dose resulted in robust changes in gene expression in hypothalamus and further increases in number of differentially expressed genes in tibia. All genes differentially expressed (P < 0.05) in response to leptin in hypothalamus and tibia, regardless of fold change, are identified in Tables 1–4. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Venn diagrams showing the number of genes in hypothalamus (A and C) and tibia (B and D) that were differentially expressed (meeting criteria of p < 0.05 and fold-change of ≥ 1.2) in ob/ob mice (n=5) treated with 12 ng/h leptin (light gray) and ob/ob mice (n=5) treated with 140 ng/h leptin (dark gray) compared to ob/ob mice treated with vehicle (n=6). RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays were used to quantify expression of transcripts associated with JAK/STAT signaling (A and B), neurotransmitter receptors (C), and genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function (D). Please note the paucity of differentially expressed genes in the hypothalamus compared to tibia in mice infused with leptin at a dose rate of 12 ng/h (2 versus 25 for Jak/Stat signaling and 5 versus 21 for neurotransmitter/bone metabolism). Also note the increases in differentially expressed genes, particularly in hypothalamus, in mice infused with leptin at a dose rate of 140 ng/h. The higher dose rate results in blood leptin levels in ob/ob mice similar to WT mice.Table 1.

The results demonstrate that leptin acts on the skeleton at dose rates having minimal impact on energy metabolism. Specifically, leptin increased osteoblast perimeter, mineralizing perimeter, and bone formation rate at an infusion rate of 4 ng/h, and mineral apposition rate and longitudinal growth rate at an infusion rate of 12 ng/h. Leptin increased UCP-1 gene expression and decreased food intake and rate of body weight gain at an infusion rate of 12 ng/h. These dose rates (4 and 12 ng/h) resulted in serum leptin levels below or at the detection limit of the serum leptin immunoassay (0.5 ng/ml) and were insufficient to affect uterine weight, cumulative food intake, hyperglycemia, or abdominal WAT weight. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC50 ranging from 7–17 ng/h whereas higher leptin levels (EC50 of 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. Due to the short duration of study, few changes in bone microarchitecture were anticipated or detected. However, consistent with increased bone formation, a significant increase in trabecular thickness was noted in the leptin-treated mice. Few studies have investigated the dose-response effects of leptin. However, similar to the current findings, no effects of low sc infusion rates of leptin (<40 ng/h) for 12 days on terminal body weight, fat depots, and uterine weight were reported (Harris, et al. 1998; Trotter-Mayo and Roberts 2008). Higher doses (200 ng/h) of sc leptin were shown to be required to reduce body weight in WT mice and even higher doses (500 ng/h) were required to deplete fat stores (Halaas, et al. 1997). The precise mechanisms mediating the physiological actions of leptin on bone are uncertain. Delivery of leptin gene into the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice reversed the skeletal abnormalities in bone architecture associated with leptin deficiency (Iwaniec, et al. 2007). Also, once daily direct delivery of high concentrations of the hormone into the hypothalamus increased bone formation (Bartell, et al. 2011). In contrast, continuous infusion of high concentrations of leptin into the hypothalamus was reported to be antiosteogenic (Ducy, et al. 2000). Direct administration of leptin or the leptin gene into the hypothalamus was originally interpreted as evidence that leptin acts indirectly through a hypothalamic relay to regulate bone metabolism (Ducy et al. 2000; Iwaniec et al. 2007; Kalra, et al. 2009; Takeda, et al. 2002). However, this conclusion is predicated on intracerebroventricular (icv) leptin remaining within the central nervous system. This assumption is not well supported because there is ample evidence indicating that icv leptin readily enters peripheral circulation. Using tracer methodology, Maness et al. (Maness, et al. 1998) investigated the fate of leptin after icv administration and found that efflux of leptin from the brain occurred with reabsorption of the cerebrospinal fluid into the blood. Efflux was not saturable and the amount of leptin in peripheral circulation after icv injection actually equaled or exceeded levels seen 20 minutes following iv administration (Maness et al. 1998). The authors concluded that icv leptin achieves exposure levels in the brain at least 300 times higher than when delivered iv, but efficient reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid into the blood introduces leptin into peripheral circulation where the hormone can bind to receptors on target cells. This conclusion is also supported by Trotter-Mayo and Roberts (Trotter-Mayo and Roberts 2008) who compared ip and icv delivery of leptin (8 ng/h) and demonstrated that leptin delivered icv enters peripheral circulation and activates leptin receptors on thymocytes. In similar light, adoptive transfer of leptin-resistant db/db bone marrow into WT mice (db/db→WT) was shown to mimic the effects of leptin deficiency on bone without impacting centrally-mediated actions of leptin on energy metabolism (Turner et al. 2013). Importantly, icv leptin dose rates administered to ob/ob mice in bone studies described above have equaled or exceeded the dose rate (8 ng/h) used by Trotter-Mayo and Roberts (Trotter-Mayo and Roberts 2008) and would have resulted in hypothalamic leptin levels unlikely to be achieved physiologically. Thus, the exquisite sensitivity of bone to low blood levels of leptin reported in the current study combined with the knowledge that leptin is transported out of the brain into peripheral circulation following icv infusion question whether the skeletal response to icv leptin is entirely due to actions mediated centrally. The long form of the leptin receptor (LepRb) belongs to gp130 family of cytokine receptors and binding of leptin to LepRb activates the Jak/Stat intracellular signaling pathways (Nanjappa V 2011). The robust differential expression of genes related to Jak/Stat signaling in bone following sc administration of low dose leptin (12 ng/h) provides strong evidence that leptin acts directly on one or more target cells in mouse long bones. Although the present study does not identify the precise leptin target cells in bone, osteoblast lineage cells are candidates. Osteoblasts are reported to express leptin receptors and analysis of the osteoblast transcriptome supports a role for peripheral leptin signaling in bone cell function (Grundberg, et al. 2008). Leptin has also been shown to activate multiple pathways, including Jak/Stat, in cultured osteoblast lineage cells (Burguera, et al. 2006; Gordeladze, et al. 2002; Lee, et al. 2002; Yang, et al. 2014). In marked contrast to its actions on gene expression in tibia, leptin at 12 ng/h had minimal effects on genes related to Jak/Stat signaling in hypothalamus. However, higher levels of leptin (140 ng/h; resulting in serum leptin levels in ob/ob mice similar to that of WT mice) were associated with robust changes in gene expression in hypothalamus. In addition to the differential dose response, there was relatively little overlap in the genes regulated in tibia and hypothalamus and when there was overlap (e.g., Smads 1, 2 and 5), the genes were often differentially expressed in opposite directions. Taken together, these findings indicate that leptin targets Jak/Stat signaling in tibia as well as hypothalamus. In the present study, sc leptin administration resulted in increased mRNA levels for bone and cartilage matrix proteins in tibia of ob/ob mice, a finding in agreement with the increase in bone formation and longitudinal bone growth and in agreement with previous studies evaluating bone metabolism in ob/ob mice (Bartell et al. 2011; Kishida et al. 2005; Turner et al. 2014). Additionally, a very low level of sc leptin replacement (12 ng/h) in ob/ob mice increased expression of genes related to BMP signaling, including Bmp 7 and Smad 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. We have previously shown that leptin deficiency results in altered expression of TGFβ1, β2 and β3, BMP 2, 3 and 6, and BMPr1a (Turner et al. 2014). Although Stat3-mediated activation of BMP/Smad signaling has been demonstrated in neural stem cells (Fukuda, et al. 2007) and BMPr1 was shown to regulate development of hypothalamic circuits critical for feeding behavior (Peng, et al. 2012), leptin-mediated BMP signaling in bone has received little attention. After crossing the BBB, leptin binds to and activates receptors residing on POMC and AgRP/NPY-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. POMC neurons are anorexigenic and stimulated by leptin while AgRP/NPY neurons are orexigenic and inhibited by leptin. These arcuate nucleus neurons project directly to nuclei in several sites which play important roles in leptin-mediated regulation of feeding behavior (Cone 2005; Gautron and Elmquist 2011). The present study demonstrates that leptin modulates expression of a group of genes related to neurotransmission in the hypothalamus. Particularly notable were the increases in expression in dopamine receptor D5 (Drd5), bombesin receptor subtype 3 (Brs3), alpha-1D adrenergic receptor (Adra1d), serotonin receptor 2A (Htr2a), and serotonin receptor 4 (Htr4). However, these changes were not apparent at leptin levels that increased longitudinal bone growth and osteoblast number and activity. Bone resorption is reduced in ob/ob mice, as reflected by delayed skeletal maturation (delayed replacement of calcified cartilage by bone), prolonged retention of fluorochrome labels deposited into mineralizing bone, and low serum levels of CTx-1, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption (Turner et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014). Osteoclast perimeter is not reduced, suggesting that leptin deficiency impairs osteoclast activity rather than reducing the number of osteoclasts (Turner et al. 2014). Compared to age-matched WT mice, serum CTx-1 levels in the present study were very low in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Leptin treatment increased serum CTx-1 but only at higher dose rates, which suggests that the positive effects of physiological doses of leptin on bone formation are not coupled to the hormone’s actions to increase bone resorption. Leptin acts through the CNS as a permissive factor for release of the neurohormone GnRH from the pituitary (Barkan, et al. 2005), which in turn stimulates an increase in estrogen secretion from the ovaries. Estrogen deficiency induced by hypogonadism typically results in increases in bone elongation and turnover in growing rodents (Turner, et al. 1994), a response that may be antagonized by leptin. Near normalization of ovarian hormone production, as ascertained by increased uterine weight, corresponded to serum leptin levels comparable to those found in WT mice and was associated with plateauing of leptin-induced increases in indices of bone growth and turnover. Additional research will be necessary to determine whether the increased estrogen levels act to oppose the stimulatory effects of leptin. Diabetes is closely associated with morbid obesity which may be due, in part, to development of leptin resistance (Gunnarsson 1983; Khan, et al. 2001; Schwartz, et al. 1996). Diabetes is also associated with decreased bone turnover (Pietschmann, et al. 2010). In the present study, performed in mice that are both leptin-deficient and diabetic, bone formation was increased at leptin levels having minimal impact on blood glucose levels. ob/ob mice and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice and fa/fa rats are often used as models for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the present study agree with prior work suggesting that the low bone formation rate in these models is due to leptin signaling deficiency and not diabetes per se (Turner et al. 2014). Leptin can increase UCP-1 by multiple mechanisms. The increased UCP-1 mRNA level in BAT induced by leptin in the present study is in agreement with prior studies (Cusin, et al. 1998; Ukropec, et al. 2006) and suggests that a combination of reduced energy intake and increased thermogenesis contributed to the dose-response effects of leptin to reduce weight gain. The importance of increased thermogenesis is consistent with studies where hypothalamic leptin gene therapy was shown to induce weight loss and maintain lower body weight in ob/ob mice and normal rodents with mild or no hypophagia (Boghossian, et al. 2007; Kalra et al. 2009). In summary, we interpret the above as evidence that osteoblasts and growth plate cartilage cells are exquisitely sensitive to low circulating levels of leptin. The present findings, combined with results from earlier studies investigating adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice→WT mice, strongly support the hypothesis that bone formation is positively regulated by leptin through peripheral signaling. The saturable transport system, which limits delivery of leptin from the hormone’s origin in peripheral adipose tissue to the hypothalamus, may function to guarantee that adequate energy is available for important anabolic processes such as bone growth and turnover and that these actions are dissociable from the actions of the hormone to reduce appetite and increase thermogenesis. Such a mechanism would serve to insure optimal energy availability for anabolic processes to proceed to support adequate growth.Table 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is negatively associated with bone mass. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same precursor cells, adipocyte differentiation may occur at the expense of osteoblast differentiation. We used MAT-deficient KitW/W−v (MAT-) mice to determine if absence of MAT reduced bone loss in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice. Male MAT- and wild-type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to a baseline, control or HU group (n = 10 mice/group) within each genotype and HU groups unloaded for 2 weeks. Femurs were evaluated using micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and targeted gene profiling. MAT- mice had a greater reduction in bone volume fraction after HU than did WT mice. HU MAT- mice had elevated cancellous bone formation and resorption compared to other treatment groups as well as a unique profile of differentially expressed genes. Adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells reconstituted c-kit but not MAT in KitW/W−v mice. The MAT- WT → KitW/W−v mice lost cancellous bone following 2 weeks of HU. In summary, results from this study suggest that MAT deficiency was not protective, and was associated with exaggerated disuse-induced cancellous bone loss.",
    "introduction": "",
    "methods": "Methods The animals were maintained in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocol was approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiment 1 The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the skeletal response to HU in WT and MAT-deficient KitW/W−v mice. Four-week-old male WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW−v/J (KitW/W−vor MAT-) mice and their WT WBB6F1/J littermates were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and single housed in a 32 °C room for the duration of the experiment. Housing mice at 32 °C (thermoneutral temperature) has been shown to minimize resting energy expenditure58,59, which should compensate for the inability of mice to huddle (regulating body temperature) during HU. Furthermore, adaptation to room temperature housing was recently shown to result in cancellous bone loss in mice38. At 16 weeks of age, the mice were randomized by body weight into one of six treatments (n = 10/group): WT baseline, WT control, WT HU, MAT- baseline, MAT- control, MAT- HU. Animals from the baseline groups were sacrificed. The next day, animals from the control and HU groups were transferred to unloading cages. The mice were unloaded for 2 weeks as described34. In brief, HU mice were placed in a restraint device, where the tail was cleaned with ethanol-soaked gauze and sprayed with a tincture of benzoin. A thin piece of traction tape was looped through a large paper clip, and then pressed along the sides of the mouse’s tail. Filament tape was wrapped around the tail in two locations to secure the traction tape: the base of the tail and 2.5 cm caudal. The paperclip end was looped through the clasp secured on the unloading apparatus. Mice were positioned in a 30° head-down tilt. All HU animals were provided with food and water ad libitum. The control groups were pair-fed to unloaded groups within genotype, and were given water ad libitum. Calcein injections (15 mg/kg; sc) were given 4 days and 1 day prior to termination to label mineralizing bone matrix. Mice were anesthetized then terminated using decapitation. The right femur from each mouse was placed in formalin for 24-hour fixation, then stored at 4 °C in 70% ethanol prior to sequential analysis by μCT and histomorphometry. The left femur was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80 °C for RNA analysis. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g), seminal vesicle weight (g; an index of androgen levels) and blood glucose (mg/dL) were recorded at necropsy. Experiment 2 Mice were purchased and housed as in Experiment 1. WT littermates were used as donors of bone marrow. At 8 weeks of age, bone marrow transplant recipient mice were lethally irradiated (two split doses of 5 Gy each, 10 Gy total; Gammacell 22060 Co gamma irradiator) then, the following day, injected with purified HSC from donor WT mice. The purified HSC were prepared as follows: whole bone marrow cells were harvested from the femora and tibia of 12 donor mice. Lineage negative (lin−) cells were enriched from bone marrow cells using magnetic cell separation with MACS lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA, USA). Enriched lin- bone marrow cells were incubated with anti-CD117 (c-kit) and anti-Sca-1 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). HSC (Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+) were purified from enriched lin- by flow cytometry and single cell sorting60,61 using MoFlo XDP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Purified HSC were resuspended in saline, and 200 μl containing 1,000 donor HSC were injected into the tail vein of each irradiated recipient mouse. Tracking of cellular repopulation was performed with the use of HSC from GFP-expressing mice (GFP→ KitW/W−v; n = 3) using the same protocol. The percentages of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry using B cell-specific (CD19) and T cell-specific (CD3) antibodies 8 weeks post adoptive transfer. Mice that did not undergo adoptive transfer were used as controls (n = 2). At 16-weeks of age the mice were randomized by body weight into one of two treatments (n = 10/group): 1) WT→KitW/W−v control, 2) WT→KitW/W−v HU. Control and HU animals were then transferred to the unloading cages. Unloading and tissue collection were performed as described in Experiment 1. Micro-computed Tomography μCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of cancellous bone volume and architecture. Femora were scanned using a Scanco μCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 μm × 12 μm × 12 μm (55 kVp x-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0–1000). Cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis. Assessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540 μm in length) proximal to the growth plate, and included forty slices (480 μm in length) of cancellous bone. The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis. Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, mm−3), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, μm), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, mm−1) and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, μm). Histomorphometry The histological methods used have been previously described in detail62. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene, then embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Sections 4 μm thick were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and fixed to slides with a dried precoated 1% gelatin solution. Mounted unstained slides were used for measurements of fluorochrome labels. For cell-based measurements, slides were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. Static (cell-based) histological measurements include bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), adipocyte size (μm2), osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %). Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing63. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to the thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase-positive cytoplasm (stained red). Dynamic (fluorochrome) histological measurements include mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter; %), mineral apposition rate (distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3 day label interval; μm/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter; μm2/μm/year). Gene Expression Femora (n = 5/group) were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen, then further homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen). The expression of 84 genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function was determined using the Mouse “Osteoporosis” RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was normalized to Gapdh and relative quantification was determined by the ΔΔCt method using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software version 3.5 (Qiagen). Two of the twenty samples did not meet quality control standards for interpretation of array data and were excluded. Statistical Analysis Means in Experiment 1 were compared between genotype and treatment groups using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When significant interactions were present, t-tests were used to make two-group comparisons with “a” used to signify a difference from control mice within genotype and “b” used to signify a difference from WT mice within treatment. When non-significant interactions were present, group comparisons were made from two-way ANOVA with main effects for genotype and treatment. Means for bone marrow adiposity, adipocyte density and adipocyte size were compared using t-tests, since the absence of marrow adiposity in KitW/W−v mice made the use of two-way ANOVA invalid. Means among baseline, control and HU groups within genotype were compared using one-way ANOVA. When the ANOVA was significant, Dunnett’s test was used to make comparisons to the baseline group. Means in Experiment 2 were compared using t-tests The required conditions for valid use of t-tests and ANOVA were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance and the Anderson-Darling test of normality. When the assumption of equal variance was violated, Welch’s two-sample t-test was used for two-group comparisons64. When the normality assumption was violated, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for two-group comparisons. Methods for maintaining false discovery rate at 5% were used to adjust for multiple comparisons65. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Data analysis was performed using RStudio version 0.98.1083.",
    "results": "Results Experiment 1 Experiment 1 evaluated the impact of MAT deficiency on the skeletal response to HU. The effects of genotype (WT and MAT-), treatment (control and HU), and their interaction on body weight, abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, seminal vesicle weight and blood glucose at necropsy are shown in Fig. 1. MAT- mice had a lower body weight than WT mice (Fig. 1a). No significant difference in body weight was observed in response to HU. MAT- mice had less abdominal WAT than WT mice (Fig. 1b). No significant difference in WAT weight was observed in response to HU. Seminal vesicle weight reflects testosterone levels in mice36. MAT- mice had lower seminal vesicle weight than WT mice (Fig. 1c) and HU resulted in greater seminal vesicle weight. Blood glucose was not different between genotypes (Fig. 1d).

MAT- mice had greater trabecular number than WT mice (Fig. 2c). HU resulted in lower trabecular number. MAT- mice had greater trabecular thickness than WT mice (Fig. 2d). HU resulted in lower trabecular thickness. MAT- mice had lower trabecular spacing than WT mice (Fig. 2e). HU resulted in greater trabecular spacing.

Images compiled by JAK.The effects of genotype, HU and their interaction on cancellous bone microarchitecture in the distal femur epiphysis are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Bone volume fraction was not different between genotypes (Fig. S1a). HU resulted in lower bone volume fraction. MAT- mice had lower connectivity density than WT mice (Fig. S1b). No significant difference in connectivity density was observed in response to HU. MAT- mice had lower trabecular number than WT mice (Fig. S1c). No significant difference was observed in trabecular number in response to HU. MAT- mice had greater trabecular thickness than WT mice (Fig. S1d). HU resulted in lower trabecular thickness. MAT- mice had greater trabecular spacing than WT mice (Fig. S1e). No significant difference was observed in trabecular spacing in response to HU. To establish the direction of changes in bone microarchitecture following HU, the treatment groups were compared to controls sacrificed at the start of the experiment (baseline controls). The results are shown in Supplementary Table S1. In general, there was no difference in bone microarchitecture between control and baseline mice, the exceptions being cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density and trabecular number in the distal femur metaphysis of WT mice which were lower in the control mice. In contrast, most parameters differed between the HU mice and baseline mice. Specifically, cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness were lower and trabecular spacing higher in the distal femur metaphysis of HU WT and HU MAT- mice. Also, cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness were lower in the distal femur epiphysis of HU WT and HU MAT- mice compared to baseline. The effects of genotype, HU and their interaction on histomorphometry in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, adipocytes in bone marrow were not detected in MAT- mice (Fig. 3a–c). The absence of adipocytes can be visibly appreciated in Fig. 3e. No significant differences were observed in bone marrow adiposity (Fig. 3a), adipocyte density (Fig. 3b) or adipocyte size (Fig. 3c) in response to HU in WT mice. Figure 3.

Two-way ANOVA: a, different from control mice within genotype; b, different from WT mice within treatment. P-values significant at P ≤ 0.05. Mean ± SEM. Image scale is 500 μm at 4x. Images taken by JAK.MAT- HU mice had greater osteoblast perimeter than WT HU mice (Fig. 3f). HU had no effect on osteoblast perimeter in WT mice, but resulted in greater osteoblast perimeter in the MAT- mice. MAT- mice had a greater osteoclast perimeter than WT mice (Fig. 3g). HU resulted in greater osteoclast perimeter. MAT- mice had greater mineralizing perimeter than WT mice (Fig. 3h). No significant difference in mineralizing perimeter was observed in response to HU. MAT- HU mice had greater mineral apposition rate than WT HU mice (Fig. 3i). HU had no effect on mineral apposition rate in WT mice, but resulted in greater mineral apposition rate in the MAT- mice. MAT- HU mice had greater bone formation rate than WT HU mice (Fig. 3j). HU had no effect on bone formation rate in the WT mice, but resulted in greater bone formation rate in MAT- mice. Gene profiling was performed to evaluate whether HU leads to differential gene expression in WT and MAT- mice that may provide insight into the mechanisms mediating the observed differences in microarchitecture and cellular responses. The differential expression of genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function is shown in Fig. 4; the complete analysis of all 84 genes can be found in Supplementary Table S2. Compared to WT control mice, 5 genes (Igfbp2, Mstn, Mthfr, Nfatc1, Sfrp1) were differentially expressed in MAT- mice. Compared to WT control mice, 10 genes (Adcy10, Bmp7, Calcr, Car2, Col1a1, Comt, Crtap, Ctsk, Esr1, Fgfr1) were differentially expressed in WT HU mice. Compared to WT control mice, 21 genes (Alox12, Alox15, Alox5, Cd40, Cnr2, Comt, Dbp, Esr1, Esrra, Hsd11b1, Igfbp2, Il6, Il6ra, Lta, Mstn, Nos3, Npy, Nr3c1, Sfrp1, Shbg, Tshr) were differentially expressed in MAT- HU mice. Two of the genes that were differentially expressed in HU WT mice were differentially expressed in MAT- HU mice (Comt, and Esr1), but in opposite directions. Figure 4. Relative expression of genes relating to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function normalized to Gapdh. Open in a new tab WT CTL mice were used to compare the effects of HU (red circle; 10 genes differentially expressed), MAT deficiency (green circle; 5 genes differentially expressed), and MAT deficiency after HU (blue circle; 21 genes differentially expressed). Experiment 2 A pilot study showed that transplanting WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) into KitW/W−v mice (WT→KitW/W−v) reconstituted the hematopoietic compartment without restoring MAT. Therefore, Experiment 2 was performed to determine if HU-induced bone loss occurs with MAT deficiency in WT→KitW/W−v mice. The absence of MAT following adoptive transfer of WT HSC was confirmed in the present study (Fig. 5). To determine the extent of hematopoietic cell compartment reconstitution with donor cells in irradiated recipients, adoptive transfer of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-positive HSC into irradiated recipients (GFP→KitW/W−v) was concurrently performed. The percentage of donor-derived GFP positive B cells and T cells, two immune cell populations derived from HSC, were determined in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of recipient mice 8 weeks post adoptive transfer (Fig. 6). As expected, the control mice had no GFP-positive cells. In the GFP→KitW/W−vmice, 95% of B cells and 79% of T cells were GFP positive. Figure 5.

    "discussion": "Discussion The present analysis is among the first to investigate the role of MAT in disuse-induced bone loss. The skeletal response to HU, an Earth-based model for spaceflight, was compared between normal mice and mice deficient in MAT (KitW/W−v mice). We hypothesized that an inability to produce MAT would provide protection from disuse-induced bone loss. This hypothesis stemmed from evidence that an increase in MAT during disuse was occurring at the expense of osteoblast formation. However, results from this study do not support our hypothesis. Indeed, MAT deficiency was associated with exaggerated bone loss. The MAT- mice exhibited compartment-specific alterations in skeletal microarchitecture. In the distal femur metaphysis, MAT- mice had higher cancellous bone volume fraction and better bone quality (higher connectivity density, higher trabecular thickness, higher trabecular number and lower trabecular spacing) compared to WT mice. A different pattern was observed in the femur epiphysis where no difference between genotypes was detected in cancellous bone volume fraction, but the MAT- mice had lower trabecular number and higher trabecular thickness. Compared to cancellous bone in the metaphysis, which is highly sensitive to systemic factors that regulate mineral homeostasis (e.g., gonadal hormones), cancellous bone in the epiphysis experiences higher strain energy levels during weight bearing, suggesting a more important mechanical role, and exhibits lower bone loss in response to gonadectomy or aging37,38,39. The potential for site-specific differences in regulation illustrate the importance of evaluating multiple skeletal sites. Histomorphometric analysis provides insight into the cellular basis for the microarchitecture in the metaphysis. Specifically, bone formation was higher in the MAT- mice compared to WT mice. These results support the concept that an inability to produce MAT may increase the production of osteoblasts24,40,41,42. Interestingly, osteoclast perimeter was also higher in MAT- mice. Presumably, the unbalanced bone turnover responsible for a higher cancellous bone volume fraction in MAT- mice is due, in part, to the previously described defect in osteoclast activity in these mice43. Two weeks of HU resulted in reduced cancellous bone volume fraction in the metaphysis in both WT and MAT- mice, but the reduction was greater in MAT- mice. HU also resulted in changes in bone microarchitecture consistent with deterioration in bone quality (decreased connectivity density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, and increased trabecular spacing). HU resulted in higher osteoclast perimeter in WT mice without altering osteoblast perimeter, a result consistent with the effect of spaceflight on biochemical markers of bone turnover is astronauts44,45,46,47. HU resulted in higher bone formation in the metaphysis of MAT-mice, as well as higher osteoclast perimeter. Thus, while HU resulted in higher osteoblast perimeter, it was insufficient to balance the higher rate of bone resorption, resulting in less cancellous bone due to unbalanced bone turnover. Whereas 4 days of HU were associated with decreased expression of bone matrix proteins in BALBc and C3H mice48, we observed no decrease in expression of bone matrix proteins (Bglap, Col1a1, Col1a2) or alkaline phosphatase 14 days following unloading in WBB6F1/J mice. These findings are consistent with the normal osteoblast perimeter and bone formation in WBB6F1/J HU mice. The results further suggest that any suppression of bone formation following HU is transient, with the rebound occurring in response to increased bone resorption. HU did not alter MAT levels, a finding that contrasts with the increases in MAT reported following spaceflight in rats18 and a previous HU study in mice49. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Few studies have evaluated effects of either spaceflight or disuse on MAT in mice. Thus, we cannot be certain that additional factors, including species, gender, age, duration of skeletal unloading and housing conditions, impact MAT accumulation during HU. The present study differs from earlier work in that mice in the present study were housed at thermoneutral temperature (32 °C). This may be relevant because MAT levels are reduced in mice by housing at room temperature38,50. Limitations of the present study include the relatively short duration of unloading and exclusive use of males. While the skeletons of male and female rats were reported to respond similarly to HU, gender comparisons have not been performed in mice51. Whatever the precise mechanism for the discrepancy in MAT accumulation during skeletal unloading, our results indicate an increase in MAT is not a prerequisite for HU-induced cancellous bone loss. Spaceflight is associated with the development of subclinical diabetogenic changes in astronauts52. Whole body insulin resistance was observed within one day in growing HU rats53. In the present study, HU resulted in higher blood glucose levels, a response that was accentuated in MAT- mice. This suggests that MAT- mice have an impaired ability to regulate blood glucose levels which may be relevant to their excessive bone loss compared to WT mice as the skeletal response to mechanical loading is impaired in mice with hyperglycemia54. Results from Experiment 1 indicate that an inability to produce MAT does not provide protection against disuse-induced bone loss. However, MAT- mice are also c-kit deficient. Kit signaling plays a role in regulating early osteoclast differentiation and mature osteoclast function55,56. Thus, impaired c-kit signaling may have impacted the skeletal response to HU. While adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells, HSC express c-kit57. Adoptive transfer in Experiment 2 was successful in restoring WT hematopoietic lineage cells without restoring MAT. Two weeks of HU resulted in reduced cancellous bone in WT→KitW/W−v mice, indicating that MAT- mice with normal c-kit signaling are not protected against HU-induced cancellous bone loss. Gene profiling adds further support to the conclusion that the underlying mechanisms mediating cancellous bone loss in the femur of HU MAT- and WT mice are not identical. There was little overlap in differentially expressed genes between HU WT and HU MAT- mice and where there was overlap (Comt, Esr1) the genes were differentially expressed in opposite directions. Particularly notable was the opposing differential response of estrogen receptor α (Esr1) in WT and MAT- mice to HU because estrogen receptor signaling plays an important role in the skeletal response to mechanical loading37. Also notable following HU was the genotype-specific (MAT- only) differential expression of genes related to fatty acid metabolism (Alox5, Alox10 and Alox12) and cytokine, neurotransmitter and hormone signaling (Comt, Hsd11b, Esr1, Igfbp2, Il6, Il6ra, Lta, Nos3, NPY, Nr3c1, Shbg, and Tshr). Further investigation is required to establish the significance of these differentially expressed genes in HU-induced bone loss. In summary, analysis of bone microarchitecture, histomorphometry and gene expression revealed differences in the skeletal response to HU between MAT- and WT mice. Taken together, the results do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT contributes to disuse-induced bone loss in mice. MAT may actually attenuate disuse-induced osteopenia, perhaps by limiting the magnitude of increased bone turnover.",

Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same precursor cells, adipocyte differentiation may occur at the expense of osteoblast differentiation. We used MAT-deficient KitW/W−v (MAT-) mice to determine if absence of MAT reduced bone loss in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice. Male MAT- and wild-type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to a baseline, control or HU group (n = 10 mice/group) within each genotype and HU groups unloaded for 2 weeks. Femurs were evaluated using micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and targeted gene profiling. MAT- mice had a greater reduction in bone volume fraction after HU than did WT mice. HU MAT- mice had elevated cancellous bone formation and resorption compared to other treatment groups as well as a unique profile of differentially expressed genes. Adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells reconstituted c-kit but not MAT in KitW/W−v mice. The MAT- WT → KitW/W−v mice lost cancellous bone following 2 weeks of HU. In summary, results from this study suggest that MAT deficiency was not protective, and was associated with exaggerated disuse-induced cancellous bone loss. In long-duration spaceflight, the human skeleton adapts to microgravity by reducing the amount of bone in sites that are weight-bearing1. While new countermeasures have been implemented in a mission-specific manner, mitigating the metabolic changes of the skeleton in microgravity remains a challenge to the success of long-duration exploration class missions2,3. An increase in bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is commonly observed with a decline in bone mass. This association has been observed in humans in iliac crest biopsies and with non-invasive use of magnetic resonance imaging, and in animal models for aging, postmenopausal osteoporosis4 and disuse5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Increased MAT was reported in humans following long-duration bedrest and in rodents during spaceflight13,17,18,19. Both osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from mesenchymal stem cells in the presence of specific transcription factors20,21,22,23. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes originate from the same progenitor pool within the bone marrow, it is possible that one cell type could be produced at the expense of the other20,24,25,26,27,28,29. However, a causal relationship has yet to be demonstrated. Thus, while conditions of disuse create a change in balance of cellular function within the bone marrow, it is not clear whether the concurrently observed infiltration of bone marrow fat actively contributes to bone loss. We have previously identified KitW/W−v mice as deficient in bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT-) in weight-bearing bones30,31. These mice have a loss of function mutation in c-kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase, located on selective hematopoietic lineage cells32,33. Since an inverse relationship between MAT accumulation and bone mass has been observed, we hypothesized that if MAT plays a causative role, MAT- mice would be resistant to disuse-induced bone loss. To test this hypothesis, we utilized hindlimb unloading (HU) as a ground-based model for spaceflight34. The HU model produces skeletal changes in hindlimbs of rodents similar to those observed in astronauts following spaceflight35. We therefore compared the skeletal response of adult male WT mice and MAT- mice to HU. Results Experiment 1 Experiment 1 evaluated the impact of MAT deficiency on the skeletal response to HU. The effects of genotype (WT and MAT-), treatment (control and HU), and their interaction on body weight, abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, seminal vesicle weight and blood glucose at necropsy are shown in Fig. 1. MAT- mice had a lower body weight than WT mice (Fig. 1a). No significant difference in body weight was observed in response to HU. MAT- mice had less abdominal WAT than WT mice (Fig. 1b). No significant difference in WAT weight was observed in response to HU. Seminal vesicle weight reflects testosterone levels in mice36. MAT- mice had lower seminal vesicle weight than WT mice (Fig. 1c) and HU resulted in greater seminal vesicle weight. Blood glucose was not different between genotypes (Fig. 1d). HU resulted in higher blood glucose concentrations, but MAT- HU mice experienced a greater increase in blood glucose. Figure 1.

Two-way ANOVA: a, different from control mice within genotype. P-values significant at P ≤ 0.05. Mean ± SEM.The effects of genotype, HU and their interaction on cancellous bone microarchitecture in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Fig. 2. MAT- mice had a greater bone volume fraction than WT mice (Fig. 2a). HU resulted in a lower bone volume fraction in both genotypes, but the MAT- mice experienced a greater reduction in bone volume fraction. MAT- mice had a greater connectivity density (Fig. 2b) than WT mice. HU reduced the connectivity density of both genotypes, but MAT- mice experienced a greater reduction. MAT- mice had greater trabecular number than WT mice (Fig. 2c). HU resulted in lower trabecular number. MAT- mice had greater trabecular thickness than WT mice (Fig. 2d). HU resulted in lower trabecular thickness. MAT- mice had lower trabecular spacing than WT mice (Fig. 2e). HU resulted in greater trabecular spacing. Representative images of microarchitecture in the femur metaphysis are shown in Fig. 2f–i. Figure 2.

Images compiled by JAK.The effects of genotype, HU and their interaction on cancellous bone microarchitecture in the distal femur epiphysis are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Bone volume fraction was not different between genotypes (Fig. S1a). HU resulted in lower bone volume fraction. MAT- mice had lower connectivity density than WT mice (Fig. S1b). No significant difference in connectivity density was observed in response to HU. MAT- mice had lower trabecular number than WT mice (Fig. S1c). No significant difference was observed in trabecular number in response to HU. MAT- mice had greater trabecular thickness than WT mice (Fig. S1d). HU resulted in lower trabecular thickness. MAT- mice had greater trabecular spacing than WT mice (Fig. S1e). No significant difference was observed in trabecular spacing in response to HU. To establish the direction of changes in bone microarchitecture following HU, the treatment groups were compared to controls sacrificed at the start of the experiment (baseline controls). The results are shown in Supplementary Table S1. In general, there was no difference in bone microarchitecture between control and baseline mice, the exceptions being cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density and trabecular number in the distal femur metaphysis of WT mice which were lower in the control mice. In contrast, most parameters differed between the HU mice and baseline mice. Specifically, cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness were lower and trabecular spacing higher in the distal femur metaphysis of HU WT and HU MAT- mice. Also, cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness were lower in the distal femur epiphysis of HU WT and HU MAT- mice compared to baseline. The effects of genotype, HU and their interaction on histomorphometry in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, adipocytes in bone marrow were not detected in MAT- mice (Fig. 3a–c). The absence of adipocytes can be visibly appreciated in Fig. 3e. No significant differences were observed in bone marrow adiposity (Fig. 3a), adipocyte density (Fig. 3b) or adipocyte size (Fig. 3c) in response to HU in WT mice. Figure 3.

Two-way ANOVA: a, different from control mice within genotype; b, different from WT mice within treatment. P-values significant at P ≤ 0.05. Mean ± SEM. Image scale is 500 μm at 4x. Images taken by JAK.MAT- HU mice had greater osteoblast perimeter than WT HU mice (Fig. 3f). HU had no effect on osteoblast perimeter in WT mice, but resulted in greater osteoblast perimeter in the MAT- mice. MAT- mice had a greater osteoclast perimeter than WT mice (Fig. 3g). HU resulted in greater osteoclast perimeter. MAT- mice had greater mineralizing perimeter than WT mice (Fig. 3h). No significant difference in mineralizing perimeter was observed in response to HU. MAT- HU mice had greater mineral apposition rate than WT HU mice (Fig. 3i). HU had no effect on mineral apposition rate in WT mice, but resulted in greater mineral apposition rate in the MAT- mice. MAT- HU mice had greater bone formation rate than WT HU mice (Fig. 3j). HU had no effect on bone formation rate in the WT mice, but resulted in greater bone formation rate in MAT- mice. Gene profiling was performed to evaluate whether HU leads to differential gene expression in WT and MAT- mice that may provide insight into the mechanisms mediating the observed differences in microarchitecture and cellular responses. The differential expression of genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function is shown in Fig. 4; the complete analysis of all 84 genes can be found in Supplementary Table S2. Compared to WT control mice, 5 genes (Igfbp2, Mstn, Mthfr, Nfatc1, Sfrp1) were differentially expressed in MAT- mice. Compared to WT control mice, 10 genes (Adcy10, Bmp7, Calcr, Car2, Col1a1, Comt, Crtap, Ctsk, Esr1, Fgfr1) were differentially expressed in WT HU mice. Compared to WT control mice, 21 genes (Alox12, Alox15, Alox5, Cd40, Cnr2, Comt, Dbp, Esr1, Esrra, Hsd11b1, Igfbp2, Il6, Il6ra, Lta, Mstn, Nos3, Npy, Nr3c1, Sfrp1, Shbg, Tshr) were differentially expressed in MAT- HU mice. Two of the genes that were differentially expressed in HU WT mice were differentially expressed in MAT- HU mice (Comt, and Esr1), but in opposite directions. Figure 4. Relative expression of genes relating to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function normalized to Gapdh. Open in a new tab WT CTL mice were used to compare the effects of HU (red circle; 10 genes differentially expressed), MAT deficiency (green circle; 5 genes differentially expressed), and MAT deficiency after HU (blue circle; 21 genes differentially expressed).Experiment 2 A pilot study showed that transplanting WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) into KitW/W−v mice (WT→KitW/W−v) reconstituted the hematopoietic compartment without restoring MAT. Therefore, Experiment 2 was performed to determine if HU-induced bone loss occurs with MAT deficiency in WT→KitW/W−v mice. The absence of MAT following adoptive transfer of WT HSC was confirmed in the present study (Fig. 5). To determine the extent of hematopoietic cell compartment reconstitution with donor cells in irradiated recipients, adoptive transfer of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-positive HSC into irradiated recipients (GFP→KitW/W−v) was concurrently performed. The percentage of donor-derived GFP positive B cells and T cells, two immune cell populations derived from HSC, were determined in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of recipient mice 8 weeks post adoptive transfer (Fig. 6). As expected, the control mice had no GFP-positive cells. In the GFP→KitW/W−vmice, 95% of B cells and 79% of T cells were GFP positive. Figure 5.

Images taken by JAK.The effect of HU on cancellous bone in the femur metaphysis of MAT- mice after adoptive transfer of WT HSC (WT→KitW/W−v) is shown in Fig. 7. HU resulted in lower cancellous bone volume fraction (Fig. 7a), lower connectivity density (Fig. 7b), and lower trabecular thickness (Fig. 7d). No effect of HU was observed in trabecular number (Fig. 7c) or trabecular spacing (Fig. 7e). Figure 7.

T-test: P-values significant at P ≤ 0.05. Mean ± SEM.Analysis of cancellous bone in the femur epiphysis of MAT- mice, who underwent adoptive transfer of WT HSC, is shown in Supplementary Figure S2. HU resulted in lower bone volume fraction (Fig. S2a). No effect of HU was observed in connectivity density (Fig. S2b), trabecular number (Fig. S2c), trabecular thickness (Fig. S2d) or trabecular spacing (Fig. S2e).Discussion The present analysis is among the first to investigate the role of MAT in disuse-induced bone loss. The skeletal response to HU, an Earth-based model for spaceflight, was compared between normal mice and mice deficient in MAT (KitW/W−v mice). We hypothesized that an inability to produce MAT would provide protection from disuse-induced bone loss. This hypothesis stemmed from evidence that an increase in MAT during disuse was occurring at the expense of osteoblast formation. However, results from this study do not support our hypothesis. Indeed, MAT deficiency was associated with exaggerated bone loss. The MAT- mice exhibited compartment-specific alterations in skeletal microarchitecture. In the distal femur metaphysis, MAT- mice had higher cancellous bone volume fraction and better bone quality (higher connectivity density, higher trabecular thickness, higher trabecular number and lower trabecular spacing) compared to WT mice. A different pattern was observed in the femur epiphysis where no difference between genotypes was detected in cancellous bone volume fraction, but the MAT- mice had lower trabecular number and higher trabecular thickness. Compared to cancellous bone in the metaphysis, which is highly sensitive to systemic factors that regulate mineral homeostasis (e.g., gonadal hormones), cancellous bone in the epiphysis experiences higher strain energy levels during weight bearing, suggesting a more important mechanical role, and exhibits lower bone loss in response to gonadectomy or aging37,38,39. The potential for site-specific differences in regulation illustrate the importance of evaluating multiple skeletal sites. Histomorphometric analysis provides insight into the cellular basis for the microarchitecture in the metaphysis. Specifically, bone formation was higher in the MAT- mice compared to WT mice. These results support the concept that an inability to produce MAT may increase the production of osteoblasts24,40,41,42. Interestingly, osteoclast perimeter was also higher in MAT- mice. Presumably, the unbalanced bone turnover responsible for a higher cancellous bone volume fraction in MAT- mice is due, in part, to the previously described defect in osteoclast activity in these mice43. Two weeks of HU resulted in reduced cancellous bone volume fraction in the metaphysis in both WT and MAT- mice, but the reduction was greater in MAT- mice. HU also resulted in changes in bone microarchitecture consistent with deterioration in bone quality (decreased connectivity density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, and increased trabecular spacing). HU resulted in higher osteoclast perimeter in WT mice without altering osteoblast perimeter, a result consistent with the effect of spaceflight on biochemical markers of bone turnover is astronauts44,45,46,47. HU resulted in higher bone formation in the metaphysis of MAT-mice, as well as higher osteoclast perimeter. Thus, while HU resulted in higher osteoblast perimeter, it was insufficient to balance the higher rate of bone resorption, resulting in less cancellous bone due to unbalanced bone turnover. Whereas 4 days of HU were associated with decreased expression of bone matrix proteins in BALBc and C3H mice48, we observed no decrease in expression of bone matrix proteins (Bglap, Col1a1, Col1a2) or alkaline phosphatase 14 days following unloading in WBB6F1/J mice. These findings are consistent with the normal osteoblast perimeter and bone formation in WBB6F1/J HU mice. The results further suggest that any suppression of bone formation following HU is transient, with the rebound occurring in response to increased bone resorption. HU did not alter MAT levels, a finding that contrasts with the increases in MAT reported following spaceflight in rats18 and a previous HU study in mice49. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Few studies have evaluated effects of either spaceflight or disuse on MAT in mice. Thus, we cannot be certain that additional factors, including species, gender, age, duration of skeletal unloading and housing conditions, impact MAT accumulation during HU. The present study differs from earlier work in that mice in the present study were housed at thermoneutral temperature (32 °C). This may be relevant because MAT levels are reduced in mice by housing at room temperature38,50. Limitations of the present study include the relatively short duration of unloading and exclusive use of males. While the skeletons of male and female rats were reported to respond similarly to HU, gender comparisons have not been performed in mice51. Whatever the precise mechanism for the discrepancy in MAT accumulation during skeletal unloading, our results indicate an increase in MAT is not a prerequisite for HU-induced cancellous bone loss. Spaceflight is associated with the development of subclinical diabetogenic changes in astronauts52. Whole body insulin resistance was observed within one day in growing HU rats53. In the present study, HU resulted in higher blood glucose levels, a response that was accentuated in MAT- mice. This suggests that MAT- mice have an impaired ability to regulate blood glucose levels which may be relevant to their excessive bone loss compared to WT mice as the skeletal response to mechanical loading is impaired in mice with hyperglycemia54. Results from Experiment 1 indicate that an inability to produce MAT does not provide protection against disuse-induced bone loss. However, MAT- mice are also c-kit deficient. Kit signaling plays a role in regulating early osteoclast differentiation and mature osteoclast function55,56. Thus, impaired c-kit signaling may have impacted the skeletal response to HU. While adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells, HSC express c-kit57. Adoptive transfer in Experiment 2 was successful in restoring WT hematopoietic lineage cells without restoring MAT. Two weeks of HU resulted in reduced cancellous bone in WT→KitW/W−v mice, indicating that MAT- mice with normal c-kit signaling are not protected against HU-induced cancellous bone loss. Gene profiling adds further support to the conclusion that the underlying mechanisms mediating cancellous bone loss in the femur of HU MAT- and WT mice are not identical. There was little overlap in differentially expressed genes between HU WT and HU MAT- mice and where there was overlap (Comt, Esr1) the genes were differentially expressed in opposite directions. Particularly notable was the opposing differential response of estrogen receptor α (Esr1) in WT and MAT- mice to HU because estrogen receptor signaling plays an important role in the skeletal response to mechanical loading37. Also notable following HU was the genotype-specific (MAT- only) differential expression of genes related to fatty acid metabolism (Alox5, Alox10 and Alox12) and cytokine, neurotransmitter and hormone signaling (Comt, Hsd11b, Esr1, Igfbp2, Il6, Il6ra, Lta, Nos3, NPY, Nr3c1, Shbg, and Tshr). Further investigation is required to establish the significance of these differentially expressed genes in HU-induced bone loss. In summary, analysis of bone microarchitecture, histomorphometry and gene expression revealed differences in the skeletal response to HU between MAT- and WT mice. Taken together, the results do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT contributes to disuse-induced bone loss in mice. MAT may actually attenuate disuse-induced osteopenia, perhaps by limiting the magnitude of increased bone turnover.Methods The animals were maintained in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocol was approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiment 1 The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the skeletal response to HU in WT and MAT-deficient KitW/W−v mice. Four-week-old male WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW−v/J (KitW/W−vor MAT-) mice and their WT WBB6F1/J littermates were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and single housed in a 32 °C room for the duration of the experiment. Housing mice at 32 °C (thermoneutral temperature) has been shown to minimize resting energy expenditure58,59, which should compensate for the inability of mice to huddle (regulating body temperature) during HU. Furthermore, adaptation to room temperature housing was recently shown to result in cancellous bone loss in mice38. At 16 weeks of age, the mice were randomized by body weight into one of six treatments (n = 10/group): WT baseline, WT control, WT HU, MAT- baseline, MAT- control, MAT- HU. Animals from the baseline groups were sacrificed. The next day, animals from the control and HU groups were transferred to unloading cages. The mice were unloaded for 2 weeks as described34. In brief, HU mice were placed in a restraint device, where the tail was cleaned with ethanol-soaked gauze and sprayed with a tincture of benzoin. A thin piece of traction tape was looped through a large paper clip, and then pressed along the sides of the mouse’s tail. Filament tape was wrapped around the tail in two locations to secure the traction tape: the base of the tail and 2.5 cm caudal. The paperclip end was looped through the clasp secured on the unloading apparatus. Mice were positioned in a 30° head-down tilt. All HU animals were provided with food and water ad libitum. The control groups were pair-fed to unloaded groups within genotype, and were given water ad libitum. Calcein injections (15 mg/kg; sc) were given 4 days and 1 day prior to termination to label mineralizing bone matrix. Mice were anesthetized then terminated using decapitation. The right femur from each mouse was placed in formalin for 24-hour fixation, then stored at 4 °C in 70% ethanol prior to sequential analysis by μCT and histomorphometry. The left femur was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80 °C for RNA analysis. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g), seminal vesicle weight (g; an index of androgen levels) and blood glucose (mg/dL) were recorded at necropsy.Experiment 2 Mice were purchased and housed as in Experiment 1. WT littermates were used as donors of bone marrow. At 8 weeks of age, bone marrow transplant recipient mice were lethally irradiated (two split doses of 5 Gy each, 10 Gy total; Gammacell 22060 Co gamma irradiator) then, the following day, injected with purified HSC from donor WT mice. The purified HSC were prepared as follows: whole bone marrow cells were harvested from the femora and tibia of 12 donor mice. Lineage negative (lin−) cells were enriched from bone marrow cells using magnetic cell separation with MACS lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA, USA). Enriched lin- bone marrow cells were incubated with anti-CD117 (c-kit) and anti-Sca-1 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). HSC (Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+) were purified from enriched lin- by flow cytometry and single cell sorting60,61 using MoFlo XDP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Purified HSC were resuspended in saline, and 200 μl containing 1,000 donor HSC were injected into the tail vein of each irradiated recipient mouse. Tracking of cellular repopulation was performed with the use of HSC from GFP-expressing mice (GFP→ KitW/W−v; n = 3) using the same protocol. The percentages of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry using B cell-specific (CD19) and T cell-specific (CD3) antibodies 8 weeks post adoptive transfer. Mice that did not undergo adoptive transfer were used as controls (n = 2). At 16-weeks of age the mice were randomized by body weight into one of two treatments (n = 10/group): 1) WT→KitW/W−v control, 2) WT→KitW/W−v HU. Control and HU animals were then transferred to the unloading cages. Unloading and tissue collection were performed as described in Experiment 1.Micro-computed Tomography μCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of cancellous bone volume and architecture. Femora were scanned using a Scanco μCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 μm × 12 μm × 12 μm (55 kVp x-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0–1000). Cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis. Assessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540 μm in length) proximal to the growth plate, and included forty slices (480 μm in length) of cancellous bone. The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis. Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, mm−3), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, μm), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, mm−1) and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, μm).Histomorphometry The histological methods used have been previously described in detail62. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene, then embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Sections 4 μm thick were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and fixed to slides with a dried precoated 1% gelatin solution. Mounted unstained slides were used for measurements of fluorochrome labels. For cell-based measurements, slides were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. Static (cell-based) histological measurements include bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), adipocyte size (μm2), osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %). Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing63. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to the thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase-positive cytoplasm (stained red). Dynamic (fluorochrome) histological measurements include mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter; %), mineral apposition rate (distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3 day label interval; μm/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter; μm2/μm/year).Gene Expression Femora (n = 5/group) were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen, then further homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen). The expression of 84 genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function was determined using the Mouse “Osteoporosis” RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was normalized to Gapdh and relative quantification was determined by the ΔΔCt method using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software version 3.5 (Qiagen). Two of the twenty samples did not meet quality control standards for interpretation of array data and were excluded.Statistical Analysis Means in Experiment 1 were compared between genotype and treatment groups using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When significant interactions were present, t-tests were used to make two-group comparisons with “a” used to signify a difference from control mice within genotype and “b” used to signify a difference from WT mice within treatment. When non-significant interactions were present, group comparisons were made from two-way ANOVA with main effects for genotype and treatment. Means for bone marrow adiposity, adipocyte density and adipocyte size were compared using t-tests, since the absence of marrow adiposity in KitW/W−v mice made the use of two-way ANOVA invalid. Means among baseline, control and HU groups within genotype were compared using one-way ANOVA. When the ANOVA was significant, Dunnett’s test was used to make comparisons to the baseline group. Means in Experiment 2 were compared using t-tests The required conditions for valid use of t-tests and ANOVA were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance and the Anderson-Darling test of normality. When the assumption of equal variance was violated, Welch’s two-sample t-test was used for two-group comparisons64. When the normality assumption was violated, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for two-group comparisons. Methods for maintaining false discovery rate at 5% were used to adjust for multiple comparisons65. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Data analysis was performed using RStudio version 0.98.1083.Additional Information How to cite this article: Keune, J. A. et al.

    "abstract": "Abstract The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. Mrc1−/− mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding, Mrc1−/− mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1−/− mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed that Mrc1−/− mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding in Mrc1−/− mice compared to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development. Keywords: Mrc1, obesity, bone marrow, inflammation",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction The mannose receptor (Mrc1) is a unique type 1 transmembrane receptor that is a member of the C-type lectin family. Mrc1 can be located on non-vascular endothelium, macrophages [1], and dendritic cells [2] as well as in the serum in a shortened soluble form [3]. It presents eight C-type lectin domains (CTLDs), of which only number four is functional, and recognizes mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) [4]. Moreover, Mrc1 has a fibronectin type II (FNII) domain with a high affinity for collagen [5], and a terminal cysteine-rich (CR) domain which binds sulfated sugars [6]. Because of its complex structure, the mannose receptor recognizes several ligands, including circulating hormones [7,8] and adhesion molecules [9]. This aspect, together with its wide expression, allows Mrc1 to be involved in several processes including the immune response. It has been proposed that Mrc1 plays a key role during the immune response because of its ability to recognize mannose residues [10], expressed as terminal glycan moiety on lysosomal enzymes released during inflammation [11] or as part of microbial walls [12], and because of its participation in leukocyte trafficking. The mannose receptor expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells interacts with the highly glycosylated protein CD44 on lymphocytes, directly regulating their trafficking [9]. Notably, Mrc1 is also expressed in the bone marrow compartment by both macrophages [13] and sinusoidal endothelium [14], which are known to modulate both the proliferation/maturation of hematopoietic stem cells and the extravasation of immune cells [15]. Conditions that cause systemic inflammation, such as metabolic disturbances and obesity [16], impair bone marrow hematopoiesis and promote the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by sinusoidal ECs [17]. The outcomes of these conditions also activate an immune inflammatory response within several target tissues, including the adipose tissue and the liver. The aims of our study were to investigate (1) the role of the mannose receptor in the bone marrow during obesity development and (2) the relationship between the mannose receptor function and changes in systemic inflammation. We fed Mrc1−/− and control WT mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks and observed that Mrc1 deficiency resulted in reduced myelopoiesis associated with an increased adipocyte count in the bone marrow. This was associated with a significant reduction of circulating myeloid inflammatory cells together with a reduced infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and in the liver. The improved inflammatory response in Mrc1-deficient mice was paralleled by reduced body weight gain during HFD feeding, reduced liver steatosis, and improved glucose and insulin response compared to WT mice. These data suggest that the mannose receptor could be involved in the development of the immunometabolic response associated with diet-induced obesity.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods Extensive details of the materials and methods used in our study are provided as an online supplement. 2.1. Mice Mrc1−/− mice on a C57BL/6J background were used and compared to age-matched C57BL/6J wild-type littermates. Four animals were housed per cage and kept in a temperature-controlled environment (20 ± 2°C, 50 ± 5% relative humidity) with a 12 h light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. Six- to 8-week-old male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% Kcal from fat, Cat. No. D12451, Research diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was measured weakly. All mice were sacrificed after overnight fasting using isoflurane (2%) inhalation, and then blood was collected using an intracardiac puncture. We also collected and weighed visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the liver, femurs, and tibias from the mice. All animal procedures conformed to the guidelines from directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and were approved by the Ethical Committee (Progetto di Ricerca 2012/02, Autorizzazione Ministeriale 929/2020). 2.2. Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were used to measure the plasmatic clearance of glucose after intraperitoneal injection of glucose or insulin, respectively. For the GTT, animals were fasted overnight (approximately 14 h) and then blood glucose levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the injection of a glucose solution (10% w/v in physiological solution, 1 mg per gram of body weight). Blood glucose levels were measured with a glucometer (ONE-TOUCH Ultra glucometer, Lifescan, Milpitas, CA, USA). For the ITT, animals were fasted for 4 h and then glucose plasma levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the injection of human recombinant insulin (0.75 mU per gram of body weight, Humulin R U-100, 100 U/mL). 2.3. Sample Preparation for Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping was performed on blood or single-cell suspensions that were previously obtained from bone marrow centrifugation (as described in Fan Y. et al. [18]), visceral adipose tissue collagenase digestion (as previously described [19]), or liver dissociation and stratification. Whole blood was incubated with an antibody mix for 30 min at 4 °C and then fixed and lysed (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell suspensions from each tissue were stained with the antibody mix at 4 °C for 30 min. Washes and the final resuspension for acquisition were performed using PBS with FBS 2% and EDTA 2 mM. Samples were acquired with LSRFortessa X-20 (BD) and analyzed with Novoexpress software (version 1.6.0, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Further details on tissue preparation are provided in the Supplementary Materials. The antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table S1. 2.4. Femurs, Liver, and Adipose Tissues Histology Mouse femurs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C, decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA pH 8 for 5 days at 4 °C, and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Longitudinal femur sections (10 μm thick) were incubated with anti-perilipin 1 antibody (1:200; Cat. No. 9349, Cell Signalling Technology®, Danvers, MA, USA). An anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted to 1:200 in PBS plus 1% BSA was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Images (10×) were acquired with a Leica DM6B automated upright microscope (Leica Biosystems S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and then processed with Fiji/ImageJ software (version 1.50, , Bethesda, MD, USA). Adipocytes were manually quantified with Fiji/ImageJ based on perilipin-1 immunostaining. Part of the liver, VAT, SCAT, and BAT was fixed overnight in 4% buffer formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) embedded in paraffin and then 5 µm tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Sigma-Aldrich). Images of H&E-stained sections were acquired using the Axiovision Zeiss software (version 4.8, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 10× magnification. We evaluated liver steatosis using ImageJ software and the adipocytes area of VAT and SCAT using the Adiposoft Plugin, considering two fields per section, for a total of 10 sections per animal. To assess hepatic neutrophil activation, immunohistochemistry staining of liver sections was performed using the Anti-Neutrophil Elastase antibody (1:200; Cat. No. ab68672, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by the HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:750; Sigma-Aldrich), a reaction with DAB Liquid Substrate System (Sigma-Aldrich), and nuclei counterstaining with haematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired with Axiovision Zeiss software at 10x magnification and elastase-positive areas were quantified with ImageJ software. 2.5. Proteomics Analysis A proteomics analysis was performed as previously described [20]. Briefly, mice livers (n = 3 WT mice and n = 3 Mrc1−/−) were pooled up to 20 mg and lysed with urea 8M, Tris-HCl 0.1 M pH 8.5 in the presence of protease inhibitors at a ratio of 1:100 (Cell Signalling, Cat. No. 5872S). The liver samples were then quantified and prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis. For plasma, 30 μL samples (n = 4 WT mice and n = 4 Mrc1−/− mice) were pooled, and the concentration was quantified by NanoDrop A280 nm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for LC-MS/MS analysis. Methodological details are provided in the Supplementary Materials. 2.6. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) For the gene expression analysis, brown adipose tissue was homogenized with TissueRuptor II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was first quantified with a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then retro-transcribed to cDNA with iScript™ Reverse Transcription Supermix (Cat. No. 1708841, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A 20 ng sample of the cDNA was used for amplification by real-time quantitative PCR (CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System instrument, Cat. No. 1855201, Bio-Rad) with the Luna® Universal qPCR Master Mix (Cat. No. M3003E, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). For each amplification, 1 µM of each primer was used to a final volume of 15 µL of the reaction mix with 7.5 µL of the master MIX. The threshold cycle number (Ct) values for each reaction were calculated. Gene expression was calculated as 2ΔΔCt adjusted to the expression of the housekeeping gene Rpl-13a and as a fold difference of Mrc1−/− to control group. The primer sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2. 2.7. Statistical Analysis GraphPad Prism (version 9, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for graphical representation and statistical analyses of the data. Results are given as the mean per group ± standard error of the mean (SEM). For comparison between the two groups, an unpaired parametric two-sided T-test with a 95% confidence interval was used when the data sets followed a normal distribution. For non-normal data, the Mann–Whitney nonparametric unpaired T-test was applied. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. The DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery, NIAID, North Bethesda, MD, USA) platform was used for gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses. GO and KEGG were performed using our protein LFQ dataset, and results for significant terms associated with the gene set were selected based on the FDR < 0.05.",

Mrc1 Deficiency in Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet Affects Bone Marrow Myelopoiesis and Adiposity, Which Results in Dampened Immune-Inflammatory Response in the Circulation To investigate whether mannose receptor deficiency affects the immune cell profile during obesity, we first characterized the circulating immune cell profile for the Mrc1−/− and control WT male mice fed an HFD for 20 weeks with a focus on myeloid populations (gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure S1A–F). The Mrc1−/− mice displayed a significant reduction in neutrophils (Figure 1A) and inflammatory CCR2+ monocyte counts (Figure 1B). Although, the total monocyte numbers were not different between the two experimental groups (Figure 1C). A trend toward the reduction of circulating CD11b+ myeloid cells was also observed (Figure 1D), whereas the counts of eosinophils (Figure 1E) and circulating adaptive immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, were not different (Figure 1F,G). We next investigated whether this profile might be the consequence of changes in the medullary compartment of Mrc1−/− as compared to WT male mice following HFD feeding. To this aim, we profiled different hematopoietic precursor subsets and mature immune cells (cell subsets investigated are presented in Supplementary Figure S2, and the gating strategy used is presented in Supplementary Figure S3A–R) in the bone marrow of the different animal models. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Mrc1 deficiency impact on circulating immune cell subsets and bone marrow hematopoiesis during high-fat diet feeding. Circulating neutrophils (A), infiltrating monocytes (B), monocytes (C), myeloid cells (D), eosinophils (E), lymphocyte B cells, (F) and lymphocyte T cells (G) counts in WT and Mrc1−/− mice fed an HFD for 20 weeks. Earlier hematopoietic progenitors, including long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs, (H)) and short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs, (I)), multipotent progenitors (MPPs, (J)) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs, (K)), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs, (L)), granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs, (M)), and granulocyte progenitors (GPs, (N)). Bone marrow distribution of pre-neutrophils (PNs, (O)), immature neutrophils (Ins, (P)), mature neutrophils (MNs, (Q)), macrophage/dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs, (R)), monocyte progenitors (MOPs, (S)), Ly6Clow monocytes (T) and Ly6Chigh monocytes (U), and macrophages (V) were profiled in bone marrow from WT and Mrc1−/− mice fed with an HFD for 20 weeks. Representative flow cytometry pseudocolor plots (red for higher density of cells, blue for lower) of WT and Mrc1-deficient mice of neutrophil differentiation subpopulations and macrophages are shown in panels (W,X). Representative immunofluorescence acquisition of femur sections stained with perilipin (left) with magnification of the outlined area (right) (Y). Adipocyte distribution per area (Z), mean count of cells per section (AA), and adipocyte area (AB) are shown. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 8–10 mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.The number of early progenitors was similar in WT and Mrc1−/− mice, including that of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs, Figure 1H), short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs, Figure 1I), multipotent progenitors (MPPs, Figure 1J), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs, Figure 1K), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs, Figure 1L), and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs, Figure 1M). Interestingly, the amount of more mature cells, including granulocyte progenitors (GPs, Figure 1N), pre-neutrophils (PNs, Figure 1O), and mature neutrophils (MNs, Figure 1Q, representative plots Figure 1W), were significantly reduced in mice lacking Mrc1 as compared to controls. Macrophage/dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs; Figure 1R), monocyte precursors (MOPs, Figure 1S), and mature Ly6Clow (Figure 1T) and Ly6Chigh (Figure 1U) monocytes were not affected. On the other hand, macrophages identified as Gr-1−CD115−F4/80+SSClow decreased in the bone marrow of Mrc1-deficient mice compared to WT mice (Figure 1V,X). This last trait was commonly associated with compromised retention of hematopoietic stem cells in the niche [21], often as the consequence of altered crosstalk between the stem cell niche and adipocytes within the bone marrow during hematopoiesis [22,23]. To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the content of adipocytes in the bone marrow of Mrc1−/− mice to control mice using Perilipin as an adipocyte marker with immunofluorescence staining (Figure 1Y). Adipocyte content significantly increased in association with Mrc1 deficiency both in terms of cells per area and absolute count (Figure 1Z,AA). The observation of a similar value for adipocyte cell surface area between the experimental groups (Figure 1AB) suggests that an investigation of differences in bone marrow adipogenesis is required to explain the phenotype described above. Altogether, the decreased presence of macrophages, the combination of reduced levels of myeloid precursors and mature cells, and the increased adipocyte content suggest that the lack of Mrc1 could promote a medullary rewiring in mice with diet-induced obesity. This medullary rewiring is reflected in changes to the circulating immune subsets and systemic inflammatory status. To explore this hypothesis, untargeted proteomic analysis of the plasma from the different experimental groups was performed. Out of 4306 proteins identified, 4.4% were downregulated and 3.4% were upregulated in the plasma of obese Mrc1−/− mice compared to that of controls (Figure 2A,B). The different proteomic signature associated with Mrc1 deficiency was confirmed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA, Figure 2C), which showed a cluster clearly separated from that of plasma proteins from WT mice. To better characterize this phenotype, differently abundant proteins were analyzed using the KEGG database to assess enriched pathways in the plasma of Mrc1−/− mice compared to that of WT mice (Figure 2D). Interestingly, ECM-receptor interaction, leukocyte transendothelial migration, chemokine signaling pathway, and platelet activation (FDR < 0.05) displayed a higher number of downregulated proteins (Figure 2E,F) in the plasma from Mrc1−/− mice. These results suggest that the lack of the mannose receptor could affect the modulation of immune cell infiltration. Figure 2.

(G) Downregulated or upregulated pathways as per Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of plasma proteome profile of Mrc1−/− compared to WT mice. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 8–10 mice per group.Furthermore, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis confirmed the impact of Mrc1 deficiency on the modulation of the immune system function. The impact was shown by inhibited canonical pathways (Z-score based) including hepatic fibrosis signaling, NF-kB signaling, PKCθ signaling in T cells, necroptosis, and increased PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (Figure 2G). Overall, these data suggest that Mrc1 deficiency results in a protective BM phenotype characterized by decreased myelopoiesis and increased presence of quiescence-promoting adipocytes, coupled with changes in plasma proteome associated with a reduced number of pro-inflammatory and tissue-infiltrating leukocytes. 3.2. Mrc1 Deficiency in Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet Impacts Immune Infiltration of Metabolic Tissues during Obesity We performed flow cytometry analyses on the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver of WT and Mrc1−/− mice fed with an HFD for 20 weeks to investigate whether the reduced inflammatory and migratory phenotype of myeloid cells in circulation—as suggested by proteomics analysis—was reflected by different recruitment of immune cells in metabolically affected tissues. Interestingly, the mannose receptor deficiency was associated with a significant reduction in macrophages, specifically in monocyte-derived macrophages (Figure 3A–C, gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure S4A–I), within VAT, which suggests a different infiltrating capacity. This reduction was paralleled by a significant decrease in inflammatory CD11c+ macrophages (Figure 3D,F) in the Mrc1−/− mice compared to the controls, which was particularly evident in the subpopulation of macrophages expressing intermediate levels of F4/80 (Figure 3E) that are known to originate from circulating monocytes [24]. A trend toward reduced VAT infiltrating myeloid cells, monocytes, and CD11c+F4/80high macrophages was also observed (Figure 3G–J). This trend was not observed for neutrophils and eosinophils (Figure 3K,L). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Immune cell subset distribution in visceral adipose tissue and liver from Mrc1-deficient and WT mice fed with an HFD for 20 weeks. Macrophages (A), CCR2+ monocyte-derived macrophages (B), and a representative flow cytometry plot of macrophages in WT and Mrc1−/− mice (C) are shown. Inflammatory CD11c+ macrophage count (D) and CD11c+ F4/80int macrophage count (E) in the two experimental groups are shown. A representative flow cytometry plot showing CD11c+ macrophages in WT and Mrc1-deficient mice is shown in panel (F). VAT counts of myeloid cells (G), monocytes (H), CCR2+ infiltrating monocytes (I), CD11c+ F4/80high macrophages (J), neutrophils (K), and eosinophils (L) are shown. Liver myeloid cells (M), monocytes (N) and CCR2+ monocyte-derived macrophages (O), and representative plots showing neutrophils and monocyte distribution in the two experimental groups are presented in (P). Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 5–10 mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.In parallel, liver immunophenotyping (gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure S5A–H) showed decreased levels of myeloid cells (Figure 3M) in Mrc1−/− mice, which was more evident for monocytes (Figure 3N,P) and monocyte-derived macrophages (Figure 3O) but not for other cell subsets (Supplementary Figure S5I–O). Interestingly, although neutrophils were present in a comparable fashion in both experimental groups (Supplementary Figure S5K), histological analysis of the expression of elastase—a marker of neutrophil activation—on liver sections revealed a trend toward reduction in Mrc1−/− mice compared to controls (Supplementary Figure S5P,Q). Such a reduction is in line with a less severe inflammatory phenotype associated with the lack of the mannose receptor. 3.3. Immunomodulation in Mrc1−/− Mice Is Associated with Improved Obese Phenotype We compared weight gain in Mrc1−/− and WT mice fed a high-fat diet to evaluate whether the observed differences in the immune phenotype translate into an improved metabolic profile. This comparison revealed a significant reduction in the weight gain of Mrc1−/− mice compared to their WT counterpart (Figure 4A,B), which was in line with a recent report [25]. This difference was not the result of changes in visceral adipose tissue or subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, significant differences were observed in the relative weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the liver (Figure 4C). Nonetheless, the moderate impact of these differences in explaining the reduction of animal weight suggests that Mrc1 deficiency in mice fed an HFD might affect other tissues that were not evaluated in our work. This limitation should be addressed in future studies. Notably, the adipocyte area was not different in the VAT or SCAT from Mrc1−/− and WT mice (Figure 4D–F), but smaller lipid droplets were observed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Figure 4D). These smaller lipid droplets were coupled to significant changes in the gene expression profile of genes associated with BAT function such as Ppara, Pgc1a, Atgl and Ucp1 (Figure 4G). Figure 4.

(M) Glucose tolerance test (GTT) performed at 20 weeks of HFD feeding in WT and Mrc1−/− mice and calculated AUC. (N) Insulin tolerance test (ITT) performed at 20 weeks of HFD feeding in WT and Mrc1−/− mice and calculated AUC. Blood glucose levels are shown. Glycaemia was measured before i.p. glucose or insulin injection (t = 0, baseline values) and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 8–10 mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.Reduced lipid accumulation was also observed in the liver (Figure 4H, I) prompting us to profile liver proteome. Among 2114 proteins, 344 were downregulated and 363 were upregulated in Mrc1−/− mice (Supplementary Figure S6A,B). Differently abundant proteins were analyzed using the KEGG database to assess enriched pathways (Figure 4J), which were identified as being mainly metabolism related. One of the enriched pathways is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, in which most molecules appear less abundant in association with mannose receptor deficiency (Figure 4K), thus confirming the previous histological analysis. On the other hand, the gene ontology (GO) analysis identified the enrichment of the cellular response to the IL-4 pathway, where proteins are mainly upregulated (Figure 4L). This result suggests the presence of pro-resolutive immune activation, which aligns with an overall downregulation of proteins within the cellular response to the IFN-ƴ pathway [26] and with the reduced infiltration observed by flow cytometry. Reduced steatosis and inflammation pair with improved glucose and insulin tolerance, as shown by more upregulated proteins in the GO cellular response to the insulin stimulus pathway (Figure 4L), as well as a better performance following the glucose tolerance test (GTT, Figure 4M) and an improved trend following insulin tolerance test (ITT, Figure 4N). However, no significant changes were observed in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels (Supplementary Figure S6C,D). Thus, we observed that in mice fed an HFD for 20 weeks, the absence of the mannose receptor leads to a protective BM phenotype and a reduced leukocyte infiltration tendency, which associates with overall protection from obesity-related dysfunctions.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion Metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with increased hematopoiesis [27] and dysfunctional endothelium, which in turn contribute to disrupting myelopoiesis [17]. This pro-inflammatory hematopoiesis not only aggravates the dysmetabolic condition but also stands as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [28], calling for an investigation of the molecular mechanisms driving this effect. Intriguingly, the soluble mannose receptor has been shown to stimulate tissue macrophage activation towards inflammation, and its deficiency in mice fed an HFD resulted in reduced tissue inflammation and a better metabolic phenotype [25]. However, the use of a whole-body Mrc1 knock-out mouse model has suggested that the wide range in the expression of this receptor [10] would account for additional activities. In this context, we showed that Mrc1 deficiency results in reduced inflammation that might be the consequence of important changes in bone marrow cell signature. Interestingly, Mrc1 is expressed by both macrophages and medullary sinusoidal endothelial cells [14], where its expression increases following the onset of diabetes mellitus within a panel of inflammatory genes [17]. Highly active myelopoiesis observed in dysmetabolic conditions is commonly associated with a systemic immune activation characterized by the increased frequency of blood inflammatory cells and circulating markers of inflammation [29]. In our experimental setting, decreased levels of circulating neutrophils and pro-inflammatory CCR2+ monocytes were indeed associated with the bone marrow phenotype switch in Mrc1-deficient mice. Our work revealed that the lack of the mannose receptor modulates myelopoiesis, thus hampering the enhancement observed in animals fed with an HFD to induce obesity [30]. We demonstrated an important downregulation of myeloid cell production as well as an increased presence of adipocytes. Considering the role of CXCL12 in promoting HSCs quiescence, an increase in adipocytes, a known source of CXCL12, could negatively modulate hematopoiesis by reducing the production of inflammatory cells [22]. As a confirmation, our plasma proteomics analysis showed that the lack of the mannose receptor is paralleled by an overall reduction in leukocyte migration and the tissue infiltration pathways. Notably, changes in glycoprotein catabolism play a critical role in lipoprotein metabolism and cardiometabolic diseases [31]. Therefore, we investigated the immune phenotype of the visceral adipose tissue and liver, as they represent tissues at the crossroad between the metabolic and inflammatory response to obesity [32,33]. In Mrc1-deficient mice, both tissues presented a reduced infiltration of myeloid cells that contributed to an amelioration of the metabolic response during HFD. Indeed, the recruitment of monocytes from circulation to adipose tissue promotes the differentiation of macrophages with a pro-inflammatory phenotype at the cost of anti-inflammatory macrophages [34]. Notably, Mrc1 deficiency appears to counterbalance this effect, limiting the immunometabolic response observed during obesity. This finding seems unexpected given that the Mrc1 receptor is one of the key markers of pro-resolutive macrophages [35]. However, previous studies have shown that the selective depletion of Mrc1+ macrophages improves the systemic insulin response and lipid handling in adipose tissue [36]. These results suggest the presence of parallel mechanisms related to the presence of the mannose receptor that might be associated with the progression of metabolic disorders. Of note, in this study, we used whole-body Mrc1 knock-out mice. Therefore, it is possible that cells other than macrophages contributed to the phenotype observed. Indeed, in addition to macrophages, the mannose receptor is expressed by a variety of cells including non-immune cells, such as sinusoidal endothelial cells [1]. These cells have been implicated in leucocyte trafficking in lymphatic vessels [9]. Therefore, future studies should investigate whether leucocyte trafficking could also play a role in the observed phenotype. In conclusion, we have shown that, during the onset of obesity, Mrc1 impacts hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and release. In addition, Mrc1 deficiency impacts the BM cell profile and reduces the number of activated immune cells in circulation and their infiltration in tissues, thus dampening obesity development.",

Copyright notice ID: 9784906 PMID: 36557243 Abstract The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. Mrc1−/− mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding, Mrc1−/− mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1−/− mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed that Mrc1−/− mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding in Mrc1−/− mice compared to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development. Keywords: Mrc1, obesity, bone marrow, inflammation1. Introduction The mannose receptor (Mrc1) is a unique type 1 transmembrane receptor that is a member of the C-type lectin family. Mrc1 can be located on non-vascular endothelium, macrophages [1], and dendritic cells [2] as well as in the serum in a shortened soluble form [3]. It presents eight C-type lectin domains (CTLDs), of which only number four is functional, and recognizes mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) [4]. Moreover, Mrc1 has a fibronectin type II (FNII) domain with a high affinity for collagen [5], and a terminal cysteine-rich (CR) domain which binds sulfated sugars [6]. Because of its complex structure, the mannose receptor recognizes several ligands, including circulating hormones [7,8] and adhesion molecules [9]. This aspect, together with its wide expression, allows Mrc1 to be involved in several processes including the immune response. It has been proposed that Mrc1 plays a key role during the immune response because of its ability to recognize mannose residues [10], expressed as terminal glycan moiety on lysosomal enzymes released during inflammation [11] or as part of microbial walls [12], and because of its participation in leukocyte trafficking. The mannose receptor expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells interacts with the highly glycosylated protein CD44 on lymphocytes, directly regulating their trafficking [9]. Notably, Mrc1 is also expressed in the bone marrow compartment by both macrophages [13] and sinusoidal endothelium [14], which are known to modulate both the proliferation/maturation of hematopoietic stem cells and the extravasation of immune cells [15]. Conditions that cause systemic inflammation, such as metabolic disturbances and obesity [16], impair bone marrow hematopoiesis and promote the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by sinusoidal ECs [17]. The outcomes of these conditions also activate an immune inflammatory response within several target tissues, including the adipose tissue and the liver. The aims of our study were to investigate (1) the role of the mannose receptor in the bone marrow during obesity development and (2) the relationship between the mannose receptor function and changes in systemic inflammation. We fed Mrc1−/− and control WT mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks and observed that Mrc1 deficiency resulted in reduced myelopoiesis associated with an increased adipocyte count in the bone marrow. This was associated with a significant reduction of circulating myeloid inflammatory cells together with a reduced infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and in the liver. The improved inflammatory response in Mrc1-deficient mice was paralleled by reduced body weight gain during HFD feeding, reduced liver steatosis, and improved glucose and insulin response compared to WT mice. These data suggest that the mannose receptor could be involved in the development of the immunometabolic response associated with diet-induced obesity.2. Materials and Methods Extensive details of the materials and methods used in our study are provided as an online supplement. 2.1. Mice Mrc1−/− mice on a C57BL/6J background were used and compared to age-matched C57BL/6J wild-type littermates. Four animals were housed per cage and kept in a temperature-controlled environment (20 ± 2°C, 50 ± 5% relative humidity) with a 12 h light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. Six- to 8-week-old male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% Kcal from fat, Cat. No. D12451, Research diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was measured weakly. All mice were sacrificed after overnight fasting using isoflurane (2%) inhalation, and then blood was collected using an intracardiac puncture. We also collected and weighed visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the liver, femurs, and tibias from the mice. All animal procedures conformed to the guidelines from directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and were approved by the Ethical Committee (Progetto di Ricerca 2012/02, Autorizzazione Ministeriale 929/2020).2.2. Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were used to measure the plasmatic clearance of glucose after intraperitoneal injection of glucose or insulin, respectively. For the GTT, animals were fasted overnight (approximately 14 h) and then blood glucose levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the injection of a glucose solution (10% w/v in physiological solution, 1 mg per gram of body weight). Blood glucose levels were measured with a glucometer (ONE-TOUCH Ultra glucometer, Lifescan, Milpitas, CA, USA). For the ITT, animals were fasted for 4 h and then glucose plasma levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the injection of human recombinant insulin (0.75 mU per gram of body weight, Humulin R U-100, 100 U/mL).2.3. Sample Preparation for Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping was performed on blood or single-cell suspensions that were previously obtained from bone marrow centrifugation (as described in Fan Y. et al. [18]), visceral adipose tissue collagenase digestion (as previously described [19]), or liver dissociation and stratification. Whole blood was incubated with an antibody mix for 30 min at 4 °C and then fixed and lysed (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell suspensions from each tissue were stained with the antibody mix at 4 °C for 30 min. Washes and the final resuspension for acquisition were performed using PBS with FBS 2% and EDTA 2 mM. Samples were acquired with LSRFortessa X-20 (BD) and analyzed with Novoexpress software (version 1.6.0, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Further details on tissue preparation are provided in the Supplementary Materials. The antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.4. Femurs, Liver, and Adipose Tissues Histology Mouse femurs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C, decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA pH 8 for 5 days at 4 °C, and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Longitudinal femur sections (10 μm thick) were incubated with anti-perilipin 1 antibody (1:200; Cat. No. 9349, Cell Signalling Technology®, Danvers, MA, USA). An anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted to 1:200 in PBS plus 1% BSA was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Images (10×) were acquired with a Leica DM6B automated upright microscope (Leica Biosystems S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and then processed with Fiji/ImageJ software (version 1.50, , Bethesda, MD, USA). Adipocytes were manually quantified with Fiji/ImageJ based on perilipin-1 immunostaining. Part of the liver, VAT, SCAT, and BAT was fixed overnight in 4% buffer formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) embedded in paraffin and then 5 µm tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Sigma-Aldrich). Images of H&E-stained sections were acquired using the Axiovision Zeiss software (version 4.8, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 10× magnification. We evaluated liver steatosis using ImageJ software and the adipocytes area of VAT and SCAT using the Adiposoft Plugin, considering two fields per section, for a total of 10 sections per animal. To assess hepatic neutrophil activation, immunohistochemistry staining of liver sections was performed using the Anti-Neutrophil Elastase antibody (1:200; Cat. No. ab68672, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by the HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:750; Sigma-Aldrich), a reaction with DAB Liquid Substrate System (Sigma-Aldrich), and nuclei counterstaining with haematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired with Axiovision Zeiss software at 10x magnification and elastase-positive areas were quantified with ImageJ software.2.5. Proteomics Analysis A proteomics analysis was performed as previously described [20]. Briefly, mice livers (n = 3 WT mice and n = 3 Mrc1−/−) were pooled up to 20 mg and lysed with urea 8M, Tris-HCl 0.1 M pH 8.5 in the presence of protease inhibitors at a ratio of 1:100 (Cell Signalling, Cat. No. 5872S). The liver samples were then quantified and prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis. For plasma, 30 μL samples (n = 4 WT mice and n = 4 Mrc1−/− mice) were pooled, and the concentration was quantified by NanoDrop A280 nm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for LC-MS/MS analysis. Methodological details are provided in the Supplementary Materials.2.6. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) For the gene expression analysis, brown adipose tissue was homogenized with TissueRuptor II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was first quantified with a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then retro-transcribed to cDNA with iScript™ Reverse Transcription Supermix (Cat. No. 1708841, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A 20 ng sample of the cDNA was used for amplification by real-time quantitative PCR (CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System instrument, Cat. No. 1855201, Bio-Rad) with the Luna® Universal qPCR Master Mix (Cat. No. M3003E, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). For each amplification, 1 µM of each primer was used to a final volume of 15 µL of the reaction mix with 7.5 µL of the master MIX. The threshold cycle number (Ct) values for each reaction were calculated. Gene expression was calculated as 2ΔΔCt adjusted to the expression of the housekeeping gene Rpl-13a and as a fold difference of Mrc1−/− to control group. The primer sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2.2.7. Statistical Analysis GraphPad Prism (version 9, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for graphical representation and statistical analyses of the data. Results are given as the mean per group ± standard error of the mean (SEM). For comparison between the two groups, an unpaired parametric two-sided T-test with a 95% confidence interval was used when the data sets followed a normal distribution. For non-normal data, the Mann–Whitney nonparametric unpaired T-test was applied. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. The DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery, NIAID, North Bethesda, MD, USA) platform was used for gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses. GO and KEGG were performed using our protein LFQ dataset, and results for significant terms associated with the gene set were selected based on the FDR < 0.05.3. Results 3.1. Mrc1 Deficiency in Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet Affects Bone Marrow Myelopoiesis and Adiposity, Which Results in Dampened Immune-Inflammatory Response in the Circulation To investigate whether mannose receptor deficiency affects the immune cell profile during obesity, we first characterized the circulating immune cell profile for the Mrc1−/− and control WT male mice fed an HFD for 20 weeks with a focus on myeloid populations (gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure S1A–F). The Mrc1−/− mice displayed a significant reduction in neutrophils (Figure 1A) and inflammatory CCR2+ monocyte counts (Figure 1B). Although, the total monocyte numbers were not different between the two experimental groups (Figure 1C). A trend toward the reduction of circulating CD11b+ myeloid cells was also observed (Figure 1D), whereas the counts of eosinophils (Figure 1E) and circulating adaptive immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, were not different (Figure 1F,G). We next investigated whether this profile might be the consequence of changes in the medullary compartment of Mrc1−/− as compared to WT male mice following HFD feeding. To this aim, we profiled different hematopoietic precursor subsets and mature immune cells (cell subsets investigated are presented in Supplementary Figure S2, and the gating strategy used is presented in Supplementary Figure S3A–R) in the bone marrow of the different animal models. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Mrc1 deficiency impact on circulating immune cell subsets and bone marrow hematopoiesis during high-fat diet feeding. Circulating neutrophils (A), infiltrating monocytes (B), monocytes (C), myeloid cells (D), eosinophils (E), lymphocyte B cells, (F) and lymphocyte T cells (G) counts in WT and Mrc1−/− mice fed an HFD for 20 weeks. Earlier hematopoietic progenitors, including long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs, (H)) and short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs, (I)), multipotent progenitors (MPPs, (J)) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs, (K)), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs, (L)), granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs, (M)), and granulocyte progenitors (GPs, (N)). Bone marrow distribution of pre-neutrophils (PNs, (O)), immature neutrophils (Ins, (P)), mature neutrophils (MNs, (Q)), macrophage/dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs, (R)), monocyte progenitors (MOPs, (S)), Ly6Clow monocytes (T) and Ly6Chigh monocytes (U), and macrophages (V) were profiled in bone marrow from WT and Mrc1−/− mice fed with an HFD for 20 weeks. Representative flow cytometry pseudocolor plots (red for higher density of cells, blue for lower) of WT and Mrc1-deficient mice of neutrophil differentiation subpopulations and macrophages are shown in panels (W,X). Representative immunofluorescence acquisition of femur sections stained with perilipin (left) with magnification of the outlined area (right) (Y). Adipocyte distribution per area (Z), mean count of cells per section (AA), and adipocyte area (AB) are shown. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 8–10 mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.The number of early progenitors was similar in WT and Mrc1−/− mice, including that of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs, Figure 1H), short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs, Figure 1I), multipotent progenitors (MPPs, Figure 1J), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs, Figure 1K), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs, Figure 1L), and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs, Figure 1M). Interestingly, the amount of more mature cells, including granulocyte progenitors (GPs, Figure 1N), pre-neutrophils (PNs, Figure 1O), and mature neutrophils (MNs, Figure 1Q, representative plots Figure 1W), were significantly reduced in mice lacking Mrc1 as compared to controls. Macrophage/dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs; Figure 1R), monocyte precursors (MOPs, Figure 1S), and mature Ly6Clow (Figure 1T) and Ly6Chigh (Figure 1U) monocytes were not affected. On the other hand, macrophages identified as Gr-1−CD115−F4/80+SSClow decreased in the bone marrow of Mrc1-deficient mice compared to WT mice (Figure 1V,X). This last trait was commonly associated with compromised retention of hematopoietic stem cells in the niche [21], often as the consequence of altered crosstalk between the stem cell niche and adipocytes within the bone marrow during hematopoiesis [22,23]. To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the content of adipocytes in the bone marrow of Mrc1−/− mice to control mice using Perilipin as an adipocyte marker with immunofluorescence staining (Figure 1Y). Adipocyte content significantly increased in association with Mrc1 deficiency both in terms of cells per area and absolute count (Figure 1Z,AA). The observation of a similar value for adipocyte cell surface area between the experimental groups (Figure 1AB) suggests that an investigation of differences in bone marrow adipogenesis is required to explain the phenotype described above. Altogether, the decreased presence of macrophages, the combination of reduced levels of myeloid precursors and mature cells, and the increased adipocyte content suggest that the lack of Mrc1 could promote a medullary rewiring in mice with diet-induced obesity. This medullary rewiring is reflected in changes to the circulating immune subsets and systemic inflammatory status. To explore this hypothesis, untargeted proteomic analysis of the plasma from the different experimental groups was performed. Out of 4306 proteins identified, 4.4% were downregulated and 3.4% were upregulated in the plasma of obese Mrc1−/− mice compared to that of controls (Figure 2A,B). The different proteomic signature associated with Mrc1 deficiency was confirmed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA, Figure 2C), which showed a cluster clearly separated from that of plasma proteins from WT mice. To better characterize this phenotype, differently abundant proteins were analyzed using the KEGG database to assess enriched pathways in the plasma of Mrc1−/− mice compared to that of WT mice (Figure 2D). Interestingly, ECM-receptor interaction, leukocyte transendothelial migration, chemokine signaling pathway, and platelet activation (FDR < 0.05) displayed a higher number of downregulated proteins (Figure 2E,F) in the plasma from Mrc1−/− mice. These results suggest that the lack of the mannose receptor could affect the modulation of immune cell infiltration. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Plasma proteomics profiling of Mrc1−/−and WT mice fed with an HFD for 20 weeks.

(E) The number of up- and downregulated proteins within the enriched pathways following KEGG database analysis. (F) Hierarchical clustering and heatmap showing relative protein expression values (Z-score transformed LFQ protein intensities) of significantly different proteins between WT and Mrc1−/−mice of the indicated KEGG pathways. (G) Downregulated or upregulated pathways as per Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of plasma proteome profile of Mrc1−/− compared to WT mice. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 8–10 mice per group.Furthermore, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis confirmed the impact of Mrc1 deficiency on the modulation of the immune system function. The impact was shown by inhibited canonical pathways (Z-score based) including hepatic fibrosis signaling, NF-kB signaling, PKCθ signaling in T cells, necroptosis, and increased PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (Figure 2G). Overall, these data suggest that Mrc1 deficiency results in a protective BM phenotype characterized by decreased myelopoiesis and increased presence of quiescence-promoting adipocytes, coupled with changes in plasma proteome associated with a reduced number of pro-inflammatory and tissue-infiltrating leukocytes.3.2. Mrc1 Deficiency in Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet Impacts Immune Infiltration of Metabolic Tissues during Obesity We performed flow cytometry analyses on the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver of WT and Mrc1−/− mice fed with an HFD for 20 weeks to investigate whether the reduced inflammatory and migratory phenotype of myeloid cells in circulation—as suggested by proteomics analysis—was reflected by different recruitment of immune cells in metabolically affected tissues. Interestingly, the mannose receptor deficiency was associated with a significant reduction in macrophages, specifically in monocyte-derived macrophages (Figure 3A–C, gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure S4A–I), within VAT, which suggests a different infiltrating capacity. This reduction was paralleled by a significant decrease in inflammatory CD11c+ macrophages (Figure 3D,F) in the Mrc1−/− mice compared to the controls, which was particularly evident in the subpopulation of macrophages expressing intermediate levels of F4/80 (Figure 3E) that are known to originate from circulating monocytes [24]. A trend toward reduced VAT infiltrating myeloid cells, monocytes, and CD11c+F4/80high macrophages was also observed (Figure 3G–J). This trend was not observed for neutrophils and eosinophils (Figure 3K,L). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Immune cell subset distribution in visceral adipose tissue and liver from Mrc1-deficient and WT mice fed with an HFD for 20 weeks. Macrophages (A), CCR2+ monocyte-derived macrophages (B), and a representative flow cytometry plot of macrophages in WT and Mrc1−/− mice (C) are shown. Inflammatory CD11c+ macrophage count (D) and CD11c+ F4/80int macrophage count (E) in the two experimental groups are shown. A representative flow cytometry plot showing CD11c+ macrophages in WT and Mrc1-deficient mice is shown in panel (F). VAT counts of myeloid cells (G), monocytes (H), CCR2+ infiltrating monocytes (I), CD11c+ F4/80high macrophages (J), neutrophils (K), and eosinophils (L) are shown. Liver myeloid cells (M), monocytes (N) and CCR2+ monocyte-derived macrophages (O), and representative plots showing neutrophils and monocyte distribution in the two experimental groups are presented in (P). Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 5–10 mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.In parallel, liver immunophenotyping (gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure S5A–H) showed decreased levels of myeloid cells (Figure 3M) in Mrc1−/− mice, which was more evident for monocytes (Figure 3N,P) and monocyte-derived macrophages (Figure 3O) but not for other cell subsets (Supplementary Figure S5I–O). Interestingly, although neutrophils were present in a comparable fashion in both experimental groups (Supplementary Figure S5K), histological analysis of the expression of elastase—a marker of neutrophil activation—on liver sections revealed a trend toward reduction in Mrc1−/− mice compared to controls (Supplementary Figure S5P,Q). Such a reduction is in line with a less severe inflammatory phenotype associated with the lack of the mannose receptor.3.3. Immunomodulation in Mrc1−/− Mice Is Associated with Improved Obese Phenotype We compared weight gain in Mrc1−/− and WT mice fed a high-fat diet to evaluate whether the observed differences in the immune phenotype translate into an improved metabolic profile. This comparison revealed a significant reduction in the weight gain of Mrc1−/− mice compared to their WT counterpart (Figure 4A,B), which was in line with a recent report [25]. This difference was not the result of changes in visceral adipose tissue or subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, significant differences were observed in the relative weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the liver (Figure 4C). Nonetheless, the moderate impact of these differences in explaining the reduction of animal weight suggests that Mrc1 deficiency in mice fed an HFD might affect other tissues that were not evaluated in our work. This limitation should be addressed in future studies. Notably, the adipocyte area was not different in the VAT or SCAT from Mrc1−/− and WT mice (Figure 4D–F), but smaller lipid droplets were observed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Figure 4D). These smaller lipid droplets were coupled to significant changes in the gene expression profile of genes associated with BAT function such as Ppara, Pgc1a, Atgl and Ucp1 (Figure 4G). Figure 4.

(J) Dot plot showing fold of enrichment (x-axis) and the –log10 p-value (y-axis) of enriched pathways following KEGG database analysis. Hierarchical clustering and heatmap showing relative protein expression values (Z-score transformed LFQ protein intensities) for proteins with significantly different expression in WT and Mrc1−/− mice (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD (K) and other relevant pathways (L),FDR < 0.05). (M) Glucose tolerance test (GTT) performed at 20 weeks of HFD feeding in WT and Mrc1−/− mice and calculated AUC. (N) Insulin tolerance test (ITT) performed at 20 weeks of HFD feeding in WT and Mrc1−/− mice and calculated AUC. Blood glucose levels are shown. Glycaemia was measured before i.p. glucose or insulin injection (t = 0, baseline values) and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, n = 8–10 mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01.Reduced lipid accumulation was also observed in the liver (Figure 4H, I) prompting us to profile liver proteome. Among 2114 proteins, 344 were downregulated and 363 were upregulated in Mrc1−/− mice (Supplementary Figure S6A,B). Differently abundant proteins were analyzed using the KEGG database to assess enriched pathways (Figure 4J), which were identified as being mainly metabolism related. One of the enriched pathways is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, in which most molecules appear less abundant in association with mannose receptor deficiency (Figure 4K), thus confirming the previous histological analysis. On the other hand, the gene ontology (GO) analysis identified the enrichment of the cellular response to the IL-4 pathway, where proteins are mainly upregulated (Figure 4L). This result suggests the presence of pro-resolutive immune activation, which aligns with an overall downregulation of proteins within the cellular response to the IFN-ƴ pathway [26] and with the reduced infiltration observed by flow cytometry. Reduced steatosis and inflammation pair with improved glucose and insulin tolerance, as shown by more upregulated proteins in the GO cellular response to the insulin stimulus pathway (Figure 4L), as well as a better performance following the glucose tolerance test (GTT, Figure 4M) and an improved trend following insulin tolerance test (ITT, Figure 4N). However, no significant changes were observed in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels (Supplementary Figure S6C,D). Thus, we observed that in mice fed an HFD for 20 weeks, the absence of the mannose receptor leads to a protective BM phenotype and a reduced leukocyte infiltration tendency, which associates with overall protection from obesity-related dysfunctions.4. Discussion Metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with increased hematopoiesis [27] and dysfunctional endothelium, which in turn contribute to disrupting myelopoiesis [17]. This pro-inflammatory hematopoiesis not only aggravates the dysmetabolic condition but also stands as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [28], calling for an investigation of the molecular mechanisms driving this effect. Intriguingly, the soluble mannose receptor has been shown to stimulate tissue macrophage activation towards inflammation, and its deficiency in mice fed an HFD resulted in reduced tissue inflammation and a better metabolic phenotype [25]. However, the use of a whole-body Mrc1 knock-out mouse model has suggested that the wide range in the expression of this receptor [10] would account for additional activities. In this context, we showed that Mrc1 deficiency results in reduced inflammation that might be the consequence of important changes in bone marrow cell signature. Interestingly, Mrc1 is expressed by both macrophages and medullary sinusoidal endothelial cells [14], where its expression increases following the onset of diabetes mellitus within a panel of inflammatory genes [17]. Highly active myelopoiesis observed in dysmetabolic conditions is commonly associated with a systemic immune activation characterized by the increased frequency of blood inflammatory cells and circulating markers of inflammation [29]. In our experimental setting, decreased levels of circulating neutrophils and pro-inflammatory CCR2+ monocytes were indeed associated with the bone marrow phenotype switch in Mrc1-deficient mice. Our work revealed that the lack of the mannose receptor modulates myelopoiesis, thus hampering the enhancement observed in animals fed with an HFD to induce obesity [30]. We demonstrated an important downregulation of myeloid cell production as well as an increased presence of adipocytes. Considering the role of CXCL12 in promoting HSCs quiescence, an increase in adipocytes, a known source of CXCL12, could negatively modulate hematopoiesis by reducing the production of inflammatory cells [22]. As a confirmation, our plasma proteomics analysis showed that the lack of the mannose receptor is paralleled by an overall reduction in leukocyte migration and the tissue infiltration pathways. Notably, changes in glycoprotein catabolism play a critical role in lipoprotein metabolism and cardiometabolic diseases [31]. Therefore, we investigated the immune phenotype of the visceral adipose tissue and liver, as they represent tissues at the crossroad between the metabolic and inflammatory response to obesity [32,33]. In Mrc1-deficient mice, both tissues presented a reduced infiltration of myeloid cells that contributed to an amelioration of the metabolic response during HFD. Indeed, the recruitment of monocytes from circulation to adipose tissue promotes the differentiation of macrophages with a pro-inflammatory phenotype at the cost of anti-inflammatory macrophages [34]. Notably, Mrc1 deficiency appears to counterbalance this effect, limiting the immunometabolic response observed during obesity. This finding seems unexpected given that the Mrc1 receptor is one of the key markers of pro-resolutive macrophages [35]. However, previous studies have shown that the selective depletion of Mrc1+ macrophages improves the systemic insulin response and lipid handling in adipose tissue [36]. These results suggest the presence of parallel mechanisms related to the presence of the mannose receptor that might be associated with the progression of metabolic disorders. Of note, in this study, we used whole-body Mrc1 knock-out mice. Therefore, it is possible that cells other than macrophages contributed to the phenotype observed. Indeed, in addition to macrophages, the mannose receptor is expressed by a variety of cells including non-immune cells, such as sinusoidal endothelial cells [1]. These cells have been implicated in leucocyte trafficking in lymphatic vessels [9]. Therefore, future studies should investigate whether leucocyte trafficking could also play a role in the observed phenotype. In conclusion, we have shown that, during the onset of obesity, Mrc1 impacts hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and release. In addition, Mrc1 deficiency impacts the BM cell profile and reduces the number of activated immune cells in circulation and their infiltration in tissues, thus dampening obesity development.Acknowledgments We thank the Genotoul Anexplo-IPBS platform (Toulouse) for help with animal husbandry.

This approach will be useful for investigating mechanisms by which hematopoietic lineage cells regulate bone metabolism.INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in bone marrow are among the most radiosensitive cells (1). Lethal total-body irradiation (TBI) reduces HSCs to levels insufficient to support immune function and, without intervention, leads to irreversible acute radiation syndrome (ARS) (2). Adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from a donor into an irradiated recipient is an effective cell-based intervention for ARS resulting from lethal TBI (3, 4). The ability of engrafted donor cells to repopulate bone marrow after lethal TBI has been routinely exploited as a powerful research tool in immunology and is used for investigating survival, differentiation, maturation and function of immune cells (5, 6). Bone marrow cell engraftment after TBI has also been used in skeletal biology, most commonly in the subfield of osteoimmunology. As one example, studies leading to improved understanding of the genetic and molecular basis for osteopetrosis, a disease in which defects in differentiation of osteoclasts from hematopoietic lineage precursors lead to poor bone quality, utilized adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from wild-type (WT) mice into mice with inherited osteopetrosis (7). These studies clarified the genetic basis for the disease, demonstrating the utility of the approach. However, there are significant barriers to widespread application of this technique in the field of skeletal biology. Ideally, adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from a normal animal into an irradiated animal, in addition to restoring immune function, would maintain normal bone turnover, growth, architecture, mass and biomechanical competence. However, these goals have proven difficult to achieve; high doses of ionizing radiation negatively influence bone cell differentiation and bone cell activity resulting in suppression of skeletal growth in subadult animals and bone loss in adult animals (8–10). Therefore, radiation-induced alterations in bone complicate interpretation of results in studies using adoptive transfer. ARS in mice induced by acute sub-lethal ionizing radiation is followed by gradual spontaneous recovery of the immune system (11). However, as with lethal TBI, there is suppression of bone accrual as well as accelerated age-related cancellous bone loss (12, 13). Alterations in bone cell number occur in normal growing female mice within 24 h of exposure to sub-lethal γ radiation and cancellous osteopenia becomes apparent within two weeks (10). After lethal TBI, engraftment with unsorted bone marrow was effective in reconstituting host B cells, CD8 T cells and CD4 T cells in spleen and osteoclast precursors in bone marrow with donor-derived cells but was less effective in reconstituting mesenchymal lineage cells in bone marrow (10). Since osteoblasts originate from mesenchymal progenitors, it is possible that failure to restore normal bone mass and architecture after TBI was due to a deficiency in mesenchymal stem cells. However, this possibility is not supported by the observation that osteoblast-lined bone perimeter, mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate and bone formation did not differ between irradiated and control mice nine weeks after TBI. While the possibility that bone microarchitecture would eventually return to normal cannot be ruled out, the high rate of cancellous bone turnover in young adult mice (~100% per month) (14) suggests that a defect in mechanosensing rather than an inability to form sufficient bone is responsible for failure to restore normal bone architecture in a timely manner after irradiation. Thus, donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be unnecessary for successful survival after lethal TBI. However, rapid reconstitution of the mesenchymal cell component of the bone marrow from surviving host MSCs may be important to minimize bone loss. Prior studies suggest that adoptive transfer of a relatively small number (≤5,000) of purified HSCs are sufficient for survival after lethal irradiation of normal mice (15). This underscores the efficacy of HSCs to engraft in bone marrow, their self-renewal capacity and their ability to reconstitute multi-lineage progenitors. The use of highly purified HSCs (instead of unsorted bone marrow cells that contain a heterogeneous mixture of stem cells, multi-potent progenitors, as well as mature blood cells) allows for a better-defined model system without potential confounding factors attributed to large numbers of non-HSCs. However, the impact of adoptive transfer of purified HSCs on the skeleton after lethal TBI is unknown and the value of this approach diminished if the procedure increases bone loss. We therefore performed a series of experiments to evaluate efficacy of adoptive transfer using purified HSCs on animal survival and on bone growth, mass, density, architecture and turnover after lethal TBI.MATERIALS AND METHODS Female C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)1Osb/J (B6.GFP), C57Bl/6 (B6), WBB6F1/JkitW/W-v (KitW/W-v, compound heterzygote), WBB6F1 (wildtype control) and B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (CD45.1 B6) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). In experiment 1, B6.GFP mice (H2b haplotype) which constitutively express GFP in all tissues except erythrocytes and hair were used as bone marrow transplant donors. This allowed for quantitative tracking of donor-derived GFP+ cells in bone marrow in transplant recipients. In experiment 2, we used a B6 congenic strain carrying CD45.1 leukocyte marker (CD45.1 B6) as transplant donors and B6 mice as transplant recipients. Expression of CD45.1 allowed for tracking donor hematopoietic lineage cells as recipient hematopoietic lineage cells express CD45.2 allele. WBB6F1 mice (H2ja/b haplotype) were chosen as bone marrow transplant donors in experiments 3 and 4 and transplant recipients in experiments 1 and 3 because these mice serve as wild-type controls for KitW/W-v mice (16, 17). KitW/W-v mice were chosen as transplant recipients in experiment 4 because these mice have defects in HSC differentiation and, as a result, are more radiosensitive than wild-type mice (18) and because restoration of normal Kit gene expression after adoptive transfer of purified wildtype HSCs into KitW/W-v mice would demonstrate proof of concept of the efficacy of the technique. Mice were housed individually in a temperature- (21–23°C) and light-(12:12 h light-dark schedule) controlled room for the duration of studies. Food (Teklad 8604; Harlan® Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to all animals. Body weight was recorded weekly. The mice were maintained in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and the Use of Laboratory Animals and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon State University approved the experimental protocols. Experiment 1 The purpose of experiment 1 was to compare the effects of transplantation of total bone marrow nucleated cells and purified HSCs on mouse survival, bone architecture and cellular indices of bone turnover. One-month-old female WBB6F1 mice were randomized by weight into one of three treatment groups (n = 4/group): 1. Untreated control; 2. WBB6F1 recipients receiving B6.GFP bone marrow cells (B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1); or 3. WBB6F1 recipients receiving purified B6.GFP HSCs (B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1). The WBB6F1 transplant recipients were lethally irradiated with a single dose of 9 Gy using a 60Co irradiator source (Radiation Center, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon) and reconstituted with either 5 × 106 donor bone marrow cells or 3,000 purified HSCs by injection (200 μl) in the lateral tail vein. The mice were maintained for eight weeks after cell engraftment. To label mineralizing bone, mice were injected with calcein (15 mg/kg; Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice. For tissue collection, the animals were anesthetized using isoflurane and killed by cardiac exsanguination. Tibiae were removed, fixed for 24 h in 10% buffered formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for dual energy absorptiometry (DXA), microcomputed tomography (μCT) and histomorphometric analyses. Bone marrow was flushed from femora using sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and made into single cell suspensions for flow cytometry and ex vivo cell differentiation. Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected for flow cytometry.Experiment 2 The purpose of experiment 2 was to verify the efficacy of bone marrow cells and purified HSCs in reconstituting bone marrow after lethal irradiation in a second mouse strain (B6) using an alternative approach (expression of CD45.1) for determining transplantation efficiency of donor cells. Two-month-old female B6 mice were randomized by weight into one of three treatment groups (n = 4/ group): 1. untreated control; 2. B6 recipients receiving CD45.1 B6 bone marrow cells (CD45.1 B6 BM → B6); or B6 recipients receiving purified CD45.1 B6 HSCs (CD45.1 B6 HSC → B6). The B6 transplant recipients were lethally irradiated with a single 9 Gy dose using a 60Co irradiator source (Radiation Center, Oregon State University) and reconstituted with either 5 × 106 donor bone marrow cells or 3,000 purified HSCs by injection (200 μl) in the lateral tail vein. The mice were maintained for eight weeks after cell engraftment. For tissue collection, the animals were anesthetized using isoflurane and killed by cardiac exsanguination. Bone marrow and spleens were collected and made into single cell suspension for flow cytometry analyses.Experiment 3 The purpose of experiment 3 was to comprehensively evaluate the skeletal response to adoptive transfer of HSCs. One-month-old female WBB6F1 mice were randomized by weight into one of two treatment groups: 1. untreated controls (n = 6); or 2. WBB6F1 recipients receiving purified WBB6F1 HSCs (WBB6F1 HSC → WBB6F1) (n = 9). The transplant recipients received 5 Gy TBI (60Co irradiator source) delivered twice within a 4-h fractionation period, for a total of 10 Gy and reconstituted with 750 purified HSC by injection (200 μl) in the lateral tail vein. The mice were maintained for eight weeks after cell engraftment. As in experiment 1, the mice in experiment 3 were injected with calcein 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice and after sacrifice, tibiae were removed, fixed for 24 h in 10% buffered formalin and stored in 70% ethanol for DXA, μCT and histomorphometric analyses. In addition, whole blood was collected for serum separation, abdominal white adipose tissue as well as uteri were removed and weighed and bone marrow was collected from femora and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for gene expression analyses.Experiment 4 The purpose of experiment 4 was to evaluate the feasibility of using adoptive transfer of purified WBB6F1 HSCs to restore normal Kit expression levels in bone marrow of KitW/W-v mice. The study was performed as described for experiment 3, with the following differences: 1. The transplant recipients were KitW/W-v mice; and 2. The mice were irradiated with 5 Gy delivered either once or twice (within a 4-h interval) prior to reconstitution with 750 purified WBB6F1 HSCs. We tested a lower dose of radiation in this experiment because KitW/W-v mice are radiosensitive. Whole Bone Marrow and HSC Transplantation Bone marrow was flushed from femora of donor mice using sterile PBS, made into a single cell suspension, and red blood cells (RBCs) were removed by incubating with RBC lysis buffer (150 mM NH4Cl, 1 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2). For whole bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow cells were washed and resuspended in PBS to 2.5 × 107 cells/ml, and 200 μl (5 × 106 cells) were injected via tail vein into irradiated recipient mice. HSC isolation was performed as described elsewhere (19). Briefly, lineage-negative (lin-) cells were enriched from bone marrow cells using MACS lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA), where mature lineage-defined immune cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, granulocytes and erythroid cells, were removed from the bone marrow cell preparation. Enriched lin- bone marrow cells were incubated with anti-CD117 (c-kit) and anti-Sca-1 antibodies (eBio-science™ Inc., San Diego, CA). HSCs (defined as Lin Sca-1+c-Kit+) (20, 21) were purified from enriched lin- cells by single cell sorting using MoFlo™ XDP (Beckman Coulter®, Indianapolis, IN) at the Oregon State University Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Facility (Corvallis, OR). Purified HSCs were resuspended in PBS, and 200 μl containing 3,000 donor HSCs (experiments 1 and 2) or 750 donor HSCs (experiments 3 and 4) were injected into the lateral tail vein of each irradiated recipient mouse.Flow Cytometry In experiment 1, the percentage of GFP+ B and T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes was measured by flow cytometry using B-cell-specific (CD19) and T-cell-specific (CD3) antibodies. The percentage of GFP+ bone marrow cells and HSCs in recipient mice was also determined. In experiment 2, the percentage of donor-derived (CD45.1+) T and B cells in spleens were determined using a combination CD45.1- specific, as well as B-cell- and T-cell-specific antibodies. The percentage of CD45.1+ bone marrow cells in recipient mice was also determined using CD45.1 congenic marker. All antibodies were purchased from eBioscience (Thermo Fisher Scientific™ Inc., Waltham, MA). Data were acquired using FACSCalibur™ (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and data analyses were done using Summit software (DakoCytomation, Fort Collins, CO).Ex Vivo Differentiation of Bone Marrow-Derived Osteoclasts and Adipocytes For osteoclast differentiation, bone marrow cells from transplant recipients were cultured in osteoclast differentiation media [Alpha MEM media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 ng/ml MCSF, 50 ng/ml RANKL] (22), and adherent multinucleated osteoclasts were analyzed on day 7. Cytokines were purchased from Peprotech® (Rocky Hill, NJ). Cells were fixed in formalin and analyzed for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and GFP expression. TRAP in osteoclasts was stained using TRAP staining kit (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA). Rabbit anti-GFP Alexa Fluor® 488 antibody (Molecular Probes®, Eugene, OR) was used to amplify GFP fluorescence. DAPI was used as a nuclear counterstain. Cell images were analyzed using Olympus IX71 fluorescent microscope (Olympus®, Waltham, MA). For adipocyte differentiation, adherent bone marrow cells were cultured in Alpha MEM media containing 10% FBS. After 5 days, adherent cells were cultured in adipocyte differentiation media (Alpha MEM media containing 10% FBS, 10 μM dexamethasone, 0.5 μM IBMX and 10 ng/ml insulin) for an additional 10–14 days. Adipocytes were fixed in formalin, stained with Oil Red, followed by GFP and DAPI staining.Densitometry Immediately prior to sacrifice, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane delivered in oxygen and percentage body fat (%), total body bone area (cm2), bone mineral content (g) and bone mineral density (g/cm2) were measured using DXA (PIXImus 2; Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI). Bone area, bone mineral content and bone mineral density were also measured in individual tibiae after excision from the body.Microcomputed Tomography Microcomputed tomography (μCT) was used for 3-dimensional (3D) evaluation of bone volume and architecture. Tibiae were scanned using a Scanco CT40 scanner (ScancoMedical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 × 12 × 12 μm (55 kVp X-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity and 200 ms integration time). The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0–1,000). Entire tibia (cancellous + cortical bone) was evaluated followed by evaluation of cortical bone at the mid-shaft and cancellous bone in the proximal metaphysis. Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. Voxels having a threshold ≥245 (0–1,000) were used to distinguish bone from non bone. For the tibial midshaft, 20 slices (0.24 mm) of bone were evaluated and total cross-sectional tissue volume (cortical and marrow volume, mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), cortical thickness (μm) and polar moment of inertia (mm4, an index of bone strength in torsion) were measured. For the proximal tibial metaphysis, 40 slices (0.48 mm) of cancellous bone were measured, 45 slices (0.54 mm) distal to the growth plate/metaphysis boundary. Irregular manual contouring a few voxels interior to the endocortical surface was used to delineate cancellous from cortical bone. Direct cancellous bone measurements in the tibial metaphysis included cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume, %), trabecular thickness (μm), trabecular number (1/mm), trabecular spacing (μm) and connectivity density (1/mm3).Histomorphometry Proximal tibiae were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and xylene, and embedded undecalcified in modified methyl methacrylate as described elsewhere (23). Coronal sections (4 μm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2065) and affixed to gel coated slides. One section per animal was stained for TRAP and counterstained with toluidine blue and used for cell-based measurements. A second section was left unstained for dynamic histomor-phometry. Histomorphometric data were collected with a 20× objective using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics Inc., Atlanta, GA). The sampling site for the proximal tibial metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm distal to the growth plate and 0.1 mm from cortical bone. Cell-based measurements included osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter, %), osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %), marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area, %), adipocyte density (number of adipocytes/tissue area, number/ mm2), and adipocyte size (μm2). Osteoblasts, osteoclasts and adipocytes were identified as described elsewhere (24). Fluoro-chrome-based measurements of bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single label normalized to bone perimeter, %), mineral apposition rate (the mean distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise each double label divided by the 3-day interlabel interval, μm/day), and bone formation rate adjusted for bone perimeter (bone formation rate/bone perimeter, μm2/μm/year). All bone histomorphometric data are reported using standard 2D nomenclature (23).Serum Biomarkers for Bone Turnover Serum osteocalcin was measured using mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Mountain View, CA). Serum CTX-1 was measured using mouse CTX-1 ELISA kit (MyBiosource, San Diego, CA).Gene Expression Total RNA was isolated from bone marrow in recipient mice using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was prepared using SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Thermo Fisher). The expression of genes related to hematopoiesis, adipogenesis, osteogenesis and osteoporosis were determined using pathway focused RT2 Profiler™ PCR Arrays [(Mouse Hematopoiesis Array (PAMM-054Z), Mouse Adipogenesis Array (PAMM-049Z), Mouse Osteogenesis Array (PAMM-026Z) and Mouse Osteoporosis Array (PAMM-170Z)] according to the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAGEN®, Carlsbad, CA). Kit expression was determined using Kit-specific RT2 qPCR Primer Assay (QIAGEN). Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH and relative quantification was determined by ΔΔCt method using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software version 3.5 (QIAGEN) and SDS RQ Manager (for Kit qPCR) (Applied Biosystems®, Foster City, CA).Statistics Mean values for bone parameters were compared between lethally irradiated (9 Gy) control mice and mice transplanted with bone marrow or HSCs using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test, with t tests or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests used to make pairwise comparisons. A modified F test was used when variances were distinct, with Welch’s two-sample t test used for two-group comparisons (25). T tests or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare control mice to mice receiving 2 × 5 Gy doses. Goodness-of-fit assessment was based on dotplots, Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots and Anderson-Darling tests of normality. The Benjamini and Hochberg (26) method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. All data are presented as mean ± SE. Data analysis was performed using R version 3.2.2.RESULTS Experiment 1 In experiment 1 we compared the efficacy of adoptive transfer of unsorted bone marrow cells and purified HSCs from GFP-expressing donor mice on animal survival, hematopoietic lineage cell reconstitution, mesenchymal lineage cell reconstitution, and bone mass, architecture and cellular indices of bone turnover after exposure to 9 Gy. All irradiated transplant recipients had successful engraftment with 100% survival for the duration of the experiment. HSCs give rise to cells of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages, in which the lymphoid lineage is composed primarily of B and T lymphocytes. The efficiency of lymphoid reconstitution was evaluated by tracking donor-derived GFP+ B and T cells in transplant recipients. As expected, GFP+ B and T cells were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes of the recipients (Fig. 1A and B). The frequency of these cells did not differ between recipients receiving total bone marrow or HSCs. GFP+ cells were also readily detected in bone marrow; the frequency of GFP+ cells did not differ between recipients receiving total bone marrow or HSCs (Fig. 1C). FIG. 1.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showing percentage of CD45.1+ B cells and CD45.1+ T cells in spleen (panels D and E, respectively) and percentage of CD45.1+ cells in bone marrow (panel F) eight weeks after adoptive transfer of unsorted bone marrow cells (B6.CD45.1 BM → B6, BM → WT) or purified HSCs (B6.CD45.1 HSC → B6, HSC → WT). Data are mean ± SE. N = 4/group.The effects of treatment on reconstitution of the myeloid compartment in transplant recipients are shown in Fig. 2. Since osteoclasts are derived from myeloid progenitors, reconstitution of the myeloid compartment can be verified by examining GFP expression of bone marrow-derived osteoclasts. Osteoclasts differentiated using bone marrow from transplant recipients (unsorted bone marrow cells or HSCs) were all GFP+ (Fig. 2A). In contrast, bone marrow-derived adipocytes (mesenchymal origin) were negative for GFP expression (Fig. 2B). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Expression of GFP+ osteoclasts (panel A) and adipocytes (panel B) cultured from bone marrow of control mice or transplant recipients receiving unsorted BM cells (B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1, BM → WT) or purified HSCs (B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1, HSC → WT) eight weeks after adoptive transfer. The left-side column shows TRAP-positive osteoclasts in panel A and oil red-positive adipocytes in panel B. The middle column shows DAPI nuclear stain of all cells in the field of image. The right-side column shows GFP expression in cells. Note that osteoclasts are GFP+ after adoptive transfer of either unsorted bone marrow cells (B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1, BM → WT) or purified HSCs (B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1, HSC → WT). In contrast, oil redpositive adipocytes are GFP- with both treatments, whereas oil red-negative cells surrounding the adipocytes are GFP+.The effects of treatment on tibial length, area, bone mineral content, bone mineral density and bone volume, and on cortical bone architecture in the tibial diaphysis, are shown in Fig. 3. Tibial length (Fig. 3A) and bone volume (Fig. 3E) were lower and bone area (Fig. 3B) tended to be lower (P < 0.1) in B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 and B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice. Bone mineral content (Fig. 3C) tended to be lower (P < 0.1) in B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 mice and was lower in B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to controls. Bone mineral density (Fig. 3D) tended to be lower (P < 0.1) in B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice. Significant differences in bone mineral density were not detected between B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 and control mice. Cross-sectional volume (Fig. 3F) tended to be lower (P < 0.1) and polar moment of inertia (Fig. 3J) was lower in B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 and B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice. Cortical volume (Fig. 3G) tended to be lower (P < 0.1) in B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 mice and was lower in B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice. Marrow volume (Fig. 3H) was lower in B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 mice and tended to be lower (P < 0.1) in B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to controls. Significant differences in cortical thickness (Fig. 3I) were not detected with treatment. Significant differences between B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 and B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 mice were not detected for any of the end points evaluated. FIG. 3.

Data are mean ± SE. N = 4/group. aDifferent from control, P < 0.05; a*different from control, P < 0.1.The effects of treatment on cancellous bone architecture and indices of bone resorption, bone formation and bone marrow adiposity in the proximal tibial metaphysis are shown in Fig. 4. Cancellous bone volume fraction (Fig. 4A) tended to be lower (P < 0.1) in B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 and B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice. Trabecular number (Fig. 4C) tended to be lower (P < 0.1) and trabecular spacing (Fig. 4D) tended to be higher in B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 compared to control mice. Significant differences in trabecular number or trabecular spacing were not detected between B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 and control mice. Significant differences in trabecular thickness (Fig. 4B) and connectivity density (Fig. 4E) were not detected with treatment. Significant differences in osteoclast perimeter (Fig. 4F), osteoblast perimeter (Fig. 4G), mineralizing perimeter (Fig. 4H), mineral apposition rate (Fig. 4I) and bone formation rate (Fig. 4J) were not detected with treatment. Significant differences in marrow adiposity (Fig. 4K) and adipocyte size (Fig. 4M) were likewise not detected with treatment. However, adipocyte density (Fig. 4L) tended to be greater (P < 0.1) in B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice. Significant differences between B6.GFP BM → WBB6F1 and B6.GFP HSC → WBB6F1 mice were not detected for any of the end points evaluated. The effects of treatment on cancellous bone architecture in the tibial metaphysis can be appreciated in Fig. 4N. FIG. 4.

Representative μCT images of cancellous bone in the proximal tibia metaphysis are shown in panel N. Data are mean ± SE. N = 4/group. aDifferent from control, P < 0.05; a*different from control, P < 0.1.Experiment 2 In experiment 2 we compared the efficacy of adoptive transfer of unsorted bone marrow cells and purified HSCs from CD45.1 B6 congenic donor mice on animal survival and hematopoietic lineage cell reconstitution in B6 mice. Similar to experiment 1, bone marrow cells and purified HSCs were highly effective in reconstituting hematopoietic lineage cells in spleen and bone marrow with donor cells expressing CD45.1 (Fig. 1D–F).Experiment 3 In experiment 3 we determined the efficacy of adoptive transfer of 750 purified WBB6F1 HSCs on body composition and bone in WBB6F1 recipients after 2 × 5 Gy irradiations. Despite the extremely low number of HSCs transplanted, 6 out of 9 irradiated transplant recipients had successful engraftment, surviving for the duration of the experiment. Three irradiated transplant recipients lost weight and died 1.5 weeks postirradiation/transplantation due to unsuccessful HSC engraftment. Lethality was not observed in experiment 1 with 3,000 cells or in experiment 4 with 750 cells. These observations suggest that technical difficulty in accurately delivering a very small number of cells in the tail vein may decrease the likelihood for successful engraftment. The effects of treatment on body composition and on tibial length, area, bone mineral content, bone mineral density and bone volume of successfully engrafted mice are shown in Table 1. Significant differences in body weight, abdominal white adipose tissue weight, percentage body fat, and total body bone area, bone mineral content or bone mineral density were not detected with treatment. However, uterine weight was lower in WBB6F1HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice. Significant differences were not detected with treatment in any of the tibia end points measured. TABLE 1.

The effects of treatment on cortical bone architecture in the tibial diaphysis and on cancellous bone architecture, indices of bone turnover and marrow adiposity in the proximal tibial metaphysis, are shown in Fig. 5. No significant differences were detected with treatment in diaphyseal cross-sectional volume (Fig. 5A), cortical volume (Fig. 5B) or polar moment of inertia (Fig. 5E). However, marrow volume (Fig. 5C) was lower and cortical thickness (Fig. 5D) was higher in WBB6F1 HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice. No significant differences were detected with treatment in bone volume fraction (Fig. 5F), trabecular thickness (Fig. 5G), trabecular number (Fig. 5H) and connectivity density (Fig. 5J). Trabecular spacing (Fig. 5I) tended to be higher (P < 0.1) in WBB6F1 HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice. No significant differences were detected with treatment in osteoclast perimeter (Fig. 5K), CTX (an index of global bone resorption) (Fig. 5S), osteoblast perimeter (Fig. 5L), mineralizing perimeter (Fig. 5M) and osteocalcin (an index of global bone turnover) (Fig. 5T). However, mineral apposition rate (Fig. 5N) and bone formation rate (Fig. 5O) were greater in WBB6F1 HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to control mice.

Very few genes had altered expression in the HSC transplant recipients. Among all the genes examined, 7% of genes associated with hematopoiesis, 8% of genes associated with osteogenesis/osteoporosis and 5% of genes associated with adipogenesis were differentially expressed in WBB6F1 HSC → WBB6F1 mice compared to controls.

Experiment 4 In experiment 4 we determined the efficacy of adoptive transfer of purified WBB6F1 HSCs on survival, body composition and bone parameters in radiosensitive KitW/W-v recipient mice. Despite the extremely low number of HSCs transplanted, all of the irradiated transplant recipients had successful engraftment, surviving for the duration of the experiment. As expected, mRNA levels for Kit were lower in KitW/W-v mice compared to WBB6F1 mice and this disparity was corrected after adoptive transfer of purified HSCs from WBB6F1 mice (Fig. 6A). FIG. 6.

KitW/W-v mice receiving 5 Gy had higher body weight but lower percentage body fat and lower uterine weight compared to control (nonirradiated) KitW/W-v mice. However, significant differences in tibial length, area, bone mineral content, bone mineral density and bone volume, and in cortical bone architecture in the tibial diaphysis were not detected with treatment. In contrast, KitW/W-v mice receiving 10 Gy (2 × 5 Gy) gained less weight, had lower white adipose tissue weight, uterine weight and percentage body fat and had smaller bones with altered cortical architecture compared to control (nonirradiated) KitW/W-v mice. Regarding bone, tibial length, area, bone mineral content and bone volume were lower in KitW/W-v mice receiving 10 Gy (2 × 5 Gy) compared to controls. In addition, cross-sectional volume, cortical volume, marrow volume and polar moment of inertia were lower in the irradiated KitW/W-v mice. Significant differences in tibia bone mineral density and cortical thickness were not detected with 10 Gy (2 × 5 Gy). TABLE 3.

Both methods of adoptive transfer were effective in reconstituting osteoclast precursors from donor cells but neither method successfully reconstituted bone marrow adipocyte precursors from donor cells and neither method prevented radiation-associated suppression of linear bone growth or reduction in bone volume. WBB6F1 mice engrafted with 750 HSCs after fractionated exposures (2 × 5 Gy) had near normal bone mass and microarchitecture eight weeks after engraftment. However, this dose reduced weight gain and induced osteopenia in radiosensitive KitW/W-v mice. Turner et al. (10) reported that sublethal 6 Gy TBI resulted in a rapid reduction in bone marrow cell density in female B6 mice, reaching a minimum value of 14% of normal 3 days postirradiation. Spontaneous, partial recovery of bone marrow cell density occurred by 14 days postirradiation. In a similar study performed in male B6 mice, Green et al. (13) reported that neither immune cell populations nor cancellous bone volume fraction returned to normal two months after sublethal 5 Gy gamma irradiation. In the current study, bone marrow cell density, bone turnover and most measured indices of cortical bone architecture and immune cell populations did not differ from nonirradiated control mice two months after lethal TBI in bone marrow-engrafted mice. Additionally, adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells resulted in quantitative replacement of host bone marrow hematopoietic cells with donor cells (10). However, this intervention was ineffective in preventing radiation-induced suppression of tibial growth, or in preventing cancellous bone loss from the appendicular (tibia) and axial (lumbar vertebra) skeleton. Importantly, the skeletal response to adoptive transfer of purified HSCs and unsorted bone marrow cells was similar, alleviating the concern that osteopenia would be exaggerated in irradiated mice not receiving donor mesenchymal cells. Exposure to high-dose ionizing radiation results in cortical as well as cancellous osteopenia in growing mice but the magnitude of response and cellular mechanisms differ between cortical and cancellous bone. Radiation slows cortical bone accrual, due to decreased longitudinal bone growth and decreased apposition of bone onto the periosteal surface, whereas it accelerates age-related cancellous bone loss (10, 13). The latter is caused by an imbalance in bone turnover due to bone resorption exceeding bone formation, and can be dramatic in the femur metaphysis of young adult mice because turnover rates can exceed 100% per month (14). Osteoblasts are derived from MSCs (27). Despite a normal osteoblast-lined bone perimeter after engraftment with unsorted bone marrow cells, host mesenchymal cells in bone marrow were only partially replaced by donor cells (10). This may be because MSCs are less radiosensitive than HSCs (28, 29). Alternatively, there is evidence that MSCs do not readily migrate to bone marrow after tail vein administration (30). In contrast to normal mice, KitW/W-v mice are devoid of adipocytes in long bones and lumbar vertebrae, and adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from WBB6F1 mice into KitW/W-v mice does not result in fat infiltration into bone marrow (17, 19). Thus, adoptive transfer of MSCs may be dispensable for both mouse survival and normalization of bone formation after lethal TBI. In support of this, engraftment with 3,000 purified HSCs was as effective as engraftment with 5 × 106 unsorted bone marrow cells in maintaining normal bone formation after lethal TBI in WBB6F1 and in B6 mice. Fat infiltration into bone marrow is a common side effect of high-dose TBI (24). In some studies, increased marrow adipose tissue was associated with one or more detrimental skeletal effects, including decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption and bone loss (31). However, causality was not established and not all studies report a negative association between bone marrow adiposity and bone turnover balance. In the current studies, the trend for increased marrow adipocyte density in mice receiving lethal TBI did not result in reduced osteoblast-lined bone perimeter or bone formation after engraftment of unsorted bone marrow cells. In the current study, osteoclasts generated in vitro using bone marrow of WBB6F1 mice obtained after adoptive transfer of either unsorted bone marrow or purified HSCs from GFP-expressing donor mice were uniformly GFP positive. We anticipated this finding because osteoclasts are members of the monocyte/macrophage lineage derived from HSCs (32). In contrast, adipocytes differentiated from bone marrow from the same mice were GFP negative. Adipocytes are derived from MSCs (33). Based on these findings we conclude that: 1. Sufficient numbers of MSCs survive 9 Gy irradiation to maintain or increase marrow adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis; and 2. Adoptive transfer of purified HSCs selectively reconstitutes hematopoietic lineage cells. This property could be used to great advantage in genetic studies directed at evaluating the signaling pathways by which hematopoietic cells regulate bone growth and turnover. As proof of concept, we demonstrated restoration of normal Kit gene expression in bone marrow of KitW/W-v mice after engraftment with only 750 purified HSCs from WBB6F1 mice. Sublethal ARS in mice is associated with transient increases in bone formation and bone resorption. Increases in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were noted within 1 day of TBI (10). Bone lining cells are post-mitotic osteoblast lineage cells located directly adjacent to inactive bone surfaces and are much more numerous than osteoblasts. Hormones and growth factors, such as parathyroid hormone, growth hormone and basic fibroblast growth factor, can quickly activate bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype and generate bone matrix (34–36). Osteoclast precursors, although derived from bone marrow HSCs, leave bone marrow and have a relatively long (days to weeks) lifespan in circulation (37). Whereas proliferating cells are highly sensitive to radiation, post-mitotic bone cells are resistant to radiation-induced cell death. Activation of bone lining cells and osteoclast formation from circulating osteoclast precursors represents post-mitotic cell differentiation. Therefore, proliferation would not be essential for the transient increase in osteoblast-lined perimeter and osteoclast-lined perimeter immediately after TBI (10, 38, 39). Long-term maintenance of normal bone turnover requires continuous replacement of osteoblasts that become osteo-cytes or bone lining cells, or undergo apoptosis and osteoclasts that undergo apoptosis. Reconstitution of donor-derived GFP+ osteoclast precursors in bone marrow was apparent 9 weeks after engraftment with unsorted bone marrow cells (10). The differentiation studies performed here confirm successful reconstitution of donor-derived osteoclast precursors after engraftment with unsorted bone marrow cells or purified HSCs. At the gene level, there were only minor differences between control mice and mice receiving purified HSCs (WBB6F1 HSC → WBB6F1) in expression levels of more than 300 genes in tibia related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function, adipogenesis and hematopoie-sis. This finding provides additional evidence that after engraftment with B6 HSCs, the bone marrow environment in the engrafted animals resembles that of untreated WBB6F1 controls. Studies performed to optimize TBI prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice indicate that improved survival and reconstitution of hematopoietic cells is achieved using fractionated radiation (40). The current studies suggest that fractionating TBI also has a bone-sparing effect. We did not investigate the effects of lethal TBI on bone metabolism in the absence of adoptive transfer of donor cells. Therefore, the precise contribution of donor HSCs to the skeletal radiation response is unknown. It would be difficult to interpret the results of an experiment in which radiation was delivered without follow-up treatment because bone metabolism is strongly influenced by nutritional status, and the initial indicator symptoms of ARS include reduced appetite and weight loss. Localized 20 Gy irradiation to the right distal femur and proximal tibia in rats has resulted in weight loss and cancellous bone loss in the irradiated as well as the contralateral limb, emphasizing the importance of indirect effects of radiation on bone health (41). For this reason, it may be necessary to reduce the radiation dose used to deplete hematopoietic cells in radiosensitive mice. In the current studies, when Kit- deficient KitW/W-v mice, a radiosensitive strain (42, 43), were inoculated with 750 HSCs, they survived 2 × 5 Gy exposures, but experienced reduced weight gain, osteopenia and lower serum osteocalcin levels compared to untreated mice. However, these negative effects were attenuated in KitW/W-v mice after 5 Gy irradiation. Notably, adoptive transfer of purified HSCs after 5 Gy irradiation was as effective as 2 × 5 Gy irradiations in restoring Kit gene expression in bone marrow. In summary, we describe an approach for reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment of bone marrow by engrafting purified HSCs after fractionated lethal TBI. This approach will be valuable for studies in skeletal biology because near normalization of bone marrow function is achieved with minimal TBI-induced collateral damage to bone mass and architecture.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNX12AL24) and the National Institutes of Health (AR060913).REFERENCES 1.van Bekkum DW.

    "title": "Effect of leptin deficiency on the skeletal response to hindlimb unloading in adult male mice.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6597714/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have less bone than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to weight bearing. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were individually housed at 32 °C (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then randomized into one of 4 groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU and the results analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. In summary, leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU-induced osteopenia in male mice, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting. Subject terms: Physiology, Endocrinology",
    "introduction": "Introduction Leptin, a hormone produced primarily by adipocytes, serves as a messenger in a feedback loop between adipose tissue and the hypothalamus and contributes to regulation of energy intake and energy expenditure1,2. ob/ob mice, homozygous for loss of function mutation in the obesity gene (ob), are unable to generate leptin1,2. ob/ob mice become morbidly obese due to the combined influence of increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure1. The physiological actions of leptin extend beyond energy metabolism and include regulation of skeletal growth and maturation3–6; a detailed review of the effects of leptin on the skeleton can be found in Reid et al.7 Leptin stimulates endochondral ossification and osteoblast differentiation and activity in long bones of the lower limb, where the hormone also inhibits differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to adipocytes8–10. Compared to wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice have smaller craniofacial dimensions11, shorter long bones12,13 and, when evaluated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), have lower total body and femur bone area, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD)8. Based on microcomputed tomographic (µCT) and histomorphometric analyses, ob/ob mice have bone- and bone compartment-specific alterations in cortical and cancellous bone mass and architecture8,14, and greatly increased levels of marrow adipose tissue (MAT)15,16. Whereas, total and cortical bone mass is normal or lower in ob/ob mice, cancellous bone mass, depending upon skeletal site and age, can be lower, normal, or higher7. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reverses skeletal abnormalities in ob/ob mice17. While the literature strongly supports an important role of leptin in increasing bone accrual prior to peak bone mass and in maintaining normal bone turnover, the hormone likely has additional, less well characterized, actions on bone metabolism. In this regard, there is conflicting evidence that leptin plays a role in mediating skeletal response to changes in body weight. Kapur et al. reported leptin signaling to be a negative modulator of bone mechanosensitivity18. Specifically, a loading strain of ∼2,500 μϵ, which was insufficient to produce a bone formation response in B6 mice, significantly increased bone formation parameters in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. However, other studies suggest that leptin is required for full expression of positive effects of weight on bone mass. For example, total femur mass is positively associated with body weight in WT mice19. Also, mice heterozygous for the ob gene (ob/+ mice) have adipocytes with a reduced capacity to generate leptin but have near normal leptin levels due to compensatory increases in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass19. ob/+ mice exhibit an association between body weight and bone mass nearly identical to WT mice. In contrast, weight differences in ob/ob mice have a positive but quantitatively smaller effect on bone mass20. Thus, it is possible that leptin is not required for skeletal adaptation to changes in weight but the hormone may enhance the magnitude of response by increasing sensitivity of bone to external loads. If leptin enhances the skeletal response to changes in magnitude of ground reaction forces during weight bearing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice would be predicted to exhibit an attenuated bone response to reduced skeletal loading. To test this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of male WT and ob/ob mice housed at thermoneutral to hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based model for microgravity21. HU unweights the hindlimbs, facilitating investigation of the role of leptin in the skeletal response to changes in weight21. The study was performed at thermoneutral because leptin plays an important role in thermoregulation and mild cold stress induced by conventional room temperature housing results in rapid premature cancellous bone loss in mice22,23. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance to establish the main effects (genotype and skeletal loading status) and their interaction.",
    "methods": "Methods The animals were maintained in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the experimental protocol. Four-week-old male C57BL/6J (WT, n = 20) mice and B6.Lepob/ob (ob/ob, n = 20) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and single-housed in a 32 °C room for the duration of the experiment. Housing mice at 32 °C (thermoneutral temperature) minimizes resting energy expenditure74,75 and prevents premature cancellous bone loss associated with cold stress induced by sub-thermoneutral housing49. Water was provided ad libitum to all animals for the duration of study. ob/ob mice were pair-fed to WT mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age to minimize differences in weight gain16. At 16 weeks of age, the mice were randomized by body weight into one of four treatment groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU. Immediately prior to HU, animals were given a declomycin injection (15 mg/kg; sc). The mice were unloaded for 2 weeks as described21. In brief, HU mice were placed in a restraint device, where the tail was cleaned with ethanol-soaked gauze and sprayed with a tincture of benzoin. A thin piece of traction tape was looped through a large paper clip, and then pressed along the sides of the mouse’s tail. Filament tape was wrapped around the tail in two locations to secure the traction tape: the base of the tail and 2.5 cm caudal. The paperclip end was looped through the clasp secured on the unloading apparatus. Mice were positioned in a 30° head-down tilt. During unloading, the ob/ob HU group and control groups of both genotypes were pair-fed to the WT HU group. The fluorochrome calcein (15 mg/kg; sc) was administered at 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and terminated using decapitation. Blood was collected from the trunk following decapitation. Serum was stored at −80 °C. Femora and 5th lumbar vertebrae from each mouse were placed in formalin for 24-hour fixation, then stored at 4 °C in 70% ethanol. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g) and seminal vesicle weight (g) were recorded at necropsy. Blood chemistry Blood glucose was measured using a glucometer (Life Scan, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) immediately following decapitation. Serum corticosterone (ng/ml) and osteocalcin (ng/ml) were measured using a mouse Corticosterone ELISA kit obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) and a mouse Gla-osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA kit obtained from Clontech (Takara Bio Inc Shiga, Japan), respectively. Densitometry Total femur bone mineral content (BMC, g), bone area (cm2), and bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2) were measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Piximus 2, Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Micro-computed tomography µCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of total femur bone volume (mm3), femur length (mm), and cortical and cancellous bone architecture. Femora were scanned using a Scanco µCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 µm × 12 µm × 12 µm (55 kVp x-ray voltage, 145 µA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0–1000). Cortical bone was evaluated in the femoral diaphysis and cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis (Fig. 3). Assessment of cortical bone in the femur diaphysis began 60% down the midshaft from the femoral head and consisted of 20 slices (240 µm in length). Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from the marrow cavity. All cortical slices were visually examined for evidence of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex and manually removed when present. Direct cortical bone measurements included total cross-sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (µm). Polar moment of inertia (mm4) was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Assessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540 µm in length) proximal to the growth plate, and included 40 slices (480 µm in length) of cancellous bone. The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis (31 ± 1 slices) and 5th lumbar vertebral body (149 ± 1 slices). Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, 1/mm3), structure model index (an architectural index defining bone as plate-like or rod-like with values ranging from 0 to 3, respectively), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, µm), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, 1/mm) and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, µm). Histomorphometry The histological methods used have been previously described in detail76. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene, then embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Sections, 4 µm thick, were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and affixed to slides with a dried pre-coated 1% gelatin solution. Slides were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and used for cell-based measurements. Mounted unstained slides were used for measurements of fluorochrome labels. All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. Static (cell-based) histological measurements include osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), and adipocyte size (µm2). Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by cuboidal cells adjacent to a thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase-positive (stained red) cytoplasm. Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing77. Fluorochrome-based measurements of cancellous bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: perimeter covered with double label plus half single label, normalized to bone perimeter, %), mineral apposition rate (the distance between double calcein labels, divided by the 3 day interlabel period, µm/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate expressed per bone perimeter (µm2/µm/y). Retained declomycin label (single label perimeter/tissue area; mm/mm2) in the distal femur metaphysis was measured as a dynamic index of bone resorption. This method is based on the premise that treatment groups did not differ in bone formation (and as such fluorochrome label incorporation) prior to HU35 and that differences measured at the study termination reflect the effect of treatment on resorption of the fluorochrome-labeled bone78. Statistical analysis Means were compared between genotype and treatment groups using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When significant interactions were present, t-tests were used to make two-group comparisons. When non-significant interactions were present, group comparisons were made from two-way ANOVA with main effects for genotype and treatment. The required conditions for valid use of t-tests and ANOVA were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance and the Anderson-Darling test of normality. When the assumption of equal variance was violated, Welch’s two-sample t-test was used for two-group comparisons79. When the normality assumption was violated, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for two-group comparisons. Methods for maintaining false discovery rate at 5% were used to adjust for multiple comparisons80. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Data analysis was performed using RStudio version 0.98.1083.",

    "discussion": "Discussion We evaluated the skeletal response to HU in leptin-deficient ob/ob male mice. Based on the observation that leptin deficiency attenuates the positive association between body weight and bone mass (e.g., more weight gain is required in ob/ob mice compared to WT mice to achieve a comparable increase in bone mass), we hypothesized that ob/ob mice would exhibit diminished bone loss in response to HU. However, contrary to our expectations, the magnitude of HU-induced osteopenia in ob/ob mice in femur, a weight bearing bone, was virtually indistinguishable from that of WT mice. In concordance with previous studies in WT mice, cancellous bone loss in HU mice housed at thermoneutral was due to increased bone resorption. The increase in bone resorption was due, at least in part, to increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter24. Leptin has differential effects on osteoclast number and activity in weight-bearing mice. ob/ob mice have normal or increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter25,26, indicating that the hormone is not required for osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, subcutaneous administration of leptin attenuates ovariectomy- and HU-induced bone loss in rats by reducing osteoclast number3,27. On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest reduced osteoclast activity in ob/ob mice. Specifically, ob/ob mice have low serum levels of CTX, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption20,26. In spite of elevated osteoclast-lined bone perimeter, resorption of declomycin is diminished in femurs of ob/ob mice16. Furthermore, ob/ob mice are resistant to polyethylene particle-induced osteolysis28. Finally, ob/ob mice have impaired ability to remodel the calcified cartilage network in growing femur, leading to pathological retention of cartilage during skeletal maturation10,16,26. In the present study, bone resorption was increased in femur metaphysis in ob/ob and WT mice in response to HU. In support, we observed an increase in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. Furthermore, we observed decreases in cancellous bone volume fraction and fluorochrome label retention. Specifically, declomycin label given at the start of the study was lower after two weeks of HU compared to weight-bearing mice, indicating greater resorption of fluorochrome labeled bone occurred with HU. This association between unloading and label loss is in agreement with previous spaceflight and HU studies in rats29. HU for two weeks had no significant effect on body composition in WT or ob/ob mice. This is important because changes in weight could independently influence bone turnover balance30. Thus, contrary to our expectation, skeletal unloading enhanced bone resorption in leptin-deficient mice. Reduced bone formation contributes to development of osteopenia in growing rodents during microgravity (spaceflight) and simulated microgravity (HU)31,32. However, suppression of bone formation is bone compartment-specific. In HU mice, cortical bone formation is suppressed33, but this is not necessarily the case for cancellous skeletal sites24. In the present study, osteoblast perimeter and bone formation rate were not reduced in distal femur in WT or ob/ob mice during HU. Taken together, these observations suggest that HU results in cancellous bone loss in the distal femur metaphysis because resorption increases to levels that exceed the prevailing level of bone formation. In addition to femur, we evaluated the respective effects of leptin deficiency and HU on lumbar vertebra. Cancellous bone loss occurs in lumbar vertebra in rodents subjected to microgravity34 and the bone loss is due, at least in part, to increased bone resorption35. Femurs experience high levels of ground reaction forces in response to weight bearing, and these forces are abolished by HU. Lumbar vertebrae do not generally bear weight in mice. However, lumbar vertebrae are load bearing and HU alters the orientation of the vertebral column to the gravitational vector, changing the direction of the load36. Similar to femur, leptin deficiency did not prevent HU-induced cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra. While there were no genotype-specific differences in magnitude of cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra of HU mice, the bone loss in WT mice was due to a combination of decreased trabecular thickness and trabecular number, whereas the bone loss in ob/ob mice was due to decreased trabecular thickness only. Therefore, minor genotype-specific changes in bone microarchitecture accompanied changes in bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebrae following HU. Spaceflight studies in rodents report lower circulating testosterone levels following spaceflight and ground-based HU studies in rodents report lower seminal vesicle weight37–42. In the present study, HU reduced seminal vesicle weight in both genotypes, indicating lower testosterone levels. Lower testosterone levels potentially contribute to elevated bone resorption and cancellous bone loss43. However, in spite of gonadal insufficiency, leptin deficiency typically results in a low turnover skeletal phenotype in ob/ob mice of both sexes44. The precise role of androgens in mediating the action of leptin on bone is unknown but antagonism of estrogen receptor signaling was largely dispensable for leptin’s actions in female ob/ob mice44. The present results, identifying similar bone loss in HU WT and HU ob/ob mice, suggest that preexisting hypogonadism in male ob/ob mice did not have a major influence on the magnitude of bone loss following HU. Compared to WT mice, MAT levels were approximately 10x greater in ob/ob mice. In concordance with prior work15,16,45, the increase was due to a combination of more numerous and larger adipocytes. HU did not alter adipocyte number or size, findings that contrast with an increase in MAT reported in rats following either spaceflight46 or HU47 and a previous HU study by Hino et al. in male B6 mice48. However, the present findings are concordant with a HU study performed in male WBB6F1/J mice housed at thermoneutral24. Hino et al.48 performed their study in 10-week-old mice housed at 24 °C, which is well below thermoneutral. This may be important because sub-thermoneutral housing reduces bone marrow adiposity in B6 mice49 and there is accumulating evidence that mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing impacts experimental results50. MAT levels are often (but not always) negatively associated with osteoblast number and bone mass and are increased in humans following long-duration bed rest and in rodents following spaceflight and in some skeletal disuse models9,24,35,51–55. Osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and some researchers have concluded that adipocyte differentiation impairs osteoblast differentiation35. Furthermore, adipokines produced by MAT have the potential to increase bone resorption56–58. Thus, high levels of MAT in mice could theoretically diminish the skeletal response to mechanical loading by at least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, impairment of osteoblast differentiation and stimulation of osteoclast activity. Despite greatly increased levels of MAT in distal femur metaphysis of ob/ob mice, the mice did not differ in cancellous bone volume fraction from WT mice. There were also negligible differences between the two genotypes in cortical or cancellous bone responses to HU. Taken together, these findings add to a growing list of studies that contradict a deterministic model where increased MAT levels invariably negatively affect bone metabolism59. These findings also fail to support a model where adipokines produced by MAT contribute to HU-induced bone loss. Cancellous bone volume fraction in femur in ob/ob mice has been variably reported to be lower14, equivalent (present study), or higher17 than in age-matched WT mice. In our experience, cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis in conventionally-housed (room temperature) mice declines with age in both WT and ob/ob mice, but the rate of decline is greater in WT mice. Impaired osteoclast activity in ob/ob mice provides a plausible explanation for slower age-related bone loss as well as reported differences in their skeletal phenotype. Leptin deficiency results in a variety of physical and metabolic changes that could influence osteoclast activity. Metabolically, ob/ob mice have impaired thermoregulation, are hypogonadal and hyperphagic, and often have elevated glucose, insulin, and glucocorticoid levels16. In the present study, we limited but did not fully eliminate the contribution of metabolic differences by housing ob/ob mice at thermoneutral and decreasing their food intake to that of WT mice. ob/ob mice preferentially gain fat mass and there is evidence that lean mass contributes more to the positive effect of weight on the skeleton than fat mass30. ob/ob mice are sarcopenic, and Hamrick and colleagues have reported a strong linear association between bone mineral content and quadriceps mass in ob/ob and WT mice14. Additional studies are required to evaluate the comparative effect of muscle atrophy on the skeleton of WT and ob/ob mice in response to HU. As expected, leptin deficiency and HU each resulted in higher corticosterone levels. Although glucocorticoids influence bone metabolism, Zerath et al.60 reported that microgravity-induced cancellous osteopenia occurred independent of endogenous corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, elevation of endogenous corticosterone levels did not replicate the skeletal changes observed in HU rodents61. While these two studies do not rule out a role for adrenal hormones, it is important to note that parallel increases in corticosterone with HU were detected in WT and ob/ob mice. This is consistent with the similar magnitude of bone loss following HU in the two genotypes. Skeletal unweighting, whether due to microgravity, bedrest, limb casting, or spinal cord injury results in bone loss62,63. Impact loading imparted by ground reaction forces, sensory and sympathetic signaling, surgery, and muscle loading each influence bone metabolism64–67. Commonly used models for unweighting the skeleton include HU, unilateral sciatic neurotomy, and limb casting. HU was originally designed as an earth-based model for microgravity68 and chosen for the current study because (1) it is minimally invasive (i.e., does not require surgery), (2) prevents weight bearing, but unlike limb casting does not prohibit voluntary muscle loading, and (3) in contrast to unilateral sciatic neurotomy, does not directly influence neuronal regulation of bone metabolism. Leptin is a potent stimulator of bone accrual, but the positive effects of leptin on bone formation in mice occur at low circulating levels of the hormone69. Similar to mice, weight gain in humans is generally associated with increases in BMD30. However, obesity results in hyperleptinemia and the positive association between increased body weight and increased BMD is attenuated in obese subjects70. Prolonged bed rest, a model for skeletal unloading in humans, results in rapid bone loss71. Bedrest studies are typically performed in healthy individuals but bedrest is sometimes used in management of hospitalized patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. These individuals, who have very low leptin levels, appear to also exhibit unbalanced bone turnover leading to bone loss72,73. There are limitations to the present study. The study focused on the role of leptin in skeletal response to changes in weight. While impact loading on the hindlimbs caused by weight is important to skeletal health, we cannot rule out that leptin plays a role in other forms of skeletal loading, such as loading mediated through muscle contraction. Furthermore, we performed the present study in male mice. Since estrogen is important in regulation of appetite, energy expenditure and metabolism, future studies comparing the skeletal response of female ob/ob and WT HU mice are warranted. In summary, chronic leptin deficiency in male ob/ob mice resulted in shorter femora, lower femoral bone mass and density, alterations in cortical bone microarchitecture, site- and bone-specific alterations in cancellous bone architecture, and greatly increased MAT levels. These results indicate that leptin plays a critical role in normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Contrary to expectation, leptin deficiency did not alter the magnitude of HU-induced osteopenia in the mouse femur. These findings suggest that leptin is not essential for the skeletal response to unweighting.",

Copyright notice ID: 6597714 PMID: 31249331 Abstract Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have less bone than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to weight bearing. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were individually housed at 32 °C (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then randomized into one of 4 groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU and the results analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. In summary, leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU-induced osteopenia in male mice, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting. Subject terms: Physiology, EndocrinologyIntroduction Leptin, a hormone produced primarily by adipocytes, serves as a messenger in a feedback loop between adipose tissue and the hypothalamus and contributes to regulation of energy intake and energy expenditure1,2. ob/ob mice, homozygous for loss of function mutation in the obesity gene (ob), are unable to generate leptin1,2. ob/ob mice become morbidly obese due to the combined influence of increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure1. The physiological actions of leptin extend beyond energy metabolism and include regulation of skeletal growth and maturation3–6; a detailed review of the effects of leptin on the skeleton can be found in Reid et al.7 Leptin stimulates endochondral ossification and osteoblast differentiation and activity in long bones of the lower limb, where the hormone also inhibits differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to adipocytes8–10. Compared to wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice have smaller craniofacial dimensions11, shorter long bones12,13 and, when evaluated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), have lower total body and femur bone area, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD)8. Based on microcomputed tomographic (µCT) and histomorphometric analyses, ob/ob mice have bone- and bone compartment-specific alterations in cortical and cancellous bone mass and architecture8,14, and greatly increased levels of marrow adipose tissue (MAT)15,16. Whereas, total and cortical bone mass is normal or lower in ob/ob mice, cancellous bone mass, depending upon skeletal site and age, can be lower, normal, or higher7. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reverses skeletal abnormalities in ob/ob mice17. While the literature strongly supports an important role of leptin in increasing bone accrual prior to peak bone mass and in maintaining normal bone turnover, the hormone likely has additional, less well characterized, actions on bone metabolism. In this regard, there is conflicting evidence that leptin plays a role in mediating skeletal response to changes in body weight. Kapur et al. reported leptin signaling to be a negative modulator of bone mechanosensitivity18. Specifically, a loading strain of ∼2,500 μϵ, which was insufficient to produce a bone formation response in B6 mice, significantly increased bone formation parameters in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. However, other studies suggest that leptin is required for full expression of positive effects of weight on bone mass. For example, total femur mass is positively associated with body weight in WT mice19. Also, mice heterozygous for the ob gene (ob/+ mice) have adipocytes with a reduced capacity to generate leptin but have near normal leptin levels due to compensatory increases in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass19. ob/+ mice exhibit an association between body weight and bone mass nearly identical to WT mice. In contrast, weight differences in ob/ob mice have a positive but quantitatively smaller effect on bone mass20. Thus, it is possible that leptin is not required for skeletal adaptation to changes in weight but the hormone may enhance the magnitude of response by increasing sensitivity of bone to external loads. If leptin enhances the skeletal response to changes in magnitude of ground reaction forces during weight bearing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice would be predicted to exhibit an attenuated bone response to reduced skeletal loading. To test this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of male WT and ob/ob mice housed at thermoneutral to hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based model for microgravity21. HU unweights the hindlimbs, facilitating investigation of the role of leptin in the skeletal response to changes in weight21. The study was performed at thermoneutral because leptin plays an important role in thermoregulation and mild cold stress induced by conventional room temperature housing results in rapid premature cancellous bone loss in mice22,23. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance to establish the main effects (genotype and skeletal loading status) and their interaction.Results ob/ob mice were pair fed to WT mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age and all mice were pair fed to WT HU mice during HU. Food intake averaged 2.3 ± 0.0 g/d for two weeks prior to HU and 1.8 ± 0.1 g/d during HU (Supplemental Fig. S1). As expected (because of pair feeding), significant genotype, HU, or interaction effects were not detected for food intake. The respective and combined effects of leptin status and HU on body weight, abdominal WAT weight, seminal vesicle weight (an index of gonadal hormone status), blood glucose levels, and serum corticosterone and osteocalcin levels are shown in Fig. 1. Compared to WT mice, ob/ob mice had greater body weight (Fig. 1a), abdominal WAT weight (Fig. 1b), and corticosterone levels (Fig. 1e), lower seminal vesicle weight (Fig. 1c) and osteocalcin levels (Fig. 1f), and no difference in glucose levels (Fig. 1d). No significant difference in WAT weight was observed in response to HU but HU resulted in trends for lower body weight (p = 0.09) and blood glucose levels (p = 0.06). HU resulted in lower seminal vesicle weight and higher corticosterone levels. No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints. Figure 1.

Osteoblast perimeter (Fig. 7a) was lower in ob/ob mice, while osteoclast perimeter (Fig. 7b) and declomycin label length (Fig. 7c) did not differ between genotypes. Mineralizing perimeter (Fig. 7d), mineral apposition rate (Fig. 7e) and bone formation rate (Fig. 7f) did not differ with genotype. ob/ob mice had greater bone marrow adiposity (Fig. 7g), adipocyte density (Fig. 7h), and adipocyte size (Fig. 7i) than WT mice.

Discussion We evaluated the skeletal response to HU in leptin-deficient ob/ob male mice. Based on the observation that leptin deficiency attenuates the positive association between body weight and bone mass (e.g., more weight gain is required in ob/ob mice compared to WT mice to achieve a comparable increase in bone mass), we hypothesized that ob/ob mice would exhibit diminished bone loss in response to HU. However, contrary to our expectations, the magnitude of HU-induced osteopenia in ob/ob mice in femur, a weight bearing bone, was virtually indistinguishable from that of WT mice. In concordance with previous studies in WT mice, cancellous bone loss in HU mice housed at thermoneutral was due to increased bone resorption. The increase in bone resorption was due, at least in part, to increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter24. Leptin has differential effects on osteoclast number and activity in weight-bearing mice. ob/ob mice have normal or increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter25,26, indicating that the hormone is not required for osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, subcutaneous administration of leptin attenuates ovariectomy- and HU-induced bone loss in rats by reducing osteoclast number3,27. On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest reduced osteoclast activity in ob/ob mice. Specifically, ob/ob mice have low serum levels of CTX, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption20,26. In spite of elevated osteoclast-lined bone perimeter, resorption of declomycin is diminished in femurs of ob/ob mice16. Furthermore, ob/ob mice are resistant to polyethylene particle-induced osteolysis28. Finally, ob/ob mice have impaired ability to remodel the calcified cartilage network in growing femur, leading to pathological retention of cartilage during skeletal maturation10,16,26. In the present study, bone resorption was increased in femur metaphysis in ob/ob and WT mice in response to HU. In support, we observed an increase in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. Furthermore, we observed decreases in cancellous bone volume fraction and fluorochrome label retention. Specifically, declomycin label given at the start of the study was lower after two weeks of HU compared to weight-bearing mice, indicating greater resorption of fluorochrome labeled bone occurred with HU. This association between unloading and label loss is in agreement with previous spaceflight and HU studies in rats29. HU for two weeks had no significant effect on body composition in WT or ob/ob mice. This is important because changes in weight could independently influence bone turnover balance30. Thus, contrary to our expectation, skeletal unloading enhanced bone resorption in leptin-deficient mice. Reduced bone formation contributes to development of osteopenia in growing rodents during microgravity (spaceflight) and simulated microgravity (HU)31,32. However, suppression of bone formation is bone compartment-specific. In HU mice, cortical bone formation is suppressed33, but this is not necessarily the case for cancellous skeletal sites24. In the present study, osteoblast perimeter and bone formation rate were not reduced in distal femur in WT or ob/ob mice during HU. Taken together, these observations suggest that HU results in cancellous bone loss in the distal femur metaphysis because resorption increases to levels that exceed the prevailing level of bone formation. In addition to femur, we evaluated the respective effects of leptin deficiency and HU on lumbar vertebra. Cancellous bone loss occurs in lumbar vertebra in rodents subjected to microgravity34 and the bone loss is due, at least in part, to increased bone resorption35. Femurs experience high levels of ground reaction forces in response to weight bearing, and these forces are abolished by HU. Lumbar vertebrae do not generally bear weight in mice. However, lumbar vertebrae are load bearing and HU alters the orientation of the vertebral column to the gravitational vector, changing the direction of the load36. Similar to femur, leptin deficiency did not prevent HU-induced cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra. While there were no genotype-specific differences in magnitude of cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra of HU mice, the bone loss in WT mice was due to a combination of decreased trabecular thickness and trabecular number, whereas the bone loss in ob/ob mice was due to decreased trabecular thickness only. Therefore, minor genotype-specific changes in bone microarchitecture accompanied changes in bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebrae following HU. Spaceflight studies in rodents report lower circulating testosterone levels following spaceflight and ground-based HU studies in rodents report lower seminal vesicle weight37–42. In the present study, HU reduced seminal vesicle weight in both genotypes, indicating lower testosterone levels. Lower testosterone levels potentially contribute to elevated bone resorption and cancellous bone loss43. However, in spite of gonadal insufficiency, leptin deficiency typically results in a low turnover skeletal phenotype in ob/ob mice of both sexes44. The precise role of androgens in mediating the action of leptin on bone is unknown but antagonism of estrogen receptor signaling was largely dispensable for leptin’s actions in female ob/ob mice44. The present results, identifying similar bone loss in HU WT and HU ob/ob mice, suggest that preexisting hypogonadism in male ob/ob mice did not have a major influence on the magnitude of bone loss following HU. Compared to WT mice, MAT levels were approximately 10x greater in ob/ob mice. In concordance with prior work15,16,45, the increase was due to a combination of more numerous and larger adipocytes. HU did not alter adipocyte number or size, findings that contrast with an increase in MAT reported in rats following either spaceflight46 or HU47 and a previous HU study by Hino et al. in male B6 mice48. However, the present findings are concordant with a HU study performed in male WBB6F1/J mice housed at thermoneutral24. Hino et al.48 performed their study in 10-week-old mice housed at 24 °C, which is well below thermoneutral. This may be important because sub-thermoneutral housing reduces bone marrow adiposity in B6 mice49 and there is accumulating evidence that mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing impacts experimental results50. MAT levels are often (but not always) negatively associated with osteoblast number and bone mass and are increased in humans following long-duration bed rest and in rodents following spaceflight and in some skeletal disuse models9,24,35,51–55. Osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and some researchers have concluded that adipocyte differentiation impairs osteoblast differentiation35. Furthermore, adipokines produced by MAT have the potential to increase bone resorption56–58. Thus, high levels of MAT in mice could theoretically diminish the skeletal response to mechanical loading by at least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, impairment of osteoblast differentiation and stimulation of osteoclast activity. Despite greatly increased levels of MAT in distal femur metaphysis of ob/ob mice, the mice did not differ in cancellous bone volume fraction from WT mice. There were also negligible differences between the two genotypes in cortical or cancellous bone responses to HU. Taken together, these findings add to a growing list of studies that contradict a deterministic model where increased MAT levels invariably negatively affect bone metabolism59. These findings also fail to support a model where adipokines produced by MAT contribute to HU-induced bone loss. Cancellous bone volume fraction in femur in ob/ob mice has been variably reported to be lower14, equivalent (present study), or higher17 than in age-matched WT mice. In our experience, cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis in conventionally-housed (room temperature) mice declines with age in both WT and ob/ob mice, but the rate of decline is greater in WT mice. Impaired osteoclast activity in ob/ob mice provides a plausible explanation for slower age-related bone loss as well as reported differences in their skeletal phenotype. Leptin deficiency results in a variety of physical and metabolic changes that could influence osteoclast activity. Metabolically, ob/ob mice have impaired thermoregulation, are hypogonadal and hyperphagic, and often have elevated glucose, insulin, and glucocorticoid levels16. In the present study, we limited but did not fully eliminate the contribution of metabolic differences by housing ob/ob mice at thermoneutral and decreasing their food intake to that of WT mice. ob/ob mice preferentially gain fat mass and there is evidence that lean mass contributes more to the positive effect of weight on the skeleton than fat mass30. ob/ob mice are sarcopenic, and Hamrick and colleagues have reported a strong linear association between bone mineral content and quadriceps mass in ob/ob and WT mice14. Additional studies are required to evaluate the comparative effect of muscle atrophy on the skeleton of WT and ob/ob mice in response to HU. As expected, leptin deficiency and HU each resulted in higher corticosterone levels. Although glucocorticoids influence bone metabolism, Zerath et al.60 reported that microgravity-induced cancellous osteopenia occurred independent of endogenous corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, elevation of endogenous corticosterone levels did not replicate the skeletal changes observed in HU rodents61. While these two studies do not rule out a role for adrenal hormones, it is important to note that parallel increases in corticosterone with HU were detected in WT and ob/ob mice. This is consistent with the similar magnitude of bone loss following HU in the two genotypes. Skeletal unweighting, whether due to microgravity, bedrest, limb casting, or spinal cord injury results in bone loss62,63. Impact loading imparted by ground reaction forces, sensory and sympathetic signaling, surgery, and muscle loading each influence bone metabolism64–67. Commonly used models for unweighting the skeleton include HU, unilateral sciatic neurotomy, and limb casting. HU was originally designed as an earth-based model for microgravity68 and chosen for the current study because (1) it is minimally invasive (i.e., does not require surgery), (2) prevents weight bearing, but unlike limb casting does not prohibit voluntary muscle loading, and (3) in contrast to unilateral sciatic neurotomy, does not directly influence neuronal regulation of bone metabolism. Leptin is a potent stimulator of bone accrual, but the positive effects of leptin on bone formation in mice occur at low circulating levels of the hormone69. Similar to mice, weight gain in humans is generally associated with increases in BMD30. However, obesity results in hyperleptinemia and the positive association between increased body weight and increased BMD is attenuated in obese subjects70. Prolonged bed rest, a model for skeletal unloading in humans, results in rapid bone loss71. Bedrest studies are typically performed in healthy individuals but bedrest is sometimes used in management of hospitalized patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. These individuals, who have very low leptin levels, appear to also exhibit unbalanced bone turnover leading to bone loss72,73. There are limitations to the present study. The study focused on the role of leptin in skeletal response to changes in weight. While impact loading on the hindlimbs caused by weight is important to skeletal health, we cannot rule out that leptin plays a role in other forms of skeletal loading, such as loading mediated through muscle contraction. Furthermore, we performed the present study in male mice. Since estrogen is important in regulation of appetite, energy expenditure and metabolism, future studies comparing the skeletal response of female ob/ob and WT HU mice are warranted. In summary, chronic leptin deficiency in male ob/ob mice resulted in shorter femora, lower femoral bone mass and density, alterations in cortical bone microarchitecture, site- and bone-specific alterations in cancellous bone architecture, and greatly increased MAT levels. These results indicate that leptin plays a critical role in normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Contrary to expectation, leptin deficiency did not alter the magnitude of HU-induced osteopenia in the mouse femur. These findings suggest that leptin is not essential for the skeletal response to unweighting.Methods The animals were maintained in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the experimental protocol. Four-week-old male C57BL/6J (WT, n = 20) mice and B6.Lepob/ob (ob/ob, n = 20) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and single-housed in a 32 °C room for the duration of the experiment. Housing mice at 32 °C (thermoneutral temperature) minimizes resting energy expenditure74,75 and prevents premature cancellous bone loss associated with cold stress induced by sub-thermoneutral housing49. Water was provided ad libitum to all animals for the duration of study. ob/ob mice were pair-fed to WT mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age to minimize differences in weight gain16. At 16 weeks of age, the mice were randomized by body weight into one of four treatment groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU. Immediately prior to HU, animals were given a declomycin injection (15 mg/kg; sc). The mice were unloaded for 2 weeks as described21. In brief, HU mice were placed in a restraint device, where the tail was cleaned with ethanol-soaked gauze and sprayed with a tincture of benzoin. A thin piece of traction tape was looped through a large paper clip, and then pressed along the sides of the mouse’s tail. Filament tape was wrapped around the tail in two locations to secure the traction tape: the base of the tail and 2.5 cm caudal. The paperclip end was looped through the clasp secured on the unloading apparatus. Mice were positioned in a 30° head-down tilt. During unloading, the ob/ob HU group and control groups of both genotypes were pair-fed to the WT HU group. The fluorochrome calcein (15 mg/kg; sc) was administered at 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and terminated using decapitation. Blood was collected from the trunk following decapitation. Serum was stored at −80 °C. Femora and 5th lumbar vertebrae from each mouse were placed in formalin for 24-hour fixation, then stored at 4 °C in 70% ethanol. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g) and seminal vesicle weight (g) were recorded at necropsy. Blood chemistry Blood glucose was measured using a glucometer (Life Scan, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) immediately following decapitation. Serum corticosterone (ng/ml) and osteocalcin (ng/ml) were measured using a mouse Corticosterone ELISA kit obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) and a mouse Gla-osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA kit obtained from Clontech (Takara Bio Inc Shiga, Japan), respectively.Densitometry Total femur bone mineral content (BMC, g), bone area (cm2), and bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2) were measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Piximus 2, Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).Micro-computed tomography µCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of total femur bone volume (mm3), femur length (mm), and cortical and cancellous bone architecture. Femora were scanned using a Scanco µCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 µm × 12 µm × 12 µm (55 kVp x-ray voltage, 145 µA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0–1000). Cortical bone was evaluated in the femoral diaphysis and cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis (Fig. 3). Assessment of cortical bone in the femur diaphysis began 60% down the midshaft from the femoral head and consisted of 20 slices (240 µm in length). Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from the marrow cavity. All cortical slices were visually examined for evidence of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex and manually removed when present. Direct cortical bone measurements included total cross-sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (µm). Polar moment of inertia (mm4) was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Assessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540 µm in length) proximal to the growth plate, and included 40 slices (480 µm in length) of cancellous bone. The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis (31 ± 1 slices) and 5th lumbar vertebral body (149 ± 1 slices). Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, 1/mm3), structure model index (an architectural index defining bone as plate-like or rod-like with values ranging from 0 to 3, respectively), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, µm), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, 1/mm) and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, µm).Histomorphometry The histological methods used have been previously described in detail76. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene, then embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Sections, 4 µm thick, were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and affixed to slides with a dried pre-coated 1% gelatin solution. Slides were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and used for cell-based measurements. Mounted unstained slides were used for measurements of fluorochrome labels. All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. Static (cell-based) histological measurements include osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), and adipocyte size (µm2). Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by cuboidal cells adjacent to a thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase-positive (stained red) cytoplasm. Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing77. Fluorochrome-based measurements of cancellous bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: perimeter covered with double label plus half single label, normalized to bone perimeter, %), mineral apposition rate (the distance between double calcein labels, divided by the 3 day interlabel period, µm/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate expressed per bone perimeter (µm2/µm/y). Retained declomycin label (single label perimeter/tissue area; mm/mm2) in the distal femur metaphysis was measured as a dynamic index of bone resorption. This method is based on the premise that treatment groups did not differ in bone formation (and as such fluorochrome label incorporation) prior to HU35 and that differences measured at the study termination reflect the effect of treatment on resorption of the fluorochrome-labeled bone78.Statistical analysis Means were compared between genotype and treatment groups using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When significant interactions were present, t-tests were used to make two-group comparisons. When non-significant interactions were present, group comparisons were made from two-way ANOVA with main effects for genotype and treatment. The required conditions for valid use of t-tests and ANOVA were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance and the Anderson-Darling test of normality. When the assumption of equal variance was violated, Welch’s two-sample t-test was used for two-group comparisons79. When the normality assumption was violated, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for two-group comparisons. Methods for maintaining false discovery rate at 5% were used to adjust for multiple comparisons80. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

    "title": "Thermoneutral housing attenuates premature cancellous bone loss in male C57BL/6J mice",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6865368/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Mice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal maturity. The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism.

    "introduction": "Introduction Mice are among the most commonly utilized animal models for aging-related metabolic bone disease in humans. Advantages of mice over many models include their small size, relatively short lifespan, and ease of genetic manipulation. However, differences in physiology between the two species may preclude the direct translation of experimental results from mice to humans (1, 2). Although aging-related bone loss occurs in both mice and humans, the temporal pattern of bone loss between the species is markedly different, at least in long bones, raising concern that the underlying mechanisms for the bone loss may differ. In mice, cancellous bone loss in long bones occurs prior to skeletal maturity (6 months of age) and concurrently with bone elongation and cortical bone accrual (3, 4). Therefore, by the time mice reach skeletal maturity, defined as cessation of linear bone growth, a large portion of their cancellous bone has been resorbed, and little cancellous bone is available to effectively model aging-related skeletal impairment. This pattern of bone loss is not evident in all small rodents. Cancellous bone loss in rats occurs later in life (5). In humans, cancellous bone loss occurs long after skeletal maturity, primarily due to negative remodeling balance, where the rate of bone resorption exceeds the rate of formation (6). The mechanism(s) mediating premature cancellous bone loss in mice have not been extensively investigated, but our previous work suggests that the ambient temperature of standard rodent housing (18–23°C) plays an important role (2). We previously reported that housing C57BL/6J (B6) female mice at a thermoneutral temperature (32°C) prevented cancellous bone loss from 8 to 18 weeks of age, an interval during which the mice accrued cortical bone. Compared to standard room temperature housing (22°C), mice housed at thermoneutral conditions had increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption (2). Differences in thermoregulatory mechanisms between mice and humans may be a critical aspect in understanding species-specific skeletal maturation and aging-related bone loss. Humans are homeotherms and maintain their body temperature within a narrow range (7). In contrast, mice are facultative daily heterotherms and experience fasting-induced decreases in body temperature upon exposure to temperatures below their thermoneutral zone (26–34°C) (8). During the light photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are reduced, laboratory mice, depending on housing conditions (e.g., temperature, bedding material, number of animals/cage), can undergo intermittent bouts of torpor, which is driven by fasting-induced reduction in serum leptin and characterized by a metabolic rate below basal metabolic level and decreased core body temperature (2, 8). Conversely, when food intake and locomotor activity are increased during the dark photoperiod, mice utilize energy-requiring adaptive thermogenesis to help maintain sufficient core body temperature, resulting in a net increase in food consumption. Non-shivering thermogenesis, a form of adaptive thermogenesis, is particularly important for adaptation to a cold environment and is regulated by neuroendocrine mechanisms that induce sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to brown adipose tissue (BAT), where heat is generated through the uncoupling of oxidation and phosphorylation by uncoupling proteins (UCPs) (9). Bone is highly innervated by efferent sympathetic neurons (10, 11), and catecholaminergic activity modulates the function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and may play a role in mediating premature bone loss in mice (12, 13). Hormones can directly influence bone health, and sex steroids, in particular, are known modulators of bone metabolism (14). Consequently, female and male mice exhibit sexually dimorphic trajectories of skeletal growth and changes in morphology throughout the lifespan (4). While premature cancellous bone loss occurs in male mice, bone loss appears to occur later than that in females (4). Therefore, in this study we sought to determine if our prior results regarding the effects of housing temperature on bone in female B6 mice were generalizable to male B6 mice. Determining the causes of premature bone loss in mice, and whether this occurs in a sexually dimorphic manner, will contribute to optimization of experimental models more closely matching human physiology and provide novel information on potential factors contributing to aging-related bone loss.",

    "results": "Results Compared to baseline, male B6 mice housed at 22°C accrued bone as evidenced by gains in femur length (Fig. 1A) and midshaft femur cortical thickness (Fig. 1C). These growth-related gains in bone length and cortical bone, however, were contrasted by a reduction in cancellous bone volume fraction (Fig. 1D) and connectivity density (Fig. 1E) in the distal femur metaphysis. The reduction in cancellous bone and increased trabecular spacing (Fig. 1G) was primarily due to decreased trabecular number (Fig. 1F) as trabecular thickness (Fig. 1H) was not changed. Figure 1.

A group of mice housed at room temperature (22°C) was killed at 8 weeks of age, the age for peak cancellous bone volume fraction in male mice, to serve as a baseline control.

Data are mean ± s.e. aDifferent from 8-week-old mice housed at 22°C. bDifferent from 16-week-old mice housed at 22°C, P < 0.05; n = 9–10/group. Housing mice at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) resulted in higher total femur bone volume and diaphysis cortical thickness (Fig. 1B and C) than housing mice at 22°C, and prevented premature loss of cancellous bone (cancellous bone volume fraction) and attenuated changes in cancellous bone microarchitecture (connectivity density, trabecular number, and trabecular spacing) in the distal femur metaphysis (Fig. 1D, E, F and G). There was no impact of aging or housing temperature on trabecular thickness (Fig. 1H). The impact of housing temperature on cortical bone in the femur diaphysis and cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis can be visually observed in Fig. 1N. In the distal femur epiphysis, cancellous bone volume fraction was not influenced by aging or housing temperature (Fig. 1I), but aging, independent of housing temperature led to changes in microarchitecture. Specifically, aging resulted in decreased connectivity density and trabecular number (Fig. 1J and K) and increased trabecular spacing (Fig. 1L). Distal femur epiphysis trabecular thickness (Fig. 1M) was not altered by aging or housing temperature. Representative microCT images of the femur epiphysis are shown in Fig. 1N. Housing mice at 22°C reduced cancellous bone volume fraction in the 5th lumbar vertebra (Fig. 2A), which was co-incidental with reductions in connectivity density (Fig. 2B) trabecular number (Fig. 2C), trabecular thickness (Fig. 2E), and an increase in trabecular spacing (Fig. 2D). Housing mice at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) protected against reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness and increased spacing, and attenuated aging-related reductions in trabecular number and connectivity density (Fig. 2A, B, C and D). The impact of housing temperature on cancellous bone in the fifth lumbar vertebra can be visually observed in Fig. 2F. Figure 2.

We analyzed static and dynamic bone histomorphometry in distal femur metaphysis histological sections to evaluate the impact of housing temperature on cellular processes regulating cancellous bone turnover. Osteoblast perimeter (Fig. 3A), mineralizing perimeter (Fig. 3B), and bone formation rate normalized to bone perimeter (Fig. 3D), bone area (Fig. 3E), and tissue area (Fig. 3F) were all higher in mice housed at 32°C compared to mice housed at 22°C. Mineral apposition rate, an index of osteoblast activity, was not altered by housing temperature (Fig. 3C), indicating that the higher cancellous bone volume fraction in mice housed at 32°C was due, in part, to higher osteoblast number rather than higher intrinsic osteoblast activity. These cellular markers of bone formation were co-incidental with higher serum osteocalcin, a systemic marker of bone formation (Fig. 3G). Mice housed at 32°C exhibited no change in osteoclast perimeter (Fig. 3H), a measure of local bone resorption, but did exhibit lower levels of serum CTX-1, a marker of global bone resorption (Fig. 3I). The impact of housing temperature on bone formation in the distal femur metaphysis can be visually observed in Fig. 3J. Figure 3.

Data are mean ± s.e. aDifferent from mice housed at 22°C, P < 0.05; n = 9–10/group. 32°C housing did not alter aging-related body mass gain (Fig. 4A), despite a ~33% reduction in food intake compared to mice housed at 22°C (Fig. 4B), indicating both housing groups of mice maintained a similar energetic balance. 32°C housing altered nutrient partitioning and adaptive thermogenesis as evidenced by 50% higher abdominal WAT (Fig. 3C) and lower BAT Ucp1 gene expression (Fig. 4D). Fasting blood glucose (Fig. 4E) was unchanged and circulating leptin levels (Fig. 4F) were higher in thermoneutral-housed mice. Housing temperature-associated changes in adiposity did not extend to the bone marrow compartment as we observed no between-group differences in marrow adipocyte area/tissue area, adipocyte number or size as assessed by histomorphometry (Fig. 4G, H and I), or whole tibia fatty acids as assessed by gas chromatography (Fig. 4J and K).

To assess sex differences in skeletal maturation in B6 mice housed at room temperature (22°C), we conducted a retrospective analysis comparing males (current study) and females (published data) (2). The effects of sex (female and male), age (8 week old and 16-18 week old), and their interaction on femur length, total femur bone volume, cortical thickness in femur diaphysis, and cancellous bone volume fraction, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table 1. Femur length was greater in males compared to females and greater in older compared to younger animals. Cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness were likewise greater in males than females. Cancellous bone volume fraction decreased with age, irrespective of sex; the decrease was not associated with a decrease in trabecular thickness. Whereas significant sex by age interactions were not detected for any of the aforementioned endpoints, interactions were noted for total femur bone volume, cortical thickness in diaphysis, and trabecular number in distal femur metaphysis. Total femur bone volume differed between females and males at baseline and study termination, but the difference was more pronounced at the earlier age. Whereas males exhibited greater cortical thickness than females at 8 weeks of age, this difference was no longer evident at study termination. Trabecular number in the femoral metaphysis was higher in males than females at both ages, but the magnitude of difference was greater in the older animals. There was a tendency (P = 0.076) for total femur bone volume to increase with age in females but not in males. Cortical thickness increased with age in both females and males but the magnitude of increase was greater in females. Trabecular number in distal femur metaphysis decreased with age in both females and males, but the decrease was greater in females. Table 1.

We also determined whether the impact of 32°C housing on bone was similar between male and female mice. The effects of sex (female and male), temperature (22°C and 32°C), and their interaction on femur are shown in Table 2. At study termination, femur length, total femur bone volume, cancellous bone volume fraction, and trabecular number were higher in male mice compared to female mice.

    "discussion": "Discussion Housing male B6 mice at thermoneutral temperature, compared to standard room temperature, attenuates premature cancellous bone loss; mice housed at 22°C from 5 to 16 weeks of age exhibited reduced cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis and lumbar vertebra compared to baseline, while mice housed at 32°C exhibited complete maintenance of the bone volume fraction. At the cellular level, the protective effects of 32°C housing temperature were associated with a net increase in bone formation. The physiological mechanisms through which housing temperature influences bone metabolism and homeostasis in mice have not been established, but based on precedent (19) likely involve neuroendocrine pathways related to activation of adaptive thermogenesis, particularly non-shivering thermogenesis. As noted in the Introduction, mice are facultative daily heterotherms and experience fasting-induced reductions in body temperature when subjected to housing temperatures below their thermoneutral zones (20). In response to cold stress, sympathetic nervous system activation and catecholaminergic signaling induce non-shivering thermogenesis via upregulation of UCPs in BAT, which generates heat through proton leakage across the inner mitochondrial membrane (9). Housing mice at thermoneutral temperature alleviates the need for adaptive thermogenesis and decreases sympathetic nervous system activity compared to room temperature housing (21). In the present study, we found housing mice at 32°C reduced adaptive thermogenesis and presumably sympathetic nervous system activity, as evidenced by a significant downregulation of BAT Ucp1 gene expression and protected mice from premature cancellous bone loss. Bone, particularly periosteum (13), is highly innervated by efferent sympathetic nerves and it is well documented that catecholaminergic signaling pathways in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells modulate the functional activity and differentiation fate of these cells; in general, increased catecholaminergic activity inhibits osteoblast function and enhances osteoclast function (22). However, in vivo studies demonstrate the complexity of regulation. The embryological origin of the bone (endochondral versus membranous), the distribution and phenotype of nerve fibers, and the relative impact of α- and β-adrenergic receptor signaling may influence the skeletal response to housing temperature (23). Additionally, alternative mechanisms, including reduced glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone and increased leptin levels, cannot be overlooked as potential mediators of housing temperature’s impact on bone. These hormones regulate bone metabolism and their levels are altered by housing temperature (24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31). Bone mass is determined by the balance of bone formation and bone resorption, and the findings herein suggest the bone-protective effects of 32°C housing on cancellous bone volume in distal femur metaphysis may involve maintenance of osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast activity, whereas mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing results in depressed osteoblastogenesis. Alternatively, osteoblast lifespan may be reduced in room temperature-housed mice. However, the normal mineral apposition rate in room temperature-housed mice does not support this alternative. Osteoblasts are derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can also differentiate into adipocytes and chondrocytes. MSC differentiation fate is driven by local and systemic stimuli, and the balance of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation is hypothesized to be an important factor in the maintenance of bone homeostasis. As noted above, housing mice at 32°C had no effect on osteoblast activity, but did significantly increase osteoblast-lined bone perimeter (~200% increase) compared to mice housed at 22°C, with no co-incidental change in adipocyte density. These data indicate 32°C housing may drive bone marrow MSC differentiation fate toward osteoblastogenesis. In regard to osteoclasts, 32°C housing did not alter osteoclast-lined bone perimeter compared to 22°C housing, but did result in a significant reduction in serum CTX-1, a marker of global bone resorption, suggesting a down regulation of osteoclast activity in mice housed at 32°C. Alternatively, the lower CTX-1 levels may reflect reduced osteoclast number at other skeletal sites. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 32°C abolishes the requirement for adaptive thermogenesis, which likely diminishes sympathetic signaling in bone, resulting in an upregulation of osteoblast differentiation, a downregulation in global bone resorption, and maintenance of cancellous bone volume. However, as mentioned, it is plausible that housing temperature-associated changes in levels of other factors, such as glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, or leptin contribute to the skeletal response. The present analysis focused on cancellous bone in representative axial (lumbar vertebra) and appendicular (femur) skeletal sites. However, it is clear that housing temperature also influences cortical bone as well as total bone accrual. Specifically, mice housed at thermoneutral conditions had increased cortical thickness and increased total femur bone volume. In contrast, femur length was not affected suggesting that, as was demonstrated for female mice (2), housing temperature does not influence the rate of endochondral ossification in male B6 mice. Comparison of the findings in this study and our previous report in female mice indicates the magnitude of premature cancellous bone loss during 22°C housing does not differ between sexes. In addition, our findings demonstrate thermoneutral housing-induced maintenance of cancellous bone is common to both female and male mice, and the extent of the protective effect is similar between sexes. Altogether, these findings suggest the skeletal responses to housing temperature exhibit minimal sexual dimorphism. Our findings address an important current issue in skeletal biology, namely the role of bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) in skeletal health. It has become a prevailing view that marrow adipocytes play a largely negative role in bone metabolism (32). However, the physiological role of MAT is not well established, and an inverse relationship between MAT levels and skeletal health is not universal (33, 34). Here we found large between-sex differences in marrow adiposity with female mice exhibiting greater marrow adiposity compared to male mice. In addition, there was a sexually dimorphic response of MAT to housing conditions, with female mice exhibiting significantly increased marrow adiposity under thermoneutral housing, an effect not observed in male mice. Despite differences in marrow adiposity between female and male mice, there were no between-sex differences in the magnitude of premature bone loss, indicating in this experimental model that bone marrow adiposity has neither a detrimental nor protective impact on the bone response to room temperature-induced cold stress. It is important to note our analyses were conducted in mice approaching skeletal maturity, but considered ‘young’ in the perspective of the full lifespan. Additional work will be required to establish the role of marrow adiposity and MAT phenotype on bone metabolism throughout the entire life span including skeletal maturation, maintenance, and senescence. This is one of a few studies to evaluate lipid species in bone. We assessed lipid species in homogenized whole tibia and found monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were the most abundant lipids, followed by saturated (SFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A limitation to using whole bone is that bone marrow is composed of a heterogeneous cell population, and therefore, we cannot attribute lipid species to specific cell types or regions (e.g., proximal, midshaft, distal); additionally, our methodology does not allow us to distinguish between lipid classes (e.g., non-esterified fatty acids, glycerolipids, sphingolipids, ether lipids, or waxes). The 16-week-old male B6 mice used in this study have relatively few adipocytes in the distal femur metaphysis; MAT occupied <1% of tissue area. This compares to ~4% in female mice housed at 22°C and ~10% in mice housed at 32°C. MAT occupied >10% of tissue area in proximal tibia metaphysis in normal growing female rats and >50% of tissue area in hypophysectomized female rats (35). In spite of the large differences in marrow adiposity, the relative distribution of lipid species (MUFA > SFA > 6-N PUFA > 3-N PUFA) was similar. These findings indicate the lipid composition of bone is similar to WAT where the abundance proportion is MUFA > SFA > PUFA. Our data largely align with the findings of Scheller et al. who assessed lipid species in two regionally distinct populations of marrow adipocytes in rats, regulated (rMAT) and constitutive (cMAT) marrow adipose depots (36). rMAT is interspersed in the red hematopoietic marrow in the proximal regions of tibia metaphysis while cMAT consists of densely packed adipocytes located in the distal tibia. They found MUFAs are the most abundant lipid species in both rMAT and cMAT, but rMAT has a higher proportion of SFAs and a lower proportion of PUFAs compared to cMAT. The physiological significance of rMAT and cMAT remains to be determined. In summary, housing growing male B6 mice at 22°C resulted in cancellous bone loss in distal femur metaphysis and lumbar vertebra between 8 and 16 weeks of age. This premature bone loss was prevented by housing the mice at 32°C. Housing at 22°C was associated with lower serum osteocalcin, osteoblast perimeter, and mineralizing perimeter, suggesting that the bone loss was due, in part, to reduced bone formation. Additionally, higher serum CTX-1 in 22°C-housed mice suggests that 22°C housing may also co-incidentally increase global bone resorption. Mechanistically, we speculate that 22°C housing-induced bone loss is strongly associated with elevated sympathetic nervous system signaling required to activate adaptive thermogenesis for the maintenance of body temperature, but additional studies are required to establish the precise mechanisms. The magnitude of premature bone loss induced by 22°C housing in male mice was similar to that of female mice, although males had higher cancellous bone volume fraction than females at baseline.

Copyright notice ID: 6865368 PMID: 31590144 Abstract Mice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal maturity. The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism. Keywords: animal models, sympathetic signaling, thermogenesis, metabolism, bone formation and resorptionIntroduction Mice are among the most commonly utilized animal models for aging-related metabolic bone disease in humans. Advantages of mice over many models include their small size, relatively short lifespan, and ease of genetic manipulation. However, differences in physiology between the two species may preclude the direct translation of experimental results from mice to humans (1, 2). Although aging-related bone loss occurs in both mice and humans, the temporal pattern of bone loss between the species is markedly different, at least in long bones, raising concern that the underlying mechanisms for the bone loss may differ. In mice, cancellous bone loss in long bones occurs prior to skeletal maturity (6 months of age) and concurrently with bone elongation and cortical bone accrual (3, 4). Therefore, by the time mice reach skeletal maturity, defined as cessation of linear bone growth, a large portion of their cancellous bone has been resorbed, and little cancellous bone is available to effectively model aging-related skeletal impairment. This pattern of bone loss is not evident in all small rodents. Cancellous bone loss in rats occurs later in life (5). In humans, cancellous bone loss occurs long after skeletal maturity, primarily due to negative remodeling balance, where the rate of bone resorption exceeds the rate of formation (6). The mechanism(s) mediating premature cancellous bone loss in mice have not been extensively investigated, but our previous work suggests that the ambient temperature of standard rodent housing (18–23°C) plays an important role (2). We previously reported that housing C57BL/6J (B6) female mice at a thermoneutral temperature (32°C) prevented cancellous bone loss from 8 to 18 weeks of age, an interval during which the mice accrued cortical bone. Compared to standard room temperature housing (22°C), mice housed at thermoneutral conditions had increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption (2). Differences in thermoregulatory mechanisms between mice and humans may be a critical aspect in understanding species-specific skeletal maturation and aging-related bone loss. Humans are homeotherms and maintain their body temperature within a narrow range (7). In contrast, mice are facultative daily heterotherms and experience fasting-induced decreases in body temperature upon exposure to temperatures below their thermoneutral zone (26–34°C) (8). During the light photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are reduced, laboratory mice, depending on housing conditions (e.g., temperature, bedding material, number of animals/cage), can undergo intermittent bouts of torpor, which is driven by fasting-induced reduction in serum leptin and characterized by a metabolic rate below basal metabolic level and decreased core body temperature (2, 8). Conversely, when food intake and locomotor activity are increased during the dark photoperiod, mice utilize energy-requiring adaptive thermogenesis to help maintain sufficient core body temperature, resulting in a net increase in food consumption. Non-shivering thermogenesis, a form of adaptive thermogenesis, is particularly important for adaptation to a cold environment and is regulated by neuroendocrine mechanisms that induce sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) to brown adipose tissue (BAT), where heat is generated through the uncoupling of oxidation and phosphorylation by uncoupling proteins (UCPs) (9). Bone is highly innervated by efferent sympathetic neurons (10, 11), and catecholaminergic activity modulates the function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and may play a role in mediating premature bone loss in mice (12, 13). Hormones can directly influence bone health, and sex steroids, in particular, are known modulators of bone metabolism (14). Consequently, female and male mice exhibit sexually dimorphic trajectories of skeletal growth and changes in morphology throughout the lifespan (4). While premature cancellous bone loss occurs in male mice, bone loss appears to occur later than that in females (4). Therefore, in this study we sought to determine if our prior results regarding the effects of housing temperature on bone in female B6 mice were generalizable to male B6 mice. Determining the causes of premature bone loss in mice, and whether this occurs in a sexually dimorphic manner, will contribute to optimization of experimental models more closely matching human physiology and provide novel information on potential factors contributing to aging-related bone loss.Materials and methods Experimental design Five-week-old male B6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and housed under controlled conditions with approval of the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were individually housed in a room on standard light cycle (12 h light; 12 h dark), and food and water were provided ad libitum. Body weight and food consumption were monitored weekly for the duration of the study. Mice were randomized into two housing conditions, a room temperature of 22°C (standard vivarium room temperature, n = 9) or a room temperature of 32°C (thermoneutral temperature for mice, n = 9), and maintained at their respective temperatures from 5 (rapidly growing) until 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Male B6 mice reach peak cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis at ~8 weeks of age and peak cortical and total femur bone volume by 6 months of age (4). The mice were injected with the fluorochrome calcein (15 mg/kg, Sigma) 4 days and 1 day prior to killing to label bone surfaces undergoing mineralization. For tissue collection, mice were deeply anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and bled by decapitation. Blood glucose was measured using a glucometer (OneTouch Ultra Mini, LifeScan, Milpitas, CA, USA). Serum was collected and stored at −80°C for analyses of markers of bone turnover and leptin. Abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) was removed and weighed. Right femora and the fifth lumbar vertebrae were isolated, fixed for 24 h in 10% formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for microcomputed tomography and histomorphometric analyses. Left tibiae were removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C for gas chromatographic analysis of lipid species. Interscapular BAT was removed and stored in RNALater (ThermoFisher) at −80°C for RNA analysis of Ucp1. A second cohort of mice (n = 10) was killed at 8 weeks of age as an asynchronous baseline control group.Chemistry Serum leptin was measured using Mouse Leptin Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems), serum osteocalcin was measured using Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), and serum CTX-1 was measured using Mouse CTX-1 ELISA kit (Life Sciences Advanced Technologies, St. Petersburg, FL, USA) according to the respective manufacturer’s protocol.Microcomputed tomography Microcomputed tomography (μCT) was used for nondestructive 3D evaluation of bone volume and architecture in femur and fifth lumbar vertebra as previously described (2).Histomorphometry Methods used here for measuring static and dynamic bone histomorphometry in distal femur metaphysis have been described in detail (2, 15, 16).Whole tibia lipid analysis Frozen tibiae were homogenized in 40% methanol, and total lipids extracted from the bone using methanol-chloroform (1:2 ratio) with butylated hydroxytolulene (1 µM); 10-nonadecenoic acid 19:1 (Δ10 cis) (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, MN, USA) was added as a recovery standard at the time of extraction. Total lipids were saponified, and fatty acid methyl esters were prepared and analyzed by gas chromatography using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (17). Methylated fatty acid standards were obtained from Nu-Chek Prep.Gene expression Frozen BAT was homogenized in TRIzol and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was generated using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR. BAT Ucp1 gene expression was assessed using the primer sequences: forward GTGAAGGTCAGAATGCAAGC and reverse AGGGCCCCCTTCATGAGGTC. Relative Ucp1 transcript abundance was normalized using 18S ribosomal RNA using the primer sequences: forward CCGCAGCTAGGAATAATGGAAT and reverse CGAACCTCCGACTTTCGTTCT.Statistics Mean responses of individual variables were compared for 8-week-old mice housed at 22°C and 16-week-old mice housed at either 22°C or 32°C using one-way ANOVA, with t-tests used to make pairwise comparisons. The Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test was used when only the normality assumption was violated, in which case the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test was used for two-group comparisons. Histomorphometric parameters measured in mice housed at 22°C or 32°C were compared using t-tests or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests. Longitudinal data on body mass and food intake were modeled using a general linear model with a compound symmetric correlation matrix and a binary fixed effect for treatment group (control temperature 22°C or thermoneutral temperature 32°C). A constant time trend was used for food intake and a linear time trend was used for body mass. A two-factor ANOVA with an interaction between sex (male and female) and age (8-week-old mice and 16–18 week old mice) was used to compare mean values for architectural endpoints between male (current study) and female (published data) (2) B6 mice housed at 22°C. In addition, a two-way ANOVA was used to investigate for effect modification between temperature and sex (i.e., whether the magnitude of the effect of temperature was the same for male and female mice). The required conditions for valid use of Gaussian linear models were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and the Anderson–Darling test of normality. The Benjamini and Hochberg method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons (18). Data analysis was performed using R version 3.4.3.Results Compared to baseline, male B6 mice housed at 22°C accrued bone as evidenced by gains in femur length (Fig. 1A) and midshaft femur cortical thickness (Fig. 1C). These growth-related gains in bone length and cortical bone, however, were contrasted by a reduction in cancellous bone volume fraction (Fig. 1D) and connectivity density (Fig. 1E) in the distal femur metaphysis. The reduction in cancellous bone and increased trabecular spacing (Fig. 1G) was primarily due to decreased trabecular number (Fig. 1F) as trabecular thickness (Fig. 1H) was not changed. Figure 1.

A group of mice housed at room temperature (22°C) was killed at 8 weeks of age, the age for peak cancellous bone volume fraction in male mice, to serve as a baseline control.

There was no impact of aging or housing temperature on trabecular thickness (Fig. 1H). The impact of housing temperature on cortical bone in the femur diaphysis and cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis can be visually observed in Fig. 1N. In the distal femur epiphysis, cancellous bone volume fraction was not influenced by aging or housing temperature (Fig. 1I), but aging, independent of housing temperature led to changes in microarchitecture. Specifically, aging resulted in decreased connectivity density and trabecular number (Fig. 1J and K) and increased trabecular spacing (Fig. 1L). Distal femur epiphysis trabecular thickness (Fig. 1M) was not altered by aging or housing temperature. Representative microCT images of the femur epiphysis are shown in Fig. 1N. Housing mice at 22°C reduced cancellous bone volume fraction in the 5th lumbar vertebra (Fig. 2A), which was co-incidental with reductions in connectivity density (Fig. 2B) trabecular number (Fig. 2C), trabecular thickness (Fig. 2E), and an increase in trabecular spacing (Fig. 2D). Housing mice at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) protected against reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness and increased spacing, and attenuated aging-related reductions in trabecular number and connectivity density (Fig. 2A, B, C and D). The impact of housing temperature on cancellous bone in the fifth lumbar vertebra can be visually observed in Fig. 2F. Figure 2.

Data are mean ± s.e. aDifferent from 8-week-old mice housed at 22°C. bDifferent from 16-week-old mice housed at 22°C, P < 0.05; n = 9–10/group.We analyzed static and dynamic bone histomorphometry in distal femur metaphysis histological sections to evaluate the impact of housing temperature on cellular processes regulating cancellous bone turnover. Osteoblast perimeter (Fig. 3A), mineralizing perimeter (Fig. 3B), and bone formation rate normalized to bone perimeter (Fig. 3D), bone area (Fig. 3E), and tissue area (Fig. 3F) were all higher in mice housed at 32°C compared to mice housed at 22°C. Mineral apposition rate, an index of osteoblast activity, was not altered by housing temperature (Fig. 3C), indicating that the higher cancellous bone volume fraction in mice housed at 32°C was due, in part, to higher osteoblast number rather than higher intrinsic osteoblast activity. These cellular markers of bone formation were co-incidental with higher serum osteocalcin, a systemic marker of bone formation (Fig. 3G). Mice housed at 32°C exhibited no change in osteoclast perimeter (Fig. 3H), a measure of local bone resorption, but did exhibit lower levels of serum CTX-1, a marker of global bone resorption (Fig. 3I). The impact of housing temperature on bone formation in the distal femur metaphysis can be visually observed in Fig. 3J. Figure 3.

Data are mean ± s.e. aDifferent from mice housed at 22°C, P < 0.05; n = 9–10/group.32°C housing did not alter aging-related body mass gain (Fig. 4A), despite a ~33% reduction in food intake compared to mice housed at 22°C (Fig. 4B), indicating both housing groups of mice maintained a similar energetic balance. 32°C housing altered nutrient partitioning and adaptive thermogenesis as evidenced by 50% higher abdominal WAT (Fig. 3C) and lower BAT Ucp1 gene expression (Fig. 4D). Fasting blood glucose (Fig. 4E) was unchanged and circulating leptin levels (Fig. 4F) were higher in thermoneutral-housed mice. Housing temperature-associated changes in adiposity did not extend to the bone marrow compartment as we observed no between-group differences in marrow adipocyte area/tissue area, adipocyte number or size as assessed by histomorphometry (Fig. 4G, H and I), or whole tibia fatty acids as assessed by gas chromatography (Fig. 4J and K).

SFA, saturated fatty acids; MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acids; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids; ω3 PUFA, ω6 PUFA.To assess sex differences in skeletal maturation in B6 mice housed at room temperature (22°C), we conducted a retrospective analysis comparing males (current study) and females (published data) (2). The effects of sex (female and male), age (8 week old and 16-18 week old), and their interaction on femur length, total femur bone volume, cortical thickness in femur diaphysis, and cancellous bone volume fraction, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table 1. Femur length was greater in males compared to females and greater in older compared to younger animals. Cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness were likewise greater in males than females. Cancellous bone volume fraction decreased with age, irrespective of sex; the decrease was not associated with a decrease in trabecular thickness. Whereas significant sex by age interactions were not detected for any of the aforementioned endpoints, interactions were noted for total femur bone volume, cortical thickness in diaphysis, and trabecular number in distal femur metaphysis. Total femur bone volume differed between females and males at baseline and study termination, but the difference was more pronounced at the earlier age. Whereas males exhibited greater cortical thickness than females at 8 weeks of age, this difference was no longer evident at study termination. Trabecular number in the femoral metaphysis was higher in males than females at both ages, but the magnitude of difference was greater in the older animals. There was a tendency (P = 0.076) for total femur bone volume to increase with age in females but not in males. Cortical thickness increased with age in both females and males but the magnitude of increase was greater in females. Trabecular number in distal femur metaphysis decreased with age in both females and males, but the decrease was greater in females. Table 1.

The effects of sex (female and male), temperature (22°C and 32°C), and their interaction on femur are shown in Table 2. At study termination, femur length, total femur bone volume, cancellous bone volume fraction, and trabecular number were higher in male mice compared to female mice. There were no effects of sex on cortical thickness or trabecular thickness. Mice housed at 32°C had higher total femur bone volume, cortical thickness, cancellous bone volume fraction, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness compared to mice housed at 22°C. There was no effect of temperature on femur length, and no sex by temperature interactions were detected for microarchitecture. Table 2.

There was no effect of sex on osteoblast perimeter. Mice housed at 32°C had higher mineralizing perimeter, bone formation rate, osteoblast perimeter, and adipocyte size compared to mice housed at 22°C. Housing temperature had no impact on mineral apposition rate. Sex by temperature interactions were detected for adipocyte area, adipocyte density, and osteoclast perimeter, where female mice housed at 32°C had higher adipocyte area and adipocyte density, and lower osteoclast perimeter compared to female mice housed at 22°C. These temperature effects were not observed in male mice.Discussion Housing male B6 mice at thermoneutral temperature, compared to standard room temperature, attenuates premature cancellous bone loss; mice housed at 22°C from 5 to 16 weeks of age exhibited reduced cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis and lumbar vertebra compared to baseline, while mice housed at 32°C exhibited complete maintenance of the bone volume fraction. At the cellular level, the protective effects of 32°C housing temperature were associated with a net increase in bone formation. The physiological mechanisms through which housing temperature influences bone metabolism and homeostasis in mice have not been established, but based on precedent (19) likely involve neuroendocrine pathways related to activation of adaptive thermogenesis, particularly non-shivering thermogenesis. As noted in the Introduction, mice are facultative daily heterotherms and experience fasting-induced reductions in body temperature when subjected to housing temperatures below their thermoneutral zones (20). In response to cold stress, sympathetic nervous system activation and catecholaminergic signaling induce non-shivering thermogenesis via upregulation of UCPs in BAT, which generates heat through proton leakage across the inner mitochondrial membrane (9). Housing mice at thermoneutral temperature alleviates the need for adaptive thermogenesis and decreases sympathetic nervous system activity compared to room temperature housing (21). In the present study, we found housing mice at 32°C reduced adaptive thermogenesis and presumably sympathetic nervous system activity, as evidenced by a significant downregulation of BAT Ucp1 gene expression and protected mice from premature cancellous bone loss. Bone, particularly periosteum (13), is highly innervated by efferent sympathetic nerves and it is well documented that catecholaminergic signaling pathways in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells modulate the functional activity and differentiation fate of these cells; in general, increased catecholaminergic activity inhibits osteoblast function and enhances osteoclast function (22). However, in vivo studies demonstrate the complexity of regulation. The embryological origin of the bone (endochondral versus membranous), the distribution and phenotype of nerve fibers, and the relative impact of α- and β-adrenergic receptor signaling may influence the skeletal response to housing temperature (23). Additionally, alternative mechanisms, including reduced glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone and increased leptin levels, cannot be overlooked as potential mediators of housing temperature’s impact on bone. These hormones regulate bone metabolism and their levels are altered by housing temperature (24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31). Bone mass is determined by the balance of bone formation and bone resorption, and the findings herein suggest the bone-protective effects of 32°C housing on cancellous bone volume in distal femur metaphysis may involve maintenance of osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast activity, whereas mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing results in depressed osteoblastogenesis. Alternatively, osteoblast lifespan may be reduced in room temperature-housed mice. However, the normal mineral apposition rate in room temperature-housed mice does not support this alternative. Osteoblasts are derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can also differentiate into adipocytes and chondrocytes. MSC differentiation fate is driven by local and systemic stimuli, and the balance of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation is hypothesized to be an important factor in the maintenance of bone homeostasis. As noted above, housing mice at 32°C had no effect on osteoblast activity, but did significantly increase osteoblast-lined bone perimeter (~200% increase) compared to mice housed at 22°C, with no co-incidental change in adipocyte density. These data indicate 32°C housing may drive bone marrow MSC differentiation fate toward osteoblastogenesis. In regard to osteoclasts, 32°C housing did not alter osteoclast-lined bone perimeter compared to 22°C housing, but did result in a significant reduction in serum CTX-1, a marker of global bone resorption, suggesting a down regulation of osteoclast activity in mice housed at 32°C. Alternatively, the lower CTX-1 levels may reflect reduced osteoclast number at other skeletal sites. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 32°C abolishes the requirement for adaptive thermogenesis, which likely diminishes sympathetic signaling in bone, resulting in an upregulation of osteoblast differentiation, a downregulation in global bone resorption, and maintenance of cancellous bone volume. However, as mentioned, it is plausible that housing temperature-associated changes in levels of other factors, such as glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, or leptin contribute to the skeletal response. The present analysis focused on cancellous bone in representative axial (lumbar vertebra) and appendicular (femur) skeletal sites. However, it is clear that housing temperature also influences cortical bone as well as total bone accrual. Specifically, mice housed at thermoneutral conditions had increased cortical thickness and increased total femur bone volume. In contrast, femur length was not affected suggesting that, as was demonstrated for female mice (2), housing temperature does not influence the rate of endochondral ossification in male B6 mice. Comparison of the findings in this study and our previous report in female mice indicates the magnitude of premature cancellous bone loss during 22°C housing does not differ between sexes. In addition, our findings demonstrate thermoneutral housing-induced maintenance of cancellous bone is common to both female and male mice, and the extent of the protective effect is similar between sexes. Altogether, these findings suggest the skeletal responses to housing temperature exhibit minimal sexual dimorphism. Our findings address an important current issue in skeletal biology, namely the role of bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) in skeletal health. It has become a prevailing view that marrow adipocytes play a largely negative role in bone metabolism (32). However, the physiological role of MAT is not well established, and an inverse relationship between MAT levels and skeletal health is not universal (33, 34). Here we found large between-sex differences in marrow adiposity with female mice exhibiting greater marrow adiposity compared to male mice. In addition, there was a sexually dimorphic response of MAT to housing conditions, with female mice exhibiting significantly increased marrow adiposity under thermoneutral housing, an effect not observed in male mice. Despite differences in marrow adiposity between female and male mice, there were no between-sex differences in the magnitude of premature bone loss, indicating in this experimental model that bone marrow adiposity has neither a detrimental nor protective impact on the bone response to room temperature-induced cold stress. It is important to note our analyses were conducted in mice approaching skeletal maturity, but considered ‘young’ in the perspective of the full lifespan. Additional work will be required to establish the role of marrow adiposity and MAT phenotype on bone metabolism throughout the entire life span including skeletal maturation, maintenance, and senescence. This is one of a few studies to evaluate lipid species in bone. We assessed lipid species in homogenized whole tibia and found monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were the most abundant lipids, followed by saturated (SFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A limitation to using whole bone is that bone marrow is composed of a heterogeneous cell population, and therefore, we cannot attribute lipid species to specific cell types or regions (e.g., proximal, midshaft, distal); additionally, our methodology does not allow us to distinguish between lipid classes (e.g., non-esterified fatty acids, glycerolipids, sphingolipids, ether lipids, or waxes). The 16-week-old male B6 mice used in this study have relatively few adipocytes in the distal femur metaphysis; MAT occupied <1% of tissue area. This compares to ~4% in female mice housed at 22°C and ~10% in mice housed at 32°C. MAT occupied >10% of tissue area in proximal tibia metaphysis in normal growing female rats and >50% of tissue area in hypophysectomized female rats (35). In spite of the large differences in marrow adiposity, the relative distribution of lipid species (MUFA > SFA > 6-N PUFA > 3-N PUFA) was similar. These findings indicate the lipid composition of bone is similar to WAT where the abundance proportion is MUFA > SFA > PUFA. Our data largely align with the findings of Scheller et al. who assessed lipid species in two regionally distinct populations of marrow adipocytes in rats, regulated (rMAT) and constitutive (cMAT) marrow adipose depots (36). rMAT is interspersed in the red hematopoietic marrow in the proximal regions of tibia metaphysis while cMAT consists of densely packed adipocytes located in the distal tibia. They found MUFAs are the most abundant lipid species in both rMAT and cMAT, but rMAT has a higher proportion of SFAs and a lower proportion of PUFAs compared to cMAT. The physiological significance of rMAT and cMAT remains to be determined. In summary, housing growing male B6 mice at 22°C resulted in cancellous bone loss in distal femur metaphysis and lumbar vertebra between 8 and 16 weeks of age. This premature bone loss was prevented by housing the mice at 32°C. Housing at 22°C was associated with lower serum osteocalcin, osteoblast perimeter, and mineralizing perimeter, suggesting that the bone loss was due, in part, to reduced bone formation. Additionally, higher serum CTX-1 in 22°C-housed mice suggests that 22°C housing may also co-incidentally increase global bone resorption. Mechanistically, we speculate that 22°C housing-induced bone loss is strongly associated with elevated sympathetic nervous system signaling required to activate adaptive thermogenesis for the maintenance of body temperature, but additional studies are required to establish the precise mechanisms. The magnitude of premature bone loss induced by 22°C housing in male mice was similar to that of female mice, although males had higher cancellous bone volume fraction than females at baseline. The present findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies investigating bone metabolism in mice, and add to the growing number of investigations emphasizing the physiological relevance of housing temperature when translating mouse experiments to humans (20, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52).Declaration of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.Funding This work was supported by the  (AR060913 [U I]; DK112360 [D B J]) and NASA (80NSSC19K0430 [R T]).References 1.Iwaniec UT, Turner RT.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mechanical loading of the skeleton during normal weight bearing plays an important role in bone accrual and turnover balance. We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. Cancellous microarchitecture and cortical thickness were assessed using x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography. In male rats, cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume) was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls, but differences were not significant compared to baseline. In ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. Cortical thickness did not differ among groups in either experiment. In summary, findings from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Life on Earth evolved in the presence of a nearly uniform gravitational field (Turner, 2000). Not surprisingly, the near absence of ‘weight’ during orbital spaceflight results in profound adaptive responses in multiple organ systems, including the skeleton. Abnormalities in bone and mineral homeostasis in astronauts during spaceflight result in net bone loss (Sibonga, 2013). Although it is unclear whether the changes in bone metabolism are self-limiting, evidence to date in animals and humans indicates that long-duration space missions will be detrimental to bone. Animal studies, done primarily in rodents, are important for modeling the effects of spaceflight at all stages of skeletal maturation. Studies to date have investigated the effects of spaceflight on bone accrual and turnover balance at a variety of weight bearing, load bearing, and unloaded skeletal sites in growing rodents (Bikle and Halloran, 1999; Turner, 2000). However, the majority of spaceflight experiments using rodents, primarily rats, were performed prior to wide spread availability of x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography (μCT) (Keune et al., 2015). Consequently, limited information is available regarding the effects of spaceflight on bone microarchitecture. The proximal tibia and distal femur are commonly evaluated following spaceflight. In contrast, the effects of spaceflight on proximal femur is much less commonly reported. Bone changes can occur at many skeletal sites but the greatest loss in astronauts is detected in the lower body and, in particular, the proximal femur (Keyak et al., 2009; Lang et al., 2006; Sibonga et al., 2007). In one of the few studies investigating multiple skeletal compartments, we analyzed gene expression in distal epiphysis, distal metaphysis, diaphysis, and proximal region of the femur following a 14-day spaceflight (STS-58) in growing male rats. Notably, we found that the proximal region of the femur exhibited the largest reduction in mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins (Evans et al., 1998). Based on this initial observation, we evaluated bone architecture (using μCT) in the proximal region of the femoral head of archived bone specimens from rapidly growing male Sprague Dawley rats flown aboard STS-41 (Turner et al., 2019), and observed strikingly lower cancellous bone volume fraction in the flight animals. The cancellous osteopenia was a surprise because of the short duration (4 days) of the spaceflight mission. To determine the generalizability of this finding across sex and strain, we assessed bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in archived bone specimens from two additional spaceflight experiments, STS-57 and STS-62. STS-57 was a 10-day mission performed using growing male Fisher 344 rats and STS-62 was a 14-day mission using growing ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats.",
    "methods": "2. Methods STS-57 was a Shuttle-SPACEHAB mission of Space Shuttle Endeavour. The mission launched June 21, 1993 from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats were flown on the flight. The experimental protocol was approved by the NASA Animal Care and Use Committee and flight details have been published (Westerlind and Turner, 1995). In brief, the rats were randomized into one of three groups: baseline control (baseline, n = 6), ground-based flight control (flight control, n = 12), or spaceflight (flight, n = 12). The baseline group was euthanized on day of launch. The flight animals were flown for 10 days. Flight control rats were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs) (Moyer et al., 2016) identical to those housing the flight animals and temperature, humidity and light levels adjusted to values in flight AEMs. All animals were provided with NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Foodbar (NuRFB) (Sun et al., 2010; Tou et al., 2003) and water ad libitum. Flight animals were euthanized 5–8 h after landing by decapitation and femora were removed, fixed overnight in 10% formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for evaluation. STS-62 was a Space Shuttle program mission flown aboard Space Shuttle Columbia that launched March 4, 1994. 12-week-old ovx female Fisher 344 rats were used in the study. The experimental protocol was approved by the NASA Animal Care and Use Committee and flight details have been published (Cavolina et al., 1997). In brief, the female rats were ovx 14 days prior to launch and randomized into one of three groups: baseline control (baseline, n = 6), ground-based flight control (flight control, n = 12), or spaceflight (flight, n = 12). The baseline group was euthanized on day of launch. The flight animals were housed in AEMs and flown for 14 days. Flight control rats were housed in AEMs and temperature, humidity and light levels were adjusted to values in flight AEMs. Flight and flight control rats were provided with food (AEM NuRFB) and water ad libitum. Flight animals were euthanized 4–6 h after landing. Asynchronous groups of ovary-intact vivarium-housed rats on a standard rat chow diet were euthanized to provide age-matched reference values for baseline and flight. The asynchronous component of the study was approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) where the study was performed. The purpose of the ovary-intact controls was to evaluate normal age-related changes in bone over the 14-day flight period and to verify that ovx resulted in cancellous osteopenia. All rats were euthanized by decapitation and femora were removed, fixed overnight in 10% formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for evaluation. 2.1. Micro-computed tomography Bone volume and microarchitecture were assessed using a Scanco μCT scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12x12x12 microns, 55 kVp X-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time. Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. Bone segmentation was conducted at a threshold value of 245 (gray scale, 0–1000) determined empirically. In both studies, a sample of 20 slices (240 μm) of cancellous bone was assessed in the proximal half of the femoral head as previously described (Turner et al., 2019). Automated irregular manual contouring was used to delineate cancellous from cortical bone. Direct cancellous bone measurements included cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume, %), connectivity density (mm−3), trabecular thickness (μm), trabecular number (mm−1), and trabecular separation (μm). In addition, 62 slices (744 μm) of cortical bone were assessed 690 slices (8.3 mm) distal to the top of femoral head and cortical thickness (μm) measured. 2.2. Statistical analysis Mean comparisons of quantitative variables (e.g., bone volume fraction) for the spaceflight, flight control, and baseline groups were made using separate one-way analysis of variance models for data from male and female rats. The mean structure of both models was specified as α*Spaceflight + β*Flight Control + γ*Baseline. The linear model conditions of normality and equal variance were assessed numerically using Anderson-Darling and Levene's tests, and graphically using boxplots, dotplots, normal quantile plots, and residual plots. Dunnett's procedure determined adjusted P-values for comparing mean outcomes of the spaceflight group to both the baseline and flight control groups. All data are reported as mean ± SE with individual values presented. Differences are considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Data analysis was performed using R version 3.4.3.",

    "discussion": "4. Discussion Rodents—historically rats and more recently mice—are the primary animal model for investigating the effects and underlying mechanisms of action of spaceflight on the skeleton. Here we report data showing that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in the proximal femoral head in rapidly growing male Fisher 344 rats and slowly growing ovx female Fisher 344 rats. The observed osteopenia in the femoral head following spaceflight supports the results of a 4-day study performed in very rapidly growing male Sprague-Dawley rats (STS-41). Spaceflight studies performed in C57BL/6 J mice (Blaber et al., 2014) suggest that this response may not be limited to rats. The dramatically lower cancellous bone volume fraction noted in the femoral head of rats flown aboard STS-41 was a surprise (Turner et al., 2019) because histomorphometric evaluation and gene expression analyses failed to detect spaceflight-induced changes in other regions of the skeleton following this 4-day mission (Backup et al., 1994; Turner, 1995; Turner et al., 1995). Since the rats were very young and rapidly growing, it is likely that the lower cancellous bone volume fraction in the femoral head of the flight animals was due to reduced bone accrual. However, we cannot verify this because baseline controls were not available for analysis. We analyzed femoral heads from rats flown aboard STS-57 and STS-62 to determine whether the results obtained for STS-41 are generalizable across sex and strain. Consistent with the original observation in male Sprague Dawley rats flown aboard STS-41, spaceflight resulted in osteopenia in the femoral head in male Fisher 344 rats flown aboard STS-57 and in ovx female Fisher 344 rats flown aboard STS-62. However, the magnitude of response appeared to be smaller in the latter two studies. Compared to ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction in flight rats was −46% in STS-41, −11% in STS-57 and -16% in STS-62. To address the possibility of error in the initial analysis, a different observer blinded to treatment re-measured the μCT scans of the femoral head in rats flown aboard STS-41. The comparable results of the 2nd analysis excludes measurement error but does not provide additional insight. Based on absence of reduction in longitudinal bone growth, absence of reduction in mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins, and absence of histomorphometric evidence for decreased bone formation at multiple skeletal sites assessed, the most likely explanation for the dramatic osteopenia in femoral head in rats from STS-41 is increased bone resorption (Backup et al., 1994; Turner, 1995; Turner et al., 1995). It remains unclear, however, whether the more modest osteopenia in rats flown aboard STS-57 and STS-62 compared to their respective flight controls reflects differences due to strain, age, duration of flight, or other factors. However, it is notable that BV/TV in ovx female rats flown aboard STS-62 was lower than baseline controls, indicating net bone loss contributed to the osteopenia. There is evidence for location-specific (e.g., appendicular versus axial) and compartment-specific (e.g., cancellous versus cortical) effects of microgravity on bone microarchitecture (Keune et al., 2015). Mechanistic inference is challenging because of the limited number of studies and variation in experimental design and endpoints used to evaluate the bone response to spaceflight (Turner, 2000). Variables in design include age at launch, strain, duration of flight, housing conditions during flight, and interval of time between reloading and necropsy (Morey-Holton et al., 2000; Vico et al., 1993; Wronski et al., 1987; Zerath et al., 2000). In general, investigators have had limited access to tissues (often a single bone). As for endpoints, histomorphometric analysis was the principle method available for evaluation of bone architecture during the interval when most spaceflight studies using rats as models were performed (1970s–1990s) (Keune et al., 2015). In this regard, we have been very fortunate in being able to analyze archived femur, humerus, lumbar vertebra and calvarium from ovx female Fisher 344 rats flown on STS-62 (Keune et al., 2015). Additionally, we measured dynamic and static histomorphometry in tibia and lumbar vertebra in rats from this flight (Cavolina et al., 1997; Keune et al., 2015; Keune et al., 2016; Westerlind et al., 1997). This wealth of material allows a more complete description of site-specific effects of spaceflight on the skeleton. Compared to ground-based flight controls, flight animals had lower cancellous bone volume fraction in femur at all sites evaluated (head, distal metaphysis and distal epiphysis) but showed no change in cortical thickness (proximal femur and mid-diaphysis). Additionally, the effects of spaceflight were bone-specific, with cancellous bone loss being detected in femur and lumbar vertebra but not in humerus. Although fewer skeletal sites were reported, differential effects of a 15-day spaceflight on cancellous bone in the femur head (lower BV/TV in flight animals) and cortical bone thickness in the femur neck (no change) were also noted in C57BL/6 J mice (Blaber et al., 2014). While suitable for assessing bone microarchitecture, μCT provides limited insight into the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the site-specific alterations in bone occurring during spaceflight. Histomorphometric analysis of bones of rats flown on STS-62 suggests differential responses at cortical and cancellous bone sites. Specifically, spaceflight resulted in decreased periosteal bone formation in weight-bearing bone (Cavolina et al., 1997), likely contributing to decreased bone mineral content (Keune et al., 2015). Reduced bone formation at the periosteum was associated with lower mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins (Cavolina et al., 1997). Decreased bone formation was also commonly detected in longer duration flights (>7 days) in male rats (Backup et al., 1994; Durnova et al., 1996; Morey and Baylink, 1978; Turner, 2000; Vico et al., 1993; Wronski and Morey, 1983). In contrast, the effect of spaceflight on bone formation at cancellous sites is less clear (Jee et al., 1983; Wronski et al., 1987, Wronski et al., 1998; Zerath et al., 2000). The most detailed analyses to date were performed on rats flown aboard STS-62. In these ovx female animals, cancellous bone loss in tibia (Cavolina et al., 1997) and lumbar vertebra (Keune et al., 2015) in excess of that attributable to ovx resulted from increased bone resorption, as ascertained by fluorochrome label disappearance, with no change in bone formation, as ascertained by static and dynamic bone histomorphometry. Finite element modeling of distal femur in these rats, as well as a theoretical model based on fuzzy decision, suggest that mechanical strain modulates the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Specifically, the overall rate of bone turnover was influenced by endocrine status but bone loss occurred preferentially at sites experiencing low mechanical strain energies (Luo et al., 2000; Westerlind et al., 1997). At the molecular level, expression levels of two cytokines known to increase bone resorption, interleukin-1beta and interferon gamma, were elevated in proximal tibial metaphysis (Zhang and Turner, 1998). In recent years, the mouse has become the exclusive rodent model flown on spaceflight missions. However, there remains a paucity of publications detailing the skeletal response of mice to microgravity (Blaber et al., 2014; Gerbaix et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2020; Tavella et al., 2012). Smith et al. reported osteopenia in the distal femur of growing female BALB/c mice following spaceflight (Smith et al., 2020). As mentioned, Blaber et al. reported changes in BV/TV in femoral head of 16-week-old female C57BL/6 J mice following a 15-day spaceflight (Blaber et al., 2014) that were similar in magnitude to changes observed in ovx female Fisher 344 rats following a 14 day spaceflight. In the ovx female rats, cancellous osteopenia in the flight animals was primarily due to lower trabecular thickness, whereas in ovary-intact mice both trabecular number and thickness were lower in flight animals compared to ground controls. The proximal femur is clinically relevant but not commonly evaluated in animal models. Low trauma fractures are common in the femoral neck of individuals with osteoporosis (Tsuda, 2017). Fractures occur at several locations in the proximal femur, including intertrochanteric region, transcervical neck, subcapital neck, and subtrochanteric region. Fractures occurring through the femoral head, the site investigated in this study, are more typically associated with trauma and are particularly difficult to manage (Scolaro et al., 2017). That being said, traumatic injury would be the likely cause of fracture during a spaceflight mission and a microgravity-induced reduction in bone volume fraction at this site would likely reduce the magnitude of trauma required for fracture. This conclusion is supported by studies demonstrating that spaceflight and simulated spaceflight result in lower mechanical competence (Patterson-Buckendahl et al., 1987; Shirazi-Fard et al., 2013; Spengler et al., 1983; Zernicke et al., 1990). In summary, spaceflight ranging from 4 to 14 days in duration in two strains of growing male rats (Sprague Dawley and Fisher 344) and in growing ovx female Fisher 344 rats resulted in osteopenia in the femoral head. It is noteworthy that significant bone loss during long duration spaceflight in astronauts occurs in the proximal femur. Thus, future studies performed in skeletally-mature animals should carefully evaluate this clinically relevant site.",

Copyright notice ID: 7907224 PMID: 33665238 Abstract Mechanical loading of the skeleton during normal weight bearing plays an important role in bone accrual and turnover balance. We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. Cancellous microarchitecture and cortical thickness were assessed using x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography. In male rats, cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume) was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls, but differences were not significant compared to baseline. In ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. Cortical thickness did not differ among groups in either experiment. In summary, findings from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats. Keywords: Spaceflight, Proximal femur, Bone microarchitecture, X-ray microtomography/micro-computed tomography, Bone volume/tissue volume, RatHighlights •Spaceflight resulted in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats. •Osteopenia was observed in female ovariectomized and male Fisher 344 rats. •The femoral head should be evaluated in future spaceflight experiments. 1. Introduction Life on Earth evolved in the presence of a nearly uniform gravitational field (Turner, 2000). Not surprisingly, the near absence of ‘weight’ during orbital spaceflight results in profound adaptive responses in multiple organ systems, including the skeleton. Abnormalities in bone and mineral homeostasis in astronauts during spaceflight result in net bone loss (Sibonga, 2013). Although it is unclear whether the changes in bone metabolism are self-limiting, evidence to date in animals and humans indicates that long-duration space missions will be detrimental to bone. Animal studies, done primarily in rodents, are important for modeling the effects of spaceflight at all stages of skeletal maturation. Studies to date have investigated the effects of spaceflight on bone accrual and turnover balance at a variety of weight bearing, load bearing, and unloaded skeletal sites in growing rodents (Bikle and Halloran, 1999; Turner, 2000). However, the majority of spaceflight experiments using rodents, primarily rats, were performed prior to wide spread availability of x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography (μCT) (Keune et al., 2015). Consequently, limited information is available regarding the effects of spaceflight on bone microarchitecture. The proximal tibia and distal femur are commonly evaluated following spaceflight. In contrast, the effects of spaceflight on proximal femur is much less commonly reported. Bone changes can occur at many skeletal sites but the greatest loss in astronauts is detected in the lower body and, in particular, the proximal femur (Keyak et al., 2009; Lang et al., 2006; Sibonga et al., 2007). In one of the few studies investigating multiple skeletal compartments, we analyzed gene expression in distal epiphysis, distal metaphysis, diaphysis, and proximal region of the femur following a 14-day spaceflight (STS-58) in growing male rats. Notably, we found that the proximal region of the femur exhibited the largest reduction in mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins (Evans et al., 1998). Based on this initial observation, we evaluated bone architecture (using μCT) in the proximal region of the femoral head of archived bone specimens from rapidly growing male Sprague Dawley rats flown aboard STS-41 (Turner et al., 2019), and observed strikingly lower cancellous bone volume fraction in the flight animals. The cancellous osteopenia was a surprise because of the short duration (4 days) of the spaceflight mission. To determine the generalizability of this finding across sex and strain, we assessed bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in archived bone specimens from two additional spaceflight experiments, STS-57 and STS-62. STS-57 was a 10-day mission performed using growing male Fisher 344 rats and STS-62 was a 14-day mission using growing ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats.2. Methods STS-57 was a Shuttle-SPACEHAB mission of Space Shuttle Endeavour. The mission launched June 21, 1993 from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats were flown on the flight. The experimental protocol was approved by the NASA Animal Care and Use Committee and flight details have been published (Westerlind and Turner, 1995). In brief, the rats were randomized into one of three groups: baseline control (baseline, n = 6), ground-based flight control (flight control, n = 12), or spaceflight (flight, n = 12). The baseline group was euthanized on day of launch. The flight animals were flown for 10 days. Flight control rats were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs) (Moyer et al., 2016) identical to those housing the flight animals and temperature, humidity and light levels adjusted to values in flight AEMs. All animals were provided with NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Foodbar (NuRFB) (Sun et al., 2010; Tou et al., 2003) and water ad libitum. Flight animals were euthanized 5–8 h after landing by decapitation and femora were removed, fixed overnight in 10% formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for evaluation. STS-62 was a Space Shuttle program mission flown aboard Space Shuttle Columbia that launched March 4, 1994. 12-week-old ovx female Fisher 344 rats were used in the study. The experimental protocol was approved by the NASA Animal Care and Use Committee and flight details have been published (Cavolina et al., 1997). In brief, the female rats were ovx 14 days prior to launch and randomized into one of three groups: baseline control (baseline, n = 6), ground-based flight control (flight control, n = 12), or spaceflight (flight, n = 12). The baseline group was euthanized on day of launch. The flight animals were housed in AEMs and flown for 14 days. Flight control rats were housed in AEMs and temperature, humidity and light levels were adjusted to values in flight AEMs. Flight and flight control rats were provided with food (AEM NuRFB) and water ad libitum. Flight animals were euthanized 4–6 h after landing. Asynchronous groups of ovary-intact vivarium-housed rats on a standard rat chow diet were euthanized to provide age-matched reference values for baseline and flight. The asynchronous component of the study was approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) where the study was performed. The purpose of the ovary-intact controls was to evaluate normal age-related changes in bone over the 14-day flight period and to verify that ovx resulted in cancellous osteopenia. All rats were euthanized by decapitation and femora were removed, fixed overnight in 10% formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for evaluation. 2.1. Micro-computed tomography Bone volume and microarchitecture were assessed using a Scanco μCT scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12x12x12 microns, 55 kVp X-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time. Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. Bone segmentation was conducted at a threshold value of 245 (gray scale, 0–1000) determined empirically. In both studies, a sample of 20 slices (240 μm) of cancellous bone was assessed in the proximal half of the femoral head as previously described (Turner et al., 2019). Automated irregular manual contouring was used to delineate cancellous from cortical bone. Direct cancellous bone measurements included cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume, %), connectivity density (mm−3), trabecular thickness (μm), trabecular number (mm−1), and trabecular separation (μm). In addition, 62 slices (744 μm) of cortical bone were assessed 690 slices (8.3 mm) distal to the top of femoral head and cortical thickness (μm) measured.2.2. Statistical analysis Mean comparisons of quantitative variables (e.g., bone volume fraction) for the spaceflight, flight control, and baseline groups were made using separate one-way analysis of variance models for data from male and female rats. The mean structure of both models was specified as α*Spaceflight + β*Flight Control + γ*Baseline. The linear model conditions of normality and equal variance were assessed numerically using Anderson-Darling and Levene's tests, and graphically using boxplots, dotplots, normal quantile plots, and residual plots. Dunnett's procedure determined adjusted P-values for comparing mean outcomes of the spaceflight group to both the baseline and flight control groups. All data are reported as mean ± SE with individual values presented. Differences are considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Data analysis was performed using R version 3.4.3.3. Results The effects of spaceflight on cancellous bone microarchitecture in the femoral head and cortical thickness in the proximal femur diaphysis in 7.5-week-old Fisher 344 male rats flown on STS-57 for 10 days are shown in Fig. 1. Flight rats had lower cancellous bone volume fraction compared to flight control rats (A). Flight rats also had lower connectivity density (B) and higher trabecular separation (E) compared to baseline rats. Significant differences among groups were not detected for any of the remaining cancellous endpoints evaluated. Significant differences in cortical thickness were likewise not detected among groups (F).

Discussion Rodents—historically rats and more recently mice—are the primary animal model for investigating the effects and underlying mechanisms of action of spaceflight on the skeleton. Here we report data showing that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in the proximal femoral head in rapidly growing male Fisher 344 rats and slowly growing ovx female Fisher 344 rats. The observed osteopenia in the femoral head following spaceflight supports the results of a 4-day study performed in very rapidly growing male Sprague-Dawley rats (STS-41). Spaceflight studies performed in C57BL/6 J mice (Blaber et al., 2014) suggest that this response may not be limited to rats. The dramatically lower cancellous bone volume fraction noted in the femoral head of rats flown aboard STS-41 was a surprise (Turner et al., 2019) because histomorphometric evaluation and gene expression analyses failed to detect spaceflight-induced changes in other regions of the skeleton following this 4-day mission (Backup et al., 1994; Turner, 1995; Turner et al., 1995). Since the rats were very young and rapidly growing, it is likely that the lower cancellous bone volume fraction in the femoral head of the flight animals was due to reduced bone accrual. However, we cannot verify this because baseline controls were not available for analysis. We analyzed femoral heads from rats flown aboard STS-57 and STS-62 to determine whether the results obtained for STS-41 are generalizable across sex and strain. Consistent with the original observation in male Sprague Dawley rats flown aboard STS-41, spaceflight resulted in osteopenia in the femoral head in male Fisher 344 rats flown aboard STS-57 and in ovx female Fisher 344 rats flown aboard STS-62. However, the magnitude of response appeared to be smaller in the latter two studies. Compared to ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction in flight rats was −46% in STS-41, −11% in STS-57 and -16% in STS-62. To address the possibility of error in the initial analysis, a different observer blinded to treatment re-measured the μCT scans of the femoral head in rats flown aboard STS-41. The comparable results of the 2nd analysis excludes measurement error but does not provide additional insight. Based on absence of reduction in longitudinal bone growth, absence of reduction in mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins, and absence of histomorphometric evidence for decreased bone formation at multiple skeletal sites assessed, the most likely explanation for the dramatic osteopenia in femoral head in rats from STS-41 is increased bone resorption (Backup et al., 1994; Turner, 1995; Turner et al., 1995). It remains unclear, however, whether the more modest osteopenia in rats flown aboard STS-57 and STS-62 compared to their respective flight controls reflects differences due to strain, age, duration of flight, or other factors. However, it is notable that BV/TV in ovx female rats flown aboard STS-62 was lower than baseline controls, indicating net bone loss contributed to the osteopenia. There is evidence for location-specific (e.g., appendicular versus axial) and compartment-specific (e.g., cancellous versus cortical) effects of microgravity on bone microarchitecture (Keune et al., 2015). Mechanistic inference is challenging because of the limited number of studies and variation in experimental design and endpoints used to evaluate the bone response to spaceflight (Turner, 2000). Variables in design include age at launch, strain, duration of flight, housing conditions during flight, and interval of time between reloading and necropsy (Morey-Holton et al., 2000; Vico et al., 1993; Wronski et al., 1987; Zerath et al., 2000). In general, investigators have had limited access to tissues (often a single bone). As for endpoints, histomorphometric analysis was the principle method available for evaluation of bone architecture during the interval when most spaceflight studies using rats as models were performed (1970s–1990s) (Keune et al., 2015). In this regard, we have been very fortunate in being able to analyze archived femur, humerus, lumbar vertebra and calvarium from ovx female Fisher 344 rats flown on STS-62 (Keune et al., 2015). Additionally, we measured dynamic and static histomorphometry in tibia and lumbar vertebra in rats from this flight (Cavolina et al., 1997; Keune et al., 2015; Keune et al., 2016; Westerlind et al., 1997). This wealth of material allows a more complete description of site-specific effects of spaceflight on the skeleton. Compared to ground-based flight controls, flight animals had lower cancellous bone volume fraction in femur at all sites evaluated (head, distal metaphysis and distal epiphysis) but showed no change in cortical thickness (proximal femur and mid-diaphysis). Additionally, the effects of spaceflight were bone-specific, with cancellous bone loss being detected in femur and lumbar vertebra but not in humerus. Although fewer skeletal sites were reported, differential effects of a 15-day spaceflight on cancellous bone in the femur head (lower BV/TV in flight animals) and cortical bone thickness in the femur neck (no change) were also noted in C57BL/6 J mice (Blaber et al., 2014). While suitable for assessing bone microarchitecture, μCT provides limited insight into the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the site-specific alterations in bone occurring during spaceflight. Histomorphometric analysis of bones of rats flown on STS-62 suggests differential responses at cortical and cancellous bone sites. Specifically, spaceflight resulted in decreased periosteal bone formation in weight-bearing bone (Cavolina et al., 1997), likely contributing to decreased bone mineral content (Keune et al., 2015). Reduced bone formation at the periosteum was associated with lower mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins (Cavolina et al., 1997). Decreased bone formation was also commonly detected in longer duration flights (>7 days) in male rats (Backup et al., 1994; Durnova et al., 1996; Morey and Baylink, 1978; Turner, 2000; Vico et al., 1993; Wronski and Morey, 1983). In contrast, the effect of spaceflight on bone formation at cancellous sites is less clear (Jee et al., 1983; Wronski et al., 1987, Wronski et al., 1998; Zerath et al., 2000). The most detailed analyses to date were performed on rats flown aboard STS-62. In these ovx female animals, cancellous bone loss in tibia (Cavolina et al., 1997) and lumbar vertebra (Keune et al., 2015) in excess of that attributable to ovx resulted from increased bone resorption, as ascertained by fluorochrome label disappearance, with no change in bone formation, as ascertained by static and dynamic bone histomorphometry. Finite element modeling of distal femur in these rats, as well as a theoretical model based on fuzzy decision, suggest that mechanical strain modulates the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Specifically, the overall rate of bone turnover was influenced by endocrine status but bone loss occurred preferentially at sites experiencing low mechanical strain energies (Luo et al., 2000; Westerlind et al., 1997). At the molecular level, expression levels of two cytokines known to increase bone resorption, interleukin-1beta and interferon gamma, were elevated in proximal tibial metaphysis (Zhang and Turner, 1998). In recent years, the mouse has become the exclusive rodent model flown on spaceflight missions. However, there remains a paucity of publications detailing the skeletal response of mice to microgravity (Blaber et al., 2014; Gerbaix et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2020; Tavella et al., 2012). Smith et al. reported osteopenia in the distal femur of growing female BALB/c mice following spaceflight (Smith et al., 2020). As mentioned, Blaber et al. reported changes in BV/TV in femoral head of 16-week-old female C57BL/6 J mice following a 15-day spaceflight (Blaber et al., 2014) that were similar in magnitude to changes observed in ovx female Fisher 344 rats following a 14 day spaceflight. In the ovx female rats, cancellous osteopenia in the flight animals was primarily due to lower trabecular thickness, whereas in ovary-intact mice both trabecular number and thickness were lower in flight animals compared to ground controls. The proximal femur is clinically relevant but not commonly evaluated in animal models. Low trauma fractures are common in the femoral neck of individuals with osteoporosis (Tsuda, 2017). Fractures occur at several locations in the proximal femur, including intertrochanteric region, transcervical neck, subcapital neck, and subtrochanteric region. Fractures occurring through the femoral head, the site investigated in this study, are more typically associated with trauma and are particularly difficult to manage (Scolaro et al., 2017). That being said, traumatic injury would be the likely cause of fracture during a spaceflight mission and a microgravity-induced reduction in bone volume fraction at this site would likely reduce the magnitude of trauma required for fracture. This conclusion is supported by studies demonstrating that spaceflight and simulated spaceflight result in lower mechanical competence (Patterson-Buckendahl et al., 1987; Shirazi-Fard et al., 2013; Spengler et al., 1983; Zernicke et al., 1990). In summary, spaceflight ranging from 4 to 14 days in duration in two strains of growing male rats (Sprague Dawley and Fisher 344) and in growing ovx female Fisher 344 rats resulted in osteopenia in the femoral head. It is noteworthy that significant bone loss during long duration spaceflight in astronauts occurs in the proximal femur. Thus, future studies performed in skeletally-mature animals should carefully evaluate this clinically relevant site.Declaration of interest The authors have no conflict of interest.CRediT authorship contribution statement Conceptualization: RT Data Collection: AG, DO, LS Data analysis: AB Drafting manuscript: AG Revising manuscript content: RT, AB, DO, LS, UI, and AG Approving final version: RT, AB, DO, LS, UI, and AG RT takes responsibility for the integrity of the data.Footnotes ☆Funding: This work was supported by NASA (80NSSC19K0430 and NNX15AL15G).
