    "abstract": "Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. Subject terms: Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones",
    "introduction": "Introduction The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21 and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.",
    "methods": "Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity. Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63 was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900) and OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900) in the Zhonghua11 background and OsEBF2, OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700), OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) in the crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) of each gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into the BsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCRW1::OsCRW1, proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06g0619600::Os06g0619600, we amplified the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1, 3 Kb of proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1, Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from the pUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generate pOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 promoter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we amplified the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1, 2500 bp of proOsEIL2) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the BamHI/SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) and proUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we amplified the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation64. Transformants were verified by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65, proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP14, or NES-YC3.665 were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 or oscrw1KO lines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant background by PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments. Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66 for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm) of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl3 (100 μM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponic experiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experiments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments. MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1 progenies. F1 progenies were selfed to generate F2 progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2 plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50× and 30× coverage for crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150-bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP-index method69 and candidate SNPs were identified. Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation. Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 or GFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82), we amplified the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 or OsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of the pSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI-PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nm and 360 nm for excitation, respectively. Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol’s solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol’s stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution. Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+ (NES-YC3.6, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively65. TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7-OsEIL1 or pGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) for growth. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221-P3P2, and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were transferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter of OsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-boxmut, ACCACC; G-boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 or OsERF82, and pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins were purified from E. coli by nickel affinity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence of OsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The protein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at 4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-linking, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP™ ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for each experiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde under vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and fragmented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of the yield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNA complex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime, P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028, China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform agent for DNA purification (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequences on the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and purified DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR. Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp-deficient SD medium and double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X-α-gal) for growth. RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html). RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA to 20 μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2–Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3. Statistics and reproducibility The experiments performed in this study were repeated independently at least three times with similar results. The data are presented as the mean ± SD and the microscope images presented are the most representative of the results. The significance of the difference between two sets of data was tested by one- or two-sided Student’s t-test using Microsoft Excel 2019. The difference among more than two sets of data was analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test as post hoc analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

    "results": "Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). Fig. 1. crw1 shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil. Open in a new tab a–d Seedlings of WT and crw1 were grown in water or soil for 2 days. a Root phenotypes. b Root caps. c Lugol’s staining of amyloplast. d, e Responses of WT and crw1 roots to gravity stimulation. Seedlings of WT and crw1 were grown in water or soil for 1 day, and roots were placed horizontally for another 9-hour growth. d Root phenotypes. e Growth angle of root tip at 9 h. The direction of each root tip was measured as the absolute value toward the direction of gravity. The frequency was calculated as the proportion of root number that fell within 15° to the total number of analyzed roots for WT and crw1. f, g Auxin distribution of root tips indicated by expressing DR5rev::VENUS (green fluorescence). f WT and crw1 grow in water or soil for two days. g When growing in water, the auxin of crw1 root tips is consistently asymmetrically distributed. The red fluorescence of propidium iodide (PI) indicates cell wall. White dashes outline the root tip of crw1 and the white arrow with g indicates the direction of gravity. h Localization of OsPIN2-GFP of epidermis at 1 mm from the root tip focusing on the left (L), middle (M) or right (R) side of the root. WT and crw1 expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP grew in water or soil for two days. Scale bars are 1 cm in (a, d), 100 μm in (b, c, f, g) and 20 μm in (h). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c–h), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i–n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic The coiling phenotype of crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placed horizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11. To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells in crw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VENUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). In Arabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT and crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost in crw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization. Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F1 plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F2 progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (χ2 = 0.002, P = 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identified Os06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KO lines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).

In roots, OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h). Transient expression of p35S::GFP-OsCRW1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2i). Elevated ethylene response in crw1 when grown in hydroponic OsCRW1 encodes an F-box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (AtEBF1)27,28. Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF238, and loss of function of OsEBF1 or OsEBF2 led to a hypersensitivity of root and coleoptile to exogenous ethylene38, and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice39,40. To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1KO lines in water (Fig. 3c–f), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.The above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, like Arabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF141,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. 4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil-vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm−3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30 Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2KO/crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.

In (d, g), different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). In (k, l), significant difference from WT at *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, respectively (Student’s t-test, one-sided). Scale bars, 1 cm. Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis43. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e). OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. 17d–f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water. The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved. OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS-responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS46 and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG)47 (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes. Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying amplified ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impaired gravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown in water-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm−3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue the crw1 phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar-solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3 – 1.2%, mass/volume). crw1 showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1 - 6 Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig. 2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19 Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8 – 1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34 – 77 Pa) (Fig. 6a–c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed when crw1 plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10° angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig. 22). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥ 34 Pa is sufficient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. Fig. 6.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip of crw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. The resistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to be approximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment of foam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin distribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribution and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhibition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling. Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49. To investigate whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. Fig. 7.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+ signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl3, a Ca2+ channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl3 suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl3 abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca2+ signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μM LaCl3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3 (Supplementary Fig. 28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism. The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30g).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. Open in a new tab The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html). The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212, aux113, eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53 and gravity signaling6,7 cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil.",

Copyright notice ID: 12008199 PMID: 40251159 Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. Subject terms: Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones This study demonstrated that amplified ethylene signaling impairs gravitropic growth of rice roots by affecting root cap stability and OsPIN2 polar localization, whereas mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to safeguard gravitropism.Introduction The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21 and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). Fig. 1. crw1 shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil.

The direction of each root tip was measured as the absolute value toward the direction of gravity.

WT and crw1 expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP grew in water or soil for two days. Scale bars are 1 cm in (a, d), 100 μm in (b, c, f, g) and 20 μm in (h). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c–h), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i–n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic The coiling phenotype of crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placed horizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11. To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells in crw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VENUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). In Arabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT and crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost in crw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization.Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F1 plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F2 progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (χ2 = 0.002, P = 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identified Os06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KO lines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).

Significant difference from WT was determined by two-sided Student’s t-test. Scale bars are 1 cm in (e and c), 1 mm in (g), 200 μm in (h) and 20 μm in (i). The data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 11). In roots, OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h). Transient expression of p35S::GFP-OsCRW1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2i).Elevated ethylene response in crw1 when grown in hydroponic OsCRW1 encodes an F-box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (AtEBF1)27,28. Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF238, and loss of function of OsEBF1 or OsEBF2 led to a hypersensitivity of root and coleoptile to exogenous ethylene38, and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice39,40. To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1KO lines in water (Fig. 3c–f), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.

These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF141,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. 4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil-vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm−3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30 Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2KO/crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis43. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e).OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. 17d–f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water. The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved.OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS-responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS46 and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG)47 (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes.Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying amplified ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impaired gravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown in water-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm−3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue the crw1 phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar-solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3 – 1.2%, mass/volume). crw1 showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1 - 6 Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig. 2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19 Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8 – 1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34 – 77 Pa) (Fig. 6a–c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed when crw1 plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10° angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig. 22). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥ 34 Pa is sufficient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. Fig. 6. Gentle mechanical resistance on the root tip rescues the root coiling phenotype of crw1.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip of crw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. The resistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to be approximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment of foam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin distribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribution and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhibition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling.Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49. To investigate whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. Fig. 7. Mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism in crw1.

Different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05 (two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). Scale bars are 1 cm in (g) and 100 μm in (a, c, e, f). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+ signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl3, a Ca2+ channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl3 suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl3 abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca2+ signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μM LaCl3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3 (Supplementary Fig. 28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism.The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30g).Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. Open in a new tab The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html).The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212, aux113, eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53 and gravity signaling6,7 cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil.Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity.Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63 was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900) and OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900) in the Zhonghua11 background and OsEBF2, OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700), OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) in the crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) of each gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into the BsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCRW1::OsCRW1, proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06g0619600::Os06g0619600, we amplified the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1, 3 Kb of proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1, Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from the pUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generate pOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 promoter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we amplified the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1, 2500 bp of proOsEIL2) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the BamHI/SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) and proUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we amplified the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation64. Transformants were verified by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65, proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP14, or NES-YC3.665 were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 or oscrw1KO lines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant background by PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments.Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66 for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm) of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl3 (100 μM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponic experiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experiments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments.MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1 progenies. F1 progenies were selfed to generate F2 progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2 plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50× and 30× coverage for crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150-bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP-index method69 and candidate SNPs were identified.Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation.Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 or GFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82), we amplified the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 or OsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of the pSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI-PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nm and 360 nm for excitation, respectively.Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol’s solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol’s stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution.Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+ (NES-YC3.6, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively65.TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively.Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7-OsEIL1 or pGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) for growth.Bimolecular fluorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221-P3P2, and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were transferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively.Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter of OsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-boxmut, ACCACC; G-boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 or OsERF82, and pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins were purified from E. coli by nickel affinity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence of OsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The protein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at 4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-linking, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP™ ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for each experiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde under vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and fragmented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of the yield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNA complex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime, P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028, China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform agent for DNA purification (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequences on the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and purified DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR.Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp-deficient SD medium and double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X-α-gal) for growth.RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html).RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA to 20 μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2–Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.Statistics and reproducibility The experiments performed in this study were repeated independently at least three times with similar results. The data are presented as the mean ± SD and the microscope images presented are the most representative of the results. The significance of the difference between two sets of data was tested by one- or two-sided Student’s t-test using Microsoft Excel 2019. The difference among more than two sets of data was analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test as post hoc analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (15.5MB, pdf) 41467_2025_59047_MOESM2_ESM.docx (11.8KB, docx) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Movie 1 (13.5MB, mp4) Reporting Summary (2.5MB, pdf) Transparent Peer Review file (619.8KB, pdf) Source data Source Data (6.3MB, xlsx) Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Chuanzao Mao of Zhejiang University for providing seeds of proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP and Dr. Wei Xuan of Nanjing Agricultural University for providing seeds of DR5rev::VENUS.

    "abstract": "Significance This work documents a previously unreported plant-wide signaling system based on the rapid, long-distance transmission of Ca2+ waves. In the root these waves move through the cortical and endodermal cell layers at speeds of up to 400 µm/s, i.e., traversing several cells per second. This Ca2+ wave system correlates with the triggering of molecular responses in distant parts of the plant upon perception of localized (salt) stress. Such propagating Ca2+ waves provide a new mechanism for the rapid integration of activities throughout the plant body. Keywords: Ca2+ signaling, Yellow Cameleon, Two Pore Channel 1",

    "methods": "Materials and Methods Plant Growth and Transformation. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia 0 and the mutants used in this study (tpc1-1, tpc1-2, tpc1-4, OxTPC1/TPC1 10.21) were surface sterilized and germinated on half-strength Epstein’s medium containing 10 mM sucrose and 0.5% (wt/vol) phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.7, as described previously (28). Plants were grown under a long-day (LD) cycle of 16 h light/8 h dark at 22 °C. Ten-day-old seedlings were transplanted to SunshineRedi-earth soil (Sun Gro Horticulture) and were grown under cool white fluorescent lights (75–88 µE⋅m−2⋅s−1) at 22 °C under the LD light cycle. Plant transformation was carried out essentially as in ref. 29 using midlogarithmic cultures (A600 = 0.6) of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring the binary vector YCNano-65/pEarleyGage100 that encoded YCNano-65 (see below for details of this vector), resuspended in half strength Epstein’s medium containing 5% (wt/vol) sucrose and 0.05% (vol/vol) Silwet-L77 (Lehle Seeds). Transformed plants were covered with a clear plastic cover overnight. A second transformation on the same plants was carried out 1 wk later. Plants were then grown under LD conditions until seed set and harvest. Selection of transformants expressing YCNano-65 was made using an epifluorescence dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ1500 Stereoscope) using a GFP filter set (excitation, 450–490 nm; dichroic mirror, 495 nm; emission, 500–550 nm). Multiple independent lines were selected, selfed, and the T2 or greater generation used for subsequent imaging. All results were confirmed on multiple independent lines. All YCNano-65–expressing lines used showed equivalent growth and development to their untransformed counterparts. tpc1-1, tpc1-2, tpc1-4, and OxTPC1 were kindly provided by Edgar Peiter (Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany) and Dale Sanders (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK). Abiotic Stress and Inhibitor Treatment. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing the YCNano-65 FRET sensor were grown on a thin layer of gel (∼2 mm thick) containing half-strength Epstein’s medium supplemented with 0.5% (wt/vol) phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mM sucrose, under LD conditions at 22 °C for 6 d. A small window (∼500 µm × 500 µm) was removed from the gel at the tip of the root to expose the apical ∼50 µm of the root to allow precise application of 100 mM NaCl (salt stress), 100 µM H2O2 (ROS stress), chilled medium at 4 °C (cold stress), or 200 mM d-sorbitol (control equivalent to the osmotic stress from 100 mM NaCl). Touch stress was applied using contact with a glass micropipette as previously described (30). For inhibitor treatments, a small window (∼500 µm × 500 µm) was also made in the gel in the middle region of the root, shootward of the root tip window. Ten microliters of 25 µM LaCl3 (putative plasma membrane channel blocker) or RuRed (putative antagonist of internal sites of Ca2+ release) were added either in the root tip gel window or to the middle gel window (see diagram in Fig. 4A) 30 min before salt treatment of the root tip as indicated for each experiment. Arabidopsis seedlings pretreated with pharmaceutical inhibitors were kept in a humid Petri dish until confocal imaging. Confocal Image Analysis of in Vivo Ca2+ Changes. Stable transgenic lines expressing YCNano-65 under the control of CaMV35S promoter were grown under sterile conditions in a thin layer (∼2 mm) of half-strength Epstein’s medium containing 0.5% (wt/vol) phytagel and 10 mM sucrose on a no. 1.5 cover glass (24 × 50 mm; Fisher Scientific) for 6 d under LD conditions at 22 °C. Ratio confocal imaging of Ca2+ changes was then performed with an LSM510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) using a Plan-Neofluar 10×/0.3 or 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective as described previously (31). The YCNano-65 Ca2+ sensor was excited with the 458-nm line of an argon laser and CFP (462–505 nm) and cpVenus (FRET, 526–537 nm) emission detected using a 458-nm primary dichroic mirror and the microscope system’s Meta detector. Ca2+ levels were determined from the ratio of the Ca2+-dependent FRET signal to the CFP signal normalized to the FRET-to-CFP ratio from before stress treatment. Quantitative analysis of Ca2+ dynamics (from the ratiometric Ca2+-FRET signal) was performed using iVision-Mac (version 4.0.16) image-processing software (BioVision Technologies) with a custom script for the calculation of the ratiometric FRET signal from region of interests (ROIs). Briefly, quantitative analysis of YCNano-65 data (e.g., Fig. 2) was calculated from the ROIs (4 µm long × 51.2 µm wide, with 1,280 pixels of data) scanned along the root, generating 116 sequential data points covering a total of 464 µm of root length per image. The extracted quantitative ratio numerical data from the sequential confocal images were displayed as a pseudocolor-coded matrix using MultiExperiment Viewer MeV software (version 10.2; ref. 32). Ratio values were converted to absolute [Ca2+]cyt (in nanomolar concentration) using the equation (33), where R is the experimentally monitored FRET/CFP ratio, n is the Hill coefficient (1.6), and the Kd for Ca2+ is 64.8 nM (10). The ratio from Ca2+-saturated reporter (Rmax, 5.33 ± 1.43) was determined by incubating samples with 50% (vol/vol) ethanol and the minimum ratio (Rmin, 0.40 ± 0.04) by incubation with 10 mM EGTA according to ref. 31. The values derived from this in vivo calibration should be taken as approximations due to difficulties inherent in obtaining a robust Rmax and Rmin value and uncertainty in the precise Kd of YCNano-65 in the plant cytoplasmic environment. Monitoring Diffusion Through the Gel. To test for the rate of small-molecule diffusion through the growth medium gel, 50 µM fluorescein was added to a window at the tip of the root as for NaCl local treatment. Fluorescein movement was then monitored with the LSM510 using a 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective. Fluorescein signal was excited with the 488-nm line of the argon laser and emission collected using an HFT 488/543/633 dichroic beam splitter and 500- to 530-nm emission filter. Images were acquired every 4 s for 270 s. Cloning of the YCNano-65 FRET Sensor. For the 35S:YCNano-65 Ca2+ FRET sensor construct, the YCNano-65 FRET cassette fragment from YCNano-65/pcDNA3.1 plasmid (a kind gift from Takeharu Nagai, Osaka University, Osaka) (10) was isolated by digesting with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pENTR11 gateway entry vector (Invitrogen). The resulting YCNano-65/pENTR11 construct was introduced into the plant binary vector pEarleyGate100 (34) by Gateway cloning using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. pEarlyGate 100 has a CaMV35S promoter to drive constitutive expression in plant. The resulting YCNano-65/pEarleyGate100 construct was verified by HindIII endonuclease digestion patterns and DNA sequencing and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using electroporation. Salt Treatment, Total RNA Isolation, and qPCR Analysis. For qPCR analysis, the root tip region of 10-d-old seedlings of WT Col_0, tpc1-1, tpc1-2, tpc1-4, OxTPC1 was covered with an ∼5-mm strip of KimWipe wetted with growth medium and acclimated for at least 1 h. Approximately 20 µL of medium with or without 100 mM NaCl or 25 µM LaCl3 was then added to the KimWipe strip to achieve precise local application as described for each experiment. For the LaCl3 blockade experiments described for Fig. 3, the 25 µM LaCl3 was added to a similar KimWipe strip covering the midregion of the root 30 min before salt stress was applied at the root tip. Root and shoot samples were harvested and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was then isolated from tissue samples (50–200 mg) using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase I treatment using the TURBO DNase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1–2 µg) was reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA in a 40-µL reaction (25–50 ng of total RNA per µL) with the SuperScriptIII first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). qPCR analysis was performed using a Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR System, and analysis was performed with the MxPro qPCR software (Stratagene). The Arabidopsis UBQ10 gene was used as an internal reference for standardization as described previously (35). cDNA proportional to 10 ng of starting total RNA was combined with 200 nM of each primer and 7.5 µL of 2× EvaGreen qPCR master mixed with ROX passive reference dye (Biotium) in a final volume of 15 µL. qPCRs were performed in a 96-well optical PCR plate (ABgene) using the following parameters: 1 cycle of 15 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 58 °C, and 15 s at 65 °C, and 1 cycle of dissociation from 58 to 95 °C with 0.5° increments. Quantitation of expression of the marker genes was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method as described previously (36). The qPCR primers used are described in Table S1. Quantification of Sodium Accumulation. Plants were treated with 100 mM NaCl applied to the root tip as described above and then dissected into root and shoot tissue (∼50 mg). The root tissues were rinsed in deionized water to remove contaminating NaCl from the medium, and then each sample (root and shoot) was digested in 0.6 mL of nitric acid in a glass test tube at 120 °C for 2 h followed by further digestion in 0.4 mL of 60% (vol/vol) HClO4 at 150–180 °C for an additional 2 h or until total sample volume became ≤0.5 mL. The resulting tissue samples were cooled to room temperature and diluted in 5 mL of Nanopure water, and sodium concentration was determined using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2000DV inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Results of Na level in parts per million (in milligrams per liter) was calculated and converted to milligrams per kilogram fresh weight (F.W) using the following equation: Chlorophyll Content Assay. Aerial parts of these seedlings (30–100 mg F.W) were harvested for chlorophyll determination as described previously (37) with slight modification. Briefly, tissue samples in 0.5 mL of 80% (vol/vol) acetone were homogenized using a GENO/GRINDER 2000 (SPEX SamplePrep, LLC) at 1,200 strokes per min for 10 min. The resulting lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C, 1,690 × g for 15 min. The clear supernatant was collected, and chlorophyll content was determined by measuring the absorbance at 652 nm and applying the following equation:",
    "results": "Results Changes in Cytoplasmic Ca2+ Occur in Response to Abiotic Stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in a thin layer of gel and a ∼500 µm × 500 µm region of the gel covering the root apex was removed to allow localized application of treatments to the root tip (Materials and Methods). Consistent with previous studies (reviewed in ref. 9), when a range of abiotic stresses including touch, cold, ROS (H2O2), and NaCl were locally applied to the root tip, we detected rapid and transient Ca2+ increases at the site of treatment that showed stimulus-specific spatial/temporal characteristics (Fig. S1 and Movies S1–S4). However, we observed that, among these treatments, NaCl treatment also led to a propagating Ca2+ increase moving away from the point of stress application (Figs. 1 and 2 and Movie S5). Treatment with 200 mM sorbitol (osmotic control for the 100 mM NaCl stress) did not elicit Ca2+ changes under these conditions (Fig. S1E), suggesting such Ca2+ changes were being specifically elicited by the salt stress.

Ratiometric data of the YCNano-65 Ca2+-dependent FRET/CFP signal was extracted from sequential regions of interest (4 µm × 51.2 µm covering the cortex and endodermis) along the root at 1,000 µm from the local application of 100 mM NaCl. Analysis was repeated on images taken every 0.5 s (WT) and 4 s (tpc1-2) and data from five roots averaged and pseudocolor coded. ROI, region of interest. Salt Stress Induces a Long-Distance Systemic Wave of Increased Ca2+. Local application of salt stress to the root tip induced an increase in Ca2+ that propagated shootward from the site of NaCl stimulation (Figs. 1 and 2). This salt stress-induced elevation in Ca2+ was largely constrained to the cortical and endodermal cell layers (Fig. 1 A and B). Thus, changes were not seen in the epidermal cells even though this tissue is known to generate stimulus-evoked Ca2+ elevations (e.g., ref. 11). In addition, when a lateral root tip was stimulated, a Ca2+ wave also moved through the cortex/endodermis, traveling to the main root and then bidirectionally rootward and shootward (Fig. 1B and Movie S6). This Ca2+ increase eventually traversed to the aerial part of the plant, moving through the hypocotyl (Fig. S2 and Movie S7). Quantitative analysis of the timing of Ca2+ increase in various regions along the root (Fig. 2A) coupled with kymograph-based measurements of rates of Ca2+ increase (Fig. 2C) indicated that the wave front of these Ca2+ changes moved at a steady 395.7 ± 27.8 µm/s (±SD) (Fig. 2 A and C), taking ∼1 min to traverse the entire length of the root system and ∼2 min to spread across the entire length of the Arabidopsis seedlings used in this study. Root Tip Salt Stress Triggers Systemic Molecular Responses in Shoot Tissue. We next used a battery of molecular markers (Table 1) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis to ask whether the long-distance Ca2+ increase we observed in response to this root-applied NaCl stress was accompanied by a systemic shoot response (Fig. 3A). As expected, increased transcript levels of stress-related genes such as RAB18, DREB2A, TCH2, and ZAT12, and the salt stress response genes SOS1 and CBL10 (12) were detectable in the directly salt-stressed root tissues within 1–2 min of treatment (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3A). These rapidly induced genes showed subsequent oscillations in levels, sharing a fall at 10 min and subsequent increase over the 60 min of analysis (Fig. S3A). However, local salt treatment of the root tip also led to an increase in transcript abundance of a number of stress markers in the distant aerial parts of the plant. For example, by 10 min RAB18, DREB2A, TCH2, TCH3, PIP2;3, ZAT12, LOX3, and SID2 levels were significantly increased in the shoot (P < 0.05, t test; Fig. 3A and Fig. S3B). These genes generally showed a peak in transcript level at 10 min that had begun to fall by 30–60 min. Induction of markers such as SOS1, SOS2/CIPK4, SOS3/CBL4, and CBL10 was significant only after 30 min. The vacuolar channel TPC1 was notable in showing a rapid, transient transcript accumulation within 1 min in the shoot (Fig. S3C). In contrast, NaCl treatment led to an equally rapid but sustained decrease in TPC1 transcript levels in the salt-stressed roots.

Chlorophyll content was monitored as an index of plant vitality. Results represent mean ± SEM; n = 3 independent experiments. “a,” “b,” and “c” denote significance (P < 0.05, t test). Bars sharing the same letter are not significantly different.Direct salt movement, either within the growth medium or within the plant, was too slow to explain the induction of such systemic responses in the aerial plant parts. Thus, fluorescein (a small molecule dye) took >2 min to diffuse only 300 µm through the matrix of the growth medium (Fig. S4 A and B), and there was no detectable increase in Na content of shoots, measured via inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, after >10 min of local root NaCl treatment (Fig. S4C). Therefore, the propagation of the Ca2+ wave and induction of systemic molecular responses are unlikely to reflect direct response to salt that had moved from the site of application either through the gel or within the plant. To test whether the transcriptional changes elicited by local salt stress of the root required the Ca2+ wave, we asked whether pharmacological inhibitors that blocked transmission of the Ca2+ wave also blocked distal transcriptional responses. Local application of LaCl3 (putative plasma-membrane Ca2+-channel blocker) or Ruthenium Red (RuRed) (putatively targeting internal Ca2+ release) between the sites of stress application and Ca2+ signal detection (Fig. 4A) inhibited transmission of the Ca2+ signal past this point (Fig. 4). However, if the NaCl stress was applied shootward of the LaCl3 treatment, the propagation of the Ca2+ wave still moved shootward at 397.5 ± 42.1 μm/s (±SEM) (P < 0.05, t test) from the point of NaCl application (Fig. S5). This result indicates that the position of the LaCl3, rather than simply its presence in the root system, appeared to be a key factor in blocking the progression of the Ca2+ wave. Fig. 4.

Results represent mean ± SEM of n ≥ 4 (RuRed and LaCl3) or n = 17 (WT) monitored 1,000 µm from the site of root tip NaCl application.The increase in transcript abundance of genes such as TCH2 and ZAT12 (Fig. 3C) or TCH3, PIP2;3, LOX3, and TPC1 (Fig. S6) seen at 10 min in the shoot in response to root tip NaCl stress was suppressed by the local LaCl3 treatment applied shootward of the site of NaCl application. In contrast, induction of RAB18 and DREB2A (Fig. S6) or SDI2 (Fig. 3C) was left unaffected. These observations are consistent with a requirement for the Ca2+ wave in the triggering of at least part of the systemic molecular regulation seen in response to local root salt stress. The effect of La3+ application on its own is an important control for these experiments. Although we observed that LaCl3 alone could alter transcript levels of some genes (Fig. 3B and Fig. S7), this treatment did not significantly affect the levels of the molecular markers at the 10-min time point used for these experiments (Fig. 3B and Fig. S7). A prolonged suppression of LOX3 and SOS1 transcript levels were a notable exception, and so responses of these markers in La3+ inhibitor experiments must be made with caution (Fig. S7). Long-Distance Ca2+ Signaling Is Dependent on the Vacuolar TWO PORE CHANNEL 1. In animals, Ca2+ waves are often supported by processes involving calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) (13). The slow vacuolar (SV) channel is a large-conductance, voltage-dependent ion channel (reviewed in ref. 14) that is permeable to Ca2+ (15) and has been proposed to mediate plant CICR (15–17), although this idea remains controversial (14). The Arabidopsis SV channel is encoded by a single gene, TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1) (18). In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutants of TPC1 show disrupted stomatal signaling and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation of germination (18) and the gain-of-function fou2 mutant exhibits developmental effects thought to be linked to aberrant defense signaling (19). We therefore tested the hypothesis that the SV channel might play a role in sustaining the salt-induced Ca2+ wave using tpc1 mutants. Previous work measuring Ca2+ changes in a TPC1 knockout expressing the luminescent Ca2+ indicator aequorin indicated no clear disruption of a range of stress-induced Ca2+ changes (20). Consistent with this report, we found that salt stress-induced Ca2+ elevations were not grossly altered in tpc1-2 (a protein null) (18) when monitored at the direct site of stress application, although they did exhibit a slightly delayed onset (Fig. S1 D and E, and Movie S8). However, the speed of transmission of the Ca2+ wave in tpc1-2 was significantly reduced to 15.5 ± 1.9 µm/s (±SD) (P < 0.05, t test; Fig. 2). TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 Mutants Affect Transcript Levels of Stress-Related Genes. qPCR analysis of our panel of stress markers showed that, in response to root tip NaCl treatment, shoot induction of genes such as TCH2 and ZAT12 was significantly attenuated in the tpc1-2 mutant (Fig. 3C and Fig. S8), a pattern confirmed in the knockdown lines tpc1-1 (36% reduction in TPC1 transcript; Fig. S8) and tpc1-4 (21% reduction in TPC1 transcript; Fig. S8). Interestingly, La3+ treatment had a complex interaction with NaCl induction of TCH2 in these backgrounds, leading to a partial recovery of transcript levels. This observation suggests that feedback between vacuolar and plasma membrane Ca2+ fluxes is likely an important element in the transcriptional response of at least TCH2 to salt stress. qPCR analysis also indicated that TPC1 is the most rapidly systemically up-regulated gene we tested, with 10-fold increase in transcript abundance in the shoot within 1–2 min of root salt stress (P < 0.05, t test; Fig. 3A and Fig. S3C). This observation raises the possibility of a self-reinforcing signaling system with Ca2+ wave-related rapid induction of TPC1 amplifying and extending subsequent Ca2+ responses. Consistent with such ideas, markers that were suppressed in tpc1 mutants such as ZAT12 and TCH2 (Fig. 3C and Fig. S8) were constitutively increased above WT in a TPC1 overexpression line (Fig. S9A). This up-regulation of transcript levels was suppressed by La3+ treatment (Fig. S9B), suggesting altered control of Ca2+ homeostasis may link TPC1 levels to transcriptional regulation. Consistent with these ideas, the speed of propagation of the Ca2+ wave in the TPC1 overexpression line was 679 ± 73 µm/s, 1.7-fold faster than WT but was still sensitive to inhibition by LaCl3 (Fig. 3D). TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 Expression Level Affects Whole-Plant Salt Sensitivity. The overexpression line TPC1 10.21 (18), which showed 73- to 130-fold increase in transcript level (Fig. S9C), was more resistant to NaCl stress based on seedling growth and chlorophyll levels after growth on 100 mM NaCl for 7 d (Fig. 3E). Thus, the up-regulation of systemic molecular changes and faster Ca2+ wave signaling observed in the TPC1 transgenic lines correlate with alterations in whole-plant salt stress resistance.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In plants, environmental stimuli including wounding or heat stress have been proposed to elicit long-distance signaling involving mechanisms such as plasma membrane depolarization and self-propagating increases of ROS (1–5, 21, 22). Our results suggest Ca2+-dependent signaling also plays a role in this process of systemic signaling in response to salt stress. Thus, local salt stress of the root tip leads to the spreading of a Ca2+ wave that propagates preferentially through cortical and endodermal cells to distal shoot tissues (Figs. 1 and 2). This Ca2+ wave moves with a velocity of ∼400 µm/s (Fig. 2A), i.e., traversing several cells per second. Local treatment with LaCl3 that blocked the transmission of the Ca2+ wave (Fig. 4) also inhibited subsequent systemic molecular responses (Fig. 3C and Fig. S6). Thus, these patterns of transmission and response are consistent with a model in which the rapidly propagating Ca2+ wave serves as a long-distance signal that triggers systemic responses to local salt stress of the root system. It is important to note that such La3+ treatment itself could inhibit transcription of some genes (Fig. S7). This observation implies that a basal level of La3+-sensitive (likely Ca2+-dependent) signaling between root and shoot may be required to sustain nonstimulated levels of some genes. In addition, although such blocking of the Ca2+ wave could inhibit systemic induction of stress markers such as TCH2, ZAT12 (Fig. 3C), TCH3, and PIP2;3 (Fig. S6) in response to localized salt stress treatment, a similar treatment could not block up-regulation of RAB18 and DREB2A (Fig. S6). These observations suggest additional systemic signals are likely operating in parallel to the Ca2+ wave. Role of the Vacuolar Ion Channel TPC1 in Propagation of the Ca2+ Wave. We found that the rate of propagation of the systemic Ca2+ wave was reduced from 395.7 ± 27.8 µm/s in WT to 15.5 ± 1.9 µm/s in the loss-of-function tpc1-2 mutant (Fig. 2), representing a ∼25-fold reduction in speed. TPC1 encodes the vacuolar SV ion channel that is sensitive to cytosolic Ca2+ levels and to those in the lumen of the vacuole (23), suggesting feedback regulation of this channel by alterations in cytosolic and vacuolar Ca2+ levels could play a role in Ca2+ wave propagation. However, it remains unclear whether TPC1 acts itself as a vacuolar Ca2+ release channel that sustains the Ca2+ wave (14). Thus, TPC1 could be operating more indirectly, through, e.g., altering tonoplast potential and so gating an independent vacuolar Ca2+ conductance. However, effects of tpc1 mutants on both reducing Ca2+ changes and inhibiting the induction of systemic molecular responses such as increase in TCH2 and ZAT12 transcript abundance (Fig. 3C and Fig. S8) are very similar to those of blocking Ca2+ changes with La3+. These observations are consistent with TPC1 actively maintaining the propagation of the Ca2+ wave through an effect on Ca2+ fluxes. In support of these ideas, the TPC1 overexpression line showed Ca2+ wave propagation rates that were 1.7-fold faster than WT (Fig. 3D). The overexpression line also exhibited constitutive elevation of marker genes such as TCH2 and ZAT12 that appear normally dependent for up-regulation on the Ca2+ wave elicited by local salt stress. This constitutive induction was inhibited by the channel blocker La3+ (Fig. S9B), suggesting a link between transcriptional changes modulated by TPC1 and Ca2+-mediated events. Taken together, these results support a model in which local NaCl stress elicits a long-distance Ca2+ wave-mediated signaling system that triggers systemic molecular responses. Furthermore, comparison of WT, tpc1-2, and plants overexpressing TPC1 grown on 100 mM NaCl-containing plates indicated that, by 7 d, the overexpression line was significantly more resistant to this level of salt stress as inferred from plant size and chlorophyll content (Fig. 3E). These observations suggest that the Ca2+ wave system mediated by TPC1 may also be contributing to the whole-plant resistance to salt stress. However, it is important to note that, due to the extended time of salt stress needed to elicit this visible phenotype, the link between Ca2+ wave signaling and this whole-plant physiological response must remain tentative. qPCR analysis (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3C) indicated that TPC1 was the most rapidly up-regulated gene we tested in the shoot, showing up to 10-fold increase in transcript abundance within 1–2 min of root salt stress. We also observed rapid changes in transcript abundance for some other genes in qPCR analyses, such as rapid down-regulation of TCH2 (Fig. S3). The timescale of these alterations suggest either extremely fast changes in transcription or rapid alterations in mRNA stability/turnover elicited by the salt stress signal. In addition to such rapid alterations in transcript level, posttranscriptional regulation is also likely playing a role in modulating the extent of Ca2+ wave propagation through TPC1. This idea is because this channel is ubiquitously expressed across tissue types, yet the root Ca2+ wave is restricted to the cortex and endodermal cell layers (Fig. 1). Although it remains to be discovered whether the action of TPC1 and transmission of the Ca2+ wave is related to other proposed systemic signaling systems such as membrane depolarization (2) or ROS-dependent events (5), TPC1 has been proposed to be posttranslationally regulated by ROS (24). This observation raises the possibility of a point of interaction between the ROS and Ca2+-dependent systemic signaling systems. Transmission of systemic ROS responses is thought to be Ca2+-independent (5), suggesting a model where Ca2+ changes could lie downstream of ROS. However, the relationship between ROS and Ca2+ is complex with Ca2+ triggering ROS production (25) and ROS eliciting Ca2+ increases (25, 26). Thus, the relationship of TPC1, Ca2+ wave, and ROS is an important area for future study. TPC1 is found in all land plants (14) and the function of this channel appears to be conserved at least between monocots to dicots (27). This ubiquity of TPC1 suggests a possibly widespread and general function of this channel in plant biology, hinting at the potentially widespread nature of Ca2+ wave signaling in plants.",

Significance This work documents a previously unreported plant-wide signaling system based on the rapid, long-distance transmission of Ca2+ waves. In the root these waves move through the cortical and endodermal cell layers at speeds of up to 400 µm/s, i.e., traversing several cells per second. This Ca2+ wave system correlates with the triggering of molecular responses in distant parts of the plant upon perception of localized (salt) stress. Such propagating Ca2+ waves provide a new mechanism for the rapid integration of activities throughout the plant body. Keywords: Ca2+ signaling, Yellow Cameleon, Two Pore Channel 1Abstract Their sessile lifestyle means that plants have to be exquisitely sensitive to their environment, integrating many signals to appropriate developmental and physiological responses. Stimuli ranging from wounding and pathogen attack to the distribution of water and nutrients in the soil are frequently presented in a localized manner but responses are often elicited throughout the plant. Such systemic signaling is thought to operate through the redistribution of a host of chemical regulators including peptides, RNAs, ions, metabolites, and hormones. However, there are hints of a much more rapid communication network that has been proposed to involve signals ranging from action and system potentials to reactive oxygen species. We now show that plants also possess a rapid stress signaling system based on Ca2+ waves that propagate through the plant at rates of up to ∼400 µm/s. In the case of local salt stress to the Arabidopsis thaliana root, Ca2+ wave propagation is channeled through the cortex and endodermal cell layers and this movement is dependent on the vacuolar ion channel TPC1. We also provide evidence that the Ca2+ wave/TPC1 system likely elicits systemic molecular responses in target organs and may contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance. These results suggest that, although plants do not have a nervous system, they do possess a sensory network that uses ion fluxes moving through defined cell types to rapidly transmit information between distant sites within the organism. Plants are constantly tailoring their responses to current environmental conditions via a complex array of chemical regulators that integrate developmental and physiological programs across the plant body. Environmental stimuli are often highly localized in nature, but the subsequent plant response is often elicited throughout the entire organism. For example, soil is a highly heterogeneous environment and the root encounters stimuli that are presented in a patchy manner. Thus, factors including dry or waterlogged regions of the soil, variations in the osmotic environment, and stresses such as elevated levels of salt are all likely to be encountered locally by individual root tips, but the information may have to be acted on by the plant as a whole. In animals, long-range signaling to integrate activities across the organism occurs through rapid ionic/membrane potential-driven signaling through the nervous system in addition to operating via long-distance chemical signaling. Plants have also been proposed to possess a rapid, systemic communication network, potentially mediated through signals ranging from changes in membrane potential/ion fluxes (1–3) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (4, 5) to altered hydraulics in the vasculature (6). Even so, the molecular mechanisms behind rapid, systemic signaling in plants and whether such signals indeed carry regulatory information remains largely unknown. Suggestions that Ca2+ channels play a role in signals that occlude sieve tube elements (7), or that mediate systemic electrical signaling (2) in response to remote wounding, highlight Ca2+-dependent signaling events as a strong candidate for mediating some of these long-range responses. Similarly, cooling of roots elicits Ca2+ increases in the shoot within minutes (8), suggesting systemic signals can elicit Ca2+-dependent responses at distal sites within the plant. However, despite extensive characterization of Ca2+ signals (reviewed in ref. 9), their roles in a possible plant-wide communication network remain poorly understood. Therefore, to visualize how Ca2+ might act in local and systemic signaling, we generated Arabidopsis plants expressing the highly sensitive, GFP-based, cytoplasmic Ca2+ sensor YCNano-65 (10). We observed that a range of abiotic stresses including H2O2, touch, NaCl, and cold shock triggered Ca2+ increases at the point of application. However, NaCl also elicited a Ca2+ increase that moved away from the point of stress application. Propagation of this Ca2+ increase was associated with subsequent systemic changes in gene expression. We also report that this salt stress-induced long-distance Ca2+ wave is dependent on the activity of the ion channel protein Two Pore Channel 1 (TPC1), which also appears to contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance. Results Changes in Cytoplasmic Ca2+ Occur in Response to Abiotic Stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in a thin layer of gel and a ∼500 µm × 500 µm region of the gel covering the root apex was removed to allow localized application of treatments to the root tip (Materials and Methods). Consistent with previous studies (reviewed in ref. 9), when a range of abiotic stresses including touch, cold, ROS (H2O2), and NaCl were locally applied to the root tip, we detected rapid and transient Ca2+ increases at the site of treatment that showed stimulus-specific spatial/temporal characteristics (Fig. S1 and Movies S1–S4). However, we observed that, among these treatments, NaCl treatment also led to a propagating Ca2+ increase moving away from the point of stress application (Figs. 1 and 2 and Movie S5). Treatment with 200 mM sorbitol (osmotic control for the 100 mM NaCl stress) did not elicit Ca2+ changes under these conditions (Fig. S1E), suggesting such Ca2+ changes were being specifically elicited by the salt stress.

Analysis was repeated on images taken every 0.5 s (WT) and 4 s (tpc1-2) and data from five roots averaged and pseudocolor coded. ROI, region of interest.Salt Stress Induces a Long-Distance Systemic Wave of Increased Ca2+. Local application of salt stress to the root tip induced an increase in Ca2+ that propagated shootward from the site of NaCl stimulation (Figs. 1 and 2). This salt stress-induced elevation in Ca2+ was largely constrained to the cortical and endodermal cell layers (Fig. 1 A and B). Thus, changes were not seen in the epidermal cells even though this tissue is known to generate stimulus-evoked Ca2+ elevations (e.g., ref. 11). In addition, when a lateral root tip was stimulated, a Ca2+ wave also moved through the cortex/endodermis, traveling to the main root and then bidirectionally rootward and shootward (Fig. 1B and Movie S6). This Ca2+ increase eventually traversed to the aerial part of the plant, moving through the hypocotyl (Fig. S2 and Movie S7). Quantitative analysis of the timing of Ca2+ increase in various regions along the root (Fig. 2A) coupled with kymograph-based measurements of rates of Ca2+ increase (Fig. 2C) indicated that the wave front of these Ca2+ changes moved at a steady 395.7 ± 27.8 µm/s (±SD) (Fig. 2 A and C), taking ∼1 min to traverse the entire length of the root system and ∼2 min to spread across the entire length of the Arabidopsis seedlings used in this study.Root Tip Salt Stress Triggers Systemic Molecular Responses in Shoot Tissue. We next used a battery of molecular markers (Table 1) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis to ask whether the long-distance Ca2+ increase we observed in response to this root-applied NaCl stress was accompanied by a systemic shoot response (Fig. 3A). As expected, increased transcript levels of stress-related genes such as RAB18, DREB2A, TCH2, and ZAT12, and the salt stress response genes SOS1 and CBL10 (12) were detectable in the directly salt-stressed root tissues within 1–2 min of treatment (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3A). These rapidly induced genes showed subsequent oscillations in levels, sharing a fall at 10 min and subsequent increase over the 60 min of analysis (Fig. S3A). However, local salt treatment of the root tip also led to an increase in transcript abundance of a number of stress markers in the distant aerial parts of the plant. For example, by 10 min RAB18, DREB2A, TCH2, TCH3, PIP2;3, ZAT12, LOX3, and SID2 levels were significantly increased in the shoot (P < 0.05, t test; Fig. 3A and Fig. S3B). These genes generally showed a peak in transcript level at 10 min that had begun to fall by 30–60 min. Induction of markers such as SOS1, SOS2/CIPK4, SOS3/CBL4, and CBL10 was significant only after 30 min. The vacuolar channel TPC1 was notable in showing a rapid, transient transcript accumulation within 1 min in the shoot (Fig. S3C). In contrast, NaCl treatment led to an equally rapid but sustained decrease in TPC1 transcript levels in the salt-stressed roots.

(D) Systemic transmission rate of Ca2+ waves in OxTPC1 and effect of La3+ treatment on blocking on Ca2+ wave propagation rate (±SEM; n ≥ 6 independent experiments). Rates were calculated as in Fig. 2A. (E) Effect of salt stress in WT, tpc1-2, and TPC1 overexpression (OxTPC1) seedlings. Ten-day-old seedlings were transplanted to 100 mM NaCl plates and grown for an additional 7 d. Representative of three independent experiments. Chlorophyll content was monitored as an index of plant vitality. Results represent mean ± SEM; n = 3 independent experiments. “a,” “b,” and “c” denote significance (P < 0.05, t test). Bars sharing the same letter are not significantly different.Direct salt movement, either within the growth medium or within the plant, was too slow to explain the induction of such systemic responses in the aerial plant parts. Thus, fluorescein (a small molecule dye) took >2 min to diffuse only 300 µm through the matrix of the growth medium (Fig. S4 A and B), and there was no detectable increase in Na content of shoots, measured via inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, after >10 min of local root NaCl treatment (Fig. S4C). Therefore, the propagation of the Ca2+ wave and induction of systemic molecular responses are unlikely to reflect direct response to salt that had moved from the site of application either through the gel or within the plant. To test whether the transcriptional changes elicited by local salt stress of the root required the Ca2+ wave, we asked whether pharmacological inhibitors that blocked transmission of the Ca2+ wave also blocked distal transcriptional responses. Local application of LaCl3 (putative plasma-membrane Ca2+-channel blocker) or Ruthenium Red (RuRed) (putatively targeting internal Ca2+ release) between the sites of stress application and Ca2+ signal detection (Fig. 4A) inhibited transmission of the Ca2+ signal past this point (Fig. 4). However, if the NaCl stress was applied shootward of the LaCl3 treatment, the propagation of the Ca2+ wave still moved shootward at 397.5 ± 42.1 μm/s (±SEM) (P < 0.05, t test) from the point of NaCl application (Fig. S5). This result indicates that the position of the LaCl3, rather than simply its presence in the root system, appeared to be a key factor in blocking the progression of the Ca2+ wave. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Effect of Ca2+ channel blockers on salt-induced Ca2+ waves. (A) Propagation of NaCl-induced Ca2+ waves in roots with and without 3.5-min pretreatment with 25 µM LaCl3 or RuRed. (Scale bars: 100 µm.) (B) Quantitative analysis of time course of Ca2+ changes in response to local 100 mM NaCl treatment with and without 25 µM LaCl3 or RuRed (B). Results represent mean ± SEM of n ≥ 4 (RuRed and LaCl3) or n = 17 (WT) monitored 1,000 µm from the site of root tip NaCl application.The increase in transcript abundance of genes such as TCH2 and ZAT12 (Fig. 3C) or TCH3, PIP2;3, LOX3, and TPC1 (Fig. S6) seen at 10 min in the shoot in response to root tip NaCl stress was suppressed by the local LaCl3 treatment applied shootward of the site of NaCl application. In contrast, induction of RAB18 and DREB2A (Fig. S6) or SDI2 (Fig. 3C) was left unaffected. These observations are consistent with a requirement for the Ca2+ wave in the triggering of at least part of the systemic molecular regulation seen in response to local root salt stress. The effect of La3+ application on its own is an important control for these experiments. Although we observed that LaCl3 alone could alter transcript levels of some genes (Fig. 3B and Fig. S7), this treatment did not significantly affect the levels of the molecular markers at the 10-min time point used for these experiments (Fig. 3B and Fig. S7). A prolonged suppression of LOX3 and SOS1 transcript levels were a notable exception, and so responses of these markers in La3+ inhibitor experiments must be made with caution (Fig. S7).Long-Distance Ca2+ Signaling Is Dependent on the Vacuolar TWO PORE CHANNEL 1. In animals, Ca2+ waves are often supported by processes involving calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) (13). The slow vacuolar (SV) channel is a large-conductance, voltage-dependent ion channel (reviewed in ref. 14) that is permeable to Ca2+ (15) and has been proposed to mediate plant CICR (15–17), although this idea remains controversial (14). The Arabidopsis SV channel is encoded by a single gene, TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1) (18). In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutants of TPC1 show disrupted stomatal signaling and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation of germination (18) and the gain-of-function fou2 mutant exhibits developmental effects thought to be linked to aberrant defense signaling (19). We therefore tested the hypothesis that the SV channel might play a role in sustaining the salt-induced Ca2+ wave using tpc1 mutants. Previous work measuring Ca2+ changes in a TPC1 knockout expressing the luminescent Ca2+ indicator aequorin indicated no clear disruption of a range of stress-induced Ca2+ changes (20). Consistent with this report, we found that salt stress-induced Ca2+ elevations were not grossly altered in tpc1-2 (a protein null) (18) when monitored at the direct site of stress application, although they did exhibit a slightly delayed onset (Fig. S1 D and E, and Movie S8). However, the speed of transmission of the Ca2+ wave in tpc1-2 was significantly reduced to 15.5 ± 1.9 µm/s (±SD) (P < 0.05, t test; Fig. 2).TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 Mutants Affect Transcript Levels of Stress-Related Genes. qPCR analysis of our panel of stress markers showed that, in response to root tip NaCl treatment, shoot induction of genes such as TCH2 and ZAT12 was significantly attenuated in the tpc1-2 mutant (Fig. 3C and Fig. S8), a pattern confirmed in the knockdown lines tpc1-1 (36% reduction in TPC1 transcript; Fig. S8) and tpc1-4 (21% reduction in TPC1 transcript; Fig. S8). Interestingly, La3+ treatment had a complex interaction with NaCl induction of TCH2 in these backgrounds, leading to a partial recovery of transcript levels. This observation suggests that feedback between vacuolar and plasma membrane Ca2+ fluxes is likely an important element in the transcriptional response of at least TCH2 to salt stress. qPCR analysis also indicated that TPC1 is the most rapidly systemically up-regulated gene we tested, with 10-fold increase in transcript abundance in the shoot within 1–2 min of root salt stress (P < 0.05, t test; Fig. 3A and Fig. S3C). This observation raises the possibility of a self-reinforcing signaling system with Ca2+ wave-related rapid induction of TPC1 amplifying and extending subsequent Ca2+ responses. Consistent with such ideas, markers that were suppressed in tpc1 mutants such as ZAT12 and TCH2 (Fig. 3C and Fig. S8) were constitutively increased above WT in a TPC1 overexpression line (Fig. S9A). This up-regulation of transcript levels was suppressed by La3+ treatment (Fig. S9B), suggesting altered control of Ca2+ homeostasis may link TPC1 levels to transcriptional regulation. Consistent with these ideas, the speed of propagation of the Ca2+ wave in the TPC1 overexpression line was 679 ± 73 µm/s, 1.7-fold faster than WT but was still sensitive to inhibition by LaCl3 (Fig. 3D).TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 Expression Level Affects Whole-Plant Salt Sensitivity. The overexpression line TPC1 10.21 (18), which showed 73- to 130-fold increase in transcript level (Fig. S9C), was more resistant to NaCl stress based on seedling growth and chlorophyll levels after growth on 100 mM NaCl for 7 d (Fig. 3E). Thus, the up-regulation of systemic molecular changes and faster Ca2+ wave signaling observed in the TPC1 transgenic lines correlate with alterations in whole-plant salt stress resistance.Discussion In plants, environmental stimuli including wounding or heat stress have been proposed to elicit long-distance signaling involving mechanisms such as plasma membrane depolarization and self-propagating increases of ROS (1–5, 21, 22). Our results suggest Ca2+-dependent signaling also plays a role in this process of systemic signaling in response to salt stress. Thus, local salt stress of the root tip leads to the spreading of a Ca2+ wave that propagates preferentially through cortical and endodermal cells to distal shoot tissues (Figs. 1 and 2). This Ca2+ wave moves with a velocity of ∼400 µm/s (Fig. 2A), i.e., traversing several cells per second. Local treatment with LaCl3 that blocked the transmission of the Ca2+ wave (Fig. 4) also inhibited subsequent systemic molecular responses (Fig. 3C and Fig. S6). Thus, these patterns of transmission and response are consistent with a model in which the rapidly propagating Ca2+ wave serves as a long-distance signal that triggers systemic responses to local salt stress of the root system. It is important to note that such La3+ treatment itself could inhibit transcription of some genes (Fig. S7). This observation implies that a basal level of La3+-sensitive (likely Ca2+-dependent) signaling between root and shoot may be required to sustain nonstimulated levels of some genes. In addition, although such blocking of the Ca2+ wave could inhibit systemic induction of stress markers such as TCH2, ZAT12 (Fig. 3C), TCH3, and PIP2;3 (Fig. S6) in response to localized salt stress treatment, a similar treatment could not block up-regulation of RAB18 and DREB2A (Fig. S6). These observations suggest additional systemic signals are likely operating in parallel to the Ca2+ wave. Role of the Vacuolar Ion Channel TPC1 in Propagation of the Ca2+ Wave. We found that the rate of propagation of the systemic Ca2+ wave was reduced from 395.7 ± 27.8 µm/s in WT to 15.5 ± 1.9 µm/s in the loss-of-function tpc1-2 mutant (Fig. 2), representing a ∼25-fold reduction in speed. TPC1 encodes the vacuolar SV ion channel that is sensitive to cytosolic Ca2+ levels and to those in the lumen of the vacuole (23), suggesting feedback regulation of this channel by alterations in cytosolic and vacuolar Ca2+ levels could play a role in Ca2+ wave propagation. However, it remains unclear whether TPC1 acts itself as a vacuolar Ca2+ release channel that sustains the Ca2+ wave (14). Thus, TPC1 could be operating more indirectly, through, e.g., altering tonoplast potential and so gating an independent vacuolar Ca2+ conductance. However, effects of tpc1 mutants on both reducing Ca2+ changes and inhibiting the induction of systemic molecular responses such as increase in TCH2 and ZAT12 transcript abundance (Fig. 3C and Fig. S8) are very similar to those of blocking Ca2+ changes with La3+. These observations are consistent with TPC1 actively maintaining the propagation of the Ca2+ wave through an effect on Ca2+ fluxes. In support of these ideas, the TPC1 overexpression line showed Ca2+ wave propagation rates that were 1.7-fold faster than WT (Fig. 3D). The overexpression line also exhibited constitutive elevation of marker genes such as TCH2 and ZAT12 that appear normally dependent for up-regulation on the Ca2+ wave elicited by local salt stress. This constitutive induction was inhibited by the channel blocker La3+ (Fig. S9B), suggesting a link between transcriptional changes modulated by TPC1 and Ca2+-mediated events. Taken together, these results support a model in which local NaCl stress elicits a long-distance Ca2+ wave-mediated signaling system that triggers systemic molecular responses. Furthermore, comparison of WT, tpc1-2, and plants overexpressing TPC1 grown on 100 mM NaCl-containing plates indicated that, by 7 d, the overexpression line was significantly more resistant to this level of salt stress as inferred from plant size and chlorophyll content (Fig. 3E). These observations suggest that the Ca2+ wave system mediated by TPC1 may also be contributing to the whole-plant resistance to salt stress. However, it is important to note that, due to the extended time of salt stress needed to elicit this visible phenotype, the link between Ca2+ wave signaling and this whole-plant physiological response must remain tentative. qPCR analysis (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3C) indicated that TPC1 was the most rapidly up-regulated gene we tested in the shoot, showing up to 10-fold increase in transcript abundance within 1–2 min of root salt stress. We also observed rapid changes in transcript abundance for some other genes in qPCR analyses, such as rapid down-regulation of TCH2 (Fig. S3). The timescale of these alterations suggest either extremely fast changes in transcription or rapid alterations in mRNA stability/turnover elicited by the salt stress signal. In addition to such rapid alterations in transcript level, posttranscriptional regulation is also likely playing a role in modulating the extent of Ca2+ wave propagation through TPC1. This idea is because this channel is ubiquitously expressed across tissue types, yet the root Ca2+ wave is restricted to the cortex and endodermal cell layers (Fig. 1). Although it remains to be discovered whether the action of TPC1 and transmission of the Ca2+ wave is related to other proposed systemic signaling systems such as membrane depolarization (2) or ROS-dependent events (5), TPC1 has been proposed to be posttranslationally regulated by ROS (24). This observation raises the possibility of a point of interaction between the ROS and Ca2+-dependent systemic signaling systems. Transmission of systemic ROS responses is thought to be Ca2+-independent (5), suggesting a model where Ca2+ changes could lie downstream of ROS. However, the relationship between ROS and Ca2+ is complex with Ca2+ triggering ROS production (25) and ROS eliciting Ca2+ increases (25, 26). Thus, the relationship of TPC1, Ca2+ wave, and ROS is an important area for future study. TPC1 is found in all land plants (14) and the function of this channel appears to be conserved at least between monocots to dicots (27). This ubiquity of TPC1 suggests a possibly widespread and general function of this channel in plant biology, hinting at the potentially widespread nature of Ca2+ wave signaling in plants.Materials and Methods Plant Growth and Transformation. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia 0 and the mutants used in this study (tpc1-1, tpc1-2, tpc1-4, OxTPC1/TPC1 10.21) were surface sterilized and germinated on half-strength Epstein’s medium containing 10 mM sucrose and 0.5% (wt/vol) phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.7, as described previously (28). Plants were grown under a long-day (LD) cycle of 16 h light/8 h dark at 22 °C. Ten-day-old seedlings were transplanted to SunshineRedi-earth soil (Sun Gro Horticulture) and were grown under cool white fluorescent lights (75–88 µE⋅m−2⋅s−1) at 22 °C under the LD light cycle. Plant transformation was carried out essentially as in ref. 29 using midlogarithmic cultures (A600 = 0.6) of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring the binary vector YCNano-65/pEarleyGage100 that encoded YCNano-65 (see below for details of this vector), resuspended in half strength Epstein’s medium containing 5% (wt/vol) sucrose and 0.05% (vol/vol) Silwet-L77 (Lehle Seeds). Transformed plants were covered with a clear plastic cover overnight. A second transformation on the same plants was carried out 1 wk later. Plants were then grown under LD conditions until seed set and harvest. Selection of transformants expressing YCNano-65 was made using an epifluorescence dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ1500 Stereoscope) using a GFP filter set (excitation, 450–490 nm; dichroic mirror, 495 nm; emission, 500–550 nm). Multiple independent lines were selected, selfed, and the T2 or greater generation used for subsequent imaging. All results were confirmed on multiple independent lines. All YCNano-65–expressing lines used showed equivalent growth and development to their untransformed counterparts. tpc1-1, tpc1-2, tpc1-4, and OxTPC1 were kindly provided by Edgar Peiter (Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany) and Dale Sanders (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK).Abiotic Stress and Inhibitor Treatment. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing the YCNano-65 FRET sensor were grown on a thin layer of gel (∼2 mm thick) containing half-strength Epstein’s medium supplemented with 0.5% (wt/vol) phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mM sucrose, under LD conditions at 22 °C for 6 d. A small window (∼500 µm × 500 µm) was removed from the gel at the tip of the root to expose the apical ∼50 µm of the root to allow precise application of 100 mM NaCl (salt stress), 100 µM H2O2 (ROS stress), chilled medium at 4 °C (cold stress), or 200 mM d-sorbitol (control equivalent to the osmotic stress from 100 mM NaCl). Touch stress was applied using contact with a glass micropipette as previously described (30). For inhibitor treatments, a small window (∼500 µm × 500 µm) was also made in the gel in the middle region of the root, shootward of the root tip window. Ten microliters of 25 µM LaCl3 (putative plasma membrane channel blocker) or RuRed (putative antagonist of internal sites of Ca2+ release) were added either in the root tip gel window or to the middle gel window (see diagram in Fig. 4A) 30 min before salt treatment of the root tip as indicated for each experiment. Arabidopsis seedlings pretreated with pharmaceutical inhibitors were kept in a humid Petri dish until confocal imaging.Confocal Image Analysis of in Vivo Ca2+ Changes. Stable transgenic lines expressing YCNano-65 under the control of CaMV35S promoter were grown under sterile conditions in a thin layer (∼2 mm) of half-strength Epstein’s medium containing 0.5% (wt/vol) phytagel and 10 mM sucrose on a no. 1.5 cover glass (24 × 50 mm; Fisher Scientific) for 6 d under LD conditions at 22 °C. Ratio confocal imaging of Ca2+ changes was then performed with an LSM510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) using a Plan-Neofluar 10×/0.3 or 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective as described previously (31). The YCNano-65 Ca2+ sensor was excited with the 458-nm line of an argon laser and CFP (462–505 nm) and cpVenus (FRET, 526–537 nm) emission detected using a 458-nm primary dichroic mirror and the microscope system’s Meta detector. Ca2+ levels were determined from the ratio of the Ca2+-dependent FRET signal to the CFP signal normalized to the FRET-to-CFP ratio from before stress treatment. Quantitative analysis of Ca2+ dynamics (from the ratiometric Ca2+-FRET signal) was performed using iVision-Mac (version 4.0.16) image-processing software (BioVision Technologies) with a custom script for the calculation of the ratiometric FRET signal from region of interests (ROIs). Briefly, quantitative analysis of YCNano-65 data (e.g., Fig. 2) was calculated from the ROIs (4 µm long × 51.2 µm wide, with 1,280 pixels of data) scanned along the root, generating 116 sequential data points covering a total of 464 µm of root length per image. The extracted quantitative ratio numerical data from the sequential confocal images were displayed as a pseudocolor-coded matrix using MultiExperiment Viewer MeV software (version 10.2; ref. 32). Ratio values were converted to absolute [Ca2+]cyt (in nanomolar concentration) using the equation (33), where R is the experimentally monitored FRET/CFP ratio, n is the Hill coefficient (1.6), and the Kd for Ca2+ is 64.8 nM (10). The ratio from Ca2+-saturated reporter (Rmax, 5.33 ± 1.43) was determined by incubating samples with 50% (vol/vol) ethanol and the minimum ratio (Rmin, 0.40 ± 0.04) by incubation with 10 mM EGTA according to ref. 31. The values derived from this in vivo calibration should be taken as approximations due to difficulties inherent in obtaining a robust Rmax and Rmin value and uncertainty in the precise Kd of YCNano-65 in the plant cytoplasmic environment.Monitoring Diffusion Through the Gel. To test for the rate of small-molecule diffusion through the growth medium gel, 50 µM fluorescein was added to a window at the tip of the root as for NaCl local treatment. Fluorescein movement was then monitored with the LSM510 using a 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective. Fluorescein signal was excited with the 488-nm line of the argon laser and emission collected using an HFT 488/543/633 dichroic beam splitter and 500- to 530-nm emission filter. Images were acquired every 4 s for 270 s.Cloning of the YCNano-65 FRET Sensor. For the 35S:YCNano-65 Ca2+ FRET sensor construct, the YCNano-65 FRET cassette fragment from YCNano-65/pcDNA3.1 plasmid (a kind gift from Takeharu Nagai, Osaka University, Osaka) (10) was isolated by digesting with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pENTR11 gateway entry vector (Invitrogen). The resulting YCNano-65/pENTR11 construct was introduced into the plant binary vector pEarleyGate100 (34) by Gateway cloning using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. pEarlyGate 100 has a CaMV35S promoter to drive constitutive expression in plant. The resulting YCNano-65/pEarleyGate100 construct was verified by HindIII endonuclease digestion patterns and DNA sequencing and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using electroporation.Salt Treatment, Total RNA Isolation, and qPCR Analysis. For qPCR analysis, the root tip region of 10-d-old seedlings of WT Col_0, tpc1-1, tpc1-2, tpc1-4, OxTPC1 was covered with an ∼5-mm strip of KimWipe wetted with growth medium and acclimated for at least 1 h. Approximately 20 µL of medium with or without 100 mM NaCl or 25 µM LaCl3 was then added to the KimWipe strip to achieve precise local application as described for each experiment. For the LaCl3 blockade experiments described for Fig. 3, the 25 µM LaCl3 was added to a similar KimWipe strip covering the midregion of the root 30 min before salt stress was applied at the root tip. Root and shoot samples were harvested and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was then isolated from tissue samples (50–200 mg) using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase I treatment using the TURBO DNase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1–2 µg) was reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA in a 40-µL reaction (25–50 ng of total RNA per µL) with the SuperScriptIII first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). qPCR analysis was performed using a Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR System, and analysis was performed with the MxPro qPCR software (Stratagene). The Arabidopsis UBQ10 gene was used as an internal reference for standardization as described previously (35). cDNA proportional to 10 ng of starting total RNA was combined with 200 nM of each primer and 7.5 µL of 2× EvaGreen qPCR master mixed with ROX passive reference dye (Biotium) in a final volume of 15 µL. qPCRs were performed in a 96-well optical PCR plate (ABgene) using the following parameters: 1 cycle of 15 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 58 °C, and 15 s at 65 °C, and 1 cycle of dissociation from 58 to 95 °C with 0.5° increments. Quantitation of expression of the marker genes was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method as described previously (36). The qPCR primers used are described in Table S1.Quantification of Sodium Accumulation. Plants were treated with 100 mM NaCl applied to the root tip as described above and then dissected into root and shoot tissue (∼50 mg). The root tissues were rinsed in deionized water to remove contaminating NaCl from the medium, and then each sample (root and shoot) was digested in 0.6 mL of nitric acid in a glass test tube at 120 °C for 2 h followed by further digestion in 0.4 mL of 60% (vol/vol) HClO4 at 150–180 °C for an additional 2 h or until total sample volume became ≤0.5 mL. The resulting tissue samples were cooled to room temperature and diluted in 5 mL of Nanopure water, and sodium concentration was determined using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2000DV inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Results of Na level in parts per million (in milligrams per liter) was calculated and converted to milligrams per kilogram fresh weight (F.W) using the following equation: Chlorophyll Content Assay. Aerial parts of these seedlings (30–100 mg F.W) were harvested for chlorophyll determination as described previously (37) with slight modification. Briefly, tissue samples in 0.5 mL of 80% (vol/vol) acetone were homogenized using a GENO/GRINDER 2000 (SPEX SamplePrep, LLC) at 1,200 strokes per min for 10 min. The resulting lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C, 1,690 × g for 15 min. The clear supernatant was collected, and chlorophyll content was determined by measuring the absorbance at 652 nm and applying the following equation: Supplementary Material Supporting Information supp_111_17_6497__index.html (8KB, html) Acknowledgments We thank S.

    "abstract": "Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. Subject terms: Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones",
    "introduction": "Introduction The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21 and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.",
    "methods": "Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity. Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63 was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900) and OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900) in the Zhonghua11 background and OsEBF2, OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700), OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) in the crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) of each gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into the BsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCRW1::OsCRW1, proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06g0619600::Os06g0619600, we amplified the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1, 3 Kb of proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1, Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from the pUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generate pOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 promoter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we amplified the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1, 2500 bp of proOsEIL2) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the BamHI/SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) and proUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we amplified the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation64. Transformants were verified by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65, proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP14, or NES-YC3.665 were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 or oscrw1KO lines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant background by PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments. Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66 for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm) of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl3 (100 μM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponic experiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experiments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments. MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1 progenies. F1 progenies were selfed to generate F2 progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2 plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50× and 30× coverage for crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150-bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP-index method69 and candidate SNPs were identified. Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation. Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 or GFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82), we amplified the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 or OsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of the pSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI-PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nm and 360 nm for excitation, respectively. Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol’s solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol’s stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution. Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+ (NES-YC3.6, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively65. TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7-OsEIL1 or pGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) for growth. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221-P3P2, and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were transferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter of OsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-boxmut, ACCACC; G-boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 or OsERF82, and pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins were purified from E. coli by nickel affinity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence of OsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The protein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at 4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-linking, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP™ ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for each experiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde under vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and fragmented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of the yield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNA complex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime, P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028, China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform agent for DNA purification (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequences on the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and purified DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR. Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp-deficient SD medium and double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X-α-gal) for growth. RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html). RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA to 20 μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2–Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

    "results": "Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). Fig. 1. crw1 shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil.

The direction of each root tip was measured as the absolute value toward the direction of gravity.

WT and crw1 expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP grew in water or soil for two days. Scale bars are 1 cm in (a, d), 100 μm in (b, c, f, g) and 20 μm in (h). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c–h), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i–n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic The coiling phenotype of crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placed horizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11. To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells in crw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VENUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). In Arabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT and crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost in crw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization. Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F1 plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F2 progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (χ2 = 0.002, P = 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identified Os06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KO lines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).

Significant difference from WT was determined by two-sided Student’s t-test. Scale bars are 1 cm in (e and c), 1 mm in (g), 200 μm in (h) and 20 μm in (i). The data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 11). In roots, OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h). Transient expression of p35S::GFP-OsCRW1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2i). Elevated ethylene response in crw1 when grown in hydroponic OsCRW1 encodes an F-box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (AtEBF1)27,28. Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF238, and loss of function of OsEBF1 or OsEBF2 led to a hypersensitivity of root and coleoptile to exogenous ethylene38, and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice39,40. To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1KO lines in water (Fig. 3c–f), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.The above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, like Arabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF141,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. 4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil-vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm−3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30 Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2KO/crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.

In (d, g), different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). In (k, l), significant difference from WT at *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, respectively (Student’s t-test, one-sided). Scale bars, 1 cm. Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis43. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e). OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. 17d–f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water. The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved. OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS-responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS46 and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG)47 (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes. Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying amplified ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impaired gravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown in water-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm−3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue the crw1 phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar-solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3 – 1.2%, mass/volume). crw1 showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1 - 6 Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig. 2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19 Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8 – 1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34 – 77 Pa) (Fig. 6a–c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed when crw1 plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10° angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig. 22). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥ 34 Pa is sufficient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. Fig. 6. Gentle mechanical resistance on the root tip rescues the root coiling phenotype of crw1.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip of crw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. The resistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to be approximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment of foam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin distribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribution and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhibition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling. Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49. To investigate whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. Fig. 7.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+ signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl3, a Ca2+ channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl3 suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl3 abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca2+ signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μM LaCl3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3 (Supplementary Fig. 28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism. The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30g).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. Open in a new tab The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html). The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212, aux113, eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53 and gravity signaling6,7 cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil.",

Copyright notice ID: 12008199 PMID: 40251159 Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. Subject terms: Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones This study demonstrated that amplified ethylene signaling impairs gravitropic growth of rice roots by affecting root cap stability and OsPIN2 polar localization, whereas mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to safeguard gravitropism.Introduction The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21 and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). Fig. 1. crw1 shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c–h), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i–n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic The coiling phenotype of crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placed horizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11. To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells in crw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VENUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). In Arabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT and crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost in crw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization.Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F1 plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F2 progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (χ2 = 0.002, P = 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identified Os06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KO lines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).

The data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 11). In roots, OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h). Transient expression of p35S::GFP-OsCRW1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2i).Elevated ethylene response in crw1 when grown in hydroponic OsCRW1 encodes an F-box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (AtEBF1)27,28. Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF238, and loss of function of OsEBF1 or OsEBF2 led to a hypersensitivity of root and coleoptile to exogenous ethylene38, and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice39,40. To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1KO lines in water (Fig. 3c–f), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.The above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, like Arabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF141,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. 4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil-vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm−3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30 Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2KO/crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.

In (d, g), different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). In (k, l), significant difference from WT at *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, respectively (Student’s t-test, one-sided). Scale bars, 1 cm. Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis43. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e).OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. 17d–f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water. The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved.OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS-responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS46 and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG)47 (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes.Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying amplified ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impaired gravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown in water-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm−3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue the crw1 phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar-solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3 – 1.2%, mass/volume). crw1 showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1 - 6 Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig. 2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19 Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8 – 1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34 – 77 Pa) (Fig. 6a–c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed when crw1 plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10° angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig. 22). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥ 34 Pa is sufficient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. Fig. 6.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip of crw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. The resistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to be approximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment of foam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin distribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribution and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhibition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling.Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49. To investigate whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. Fig. 7.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+ signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl3, a Ca2+ channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl3 suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl3 abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca2+ signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μM LaCl3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3 (Supplementary Fig. 28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism.The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30g).Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. Open in a new tab The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html).The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212, aux113, eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53 and gravity signaling6,7 cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil.Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity.Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63 was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900) and OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900) in the Zhonghua11 background and OsEBF2, OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700), OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) in the crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) of each gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into the BsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCRW1::OsCRW1, proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06g0619600::Os06g0619600, we amplified the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1, 3 Kb of proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1, Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from the pUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generate pOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 promoter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we amplified the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1, 2500 bp of proOsEIL2) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the BamHI/SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) and proUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we amplified the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation64. Transformants were verified by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65, proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP14, or NES-YC3.665 were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 or oscrw1KO lines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant background by PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments.Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66 for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm) of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl3 (100 μM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponic experiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experiments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments.MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1 progenies. F1 progenies were selfed to generate F2 progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2 plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50× and 30× coverage for crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150-bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP-index method69 and candidate SNPs were identified.Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation.Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 or GFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82), we amplified the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 or OsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of the pSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI-PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nm and 360 nm for excitation, respectively.Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol’s solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol’s stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution.Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+ (NES-YC3.6, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively65.TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively.Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7-OsEIL1 or pGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) for growth.Bimolecular fluorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221-P3P2, and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were transferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively.Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter of OsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-boxmut, ACCACC; G-boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 or OsERF82, and pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins were purified from E. coli by nickel affinity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence of OsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The protein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at 4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-linking, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP™ ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for each experiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde under vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and fragmented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of the yield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNA complex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime, P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028, China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform agent for DNA purification (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequences on the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and purified DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR.Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp-deficient SD medium and double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X-α-gal) for growth.RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html).RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA to 20 μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2–Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.Statistics and reproducibility The experiments performed in this study were repeated independently at least three times with similar results. The data are presented as the mean ± SD and the microscope images presented are the most representative of the results. The significance of the difference between two sets of data was tested by one- or two-sided Student’s t-test using Microsoft Excel 2019. The difference among more than two sets of data was analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test as post hoc analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (15.5MB, pdf) 41467_2025_59047_MOESM2_ESM.docx (11.8KB, docx) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Movie 1 (13.5MB, mp4) Reporting Summary (2.5MB, pdf) Transparent Peer Review file (619.8KB, pdf) Source data Source Data (6.3MB, xlsx) Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Chuanzao Mao of Zhejiang University for providing seeds of proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP and Dr. Wei Xuan of Nanjing Agricultural University for providing seeds of DR5rev::VENUS.

    "introduction": "Introduction Plants have the capacity to sense and respond to the direction of gravity by precise modulation of growth patterns in roots and shoots (Hashiguchi et al., 2013). Gravitropism involves mechanisms of perception, signal transduction and auxin-directed differential growth. According to the starch-statolith hypothesis, sedimentation of amyloplasts in response to gravity stimuli is critical for gravity sensing (Masson et al., 2002). Gravity perception in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the ability to sense the position of starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, within shoot endodermal cells, or statocytes (Fukaki et al., 1998). This is supported by evidence that (i) mutants lacking an endodermis display agravitropic shoots (Fukaki et al., 1998), (ii) starchless mutants or mutants that lack amyloplasts show reduced gravitropism (Kiss et al., 1997; Weise and Kiss, 1999; Fujihira et al., 2000), (iii) hypergravity restored gravitropic sensitivity in starch-deficient mutants (Fitzelle and Kiss, 2001), and (iv) there is significant movement (sedimentation) of amyloplasts following gravistimulation (Saito et al., 2005; Hashiguchi et al., 2014). The sedimentation of amyloplasts in shoot statocytes is thought to trigger downstream signaling events, including changes in the transport of and response to auxin (Rakusova et al., 2011). The early events of signal transduction for gravitropism remain largely unknown, although several genes have been suggested to function in its early phases (Blancaflor and Masson, 2003). The current model of gravity sensing implicates the plant vacuole in the shoot gravity response (Morita et al., 2002; Yano et al., 2003; Hashiguchi et al., 2013). Shoot endodermal cells contain a large central vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume, and its role in gravity sensing is well established. Mutants with vacuolar defects, including mutant alleles of SHOOT GRAVITROPISM6 (SGR6), VTI11/ZIGZAG-1 (ZIG-1)/SGR4, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS22 (SYP22)/SGR3 and KATAMARI2 (KAM2) were identified from screens for agravitropic shoots in Arabidopsis (Fukaki et al., 1996b ; Yamauchi et al., 1997; Kato et al., 2002; Morita et al., 2002; Yano et al., 2003; Saito et al., 2005; Hashiguchi et al., 2014). A common phenotype in these mutants was the abnormal localization of amyloplasts in relation to the vacuole or abnormal vacuole morphology. In the case of zig-1 mutants, the movement of amyloplasts in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem was greatly reduced (Yano et al., 2003). Both VTI11 and SYP22 are SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins that have important roles in membrane fusion at the vacuole, including homotypic vacuole fusion (Chen and Scheller, 2001; Wickner, 2010; Zheng et al., 2014b ). Two mutant alleles of VTI11, zig-1 and impaired traffic to tonoplast3 (itt3), have multiple vacuoles per cell (Zheng et al., 2014a ,b). Treatment of itt3 and zig-1 with wortmannin (Wm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), resulted in vacuole fusion, and enhanced hypocotyl gravitropism (Zheng et al., 2014b ). This result is consistent with fragmented vacuoles being responsible for the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1. Two other proteins associated with endomembranes were implicated in gravitropism. KAT2 is a membrane-associated protein (Tamura et al., 2007), and SGR6 is a HEAT-domain containing protein involved in vacuole membrane remodeling (Hashiguchi et al., 2014). The roles of KAT2 or SGR6 in gravitropism are still unknown. A tight association between amyloplasts and the large central vacuole has been described in inflorescence endodermal cells. In resting cells, amyloplasts are found at the bottom of the cell, where they undergo saltatory movements and are almost completely surrounded by the vacuole membrane (Morita et al., 2002; Yano et al., 2003; Morita, 2010). Amyloplast sedimentation that results from changes in the gravity vector occurs inside transvacuolar strands (TVSs), and the amyloplasts remain tightly associated with the vacuolar membrane during this time (Saito et al., 2005; Moirta et al., 2012). TVSs may allow movement of organelles, and their formation requires actin filaments (Gao et al., 2005; Leitz et al., 2009; Moirta et al., 2012). It is unclear if the F-actin inside TVSs is required for amyloplast association with the vacuole, sedimentation, or mechanisms of gravity perception (Morita, 2010; Blancaflor, 2013), but F-actin cables have been shown to associate with sedimenting amyloplasts inside TVSs (Saito et al., 2005). However, the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin-B in wild-type inflorescences (Saito et al., 2005). Overall, the mechanisms by which amyloplasts are so closely attached to vacuolar membranes, including TVSs, and the role of this interaction for gravitropism have not been elucidated. Interestingly, kat2 mutants, which are agravitropic in shoots, develop fewer transvacuolar strands in leaves and petioles (Tamura et al., 2007), but it is not known if this is the case for shoot endodermal cells. Even though a clear role for the vacuole in gravity perception is well established, the molecular mechanisms for vacuolar control or perception of amyloplast sedimentation has not been identified. In addition to the vacuole, important roles for actin filaments have been reported, but their role during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear (Blancaflor, 2013). Actin depolymerizing drugs have been reported to enhance gravity response in hypocotyls (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2002), reduce amyloplast sedimentation in endodermal cells (Palmieri and Kiss, 2005) or have no effect in experiments with live cells (Saito et al., 2005). An important role of the actin cytoskeleton was demonstrated by the identification of the shoot gravitropism9 (sgr9) mutant, which shows reduced amyloplast sedimentation due to increased interactions between amyloplasts and F-actin (Nakamura et al., 2011). SGR9 encodes an E3 ligase that may disrupt the attachment of amyloplasts to F-actin during saltatory movements and as a result promote amyloplast sedimentation (Nakamura et al., 2011). The difficulty of establishing a role of F-actin in gravity perception may be due to the complexity of interactions that it may have with a multitude of cellular components, including amyloplasts. Here we used live-cell imaging on a vertical stage microscope to demonstrate the role of the large central vacuole in shoot gravitropism in seedlings. Our results identified the upper hypocotyl endodermis as the gravisensing tissue and highlight a novel tight interaction between the vacuolar membrane and amyloplasts. The fragmented vacuoles in endodermal cells of zig-1 hypocotyls restrict amyloplast movement, contributing to the agravitropic phenotype of this mutant. We show that application of Wm to zig-1 enhances their gravitropic response, restores amyloplast sedimentation and enhances the formation of TVSs. Additionally, we show that the tight association between vacuoles and amyloplasts observed in zig-1 hypocotyls involves neither F-actin nor microtubules.",

    "results": "Results Statocytes in etiolated hypocotyls are restricted to young cells below the apical hook Amyloplast sedimentation in shoots has been well characterized by live-cell microscopy in inflorescence stems (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005; Toyota et al., 2013b ) but not in seedlings. In order to characterize mechanisms of gravity perception in seedlings, we first quantified amyloplast sedimentation in wild-type (WT) hypocotyl endodermal cells by Lugol staining (Fig. 1A). When cells from the upper portion of the hypocotyl were imaged, 97.8% of the amyloplasts were found sedimented in the direction of gravity. However, only 9.5% of amyloplasts were observed at the bottom of the cell when cells were imaged further down the hypocotyl. This result suggests that amyloplast sedimentation may be restricted to endodermal cells just below the apical hook. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Graviperceptive cells are located just below the shoot apex. (A) Endodermal cells below the apical hook contain sedimented amyloplasts. Col-0 WT seedlings were stained with Lugol solution and imaged on a compound microscope while maintaining a vertical orientation. The insets show representative cells from the region just below the apical hook (top) or a region towards the middle of the hypocotyl (bottom). Percentages under the insets represent the proportion of amyloplasts found at the bottom of cells in each region of the hypocotyl. n=88 amyloplasts from 23 cells and three seedlings. Arrowheads indicate the position of amyloplasts. Scale bar: 100 μm. (B) Increase of cell length along the hypocotyl endodermis. Dark-grown Col-0 WT seedling expressing pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP were imaged by confocal microscopy. Average length of cells between the arrowhead marks is shown. Cell length data also include seedlings stained with Lugol solution and imaged by bright-field. n=7 seedlings. Scale bar: 100 μm. (C) Amyloplasts get trapped between vacuoles in zig-1 endodermis. Endodermal cells near the shoot meristem of Col-0 WT (Col-0) and zig-1 seedlings expressing pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP were imaged by bright-field and confocal microscopy. Arrowheads mark the position of amyloplasts. Insets show the association between tonoplast and amyloplast. Scale bar: 20 μm.We measured cell length along the upper hypocotyl endodermis to better understand the potential transition between statocytes and non-statocytes. Cell length was estimated from bright-field images of Lugol-stained WT, as well as confocal images of a GFP-tagged vacuolar marker exclusively expressed in the endodermis (pSCR::TIP-1;1-GFP, Fig. 1B). Cell length varied from 23 ± 3.69 to 94 ± 0.82 μm in this region when measured from the apical hook to ~1 mm towards the root, but on average, only cells with length <70 μm showed sedimented amyloplasts. Using amyloplast sedimentation as a marker for the ability to perceive gravity, the small cells at the top of the hypocotyl are more likely to correspond to the shoot statocytes. Given this result, all subsequent experiments described below were conducted with endodermal cells between 30 and 70 μm in length within this region of the hypocotyl. Amyloplasts in graviperceptive cells have been shown to be closely associated with the vacuole membrane (Morita et al., 2002), and mutants in the SNARE protein VTI11 have abnormal vacuole morphology (Zheng et al., 2014b ) and agravitropic phenotypes (Kato et al., 2002). The vacuole was visualized in WT and zig-1 using the pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP marker in order to determine the relationship between the vacuole and amyloplast in seedlings. As expected, a large central vacuole occupies most of the volume of WT endodermal cells and the tonoplast surrounds the sedimented amyloplasts (Fig. 1C). In contrast, zig-1 displays a fragmented vacuole phenotype in shoot endodermal cells, as previously described for other tissues (Zheng et al., 2014b ). It is important to note that amyloplasts do not sediment in zig-1 mutants and appear to be trapped at the junction between two or more adjacent vacuoles (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, and similar to zig-1 inflorescences (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005), the tonoplast does not tightly surround the amyloplasts in zig-1 hypocotyls. These results indicate that the vacuole phenotype of zig-1 impinges on the distribution of amyloplasts in hypocotyl endodermal cells and likely prevents their sedimentation. The dynamic behavior of endodermal amyloplasts is restricted in zig-1 A novel set-up for live-cell imaging on a vertical microscope was developed to identify mechanisms of vacuolar membrane dynamics involved in gravity perception or response (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Seedlings were grown vertically for 4 d before being mounted in a slide chamber and equilibrated for 5 min. Sequential images were acquired at 10 s intervals for 3 min (Saito et al., 2005) in the vertical stage (Fig. 2A). Most WT amyloplasts were detected at the bottom of the cell between 0 and 3 min (Fig. 2B, 0–3 min), and organelle tracking indicates that they exhibited dynamic saltatory movements (Fig. 2B, 0–3 min). In contrast, zig-1 amyloplasts were found more widely distributed in the cell between 0 and 3 min, and they were severely limited in their movement as shown by their comparatively static tracks (Fig. 2C). Next, seedlings were rotated 90° and imaged immediately for the following 3 min (Fig. 2A). Amyloplasts from WT sedimented in the direction of gravity after reorientation as shown by the organelle tracks between 0 and 3 min after rotation (Fig. 2B, rotation). In contrast, amyloplasts from zig-1 continued to be much more limited in their movement even after a reorientation (Fig. 2C, rotation). These results, and those from inflorescences (Saito et al., 2005), support the role of the central vacuole in shoot gravity sensing. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Amyloplast dynamics in hypocotyl endodermal cells before and after gravity reorientation. (A) Schematic representation of the rotation experiment. The orientation of the seedling with respect to gravity (g) before and after rotation is shown. Displacement of an amyloplast (gray circle) during a 3 min time lapse is shown with a pink arrow, and is expressed as a change in the horizontal position (Δx) and the vertical position (Δy). Positive values correspond to right and down and negative values correspond to left and up. (B, C) Amyloplast movements before and after rotation. A representative cell from the endodermis of Col-0 WT (B) or zig-1 (C) is shown before (0–3 min) or after (rotation) a 90° rotation. Images correspond to the amyloplast positions at the start (0m) or the end (3m) of a 3 min time lapse. Tracks of representative amyloplasts are shown as different colored lines at the right of each panel. Arrowheads indicate one to two amyloplasts. Scale bar: 15 μm. (D, E) Quantification of amyloplast movements in WT and zig-1 before and after rotation. Coordinate graph showing amyloplast displacement between 0 and 3 min in Col-0 WT (D) or zig-1 (E). Time-lapse experiments were carried out either before (blue triangles) or after (orange crosses) a 90° rotation. n=73 amyloplasts from four seedlings of Col-0; n=65 amyloplasts from four seedlings of zig-1.Quantification of amyloplast movement indicated that their movement in WT before rotation occurred in all directions for up to 10 μm (Fig. 2D, E). Following a 90° reorientation, most amyloplasts translocated to the new bottom of the cell (lower right quadrant of the graph) for up to 30 μm. On the other hand, amyloplast movement in zig-1 was confined to <5 μm in all directions before reorientation, and there was little change in their position after a 90° reorientation (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the fragmented vacuoles may impair movement of these organelles in zig-1. Reduced amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1 hypocotyls could be due to the physical impediments created by the fragmented vacuoles. To address this question, we utilized hypergravity conditions to increase sedimentary movement and analysed amyloplast behavior using a centrifuge microscope (Toyota et al., 2013a ,b). Two types of gravistimulation were used at 10 g, one applied longitudinally (along the shoot–root longitudinal axis) and a second applied perpendicularly, similar to a 90° reorientation assay. Upon application of hypergravity in either direction, amyloplasts in WT moved and reached the edge of the cell within 60 s (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, when 10 g was applied in either direction in zig-1, amyloplast movements were highly restricted (Fig. 3A), indicating a potential tight association between amyloplasts and the tonoplast itself. Measurements of amyloplast velocity indicated that these differences are significant (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results suggest that failure of amyloplasts to sediment in zig-1 is due to the abnormal vacuoles and a potential physical interaction between vacuoles and amyloplasts. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Hypergravity does not displace amyloplasts in the zig-1 mutant. (A) Hypergravity (10 g) was applied either longitudinally or perpendicularly to 4-d-old dark grown WT and zig-1 seedlings. Amyloplast localization was imaged by bright-field. Amyloplasts in WT relocate to the gravity associated bottom of the cell within 1 min of hypergravity; however, amyloplast movement in zig-1 is much more restricted. Scale bar: 20 μm. (B) The velocity of amyloplast movement in Col-0 and zig-1 was analysed under the 10 g conditions. Data are shown as means and error bars represent standard error. Different letters denote significant differences among all four data (P<0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s multiple comparison test). n=9–17 amyloplasts. (This figure is available in color at JXB online.) Wortmannin-induced vacuolar membrane fusion releases endodermal amyloplasts in zig-1 Wm was used to test the effect of vacuole fusion on amyloplast sedimentation. Wm inhibits PI3-kinase, reduces the amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate in cellular membranes (Jung et al., 2002), and induces vacuole fusion in zig-1 (Zheng et al., 2014b ). Seedlings were treated with 33 μM Wm in the vertical microscope stage (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online), and time lapses were collected within 3–8 min of Wm application and after 90 min. Figure 4A shows the orientation of the seedlings throughout the experiment. No obvious differences in amyloplast dynamics were observed in WT seedlings 3–8 min after Wm application (Fig. 4B, 3–8 min) when compared with the untreated control (Fig. 2B). Additionally, amyloplast movements still appeared severely limited in zig-1 when seedlings were imaged within 8 min of Wm treatment (Fig. 4C, 3–8 min). After 90 min of Wm treatment, WT amyloplasts were still sedimented in the direction of gravity, but the amplitude of saltatory movements seemed reduced (Fig. 4B, 90–93 min). In contrast, 90 min of Wm treatment in zig-1 resulted in many amyloplasts being found at the bottom of the cell (Fig. 4C, 90–93 min), compared with the untreated zig-1 (Fig. 2C). Seedlings were then rotated 90° and they were again imaged for 3 min immediately after. Upon reorientation, WT amyloplasts sedimented to the new gravity-associated cell bottom within 3 min (Fig. 4B, rotation). Finally, several amyloplasts in Wm-treated zig-1 sedimented in the direction of gravity following reorientation and their tracks were more similar to WT (Fig. 4C, rotation). Collectively, these results suggest that Wm treatment, which induces vacuole fusion, is sufficient to release amyloplasts in the endodermis of zig-1 hypocotyls. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Wortmannin treatment enhances amyloplast dynamics in zig-1 hypocotyls. (A) Representation of the rotation experiment showing the orientation of the seedling with respect to gravity throughout the experiment. Displacement of an amyloplast (grey circle) during a 3 min time lapse is shown with a pink arrow, and is expressed as a change in the horizontal (Δx) and the vertical (Δy) position. Positive values correspond to displacement to the right and down while negative values correspond to displacement towards the left and up. Seedlings were incubated vertically in the presence of 33 μM Wm and imaged immediately for 3 min (top, 3–8 min). Another 3 min time lapse was captured after 90 min of Wm treatment (middle, 90–93 min), and finally, seedlings were rotated 90° and a 3 min time lapse was captured immediately (bottom, rotation). (B, C) Amyloplast movements after a Wm treatment. A representative cell from the endodermis of Col-0 WT (B) or zig-1 (C) was imaged immediately after Wm treatment (3–8 min), 90 min after Wm treatment (90–93min) or 90 min after Wm treatment and a 90° rotation (rotation). Images correspond to the amyloplast positions at the start (0m) or the end (3m) of a 3 min time lapse. Tracks of representative amyloplasts are shown as different colored lines at the right of each panel. Arrowheads indicate one to two amyloplasts. Scale bar: 15 μm. (D, E) Quantification of amyloplast movements in WT and zig-1 after Wm treatment. Coordinate graph showing amyloplast displacement between 0 and 3 min of each time lapse in Col-0 WT (D) or zig-1 (E). Time lapse experiments were carried out within 3–8 min of Wm treatment (blue triangle), after 90 min of Wm treatment before rotation (orange crosses), or after 93 min of Wm treatment followed by a 90° rotation (yellow circles). n=110 amyloplasts from four seedlings of Col-0; n=98 amyloplasts from four seedlings of zig-1.Quantification of amyloplast movements during these experiments indicated that amyloplast saltatory motion in WT was large (up to 20 μm) and showed no obvious bias in direction shortly after Wm treatment (Fig. 4D, 3–8 min). However, Wm treatment for 90 min restricted amyloplast movement in WT to within 10 μm of their initial position (Fig. 4D, 90–93 min). Again, most amyloplasts were able to translocate to the new gravity-associated bottom of the cell following the reorientation (Fig. 4D, rotation). In contrast, Wm treatment of zig-1 mutants had dramatic effects on amyloplast movement. Initially, zig-1 amyloplast movement was highly restricted to within 5 μm of their starting position immediately after Wm application (Fig. 4E, 3–8 min) in a similar fashion to untreated seedlings (Fig. 2C). However, after 90 min their range of motion had increased to within 10 μm, and sometimes up to 17 μm from their original position (Fig. 4E, 90–93 min). After rotation, several amyloplasts were able to relocate to the bottom of the cell and move up to 30 μm (Fig. 4E, rotation). These data confirm that altering vacuolar membrane morphology has profound effects on amyloplast movement in zig-1. Wortmannin treatment of zig-1 statocytes partially restores gravitropism We have shown above that statocytes in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl may be located just below the hook (Fig. 1). To confirm this, we took advantage of the effect of Wm on zig-1 vacuoles and amyloplast sedimentation (Fig. 4). Thus, we tested whether local Wm application to either the top or bottom of the hypocotyl was sufficient to restore gravity response in zig-1. A small dot of growth medium containing either 1% (v/v) DMSO (control) or 33 μM Wm was placed over the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl. The plates were then rotated 90° from the original gravity vector and the angle of hypocotyl curvature (α) was measured after 20 h (Fig. 5A). Col-0 WT responded to the new gravity vector when DMSO (control) was placed at the top of the hypocotyls, while zig-1 displayed an agravitropic response, as expected (Fig. 5B). When medium containing Wm was placed at the top of Col-0 hypocotyls, it induced a slight delay in graviresponse as indicated by an increase in the seedlings with an angle between 0 and 30° and a decrease in those between 30 and 60°. However, local application of Wm to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls resulted in an enhanced response to gravity. zig-1 mutants treated with DMSO showed a strong agravitropic phenotype, with most seedlings in the –30 to 0° and 0 to 30° categories, while zig-1 mutants treated with Wm at the top showed an increase in the hypocotyls between 30 and 60° and a decrease in those between –30 and 0° (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that Wm application to the upper hypocotyl partially suppresses the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 mutants. In contrast, application of Wm to the bottom of the hypocotyl did not have major effects on gravity response in zig-1 (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, only local Wm application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls can enhance their gravitropic response. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Local Wm application at the top of hypocotyls enhances gravitropism of zig-1. Three-day-old seedlings from Col-0 WT and zig-1 were treated at either the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl with a dot of AGM containing DMSO or 33 μM Wm. Seedlings were then exposed to a 90° rotation, and the angle of hypocotyl curvature was measured after 20 h. (A) Illustrations showing the placement of medium dots containing DMSO or Wm at either the top or the bottom of hypocotyls, the angle of hypocotyl curvature between the first gravity vector (g1) and the top of the hypocotyl, and how the angle distributions are represented. (B) Application of Wm at the top of the hypocotyl enhances zig-1 gravitropism. Shown are the angle distributions for WT and zig-1 treated with DMSO or Wm at the top of the hypocotyl (n=87–112). (This figure is available in color at JXB online.) Loss of VTI11 has dramatic consequences for endoplasmic reticulum organization The dramatic restriction on amyloplast movement in zig-1 prompted us to determine if fragmented vacuoles altered the morphology of organelles of the endomembrane system, which could impede their flow. To this end, VHA-a1-GFP, a marker for the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Dettmer et al., 2006), and mCherry-HDEL, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Nelson et al., 2007), were analysed in the zig-1 background. Organelle morphology was analysed in hypocotyl cortical cells given the weak fluorescence of these markers in the endodermis. VHA-a1-GFP labeled typical TGN structures in WT and the zig-1 background (Fig. 6A–D). Not surprisingly, TGN puncta were found both in the cell cortex and in the cytosol that surrounded fragmented vacuoles of zig-1 (Fig. 6C, D). Therefore, loss of VTI11 does not appear to have an effect on TGN morphology. The mCherry-HDEL marker showed the canonical ER network organization at the cell cortex and ER bodies in WT (Nelson et al., 2007) (Fig. 6E, F). The ER was found surrounding the small vacuoles of zig-1, similar to the other organelles, but two distinct abnormalities could be detected. First, the cortical organization of the ER was altered as there was enrichment of ER membranes in the cortical domains that abutted juxtaposed vacuoles (Fig. 6G). In addition, aggregates of ER were found in the cytosolic domains between juxtaposed vacuoles and these appear to have restrictions in their movement (Fig. 6H and Supplementary Movies S1 and S2). These aggregates of ER could result from accumulation of fusiform bodies at these sites, in addition to aggregated ER membranes, but these are difficult to differentiate at the resolution of a light microscope. These defects indicate that vacuole morphology is important for proper ER organization. To further test this possibility, we determined whether Wm treatment of zig-1 would restore the cortical ER organization by promoting vacuole fusion. There were no apparent changes to the ER network in WT hypocotyls after treatment with Wm (Fig. 6I, J), although membrane aggregates were sometimes observed. As expected, Wm treatment induced the fusion of vacuoles in zig-1, and the enrichment of ER membranes was no longer observed in the cortex after a 2 h washout (Fig. 6K, L). These results overall indicate that vacuole morphology defects in zig-1 do not alter the morphology of the TGN, but it does have a dramatic effect on the organization of the ER. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Loss of VTI11 function results in impaired ER morphology. Hypocotyl cells from 3-d-old seedlings from Col-0 wild-type or zig-1 expressing subcellular markers were imaged by confocal microscopy. Seedlings were grown in the dark. A cortical section and a medial section of the same cell are shown for each marker. (A–D) Col-0 wild-type or zig-1 expressing VHA-a1-GFP. (E–L) Dark-grown Col-0 WT or zig-1 seedlings expressing the ER marker mCherry-HDEL were treated with 1% (v/v) DMSO (E–H) or 33 μM Wm (I–L) for 3 h and then transferred to AGM for 2 h before imaging. Identical microscope settings were used for both genotypes. Scale bar: 20 μm. Vacuoles and amyloplasts associate by cytoskeleton-independent mechanisms F-actin is involved in amyloplast saltatory movements in wild-type (Saito et al., 2005; Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002), and it may function as a negative regulator of sedimentation (Nakamura et al., 2011), but its specific role in the gravity response is unknown (Blancaflor, 2013). Because amyloplasts appear trapped between fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 (Fig. 1) and are relatively static (Fig. 2), it was important to investigate if F-actin or microtubules were involved in restricting their movement. The cytoskeleton was visualized using the F-actin marker ABD2-GFP (Wang et al., 2004) or microtubule (MT) marker TUA6-GFP (Ueda et al., 1999) in cortical and medial sections of epidermal cells (Fig. 7). F-actin cables were observed at the cortex in zig-1 (Fig. 7C) similar to the WT (Fig. 7A), except that the F-actin network surrounds the fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 (Fig. 7C). We conclude that the fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 do not impede F-actin polymerization or cortical arrangement. Similarly, microtubules were detected in the cell cortex in WT (Fig. 7E) and zig-1 (Fig. 7G). However, dense MT arrays were also observed close to juxtaposing vacuoles (Fig. 7H). Overall, the lack of a central vacuole in zig-1 does not appear to cause aggregates or abnormalities in the composition of the cytoskeletal network, except that both polymers are found surrounding the zig-1 vacuoles. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab The cytoskeleton organization at the cortex is not affected in zig-1. Four-day-old seedlings from Col-0 WT (A, B, E, F) or zig-1 (C, D, G, H) expressing ABD2-GFP to label F-actin (A–D) or TUA6-GFP to label microtubules (E–H) were imaged by confocal microscopy. Both cortical sections (A, C, E, G) and medial sections (B, D, F, H) for a representative cell are shown. Seedlings were grown in the dark. Arrowheads indicate zones with cytoskeleton enrichment that are found above juxtaposing vacuoles. Scale bar: 20 μm. (This figure is available in color at JXB online.)We conducted gravitropic assays in the presence and absence of the cytoskeleton inhibitors lantrunculin B (Lat-B) or oryzalin to determine if the cytoskeleton contributed to the static behavior of zig-1 amyloplasts. Lat-B induced an increase in the response to gravity in WT including an increase in the hypocotyls between 60 and 90° and hypocotyl curvatures of more than 90° in 22.1% of seedlings (Fig. 8A). No changes were observed in zig-1, with or without Lat-B, as most zig-1 hypocotyls were found in two categories, –30 to 0° and 0 to 30°, in both treatments (Fig. 8A). The ABD2-GFP marker was included in these experiments as a control to show the effectiveness of the Lat-B treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S3A). A possible role of MT in tethering of amyloplasts was also tested (Fig. 8B). There was a delay in the response of the oryzalin-treated seedlings, with an increase in the proportion of seedlings in the 0–30° category and a decrease in the 60–90° category. In the case of zig-1, both treatments resulted in very similar angle distributions, with almost all seedlings bending to an angle between –30 and 30°. Therefore, treatment with oryzalin does not enhance graviresponse of zig-1. Again, the TUA6-GFP marker was used to confirm the effectiveness of the oryzalin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Neither lantrunculin B (Lat B) nor oryzalin treatment suppresses the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1. Gravitropism assay with Col-0 WT and zig-1 in the presence of cytoskeleton inhibitors. Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 d in the dark, and then transferred to AGM plates containing 1% (v/v) DMSO (A, B), 2 μM Lat-B (A) or 20 μM oryzalin (B). Plates were returned to the dark and oriented at 90° from the original gravity vector (g1). After 20 h the angle of hypocotyl curvature was measured between g1 and the top of the hypocotyl. The distribution of seedlings in each degree class is indicated. n=77–100.That neither Lat-B nor oryzalin treatments suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 suggested that neither actin nor MT depolymerization was sufficient to release amyloplasts from the static inter-vacuolar junctions. To confirm this, amyloplast sedimentation was visualized after inhibitor treatment in the endodermis of dark-grown hypocotyls (see Supplementary Fig. S3B). In this experiment, seedlings were incubated overnight in the presence of DMSO, 2 μM Lat-B or 20 μM oryzalin to depolymerize the cytoskeleton. Seedlings were then incubated vertically for 10 min, imaged, incubated vertically again for 10 min but upside down (180° rotation), and then imaged again. Wild-type amyloplasts sedimented to the new bottom of the cell after the 180° rotation regardless of chemical pretreatment. In contrast, zig-1 amyloplasts did not sediment in either of the chemical treatments as shown by their static localization before and after reorientation (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Since depolymerization of F-actin or MT does not enhance gravity response in zig-1, nor does it restore amyloplast sedimentation, these results overall indicate that actin filaments or microtubules are not contributing to the immobile nature of amyloplasts by serving as a physical tether connecting amyloplasts and tonoplast. Therefore, the static nature of zig-1 amyloplasts is not explained by physical associations with the cytoskeleton. Wm enhances graviresponse of vti11 alleles through dynamic TVS formation We have demonstrated that immobile amyloplasts in zig-1 hypocotyls increase dynamic movements after Wm treatments. We then quantified transvacuolar strands (TVSs) in hypocotyls of WT and itt3 before and after Wm treatment (Fig. 9A) to test whether this enhanced motion is due to vacuolar membrane remodeling through changes in TVS formation. The parental line showed 3.07 ± 0.22 TVSs per cell in hypocotyl epidermis, while itt3 mutants had only 0.22 ± 0.04 TVSs when DMSO treatments were used (Fig. 9B). The number of TVSs increased to 4.17 ± 0.10 in the parental line and to 1.60 ± 0.05 for itt3 when seedlings were treated with Wm for 2 h. The significant increase in the number of TVSs after Wm treatment for both the parental line and itt3 suggests that Wm not only promotes vacuole fusion, but has a positive effect on vacuole membrane dynamics as well.

    "discussion": "Discussion Here, we used live-cell imaging to analyse the dynamics of amyloplast sedimentation in Arabidopsis hypocotyls from whole seedlings. Previous studies have utilized cuttings from inflorescence stems (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005; Toyota et al., 2013b ). Our microscope set-up allowed us to image endodermis through the almost transparent cortex of etiolated hypocotyls using a fluorescence microscope. A very small amount of Immersol allowed us to use a water immersion objective on the vertical stage, which provided optimal resolution. This unique set-up allowed us to track amyloplast sedimentation in real time and in whole plants without the concerns of plant injury. The system is amenable for cell biology analysis, including treatment with chemical inhibitors, and long-term time-lapse experiments. Furthermore, this system can overcome the challenges of imaging using stem cuttings, which have been shown to affect the vacuole morphology of certain mutants (Hashiguchi et al., 2014). One caveat of our system is the need to illuminate the seedlings during image acquisition, which we have addressed with a green filter to minimize phototropic responses. Green light, however, has been shown to enhance hypocotyl growth and inhibit blue and red phototropic responses in dark-grown seedlings (Folta, 2004; Folta and Maruhnich, 2007; McCoshum and Kiss, 2011). Therefore, experiments in the vertical stage must be interpreted with caution as they may be influenced by effects of the green light on seedling growth. Restriction of amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1 is dependent on its vacuole phenotype A role for the vacuole in gravity perception or response is well documented (Morita et al., 2002; Yano et al., 2003; Saito et al., 2005). The VTI11 loss of function mutant sgr4/zig-1 was originally identified for its agravitropic phenotype in shoots (Yamauchi et al., 1997; Kato et al., 2002), and it was later shown to display abnormal vacuole morphology and reduced vacuole fusion (Zheng et al., 2014b ). We used zig-1 and a second allele, itt3, as tools to interrogate the role of vacuole dynamics on gravitropism in Arabidopsis hypocotyls. As expected, WT endodermal cells from hypocotyl statocytes show a large central vacuole and sedimented amyloplasts that appeared surrounded by tonoplast membrane. This organization is very similar to that found in inflorescence stems (Morita et al., 2002). In contrast, and consistent with other tissues (Zheng et al., 2014a ,b), smaller unfused vacuoles were detected in endodermal statocytes from zig-1 mutants, where the amyloplasts were found distributed almost randomly throughout the cell. In these cells, amyloplasts appeared trapped at the junction of juxtaposing vacuoles, and this organization seems to prevent amyloplast movement in zig-1, both before and after gravistimulation, as depicted by time-lapse experiments. Surprisingly, conditions of hypergravity up to 10 g were not sufficient to force amyloplasts to sediment in these cells. It is unlikely that the fragmented vacuoles alone would be sufficient to prevent the movement of these organelles simply by creating physical obstacles to their movements along the cytosolic space. Therefore, we propose that a physical tether exists between the vacuole and amyloplasts that is of sufficient strength to resist a 10 g force. In fact in the case of zig-1, each amyloplast seems attached to multiple vacuoles, which perhaps generates a strong physical tethering structure to resist this hypergravity pull. In contrast, hypergravity is known to increase amyloplast sedimentation and gravitropic curvature of other agravitropic mutants such as sgr2, sgr9, and pgm (Toyota et al., 2013b ), but none of these mutants displays a fragmented vacuole phenotype. Amyloplast sedimentation has been shown to occur via transvacuolar strands (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005), and therefore we asked whether the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1 could impair TVS formation. In fact, zig-1 mutants formed very few TVS structures in epidermal cells when compared with the WT, which could contribute to the reduced sedimentation of amyloplasts inside their statocytes. This possibility is consistent with the phenotype of the sgr2 mutant, which displays fewer TVSs than WT and is agravitropic (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005). Treatment with Wm induces fusion and restores the vacuole morphology of zig-1 (Zheng et al., 2014a ,b). We used this assay to test whether the vacuole morphology phenotype of zig-1 was necessary for their lack of amyloplast sedimentation and the role of vacuole morphology on this movement. As expected, Wm treatment increased amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1. The Wm-induced vacuole fusion may have this effect due to the following: (i) vacuole fusion could disrupt the putative tethers between amyloplasts and the vacuolar membrane proposed above and therefore increase mobility of these organelles; (ii) vacuole fusion could restore the ability to form TVSs, which could become conduits for amyloplast sedimentation; (iii) restoring the single vacuole phenotype could remove physical obstacles formed by the vacuoles themselves. We indeed confirmed that Wm-induced vacuole fusion increases the formation of TVSs in epidermal cells. However, TVSs alone are probably not sufficient because sgr2 mutants, which do not form TVSs in stems, were able to reposition amyloplasts along a hypergravity vector (Toyota et al., 2013b ). Future research is needed to address the role of a putative tethering system to determine if all three possibilities play a role in this response. The alternate possibility that Wm is actually affecting gravitropism through effects on cellular events unrelated to vacuolar function seems less likely as Wm action on gravity response is not seen in WT plants where these other sites of action would presumably still be present. Shoot statocytes comprise young endodermal cells near the top of the hypocotyl The endodermal layer of the hypocotyl has been identified as the graviperceptive tissue in shoots (Fukaki et al., 1998). Visualization of endodermal cells in the medial region of the hypocotyl of etiolated seedlings indicated that most cells did not show the expected sedimented amyloplasts, and instead these organelles were in constant motion from cytoplasmic streaming. Only the smaller cells in the upper hypocotyl of an average length of 70 μm or less showed sedimented amyloplasts that were consistent with graviperception. To confirm this result, we took advantage of the phenotype of zig-1 and Wm treatment. This provided a unique opportunity to test whether amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1 at the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl was associated with restoration of gravitropism. Adding Wm at the top of the hypocotyl enhanced gravitropism in these mutants, but the treatment at the bottom did not. Therefore, only Wm treatment at the top is sufficient to restore the gravity response. This effect is correlated with an increase in amyloplast sedimentation as shown by organelle tracking experiments. Altogether, these results indicate that the statocytes in etiolated hypocotyls are localized to the young endodermal cells at the top of the hypocotyl. These results are consistent with the top ~4 cm region of the inflorescence stem being sufficient for graviresponse in mature plants (Fukaki et al., 1996a ) and the finding that displacement of amyloplasts at the base of the inflorescence stem does not result in inflorescence bending (Weise et al., 2000). The cytoskeleton is not involved in amyloplast tethering to zig-1 vacuoles A role for actin during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2002; Palmieri and Kiss, 2005; Saito et al., 2005; Blancaflor, 2013). The inability of amyloplasts to sediment in zig-1 could be due to the fragmented vacuoles being obstacles for movement. However the fact that hypergravity is not sufficient to release them indicates that there may be physical tethers between the amyloplasts and the vacuole. We tested whether such tethers could be formed in part by cytoskeletal structures and, therefore, if they could be disrupted with inhibitors that depolymerize MT and actin microfilaments. However, neither Lat-B nor oryzalin treatment was sufficient to overcome the block in sedimentation. This is consistent with previous reports indicating that the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin B in wild-type inflorescences (Saito et al., 2005). However, these results are not consistent with experiments in flowering snapdragon shoots, in which depolymerization of actin microfilaments with Lat-B released amyloplasts (Friedman et al., 2003). We conclude that the association between amyloplasts and the vacuole may occur either directly or indirectly but does not seem to involve the cytoskeleton. Contact sites between the vacuole and other organelles and association between those and amyloplasts may be responsible for the tethering that we have observed. Contact sites between plant subcellular organelles have been identified by electron microscopy or laser trapping, including between ER and plasma membrane (summarized in Staehelin, 1997), ER and endosomes (Stefano et al., 2015), and ER and Golgi (Sparkes et al., 2009). The vacuole has also been shown in tight association with the cytoskeleton (Scheuring et al., 2016) and the ER (Staehelin, 1997), and the latter may provide an anchoring system that may be important to regulate amyloplast sedimentation. Future analysis by electron microscopy in shoot endodermal cells may provide further support for these contact sites. The dramatic effects on ER morphology in the zig-1 mutant indicates that ER–vacuole interactions are critical for organelle structure. Given that no major changes in organelle morphology or distribution were observed for the TGN, we conclude that the vacuole is unlikely to form physical attachments with these organelles as it does for amyloplasts.",

Copyright notice ID: 5181587 PMID: 27816929 Highlight The highly restricted movement of amyloplasts in graviperceptive cells of zig-1 hypocotyls is overcome by wortmannin treatment, suggesting a physical association between amyloplasts and the vacuole. Key words: Amyloplasts, cytoskeleton, gravitropism, SNARE, vacuole, wortmannin.Abstract Gravitropism in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the sedimentation of amyloplasts in the endodermis, and a complex interplay between the vacuole and F-actin. Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 (zig-1), a mutant allele of VTI11, which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion. Using live-cell imaging with a vertical stage microscope, we determined that young endodermal cells below the apical hook that are smaller than 70 μm in length are the graviperceptive cells in dark-grown hypocotyls. This result was confirmed by local wortmannin application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls, which enhanced shoot gravitropism in zig-1 mutants. Live-cell imaging of zig-1 hypocotyl endodermal cells indicated that amyloplasts are trapped between juxtaposed vacuoles and their movement is severely restricted. Wortmannin-induced fusion of vacuoles in zig-1 seedlings increased the formation of transvacuolar strands, enhanced amyloplast sedimentation and partially suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 seedlings. Hypergravity conditions at 10 g were not sufficient to displace amyloplasts in zig-1, suggesting the existence of a physical tether between the vacuole and amyloplasts. Our results overall suggest that vacuole membrane remodeling may be involved in regulating the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts during graviperception.Introduction Plants have the capacity to sense and respond to the direction of gravity by precise modulation of growth patterns in roots and shoots (Hashiguchi et al., 2013). Gravitropism involves mechanisms of perception, signal transduction and auxin-directed differential growth. According to the starch-statolith hypothesis, sedimentation of amyloplasts in response to gravity stimuli is critical for gravity sensing (Masson et al., 2002). Gravity perception in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the ability to sense the position of starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, within shoot endodermal cells, or statocytes (Fukaki et al., 1998). This is supported by evidence that (i) mutants lacking an endodermis display agravitropic shoots (Fukaki et al., 1998), (ii) starchless mutants or mutants that lack amyloplasts show reduced gravitropism (Kiss et al., 1997; Weise and Kiss, 1999; Fujihira et al., 2000), (iii) hypergravity restored gravitropic sensitivity in starch-deficient mutants (Fitzelle and Kiss, 2001), and (iv) there is significant movement (sedimentation) of amyloplasts following gravistimulation (Saito et al., 2005; Hashiguchi et al., 2014). The sedimentation of amyloplasts in shoot statocytes is thought to trigger downstream signaling events, including changes in the transport of and response to auxin (Rakusova et al., 2011). The early events of signal transduction for gravitropism remain largely unknown, although several genes have been suggested to function in its early phases (Blancaflor and Masson, 2003). The current model of gravity sensing implicates the plant vacuole in the shoot gravity response (Morita et al., 2002; Yano et al., 2003; Hashiguchi et al., 2013). Shoot endodermal cells contain a large central vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume, and its role in gravity sensing is well established. Mutants with vacuolar defects, including mutant alleles of SHOOT GRAVITROPISM6 (SGR6), VTI11/ZIGZAG-1 (ZIG-1)/SGR4, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS22 (SYP22)/SGR3 and KATAMARI2 (KAM2) were identified from screens for agravitropic shoots in Arabidopsis (Fukaki et al., 1996b ; Yamauchi et al., 1997; Kato et al., 2002; Morita et al., 2002; Yano et al., 2003; Saito et al., 2005; Hashiguchi et al., 2014). A common phenotype in these mutants was the abnormal localization of amyloplasts in relation to the vacuole or abnormal vacuole morphology. In the case of zig-1 mutants, the movement of amyloplasts in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem was greatly reduced (Yano et al., 2003). Both VTI11 and SYP22 are SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins that have important roles in membrane fusion at the vacuole, including homotypic vacuole fusion (Chen and Scheller, 2001; Wickner, 2010; Zheng et al., 2014b ). Two mutant alleles of VTI11, zig-1 and impaired traffic to tonoplast3 (itt3), have multiple vacuoles per cell (Zheng et al., 2014a ,b). Treatment of itt3 and zig-1 with wortmannin (Wm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), resulted in vacuole fusion, and enhanced hypocotyl gravitropism (Zheng et al., 2014b ). This result is consistent with fragmented vacuoles being responsible for the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1. Two other proteins associated with endomembranes were implicated in gravitropism. KAT2 is a membrane-associated protein (Tamura et al., 2007), and SGR6 is a HEAT-domain containing protein involved in vacuole membrane remodeling (Hashiguchi et al., 2014). The roles of KAT2 or SGR6 in gravitropism are still unknown. A tight association between amyloplasts and the large central vacuole has been described in inflorescence endodermal cells. In resting cells, amyloplasts are found at the bottom of the cell, where they undergo saltatory movements and are almost completely surrounded by the vacuole membrane (Morita et al., 2002; Yano et al., 2003; Morita, 2010). Amyloplast sedimentation that results from changes in the gravity vector occurs inside transvacuolar strands (TVSs), and the amyloplasts remain tightly associated with the vacuolar membrane during this time (Saito et al., 2005; Moirta et al., 2012). TVSs may allow movement of organelles, and their formation requires actin filaments (Gao et al., 2005; Leitz et al., 2009; Moirta et al., 2012). It is unclear if the F-actin inside TVSs is required for amyloplast association with the vacuole, sedimentation, or mechanisms of gravity perception (Morita, 2010; Blancaflor, 2013), but F-actin cables have been shown to associate with sedimenting amyloplasts inside TVSs (Saito et al., 2005). However, the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin-B in wild-type inflorescences (Saito et al., 2005). Overall, the mechanisms by which amyloplasts are so closely attached to vacuolar membranes, including TVSs, and the role of this interaction for gravitropism have not been elucidated. Interestingly, kat2 mutants, which are agravitropic in shoots, develop fewer transvacuolar strands in leaves and petioles (Tamura et al., 2007), but it is not known if this is the case for shoot endodermal cells. Even though a clear role for the vacuole in gravity perception is well established, the molecular mechanisms for vacuolar control or perception of amyloplast sedimentation has not been identified. In addition to the vacuole, important roles for actin filaments have been reported, but their role during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear (Blancaflor, 2013). Actin depolymerizing drugs have been reported to enhance gravity response in hypocotyls (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2002), reduce amyloplast sedimentation in endodermal cells (Palmieri and Kiss, 2005) or have no effect in experiments with live cells (Saito et al., 2005). An important role of the actin cytoskeleton was demonstrated by the identification of the shoot gravitropism9 (sgr9) mutant, which shows reduced amyloplast sedimentation due to increased interactions between amyloplasts and F-actin (Nakamura et al., 2011). SGR9 encodes an E3 ligase that may disrupt the attachment of amyloplasts to F-actin during saltatory movements and as a result promote amyloplast sedimentation (Nakamura et al., 2011). The difficulty of establishing a role of F-actin in gravity perception may be due to the complexity of interactions that it may have with a multitude of cellular components, including amyloplasts. Here we used live-cell imaging on a vertical stage microscope to demonstrate the role of the large central vacuole in shoot gravitropism in seedlings. Our results identified the upper hypocotyl endodermis as the gravisensing tissue and highlight a novel tight interaction between the vacuolar membrane and amyloplasts. The fragmented vacuoles in endodermal cells of zig-1 hypocotyls restrict amyloplast movement, contributing to the agravitropic phenotype of this mutant. We show that application of Wm to zig-1 enhances their gravitropic response, restores amyloplast sedimentation and enhances the formation of TVSs. Additionally, we show that the tight association between vacuoles and amyloplasts observed in zig-1 hypocotyls involves neither F-actin nor microtubules.Materials and methods Plant material and growth conditions The zig-1 mutant line was previously described (Kato et al., 2002). The parental and itt3 lines contain the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-TIP2;1 and the mCherry-HDEL markers (Zheng et al., 2014b ), and marker lines expressing the fluorescent protein fusions VHA-a1:GFP (Dettmer et al., 2006), ABD2-GFP (Wang et al., 2004) and TUA6-GFP (Ueda et al., 1999) were described before. Seeds were surface sterilized and incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 2–5 d. Seeds were sown on Arabidopsis growth medium (AGM; 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium, 4 g l–1 GelRite, 1% (w/v) sucrose) and transferred to a 22 °C growth chamber with 16 h/8 h day/night photoperiod. For dark grown experiments, plants were incubated in light for 8 h to stimulate germination prior to growth in the dark.Plasmid construction and plant transformations The pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP construct was generated by amplifying a 2 kb fragment corresponding to the SCARECROW promoter (pSCR2.0) from pENTR 5′pSCR2.0 (Levesque et al., 2006; Sozzani et al., 2010) using primers 5′-AAGCTTTGCCAAA CAGATATTTGCATTTGGGCTATG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTAGG AGATTGAAGGGTTGTT-3′. The pSCR2.0 PCR fragment was cloned into VAC-GK (Nelson et al., 2007) by restriction enzyme and ligation with HindIII and XhoI to generate pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP. The resulting plasmid was then transformed into zig-1 or Col-0 WT by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998).Chemical stocks and treatments All chemical treatments used 4-d-old seedlings unless otherwise specified. Stock solutions of 3.3 mM wortmannin (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 μM latrunculin B (Lat-B; Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 mM oryzalin (Sigma-Aldrich) were made in 100% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted to working concentrations in liquid AGM as 1% (v/v) DMSO, 33 μM Wm, 2 μM Lat-B and 20 μM oryzalin. Vacuole fusion assays were carried out by incubating seedlings in either DMSO or Wm for 90 min to 2 h before rinsing in diH2O and imaging. Lugol solution was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (62650). Staining was carried out by submerging Col-0 WT seedlings in solution for 20 min, while maintaining their growth orientation. Next, they were washed in diH2O for 10 min before they were mounted on microscope slides.Microscopy Imaging in a vertical stage was carried out with a Leica DM5000 compound microscope equipped with a Leica DFC365 FX camera, and a Leica ×40/1.0 NA water objective was used. The microscope was outfitted with a custom-made 90° InverterScope objective inverter (LSM Technologies) between the objective turret and the ×40 objective and a custom-made vertical stage (LSM Technologies) that included a manual rotation stage (Thor Labs). Bright-field imaging was accomplished by placing an aspheric condenser lens (cat. no. ACL1210-A, Thor Labs) inside the rotation stage ~10 mm behind the sample, and an adaptor was made by 3-D printing to attach the end of a light guide to the back of the vertical stage. The adaptor included a slit to slide a blocking sheet or a green filter (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). All imaging was done with the green filter inside the slit. Etiolated seedlings were affixed to slides using a very fine layer of Hollister Medical Adhesive (Behera and Kudla, 2013). A 1.0 mm silicon isolator (cat. no. CWS-13R-1.0, Grace BioLabs) and a coverslip were used to create a chamber filled with water, and Immersol 518 F (Carl Zeiss) was used as the immersion oil for the water objective. A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a ×40 water objective (1.1 NA) or ×20 objective (0.8 NA) was used for confocal microscopy. The excitation/emission wavelengths during acquisition were 488 nm/492–557 nm for GFP, and 516 nm/582–670 nm for mCherry. TVSs were counted as previously described (Han et al., 2015). Briefly, hypocotyls were imaged in 600 μm thick optical sections using a ×20 (0.8 NA) objective to capture the volume of entire cells. Vacuolar membrane folds were counted as TVSs if they were formed by a double membrane, even if they did not transverse the entire vacuole in the XY plane. A centrifuge microscope was used for hypergravity experiments as previously described (Toyota et al., 2013a ,b). Four-day-old etiolated seedlings were mounted in a chamber to fix the specimen on the centrifuge microscope before rotation; 10 g was applied after 10–20s of imaging and held continuously for 60s.Quantification of organelle movement Tracking amyloplast movement was performed with the MTrackJ plugin of ImageJ. Amyloplast movement was quantified capturing time-lapse images for 3 min at 10 s intervals, but only amyloplasts that could be traced throughout all frames were scored. Seedlings were 4 d old for all experiments. The x, y coordinates of each amyloplast were recorded from each image. Then, the change in position in the x (Δx) and y (Δy) axes were determined and plotted in a coordinate graph. A stationary reference point such as the corner of a cell was used to correct for stage drift. Tracking of amyloplasts during hypergravity experiments was carried out with G-Track spot-tracking software (G-Angstrom, Japan) as described (Toyota et al., 2013a ).Gravitropism assay and hypocotyl curvature Col-0 WT and zig-1 were sown on AGM, wrapped in foil to simulate dark, and oriented vertically for 3 d. All subsequent transfers took place in a dark room using a green safe light. Wm treatment was carried out by first aligning seedlings to the first gravity vector (g1) before placing an AGM dot containing either 1% (v/v) DMSO or 33 μM Wm on the top or bottom of the seedlings. For cytoskeleton inhibitor treatments, seedlings were transferred to fresh plates containing DMSO, 2 μM Lat-B or 20 μM oryzalin, and aligned to g1. Plates were wrapped in foil after transfers, rotated 90°, and scanned after another 20 h in the dark. ImageJ was used to measure hypocotyl curvature as the angle between the top of the hypocotyl and g1. All experiments were repeated at least three times.Results Statocytes in etiolated hypocotyls are restricted to young cells below the apical hook Amyloplast sedimentation in shoots has been well characterized by live-cell microscopy in inflorescence stems (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005; Toyota et al., 2013b ) but not in seedlings. In order to characterize mechanisms of gravity perception in seedlings, we first quantified amyloplast sedimentation in wild-type (WT) hypocotyl endodermal cells by Lugol staining (Fig. 1A). When cells from the upper portion of the hypocotyl were imaged, 97.8% of the amyloplasts were found sedimented in the direction of gravity. However, only 9.5% of amyloplasts were observed at the bottom of the cell when cells were imaged further down the hypocotyl. This result suggests that amyloplast sedimentation may be restricted to endodermal cells just below the apical hook. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Graviperceptive cells are located just below the shoot apex. (A) Endodermal cells below the apical hook contain sedimented amyloplasts. Col-0 WT seedlings were stained with Lugol solution and imaged on a compound microscope while maintaining a vertical orientation. The insets show representative cells from the region just below the apical hook (top) or a region towards the middle of the hypocotyl (bottom). Percentages under the insets represent the proportion of amyloplasts found at the bottom of cells in each region of the hypocotyl. n=88 amyloplasts from 23 cells and three seedlings. Arrowheads indicate the position of amyloplasts. Scale bar: 100 μm. (B) Increase of cell length along the hypocotyl endodermis.

Cell length data also include seedlings stained with Lugol solution and imaged by bright-field. n=7 seedlings. Scale bar: 100 μm. (C) Amyloplasts get trapped between vacuoles in zig-1 endodermis. Endodermal cells near the shoot meristem of Col-0 WT (Col-0) and zig-1 seedlings expressing pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP were imaged by bright-field and confocal microscopy. Arrowheads mark the position of amyloplasts. Insets show the association between tonoplast and amyloplast. Scale bar: 20 μm.We measured cell length along the upper hypocotyl endodermis to better understand the potential transition between statocytes and non-statocytes. Cell length was estimated from bright-field images of Lugol-stained WT, as well as confocal images of a GFP-tagged vacuolar marker exclusively expressed in the endodermis (pSCR::TIP-1;1-GFP, Fig. 1B). Cell length varied from 23 ± 3.69 to 94 ± 0.82 μm in this region when measured from the apical hook to ~1 mm towards the root, but on average, only cells with length <70 μm showed sedimented amyloplasts. Using amyloplast sedimentation as a marker for the ability to perceive gravity, the small cells at the top of the hypocotyl are more likely to correspond to the shoot statocytes. Given this result, all subsequent experiments described below were conducted with endodermal cells between 30 and 70 μm in length within this region of the hypocotyl. Amyloplasts in graviperceptive cells have been shown to be closely associated with the vacuole membrane (Morita et al., 2002), and mutants in the SNARE protein VTI11 have abnormal vacuole morphology (Zheng et al., 2014b ) and agravitropic phenotypes (Kato et al., 2002). The vacuole was visualized in WT and zig-1 using the pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP marker in order to determine the relationship between the vacuole and amyloplast in seedlings. As expected, a large central vacuole occupies most of the volume of WT endodermal cells and the tonoplast surrounds the sedimented amyloplasts (Fig. 1C). In contrast, zig-1 displays a fragmented vacuole phenotype in shoot endodermal cells, as previously described for other tissues (Zheng et al., 2014b ). It is important to note that amyloplasts do not sediment in zig-1 mutants and appear to be trapped at the junction between two or more adjacent vacuoles (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, and similar to zig-1 inflorescences (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005), the tonoplast does not tightly surround the amyloplasts in zig-1 hypocotyls. These results indicate that the vacuole phenotype of zig-1 impinges on the distribution of amyloplasts in hypocotyl endodermal cells and likely prevents their sedimentation.The dynamic behavior of endodermal amyloplasts is restricted in zig-1 A novel set-up for live-cell imaging on a vertical microscope was developed to identify mechanisms of vacuolar membrane dynamics involved in gravity perception or response (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Seedlings were grown vertically for 4 d before being mounted in a slide chamber and equilibrated for 5 min. Sequential images were acquired at 10 s intervals for 3 min (Saito et al., 2005) in the vertical stage (Fig. 2A). Most WT amyloplasts were detected at the bottom of the cell between 0 and 3 min (Fig. 2B, 0–3 min), and organelle tracking indicates that they exhibited dynamic saltatory movements (Fig. 2B, 0–3 min). In contrast, zig-1 amyloplasts were found more widely distributed in the cell between 0 and 3 min, and they were severely limited in their movement as shown by their comparatively static tracks (Fig. 2C). Next, seedlings were rotated 90° and imaged immediately for the following 3 min (Fig. 2A). Amyloplasts from WT sedimented in the direction of gravity after reorientation as shown by the organelle tracks between 0 and 3 min after rotation (Fig. 2B, rotation). In contrast, amyloplasts from zig-1 continued to be much more limited in their movement even after a reorientation (Fig. 2C, rotation). These results, and those from inflorescences (Saito et al., 2005), support the role of the central vacuole in shoot gravity sensing. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Amyloplast dynamics in hypocotyl endodermal cells before and after gravity reorientation. (A) Schematic representation of the rotation experiment. The orientation of the seedling with respect to gravity (g) before and after rotation is shown. Displacement of an amyloplast (gray circle) during a 3 min time lapse is shown with a pink arrow, and is expressed as a change in the horizontal position (Δx) and the vertical position (Δy). Positive values correspond to right and down and negative values correspond to left and up. (B, C) Amyloplast movements before and after rotation. A representative cell from the endodermis of Col-0 WT (B) or zig-1 (C) is shown before (0–3 min) or after (rotation) a 90° rotation. Images correspond to the amyloplast positions at the start (0m) or the end (3m) of a 3 min time lapse. Tracks of representative amyloplasts are shown as different colored lines at the right of each panel. Arrowheads indicate one to two amyloplasts. Scale bar: 15 μm. (D, E) Quantification of amyloplast movements in WT and zig-1 before and after rotation. Coordinate graph showing amyloplast displacement between 0 and 3 min in Col-0 WT (D) or zig-1 (E). Time-lapse experiments were carried out either before (blue triangles) or after (orange crosses) a 90° rotation. n=73 amyloplasts from four seedlings of Col-0; n=65 amyloplasts from four seedlings of zig-1.Quantification of amyloplast movement indicated that their movement in WT before rotation occurred in all directions for up to 10 μm (Fig. 2D, E). Following a 90° reorientation, most amyloplasts translocated to the new bottom of the cell (lower right quadrant of the graph) for up to 30 μm. On the other hand, amyloplast movement in zig-1 was confined to <5 μm in all directions before reorientation, and there was little change in their position after a 90° reorientation (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that the fragmented vacuoles may impair movement of these organelles in zig-1. Reduced amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1 hypocotyls could be due to the physical impediments created by the fragmented vacuoles. To address this question, we utilized hypergravity conditions to increase sedimentary movement and analysed amyloplast behavior using a centrifuge microscope (Toyota et al., 2013a ,b). Two types of gravistimulation were used at 10 g, one applied longitudinally (along the shoot–root longitudinal axis) and a second applied perpendicularly, similar to a 90° reorientation assay. Upon application of hypergravity in either direction, amyloplasts in WT moved and reached the edge of the cell within 60 s (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, when 10 g was applied in either direction in zig-1, amyloplast movements were highly restricted (Fig. 3A), indicating a potential tight association between amyloplasts and the tonoplast itself. Measurements of amyloplast velocity indicated that these differences are significant (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results suggest that failure of amyloplasts to sediment in zig-1 is due to the abnormal vacuoles and a potential physical interaction between vacuoles and amyloplasts. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Hypergravity does not displace amyloplasts in the zig-1 mutant. (A) Hypergravity (10 g) was applied either longitudinally or perpendicularly to 4-d-old dark grown WT and zig-1 seedlings. Amyloplast localization was imaged by bright-field. Amyloplasts in WT relocate to the gravity associated bottom of the cell within 1 min of hypergravity; however, amyloplast movement in zig-1 is much more restricted. Scale bar: 20 μm. (B) The velocity of amyloplast movement in Col-0 and zig-1 was analysed under the 10 g conditions. Data are shown as means and error bars represent standard error. Different letters denote significant differences among all four data (P<0.05, one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s multiple comparison test). n=9–17 amyloplasts. (This figure is available in color at JXB online.)Wortmannin-induced vacuolar membrane fusion releases endodermal amyloplasts in zig-1 Wm was used to test the effect of vacuole fusion on amyloplast sedimentation. Wm inhibits PI3-kinase, reduces the amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate in cellular membranes (Jung et al., 2002), and induces vacuole fusion in zig-1 (Zheng et al., 2014b ). Seedlings were treated with 33 μM Wm in the vertical microscope stage (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online), and time lapses were collected within 3–8 min of Wm application and after 90 min. Figure 4A shows the orientation of the seedlings throughout the experiment. No obvious differences in amyloplast dynamics were observed in WT seedlings 3–8 min after Wm application (Fig. 4B, 3–8 min) when compared with the untreated control (Fig. 2B). Additionally, amyloplast movements still appeared severely limited in zig-1 when seedlings were imaged within 8 min of Wm treatment (Fig. 4C, 3–8 min). After 90 min of Wm treatment, WT amyloplasts were still sedimented in the direction of gravity, but the amplitude of saltatory movements seemed reduced (Fig. 4B, 90–93 min). In contrast, 90 min of Wm treatment in zig-1 resulted in many amyloplasts being found at the bottom of the cell (Fig. 4C, 90–93 min), compared with the untreated zig-1 (Fig. 2C). Seedlings were then rotated 90° and they were again imaged for 3 min immediately after. Upon reorientation, WT amyloplasts sedimented to the new gravity-associated cell bottom within 3 min (Fig. 4B, rotation). Finally, several amyloplasts in Wm-treated zig-1 sedimented in the direction of gravity following reorientation and their tracks were more similar to WT (Fig. 4C, rotation). Collectively, these results suggest that Wm treatment, which induces vacuole fusion, is sufficient to release amyloplasts in the endodermis of zig-1 hypocotyls. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Wortmannin treatment enhances amyloplast dynamics in zig-1 hypocotyls. (A) Representation of the rotation experiment showing the orientation of the seedling with respect to gravity throughout the experiment. Displacement of an amyloplast (grey circle) during a 3 min time lapse is shown with a pink arrow, and is expressed as a change in the horizontal (Δx) and the vertical (Δy) position. Positive values correspond to displacement to the right and down while negative values correspond to displacement towards the left and up. Seedlings were incubated vertically in the presence of 33 μM Wm and imaged immediately for 3 min (top, 3–8 min). Another 3 min time lapse was captured after 90 min of Wm treatment (middle, 90–93 min), and finally, seedlings were rotated 90° and a 3 min time lapse was captured immediately (bottom, rotation). (B, C) Amyloplast movements after a Wm treatment. A representative cell from the endodermis of Col-0 WT (B) or zig-1 (C) was imaged immediately after Wm treatment (3–8 min), 90 min after Wm treatment (90–93min) or 90 min after Wm treatment and a 90° rotation (rotation). Images correspond to the amyloplast positions at the start (0m) or the end (3m) of a 3 min time lapse. Tracks of representative amyloplasts are shown as different colored lines at the right of each panel. Arrowheads indicate one to two amyloplasts. Scale bar: 15 μm. (D, E) Quantification of amyloplast movements in WT and zig-1 after Wm treatment. Coordinate graph showing amyloplast displacement between 0 and 3 min of each time lapse in Col-0 WT (D) or zig-1 (E). Time lapse experiments were carried out within 3–8 min of Wm treatment (blue triangle), after 90 min of Wm treatment before rotation (orange crosses), or after 93 min of Wm treatment followed by a 90° rotation (yellow circles). n=110 amyloplasts from four seedlings of Col-0; n=98 amyloplasts from four seedlings of zig-1.Quantification of amyloplast movements during these experiments indicated that amyloplast saltatory motion in WT was large (up to 20 μm) and showed no obvious bias in direction shortly after Wm treatment (Fig. 4D, 3–8 min). However, Wm treatment for 90 min restricted amyloplast movement in WT to within 10 μm of their initial position (Fig. 4D, 90–93 min). Again, most amyloplasts were able to translocate to the new gravity-associated bottom of the cell following the reorientation (Fig. 4D, rotation). In contrast, Wm treatment of zig-1 mutants had dramatic effects on amyloplast movement. Initially, zig-1 amyloplast movement was highly restricted to within 5 μm of their starting position immediately after Wm application (Fig. 4E, 3–8 min) in a similar fashion to untreated seedlings (Fig. 2C). However, after 90 min their range of motion had increased to within 10 μm, and sometimes up to 17 μm from their original position (Fig. 4E, 90–93 min). After rotation, several amyloplasts were able to relocate to the bottom of the cell and move up to 30 μm (Fig. 4E, rotation). These data confirm that altering vacuolar membrane morphology has profound effects on amyloplast movement in zig-1.Wortmannin treatment of zig-1 statocytes partially restores gravitropism We have shown above that statocytes in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl may be located just below the hook (Fig. 1). To confirm this, we took advantage of the effect of Wm on zig-1 vacuoles and amyloplast sedimentation (Fig. 4). Thus, we tested whether local Wm application to either the top or bottom of the hypocotyl was sufficient to restore gravity response in zig-1. A small dot of growth medium containing either 1% (v/v) DMSO (control) or 33 μM Wm was placed over the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl. The plates were then rotated 90° from the original gravity vector and the angle of hypocotyl curvature (α) was measured after 20 h (Fig. 5A). Col-0 WT responded to the new gravity vector when DMSO (control) was placed at the top of the hypocotyls, while zig-1 displayed an agravitropic response, as expected (Fig. 5B). When medium containing Wm was placed at the top of Col-0 hypocotyls, it induced a slight delay in graviresponse as indicated by an increase in the seedlings with an angle between 0 and 30° and a decrease in those between 30 and 60°. However, local application of Wm to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls resulted in an enhanced response to gravity. zig-1 mutants treated with DMSO showed a strong agravitropic phenotype, with most seedlings in the –30 to 0° and 0 to 30° categories, while zig-1 mutants treated with Wm at the top showed an increase in the hypocotyls between 30 and 60° and a decrease in those between –30 and 0° (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that Wm application to the upper hypocotyl partially suppresses the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 mutants. In contrast, application of Wm to the bottom of the hypocotyl did not have major effects on gravity response in zig-1 (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, only local Wm application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls can enhance their gravitropic response. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Local Wm application at the top of hypocotyls enhances gravitropism of zig-1. Three-day-old seedlings from Col-0 WT and zig-1 were treated at either the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl with a dot of AGM containing DMSO or 33 μM Wm. Seedlings were then exposed to a 90° rotation, and the angle of hypocotyl curvature was measured after 20 h. (A) Illustrations showing the placement of medium dots containing DMSO or Wm at either the top or the bottom of hypocotyls, the angle of hypocotyl curvature between the first gravity vector (g1) and the top of the hypocotyl, and how the angle distributions are represented. (B) Application of Wm at the top of the hypocotyl enhances zig-1 gravitropism. Shown are the angle distributions for WT and zig-1 treated with DMSO or Wm at the top of the hypocotyl (n=87–112). (This figure is available in color at JXB online.)Loss of VTI11 has dramatic consequences for endoplasmic reticulum organization The dramatic restriction on amyloplast movement in zig-1 prompted us to determine if fragmented vacuoles altered the morphology of organelles of the endomembrane system, which could impede their flow. To this end, VHA-a1-GFP, a marker for the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Dettmer et al., 2006), and mCherry-HDEL, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Nelson et al., 2007), were analysed in the zig-1 background. Organelle morphology was analysed in hypocotyl cortical cells given the weak fluorescence of these markers in the endodermis. VHA-a1-GFP labeled typical TGN structures in WT and the zig-1 background (Fig. 6A–D). Not surprisingly, TGN puncta were found both in the cell cortex and in the cytosol that surrounded fragmented vacuoles of zig-1 (Fig. 6C, D). Therefore, loss of VTI11 does not appear to have an effect on TGN morphology. The mCherry-HDEL marker showed the canonical ER network organization at the cell cortex and ER bodies in WT (Nelson et al., 2007) (Fig. 6E, F). The ER was found surrounding the small vacuoles of zig-1, similar to the other organelles, but two distinct abnormalities could be detected. First, the cortical organization of the ER was altered as there was enrichment of ER membranes in the cortical domains that abutted juxtaposed vacuoles (Fig. 6G). In addition, aggregates of ER were found in the cytosolic domains between juxtaposed vacuoles and these appear to have restrictions in their movement (Fig. 6H and Supplementary Movies S1 and S2). These aggregates of ER could result from accumulation of fusiform bodies at these sites, in addition to aggregated ER membranes, but these are difficult to differentiate at the resolution of a light microscope. These defects indicate that vacuole morphology is important for proper ER organization. To further test this possibility, we determined whether Wm treatment of zig-1 would restore the cortical ER organization by promoting vacuole fusion. There were no apparent changes to the ER network in WT hypocotyls after treatment with Wm (Fig. 6I, J), although membrane aggregates were sometimes observed. As expected, Wm treatment induced the fusion of vacuoles in zig-1, and the enrichment of ER membranes was no longer observed in the cortex after a 2 h washout (Fig. 6K, L). These results overall indicate that vacuole morphology defects in zig-1 do not alter the morphology of the TGN, but it does have a dramatic effect on the organization of the ER. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Loss of VTI11 function results in impaired ER morphology. Hypocotyl cells from 3-d-old seedlings from Col-0 wild-type or zig-1 expressing subcellular markers were imaged by confocal microscopy. Seedlings were grown in the dark. A cortical section and a medial section of the same cell are shown for each marker. (A–D) Col-0 wild-type or zig-1 expressing VHA-a1-GFP. (E–L) Dark-grown Col-0 WT or zig-1 seedlings expressing the ER marker mCherry-HDEL were treated with 1% (v/v) DMSO (E–H) or 33 μM Wm (I–L) for 3 h and then transferred to AGM for 2 h before imaging. Identical microscope settings were used for both genotypes. Scale bar: 20 μm.Vacuoles and amyloplasts associate by cytoskeleton-independent mechanisms F-actin is involved in amyloplast saltatory movements in wild-type (Saito et al., 2005; Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002), and it may function as a negative regulator of sedimentation (Nakamura et al., 2011), but its specific role in the gravity response is unknown (Blancaflor, 2013). Because amyloplasts appear trapped between fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 (Fig. 1) and are relatively static (Fig. 2), it was important to investigate if F-actin or microtubules were involved in restricting their movement. The cytoskeleton was visualized using the F-actin marker ABD2-GFP (Wang et al., 2004) or microtubule (MT) marker TUA6-GFP (Ueda et al., 1999) in cortical and medial sections of epidermal cells (Fig. 7). F-actin cables were observed at the cortex in zig-1 (Fig. 7C) similar to the WT (Fig. 7A), except that the F-actin network surrounds the fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 (Fig. 7C). We conclude that the fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 do not impede F-actin polymerization or cortical arrangement. Similarly, microtubules were detected in the cell cortex in WT (Fig. 7E) and zig-1 (Fig. 7G). However, dense MT arrays were also observed close to juxtaposing vacuoles (Fig. 7H). Overall, the lack of a central vacuole in zig-1 does not appear to cause aggregates or abnormalities in the composition of the cytoskeletal network, except that both polymers are found surrounding the zig-1 vacuoles. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab The cytoskeleton organization at the cortex is not affected in zig-1. Four-day-old seedlings from Col-0 WT (A, B, E, F) or zig-1 (C, D, G, H) expressing ABD2-GFP to label F-actin (A–D) or TUA6-GFP to label microtubules (E–H) were imaged by confocal microscopy. Both cortical sections (A, C, E, G) and medial sections (B, D, F, H) for a representative cell are shown. Seedlings were grown in the dark. Arrowheads indicate zones with cytoskeleton enrichment that are found above juxtaposing vacuoles. Scale bar: 20 μm. (This figure is available in color at JXB online.)We conducted gravitropic assays in the presence and absence of the cytoskeleton inhibitors lantrunculin B (Lat-B) or oryzalin to determine if the cytoskeleton contributed to the static behavior of zig-1 amyloplasts. Lat-B induced an increase in the response to gravity in WT including an increase in the hypocotyls between 60 and 90° and hypocotyl curvatures of more than 90° in 22.1% of seedlings (Fig. 8A). No changes were observed in zig-1, with or without Lat-B, as most zig-1 hypocotyls were found in two categories, –30 to 0° and 0 to 30°, in both treatments (Fig. 8A). The ABD2-GFP marker was included in these experiments as a control to show the effectiveness of the Lat-B treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S3A). A possible role of MT in tethering of amyloplasts was also tested (Fig. 8B). There was a delay in the response of the oryzalin-treated seedlings, with an increase in the proportion of seedlings in the 0–30° category and a decrease in the 60–90° category. In the case of zig-1, both treatments resulted in very similar angle distributions, with almost all seedlings bending to an angle between –30 and 30°. Therefore, treatment with oryzalin does not enhance graviresponse of zig-1. Again, the TUA6-GFP marker was used to confirm the effectiveness of the oryzalin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Neither lantrunculin B (Lat B) nor oryzalin treatment suppresses the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1. Gravitropism assay with Col-0 WT and zig-1 in the presence of cytoskeleton inhibitors. Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 d in the dark, and then transferred to AGM plates containing 1% (v/v) DMSO (A, B), 2 μM Lat-B (A) or 20 μM oryzalin (B). Plates were returned to the dark and oriented at 90° from the original gravity vector (g1). After 20 h the angle of hypocotyl curvature was measured between g1 and the top of the hypocotyl. The distribution of seedlings in each degree class is indicated. n=77–100.That neither Lat-B nor oryzalin treatments suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 suggested that neither actin nor MT depolymerization was sufficient to release amyloplasts from the static inter-vacuolar junctions. To confirm this, amyloplast sedimentation was visualized after inhibitor treatment in the endodermis of dark-grown hypocotyls (see Supplementary Fig. S3B). In this experiment, seedlings were incubated overnight in the presence of DMSO, 2 μM Lat-B or 20 μM oryzalin to depolymerize the cytoskeleton. Seedlings were then incubated vertically for 10 min, imaged, incubated vertically again for 10 min but upside down (180° rotation), and then imaged again. Wild-type amyloplasts sedimented to the new bottom of the cell after the 180° rotation regardless of chemical pretreatment. In contrast, zig-1 amyloplasts did not sediment in either of the chemical treatments as shown by their static localization before and after reorientation (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Since depolymerization of F-actin or MT does not enhance gravity response in zig-1, nor does it restore amyloplast sedimentation, these results overall indicate that actin filaments or microtubules are not contributing to the immobile nature of amyloplasts by serving as a physical tether connecting amyloplasts and tonoplast. Therefore, the static nature of zig-1 amyloplasts is not explained by physical associations with the cytoskeleton.Wm enhances graviresponse of vti11 alleles through dynamic TVS formation We have demonstrated that immobile amyloplasts in zig-1 hypocotyls increase dynamic movements after Wm treatments. We then quantified transvacuolar strands (TVSs) in hypocotyls of WT and itt3 before and after Wm treatment (Fig. 9A) to test whether this enhanced motion is due to vacuolar membrane remodeling through changes in TVS formation. The parental line showed 3.07 ± 0.22 TVSs per cell in hypocotyl epidermis, while itt3 mutants had only 0.22 ± 0.04 TVSs when DMSO treatments were used (Fig. 9B). The number of TVSs increased to 4.17 ± 0.10 in the parental line and to 1.60 ± 0.05 for itt3 when seedlings were treated with Wm for 2 h. The significant increase in the number of TVSs after Wm treatment for both the parental line and itt3 suggests that Wm not only promotes vacuole fusion, but has a positive effect on vacuole membrane dynamics as well. Fig. 9. Open in a new tab Wm treatment induces the formation of transvacuolar strands (TVSs). (A) Thick optical sections were captured for TVS quantification at low magnification. Example images used from WT and itt3 hypocotyls are shown for both DMSO and Wm treatments. The types of TVS that were counted are indicated with arrowheads. Note that membranes that fully surrounded a vacuole in itt3 were not included (arrows). (B) Average number of TVSs per cell in parental and itt3. n=60 cells total from four seedlings per genotype. Mean values are statistically significant (Student’s t test, two tailed, P≤0.05) if letters are different.Discussion Here, we used live-cell imaging to analyse the dynamics of amyloplast sedimentation in Arabidopsis hypocotyls from whole seedlings. Previous studies have utilized cuttings from inflorescence stems (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005; Toyota et al., 2013b ). Our microscope set-up allowed us to image endodermis through the almost transparent cortex of etiolated hypocotyls using a fluorescence microscope. A very small amount of Immersol allowed us to use a water immersion objective on the vertical stage, which provided optimal resolution. This unique set-up allowed us to track amyloplast sedimentation in real time and in whole plants without the concerns of plant injury. The system is amenable for cell biology analysis, including treatment with chemical inhibitors, and long-term time-lapse experiments. Furthermore, this system can overcome the challenges of imaging using stem cuttings, which have been shown to affect the vacuole morphology of certain mutants (Hashiguchi et al., 2014). One caveat of our system is the need to illuminate the seedlings during image acquisition, which we have addressed with a green filter to minimize phototropic responses. Green light, however, has been shown to enhance hypocotyl growth and inhibit blue and red phototropic responses in dark-grown seedlings (Folta, 2004; Folta and Maruhnich, 2007; McCoshum and Kiss, 2011). Therefore, experiments in the vertical stage must be interpreted with caution as they may be influenced by effects of the green light on seedling growth. Restriction of amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1 is dependent on its vacuole phenotype A role for the vacuole in gravity perception or response is well documented (Morita et al., 2002; Yano et al., 2003; Saito et al., 2005). The VTI11 loss of function mutant sgr4/zig-1 was originally identified for its agravitropic phenotype in shoots (Yamauchi et al., 1997; Kato et al., 2002), and it was later shown to display abnormal vacuole morphology and reduced vacuole fusion (Zheng et al., 2014b ). We used zig-1 and a second allele, itt3, as tools to interrogate the role of vacuole dynamics on gravitropism in Arabidopsis hypocotyls. As expected, WT endodermal cells from hypocotyl statocytes show a large central vacuole and sedimented amyloplasts that appeared surrounded by tonoplast membrane. This organization is very similar to that found in inflorescence stems (Morita et al., 2002). In contrast, and consistent with other tissues (Zheng et al., 2014a ,b), smaller unfused vacuoles were detected in endodermal statocytes from zig-1 mutants, where the amyloplasts were found distributed almost randomly throughout the cell. In these cells, amyloplasts appeared trapped at the junction of juxtaposing vacuoles, and this organization seems to prevent amyloplast movement in zig-1, both before and after gravistimulation, as depicted by time-lapse experiments. Surprisingly, conditions of hypergravity up to 10 g were not sufficient to force amyloplasts to sediment in these cells. It is unlikely that the fragmented vacuoles alone would be sufficient to prevent the movement of these organelles simply by creating physical obstacles to their movements along the cytosolic space. Therefore, we propose that a physical tether exists between the vacuole and amyloplasts that is of sufficient strength to resist a 10 g force. In fact in the case of zig-1, each amyloplast seems attached to multiple vacuoles, which perhaps generates a strong physical tethering structure to resist this hypergravity pull. In contrast, hypergravity is known to increase amyloplast sedimentation and gravitropic curvature of other agravitropic mutants such as sgr2, sgr9, and pgm (Toyota et al., 2013b ), but none of these mutants displays a fragmented vacuole phenotype. Amyloplast sedimentation has been shown to occur via transvacuolar strands (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005), and therefore we asked whether the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1 could impair TVS formation. In fact, zig-1 mutants formed very few TVS structures in epidermal cells when compared with the WT, which could contribute to the reduced sedimentation of amyloplasts inside their statocytes. This possibility is consistent with the phenotype of the sgr2 mutant, which displays fewer TVSs than WT and is agravitropic (Morita et al., 2002; Saito et al., 2005). Treatment with Wm induces fusion and restores the vacuole morphology of zig-1 (Zheng et al., 2014a ,b). We used this assay to test whether the vacuole morphology phenotype of zig-1 was necessary for their lack of amyloplast sedimentation and the role of vacuole morphology on this movement. As expected, Wm treatment increased amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1. The Wm-induced vacuole fusion may have this effect due to the following: (i) vacuole fusion could disrupt the putative tethers between amyloplasts and the vacuolar membrane proposed above and therefore increase mobility of these organelles; (ii) vacuole fusion could restore the ability to form TVSs, which could become conduits for amyloplast sedimentation; (iii) restoring the single vacuole phenotype could remove physical obstacles formed by the vacuoles themselves. We indeed confirmed that Wm-induced vacuole fusion increases the formation of TVSs in epidermal cells. However, TVSs alone are probably not sufficient because sgr2 mutants, which do not form TVSs in stems, were able to reposition amyloplasts along a hypergravity vector (Toyota et al., 2013b ). Future research is needed to address the role of a putative tethering system to determine if all three possibilities play a role in this response. The alternate possibility that Wm is actually affecting gravitropism through effects on cellular events unrelated to vacuolar function seems less likely as Wm action on gravity response is not seen in WT plants where these other sites of action would presumably still be present.Shoot statocytes comprise young endodermal cells near the top of the hypocotyl The endodermal layer of the hypocotyl has been identified as the graviperceptive tissue in shoots (Fukaki et al., 1998). Visualization of endodermal cells in the medial region of the hypocotyl of etiolated seedlings indicated that most cells did not show the expected sedimented amyloplasts, and instead these organelles were in constant motion from cytoplasmic streaming. Only the smaller cells in the upper hypocotyl of an average length of 70 μm or less showed sedimented amyloplasts that were consistent with graviperception. To confirm this result, we took advantage of the phenotype of zig-1 and Wm treatment. This provided a unique opportunity to test whether amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1 at the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl was associated with restoration of gravitropism. Adding Wm at the top of the hypocotyl enhanced gravitropism in these mutants, but the treatment at the bottom did not. Therefore, only Wm treatment at the top is sufficient to restore the gravity response. This effect is correlated with an increase in amyloplast sedimentation as shown by organelle tracking experiments. Altogether, these results indicate that the statocytes in etiolated hypocotyls are localized to the young endodermal cells at the top of the hypocotyl. These results are consistent with the top ~4 cm region of the inflorescence stem being sufficient for graviresponse in mature plants (Fukaki et al., 1996a ) and the finding that displacement of amyloplasts at the base of the inflorescence stem does not result in inflorescence bending (Weise et al., 2000).The cytoskeleton is not involved in amyloplast tethering to zig-1 vacuoles A role for actin during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2002; Palmieri and Kiss, 2005; Saito et al., 2005; Blancaflor, 2013). The inability of amyloplasts to sediment in zig-1 could be due to the fragmented vacuoles being obstacles for movement. However the fact that hypergravity is not sufficient to release them indicates that there may be physical tethers between the amyloplasts and the vacuole. We tested whether such tethers could be formed in part by cytoskeletal structures and, therefore, if they could be disrupted with inhibitors that depolymerize MT and actin microfilaments. However, neither Lat-B nor oryzalin treatment was sufficient to overcome the block in sedimentation. This is consistent with previous reports indicating that the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin B in wild-type inflorescences (Saito et al., 2005). However, these results are not consistent with experiments in flowering snapdragon shoots, in which depolymerization of actin microfilaments with Lat-B released amyloplasts (Friedman et al., 2003). We conclude that the association between amyloplasts and the vacuole may occur either directly or indirectly but does not seem to involve the cytoskeleton. Contact sites between the vacuole and other organelles and association between those and amyloplasts may be responsible for the tethering that we have observed. Contact sites between plant subcellular organelles have been identified by electron microscopy or laser trapping, including between ER and plasma membrane (summarized in Staehelin, 1997), ER and endosomes (Stefano et al., 2015), and ER and Golgi (Sparkes et al., 2009). The vacuole has also been shown in tight association with the cytoskeleton (Scheuring et al., 2016) and the ER (Staehelin, 1997), and the latter may provide an anchoring system that may be important to regulate amyloplast sedimentation. Future analysis by electron microscopy in shoot endodermal cells may provide further support for these contact sites. The dramatic effects on ER morphology in the zig-1 mutant indicates that ER–vacuole interactions are critical for organelle structure. Given that no major changes in organelle morphology or distribution were observed for the TGN, we conclude that the vacuole is unlikely to form physical attachments with these organelles as it does for amyloplasts.Supplementary data Supplementary data are available at JXB online.

Copyright notice ID: 4936552 PMID: 27261066 Mathematical modeling coupled with direct measurement of Ca2+ and ROS dynamics suggest that ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium release propagates stress-induced Ca2+ waves in plants.Abstract Plants exhibit rapid, systemic signaling systems that allow them to coordinate physiological and developmental responses throughout the plant body, even to highly localized and quickly changing environmental stresses. The propagation of these signals is thought to include processes ranging from electrical and hydraulic networks to waves of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytoplasmic Ca2+ traveling throughout the plant. For the Ca2+ wave system, the involvement of the vacuolar ion channel TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) has been reported. However, the precise role of this channel and the mechanism of cell-to-cell propagation of the wave have remained largely undefined. Here, we use the fire-diffuse-fire model to analyze the behavior of a Ca2+ wave originating from Ca2+ release involving the TPC1 channel in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We conclude that a Ca2+ diffusion-dominated calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism is insufficient to explain the observed wave transmission speeds. The addition of a ROS-triggered element, however, is able to quantitatively reproduce the observed transmission characteristics. The treatment of roots with the ROS scavenger ascorbate and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium and analysis of Ca2+ wave propagation in the Arabidopsis respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (AtrbohD) knockout background all led to reductions in Ca2+ wave transmission speeds consistent with this model. Furthermore, imaging of extracellular ROS production revealed a systemic spread of ROS release that is dependent on both AtRBOHD and TPC1. These results suggest that, in the root, plant systemic signaling is supported by a ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism intimately involving ROS production by AtRBOHD and Ca2+ release dependent on the vacuolar channel TPC1. Plants possess a rapid systemic signaling network that enables whole-plant responses to localized stimuli. Examples include wounding (Miller et al., 2009), pathogen attack (Dempsey and Klessig, 2012), and osmotic shock (Christmann et al., 2007). The system(s) involved in the plant-wide propagation of these signals has been proposed to be mediated by a diverse set of molecular regulators, including changes in membrane potential and ion fluxes (Felle and Zimmermann, 2007; Zimmermann et al., 2009; Mousavi et al., 2013), hydraulics in the vasculature (Christmann et al., 2007; Farmer et al., 2014), and reactive oxygen species (ROS; Miller et al., 2009). A novel addition to this suite of systemic signals was described by Choi et al. (2014), in which a wave-like propagation of increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ moved throughout the plant in response to localized salt stress. This signal propagated through the roots at a velocity of 396 ± 28 μm s−1 and induced the expression of a range of stress-response genes in the leaves. Unlike systemic signals described previously, this Ca2+ wave preferentially propagates through the root cortical and endodermal cells rather than the vasculature (Choi et al., 2014). Furthermore, the velocity of the signal is slower than the reported speed of 800 to 1,400 μm s−1 seen with the other proposed systemic signals, such as the ROS wave or electrical coupling (Miller et al., 2009; Mousavi et al., 2013). Choi et al. (2014) revealed that the Ca2+ wave could be blocked by the application of pharmacological agents (La3+ and Ruthenium Red) known to inhibit calcium-release pathways and that disruption of the TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) gene results in a substantial drop in wave speed (Table I). Furthermore, overexpression of TPC1 increased the speed of the wave by a factor of 1.7 (Table I). TPC1 also appears to be involved in systemic wound-related Ca2+ increases (Kiep et al., 2015), yet for many stress responses, whole-plant Ca2+ signaling dynamics appear unchanged in TPC1 mutants (Ranf et al., 2008).

(2014) AtrbohD 73 ± 19 This study Open in a new tabTPC1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) encodes the slow vacuolar (SV) channel (Hedrich and Neher, 1987; Peiter et al., 2005) that has been shown to be permeable to cations such as K+ but also to Ca2+ (Ward and Schroeder, 1994; Gradogna et al., 2009). The SV channel has been proposed to mediate Ca2+ release from the vacuole (Ward and Schroeder, 1994; Allen and Sanders, 1996; Pottosin et al., 2009), although this idea has become controversial in recent years (Hedrich and Marten, 2011). The original electrophysiological characterization of the SV channel showed that it could be modulated by Ca2+ levels (Hedrich and Neher, 1987), and now structural and genetic analyses of the channel indicate the presence of Ca2+-binding EF hand domains on the cytosolic face of the channel that aid channel activation (Guo et al., 2016; Kintzer and Stroud, 2016; for review, see Hedrich and Marten, 2011), coupled with a novel Ca2+-sensitive regulatory domain on its vacuolar lumenal face that shifts the channel’s voltage activation toward more positive potentials as vacuolar Ca2+ levels rise (Beyhl et al., 2009; Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2016). The recently published structure of TPC1 (Guo et al., 2016; Kintzer and Stroud, 2016) indicates several possible sites of phosphorylation offering further scope for regulation. Indeed, SV channel activity is known to be regulated by a host of cytosolic factors (for review, see Hedrich and Marten, 2011). However, in general, the precise role of TPC1 in potentially mediating stress-induced Ca2+ changes, and also which regulatory mechanisms may act to modulate TPC1 channel gating in such responses, remain unclear. For example, while some of the genetic components of the wave-like propagation of stress information by Ca2+ (such as TPC1; Choi et al., 2014; Kiep et al., 2015) have been identified, the molecular mechanisms mediating the spread of this wave have yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, we used mathematical models to provide insight into the possible modes to generate this wave and to produce testable predictions for empirical validation of these models. We conclude that a simple calcium-induced calcium-release (CICR) mechanism is unlikely. To support the speeds of wave transmission seen in vivo, we suggest that a ROS-assisted CICR mechanism involving TPC1 and ROS production by the NADPH oxidase Arabidopsis RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (AtRBOHD) may be required. RESULTS Models Based on CICR Do Not Recapitulate the Experimentally Determined Speed of Ca2+ Wave Propagation under Physiological Conditions The experimental investigation of Choi et al. (2014) highlighted a number of different Ca2+ wave speeds in roots in response to chemical perturbations and in mutant lines of Arabidopsis in response to local NaCl stress application (Table I). For instance, increasing the abundance of TPC1 using a 35S promoter resulted in a significantly increased wave speed. Our approach to begin to dissect this system, therefore, has been to evaluate whether there are parameters for a mathematical model of Ca2+ wave propagation that can reproduce the empirically determined wild-type velocity and whether those same parameters, but with an increased number of TPC1 channels, also can capture the speed in the TPC1 overexpression line. Failure to do so would indicate that further elements and/or other mechanisms need to be considered in the model. This approach of testing whether a model is consistent with the available data has the advantage of not requiring experimental values for all parameters (which might be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine). Given the direct effect that TPC1 has on the propagation of the Ca2+ wave, we first considered whether a CICR mechanism mediated by TPC1 could be involved. As discussed in the introduction, TPC1’s ability to directly mediate the release of vacuolar Ca2+ is not clear (Hedrich and Marten, 2011), and its role could well be indirect. However, one key strength of the modeling strategy is that it does not make any statement about the identity of the channels responsible for mediating the release of Ca2+, just that it is dependent on TPC1 action. CICR can be described mathematically through the fire-diffuse-fire model (Keizer et al., 1998; Ponce-Dawson et al., 1999; Timofeeva and Coombes, 2003; Coombes et al., 2004). This framework describes the process in which a quantity of Ca2+, σi, released through a channel at position xi and at time ti diffuses through the cytosol and activates the next channel at position xi+1. This mechanism has the capacity to create a wave of Ca2+ that is regenerated each time a channel opens. Approximating wave propagation through roots as a one-dimensional system, the concentration of Ca2+, u(x,t), can be determined using the diffusion equation: (1) where D is the diffusion constant of Ca2+, σ is the release strength, and τR is the time for which the channel remains open. Channels are modeled as point sources that are characterized by Dirac delta functions, δ(x), in space and by the product of two Heaviside step functions, H(t), in time, to capture the open time. A channel at a position, xi, on the vacuole is assumed to open when the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration at that position is greater than the threshold value uc. This gating value represents the mathematical description of either the concentration-dependent binding kinetics of a ligand-gated channel or the requisite buildup of ionic charge needed to open a voltage-gated channel. We assume that the release of Ca2+ from the vacuole occurs quickly compared with the time for diffusion between channels, so that we can treat a release as a point source in time (τR = 0). For a system of equally spaced channels with separation d, the velocity of the resulting wave is given by Pearson and Ponce-Dawson (1998): (2) Within a cell, the vacuole (with the ubiquitously expressed channel TPC1) typically occupies 50% to 90% of the interior volume (Macklon et al., 1996), whereas plasmodesmata, presumably lacking TPC1, connect cells, leading to two distinct regions for the propagation of the wave in the model (Fig. 1A). In the first, the Ca2+ wave is propagated through the cytoplasm surrounding the vacuole. In the case of approximately equally distributed TPC1 channels on the tonoplast, the Ca2+ wave has a velocity given by Equation 2. In the second region, the wave must move between neighboring cells. If the mechanism behind transmission in the cytoplasm is a self-propagating wave of CICR mediated by TPC1, then presumably this mechanism will reduce to passive diffusion over a distance dv (the cell wall region) between the cytoplasm in adjacent cells through plasmodesmata. We assumed that this plasmodesmal coupling poses no obstacle to diffusion, so that the model has the best chance of propagating a wave at maximal speed. In this case, Ca2+ moving from a cell takes a time, T, to activate the first TPC1 channel on the tonoplast of the neighboring cell. The concentration profile for a single release evaluated at the time of activation of the next channel (when u = uc) then satisfies the expression (3) We assume here that the activation of the first channel in the neighboring cell is dominated by Ca2+ released from the closest channel in the previous cell. Within this model, the velocity of a Ca2+ wave is determined by the velocities across these two regions. The spatial and temporal resolution of the experiments measuring these speeds (Choi et al., 2014) is insufficient to robustly distinguish transmission through each cell versus the cell-to-cell component crossing dv, even using the high spatial and temporal resolution afforded by confocal microscopy. Therefore, the transit speed between the two regions cannot be separated and so is averaged in the empirical measurements. For a cell of length L, this average speed is given by (4) The time taken to cross the cell wall region (Eq. 3) and the velocity in the cytoplasm surrounding each vacuole region (Eq. 2) both depend on the parameter ratio σ/uc. This dependency implies that, in order to decrease the time spent crossing the cell wall region, the cell must change the release properties of the channels, but this has a corresponding effect on how quickly the wave crosses the cytoplasm in the vacuolar region. We used the measured velocity in the wild type, 395 μm s−1, the measured density of TPC1 channels in mesophyll cells, d = 1 μm (Pottosin and Schönknecht, 2007), and a commonly used value for the diffusion rate of Ca2+ in the cytosol, D = 20 μm2 s−1 (Allbritton et al., 1992), to calculate an estimate for this unknown parameter ratio, σ/uc. We then used this value to determine if the model can recapitulate the velocity in the TPC1 overexpressor (oxTPC1), 679 ± 73 μm s−1 (Choi et al., 2014). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Ca2+ wave propagation via CICR and Ca2+ diffusion through the plasmodesmata can explain observed velocities under strict circumstances. A, Scheme of the model. Calcium is released through activated TPC1, and it diffuses through the cytoplasm a distance dtpc1 to activate neighboring TPC1 channels. At the end of a cell (length L), the signal diffuses passively to activate the neighboring cell (distance dv) through the plasmodesmata. B, Predicted wave speeds for the TPC1 overexpressor (OxTPC1) for a range of L and dv using Equations 2 to 4, where the model parameters are chosen to fit the wild-type velocity (Table I). The shaded region indicates 1 sd in the observed velocity. C, To account for distributions in dv, two simple schemes were tested. A one-dimensional array of cells with either dv = 10 μm (white) or dv = (blue) was set up in sequential order (i) or in random order (ii). D, The result of varying the proportion of cells within Ci with , as described in B, and utilizing a full simulation (see “Materials and Methods”).The overexpressor has an increased density of TPC1 channels, which results in a decreased channel separation and so altered wave kinetics in the model. Peiter et al. (2005) measured the average numbers of TPC1 channels in vacuolar membrane patches in both the wild type and the overexpressor line. With the average channel density measured by Pottosin and Schönknecht (2007), we used the channel number data to estimate the channel separation. For the TPC1 overexpressor, we obtained a channel separation, d, of about 0.6 μm. Using this channel separation estimate and the ratio σ/uc calculated from the wild-type data, we calculated the expected velocity in the TPC1 overexpressor for a range of cell lengths and intervacuolar distances, dv, covering those found in the regions of the Arabidopsis root where empirical wave speed determinations have been performed (Fig. 1B). We see that the model can only recapitulate the velocity in the overexpressor when dv is sufficiently small. This result did not depend on our choice of diffusion constant (Supplemental Fig. S1A) but could be affected by changes in the channel separation, d (Supplemental Fig. S1B). Since our chosen value for d came from TPC1 channel density data from mesophyll cells and the wave travels through the root, different expression levels of TPC1 could result in different densities of TPC1 on the vacuolar membrane. We tested for such potential differences with quantitative PCR (QPCR) analysis of roots and shoots dissected from plants grown as for the Ca2+ imaging. This analysis showed no statistically significant difference between root and shoot expression in the wild type (Supplemental Fig. S2). In the overexpressor, shoots showed a 1.9-fold higher transcript level than the roots of the same plants, so any change in actual channel density between roots and shoots will likely be small. Measurements of cell wall thickness in leaves (Moghaddam and Wilman, 1998) and imaging of tonoplast intrinsic proteins in root cells (Werner et al., 2003; Hunter et al., 2007; Gattolin et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2014) suggest typical values of dv in the range of 1 to 2 μm, with values of 10 μm and even 60 μm in some cases. Due to the variability in such parameters drawn from the literature, we used the GFP signals in the images from the Ca2+ measurement data to visualize the cytoplasm of the cells used for Ca2+ wave speed measurement and so define where the vacuoles within each cell likely ended. We then measured the distance between the vacuole (where the yellow fluorescent protein [YFP] signal was less than 2 sd above background) in one cell to the vacuole in the adjacent cell using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). As the Ca2+ wave speed is constant throughout the root at approximately 400 µm s−1 in the wild type (Choi et al., 2014), we concentrated on making these measurements in images taken at the 1,000-µm region from the root tip to allow direct comparison with the data in Figures 3 and 4, which focus on Ca2+ wave responses at this point in the root. Using this approach, average cytoplasmic lengths between vacuoles in adjacent cells were 4.4 ± 1.2 µm (epidermis; mean ± sd, n = 29), 5.4 ± 1.5 µm (cortex; n = 38), and 4.9 ± 1.4 (endodermis; n = 41). It is important to note that vacuoles are dynamic organelles, so these measurements should be viewed as time-averaged values of vacuolar behavior, as they are taken from random images across multiple independent experiments.

Open in a new tab The Ca2+ wave has a reduced velocity in the AtrbohD mutant. Ca2+ propagation occurred in mature root, 1,000 µm shootward from the site of direct salt stimulation at the root tip. A, Kymographs showing altered Ca2+ wave dynamics in the wild type versus the AtrbohD mutant. To generate the kymogram, quantitative ratiometric data (YFP-to-cyan fluorescent protein [CFP] ratio) were extracted from a region of interest (ROI) 1,000 µm from the tip site of 100 mm NaCl addition (monitor in the diagram at top). Starting at the edge of this ROI closest to the root tip, ratiometric data from a 5-µm-tall (along the root-shoot axis of the root) × 144-µm-wide region covering the cortex and endodermis was averaged and plotted at 0 µm of ROI. This 5-µm-tall region was then moved 5 µm shootward within the ROI and the analysis repeated, and the average ratio value was plotted at 5 µm of ROI. This process was repeated at sequential 5-µm distances from the start point to cover the 200-µm region of the root depicted. Analysis was then repeated on each of the images taken for the time course of the experiment (imaging every 2 s). Data were extracted using this approach from five roots and averaged, and pseudocolor-coded results are presented. B, Representative images of the time course of Ca2+ increase measured at 1,000 µm from the site of 100 mm NaCl to the root tip. Ca2+ levels were monitored using confocal ratio imaging of plants expressing Yellow Cameleon nano-65 and pseudocolor coded according to the scale at right. Time represents seconds after NaCl addition. Results shown are representative of n ≥ 5. Note that Ca2+ increase is limited primarily to cortex and endodermal cells in both the wild type and atrbohD, but the increase is delayed in the atrbohD mutant. Bar = 100 µm.To assess the sensitivity of the model to dv and how well the measured intervacuolar distances could support a model that recapitulates measured wave speeds, we extended our modeling analysis to consider an array of cells with different values for dv, distributed either as two blocks of cells (Fig. 1Ci) or randomly among the array (Fig. 1Cii). This approach requires that we simulate the fire-diffuse-fire process as described in “Materials and Methods” rather than estimate the velocity using Equation 4. As before, we use the measured velocity in the wild type to determine the unconstrained parameter ratio, σ/uc, and then increased the TPC1 channel density to evaluate whether the model can recapitulate the measured velocity in the overexpressor. We asked what proportion of the array must have a small dv value if the largest value of dv is 10 μm. Figure 1D shows how, even with an intervacuole separation of 1 μm, the smallest value suggested in the literature (Moghaddam and Wilman, 1998; Werner et al., 2003; Hunter et al., 2007; Gattolin et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2014) and much less than our average measurements of dv in the root cortex and endodermis, more than 75% of the cells must have this value to reproduce the empirically determined wave speed. Figure 1D has the cells organized according to the scheme in Figure 1Ci, but the choice of cell distribution has no effect on the predicted velocities. Thus, with such intervacuolar distances, Ca2+ diffusion would not be sufficiently rapid to recapitulate experimentally determined wave speeds. We emphasize that this model has not included any kind of obstruction to diffusion that the plasmodesmata may produce, which would make the wave even slower. In summary, the range of distances in the literature together with our analysis suggest that it is unlikely that calcium release through a TPC1-dependent CICR-driven mechanism alone is responsible for propagating the observed signal.TPC1 Channel Clustering Does Not Explain Observed Ca2+ Wave Propagation Speeds The analysis outlined above assumes that TPC1 is distributed uniformly across the vacuolar membrane. Clustering of signaling components may provide a mechanism for selective amplification and channeling of signals that could, in theory, contribute to increased signal propagation rates. Indeed, the observed distribution of channels (Peiter et al., 2005) suggests that TPC1 may show a degree of clustering. The distribution of random independent events on a fixed interval of space or time (such as the area of a membrane patch) follows a Poisson distribution (Riley et al., 1998), so if TPC1 channels were distributed randomly across the tonoplast, we would expect the patch clamp data of Peiter et al. (2005), which monitor individual TPC1 channel gating in isolated tonoplast membrane patches, to obey a Poisson distribution. In Figure 2, we compare the measured distribution (Peiter et al., 2005) of TPC1 channels with the best-fit Poisson distribution for both the wild-type and overexpressor lines. We see that the Poisson distribution does not describe either of the experimental distributions well. A χ2 test with the Poisson distribution as a null hypothesis indicates that both the wild type and the overexpressor show strong evidence of clustering (Table II). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Clustering of TPC1 on the tonoplast reduces the efficiency of CICR-mediated Ca2+ wave transmission. A and B, Numbers of TPC1 channels observed in vacuolar membrane patches by Peiter et al. (2005; bars) compared with best-fit Poisson distributions (lines) for the wild type (A) and the TPC1 overexpressor (B). C, How the velocity of a Ca2+ wave varies with increased clustering within the CICR model. The number of channels is kept constant as the number per cluster increases. Release strength, σ/uc, was chosen so the velocity with equally spaced channels matched the wild-type velocity (395 μm s−1). The dashed line shows the behavior predicted by Equation 5.Table II. Clustering of TPC1 channels. A χ2 test of channel count data (Peiter et al., 2005) was performed under the null hypothesis that TPC1 channels are (uniform) randomly distributed Line Best-Fit Poisson Mean χ2 Wild type 5.14288 7.2 × 108 oxTPC1 23.6695 1.54 × 106 Open in a new tabTo investigate the impact of channel clustering on the wave propagation speeds, we performed the following simulations. An initial wave was generated assuming equally spaced channels. Keeping the total number of channels the same, the number of channels in a cluster was increased (initially one channel per cluster with separation d, changing to two channels per cluster with separation 2d, and so on). We simulated the system with an array of 51 cells (as in Fig. 1C) with all dv values the same and a cell length, L, of 100 μm. This analysis showed that the speed of the wave falls with increased clustering (Fig. 2). The optimal arrangement for most rapid signal propagation, therefore, is when channels are equally spaced. The expression for the wave velocity (Eq. 2) explains this decrease in velocity with increased clustering. Treating each cluster of channels as a single release site, with a release strength proportional to the number of channels in that cluster (Shuai and Jung, 2003), the effect of increasing the degree of clustering by a factor of 2, say, involves changing the channel separation d → d′ = 2d and the release strength σ → σ′ = 2σ (since we now have twice as many channels at a release site). The resulting velocity v′ is (5) This prediction captures the qualitative behavior of the wave, as shown in Figure 2C. This prediction describes the simulation for dv = 1 μm better than for dv = 10 μm, because it neglects the intervacuolar separation, which has a much larger influence when dv = 10 μm. In the Ca2+ diffusion model, an optimal distribution of equally spaced channels is unlikely to explain the speed of the observed Ca2+ waves. An increase in clustering between the wild type and the TPC1 overexpressor would lead to less efficient signal propagation than the equally spaced channels and, therefore, an even worse fit. ROS Production via RBOHD Is Sufficient to Activate Calcium Release and Wave Propagation at Observed Rates To explain the observed Ca2+ wave speeds, we hypothesized that ROS may have a role to play. Rapid propagation of a systemic increase in ROS produced by the NADPH oxidase AtRBOHD has been reported in response to stress signals (Torres et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). RBOHD is expressed ubiquitously throughout Arabidopsis plants and is localized to the plasma membrane of cells (Sagi and Fluhr, 2006). It is responsible for the production of ROS such as hydrogen peroxide in the apoplast and is involved in a range of signaling processes, such as in defense (Torres et al., 2002) and in the opening and closing of stomata (Zhang et al., 2009). Furthermore, it has been shown to be essential to the propagation of the ROS waves by Miller et al. (2009). The RBOH family of proteins contain two EF hand calcium-binding domains as well as multiple potential phosphorylation sites, which enable their activation in response to raised cytosolic Ca2+ (Sagi and Fluhr, 2006). Indeed, the dynamics of changes in ROS and Ca2+ also are known to interact in the processes of ROS-induced Ca2+ release and Ca2+-induced ROS release (Gilroy et al., 2014). A conceptual model for ROS wave propagation was produced by Dubiella et al. (2013), where Ca2+ acting via the calcium-dependent protein kinase family member 5 stimulates ROS production from the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase RBOHD and ROS is able to trigger Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane into cells via ROS-regulated plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (Richards et al., 2014). This provides a self-propagation mechanism in which ROS triggers plasma membrane Ca2+ influx into the cell, potentially triggering CICR via TCP1 at the tonoplast. The cellular Ca2+ rise in turn activates RBOHD, which then produces more apoplastic ROS. ROS could potentially travel through the apoplast and trigger the same process in the neighboring cell. This ROS-dependent model can be described mathematically to quantitatively analyze whether it is consistent with the observed stress-related Ca2+ waves. ROS-induced ROS release can be described by Equation 1, where u is now the concentration of ROS in the apoplast. ROS does not activate a neighboring RBOHD directly but via triggering increased Ca2+ in the cytoplasm, which in turn activates RBOHD. The critical threshold parameter uc incorporates the indirect nature and complexity of this activation process in one variable and so provides a mathematical means through which changes in Ca2+ behavior can feed back on ROS propagation without needing to parameterize the detailed molecular mechanisms behind this process. If higher levels of Ca2+ release are being maintained in a cell (e.g. because of TPC1 overexpression), then we would expect the RBOHDs to be activated more quickly, which can be represented in the model by a decreased uc, irrespective of the precise molecular mechanism responsible for the Ca2+-dependent activation. ROS diffusion in the apoplast may be predicted to be faster than that of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm, as highly active cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering and sequestration mechanisms limit the cytoplasmic movement of this ion (Allbritton et al., 1992); although it is important to note that the levels of ROS in the cell wall also are thought to be tightly regulated by a balance between their generation systems and ROS-scavenging mechanisms (Kärkönen and Kuchitsu, 2015). RBOHDs also exist at a higher density than TPC1 (Peiter et al., 2005; Hao et al., 2014). This puts the propagation of the ROS wave into the continuous regime (Pearson and Ponce-Dawson, 1998); therefore, the velocity of the ROS-assisted wave has a different functional form than from a purely CICR-driven process, in which it propagates as a saltatory wave (Coombes et al., 2004): (6) The wild-type velocity can be used to calculate the ratio of the unknown parameters. To test the model, we evaluated the velocity in the TPC1 overexpressor: (7) where α is the decrease in the firing threshold uc due to the increase in TPC1 channels in the overexpressor. The number of channels increases by a factor of 24.2/8.6 (Peiter et al., 2005). Therefore, the rate of calcium-dependent activation of RBOHD should increase and uc should decrease. Using a first-order approximation for this response as a function of the number of channels results in α = 8.6/24.2, for which the model predicts v+ = 662.6 μm s−1. This estimate is well within the experimental uncertainty of the experimentally measured value of calcium wave speed from the overexpressor (Table I). Hence, this ROS-assisted CICR model is able to produce a good fit to the data. Importantly for this ROS-assisted CICR model, we used the average value of channel density derived from Peiter et al. (2005). This parameter is independent of the underlying distribution of TPC1, being derived from the total number of channels observed divided by the number of samples. For the ROS-assisted model, only the number of TPC1 channels is used in the analysis, but as we demonstrated with the pure CICR model, clustering of TPC1 will tend to slow down wave propagation but is unlikely to affect the inferences drawn from the predictions.Blocking ROS Production with DPI, Ascorbate, and in the AtrbohD Knockout Validates Predictions of the ROS-Assisted CICR Model To empirically test the prediction of a ROS-assisted mechanism for Ca2+ wave propagation, we attempted to dissect the involvement of ROS in the Ca2+ wave by treating the root with the ROS scavenger ascorbate and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI. To separate the effects of these compounds on the ability of the plant to propagate the wave versus the ability to initially trigger a stress response, we initiated a Ca2+ wave by locally treating the tip of the root with 100 mm NaCl in the absence of any inhibitor. The root system of Arabidopsis was growing through a Phytagel matrix, so the local treatment was applied by cutting an approximately 500-μm × 500-μm hole in the gel ahead of the root tip and letting the root apex grow into this window, which was subsequently filled with growth medium containing 100 mm NaCl. We had determined previously that this treatment localizes the salt stress to the very apex of the root and reproducibly triggers a Ca2+ wave propagating shootward from the root apex (Choi et al., 2014). Either 25 to 100 μm potassium ascorbate, 25 to 200 μm DPI, or growth medium (negative control) was applied locally 10 min prior to the root tip NaCl stimulation to a similar window cut into the gel surrounding the mature region of the root more than 1,000 μm shootward of the root tip. In all cases, the Ca2+ wave propagated at approximately 400 μm s−1 from the root tip to the region treated with inhibitor, but transit through the treatment region was altered depending on the pharmacological agent present. Calcium wave movement through the region treated with growth medium alone was maintained at 400 μm s−1. Treatment with 25 μm ascorbate slowed wave propagation to 64 µm s−1, and detectable Ca2+ changes were abolished with 100 μm ascorbate pretreatment. Treatment with up to 200 μm DPI significantly attenuated the magnitude of the Ca2+ increase and slowed propagation rates to 146 μm s−1 (Table I; Fig. 3A). These observations are consistent with a requirement for ROS and NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production in Ca2+ wave transmission. Furthermore, knockout of AtRBOHD slowed propagation of the Ca2+ wave to 73 μm s−1 (Table I; Fig. 4; Supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). One further prediction of the ROS-assisted CICR model is that loss of RBOH-driven ROS production in the oxTPC1 background will slow wave propagation: (8) with α as before. This suggests a velocity of 123 μm s−1. To test this prediction, we applied DPI to the oxTPC1 plants and monitored wave speeds. In the oxTPC1 background, a Ca2+ wave was still evident after pretreatment with DPI, but the rate of transmission was slowed to 134.4 µm s−1 (Supplemental Fig. S4).Imaging of the Extracellular ROS Wave Using OxyBurst Green-Bovine Serum Albumin Implicit in the ROS-assisted CICR model of Ca2+ wave propagation is that the Ca2+ wave should be accompanied by a similarly propagating wave of apoplastic ROS production. Although the presence of a ROS wave has been inferred from the wave-like activation of the ROS-dependent transcriptional response (Miller et al., 2009), direct measurement of the wave-like propagation of an apoplastic ROS signal has proven technically challenging. We used the ROS-sensing fluorescent dye OxyBurst Green H2HFF conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to exclude this ROS sensor from the cytoplasm of the root. OxyBurst becomes more fluorescent upon oxidation and so provides a measure of the kinetics of ROS increases (Monshausen et al., 2007, 2009). Therefore, we monitored OxyBurst fluorescence intensity before and after local NaCl stimulation of the root tip at points distant from the site of NaCl stimulation to try to capture the spread of a putative wave of ROS production. As OxyBurst shows an irreversible increase in fluorescence upon oxidation, the constitutive background ROS production by the root led to a slow increase in signal with time prior to treatment (Fig. 5, A and B; Supplemental Movie S1). Addition of growth medium to the root tip (control) led to a slight increase in OxyBurst signal measured 3,000 µm away from the root tip site of local medium addition (Fig. 5, A and B; Supplemental Movie S1), which may represent a small response to the mechanical signal generated by medium addition (Monshausen et al., 2007). However, when NaCl was added to the tip, this distal region showed a rapid and significantly larger increase in OxyBurst fluorescence (Fig. 5, A and B; Supplemental Movie S2). Calculation of the speed of movement of the signal triggering this response was made by monitoring the time for a significant increase (greater than 2 sd above prestimulated levels) in the mean OxyBurst signal monitored at 3,000 and 5,000 µm from the root apex in 14 replicate experiments. This analysis indicated a propagation speed of 374 µm s−1. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Extracellular ROS increases accompany the Ca2+ wave to NaCl stimulation.

B, Quantification of OxyBurst signal at 3,000 µm from the tip in the wild type and mutants in AtRBOHD and TPC1. C, Responses measured at 3,000 µm shootward in oxTPC1 treated with medium (control) or 100 mm NaCl added to the root tip. Signals were normalized to the mean signal for 60 s prior to additions at 0 s. OxyBurst becomes irreversibly more fluorescent as it is oxidized. Results are means ± se; n ≥ 5. For clarity, the data from atrbohD, tpc1-2, and oxTPC1 are shown across B and C. To allow for comparison, the same wild type + NaCl and control data are shown in both B and C.Consistent with the model of ROS-assisted CICR, these ROS increases distal to the site of NaCl stimulation were dependent on AtRBOHD and TPC1, being attenuated in AtrbohD and tpc1-2 mutants (Fig. 5B). The ROS increase did not differ significantly (P > 0.05, ANOVA) from the wild-type response in the TPC1 overexpression line (Fig. 5C).DISCUSSION We have applied the fire-diffuse-fire model to explore the mechanisms behind the plant-wide transmission of stress-induced Ca2+ waves, focusing on the salt-induced wave of the root. Our analyses suggest that a simple CICR-based mechanism relying upon a self-reinforcing Ca2+ release from the vacuole via TPC1-dependent Ca2+ efflux and diffusion of Ca2+ between cells is unlikely to account for the observed velocity of wave movement. Extending this CICR mechanism for Ca2+ wave transit through the cell with Ca2+-dependent apoplastic ROS production to couple between cells, however, is able to support the observed velocities. ROS have been implicated repeatedly in systemic signaling (Alvarez et al., 1998; Karpinski et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2009; Suzuki et al., 2013), and while it is tempting to identify this and the Ca2+ wave we have studied here as two sides of the same coin, there are important differences that have yet to be explained. First, the ROS wave in response to wounding travels at 1,400 μm s−1 (Miller et al., 2009), much faster than the Ca2+ wave we studied here. This difference might be because the wound-induced ROS wave propagates through the vascular tissue, whereas the Ca2+ wave appears to be restricted to the cortex and endodermis (Choi et al., 2014). The vasculature is well suited for long-distance transmission of signals (van Bel et al., 2014), particularly electrical signals. Alternatively, the triggering stimulus also may impact on propagation speed/mechanism. Indeed, the velocity of the wound-related ROS wave is very similar to that of electrical responses to wounding (Mousavi et al., 2013), suggesting that ROS and electrical signals may act together in the wounding response (van Bel et al., 2014). It is striking, however, that the signal velocity in the rbohD mutant is compromised in response to either salt stress (this study) or wounding (Miller et al., 2009), hinting at some possibly shared core components of the transmission machinery. Indeed, both the NaCl-triggered Ca2+ wave propagation (Choi et al., 2014) and the wound-induced systemic Ca2+ increases (Kiep et al., 2015) appear to be dependent on the TPC1, reinforcing the idea of conserved elements of the propagation system. The activity of SV channels is known to be inhibited by ROS and activated by reducing agents (Carpaneto et al., 1999; Scholz-Starke et al., 2004; Pottosin et al., 2009), and this may at first sight appear contradictory to the ROS/TPC1-related propagation mechanism modeled above. However, since ROS is generated within the apoplast by RBOHDs, it would initially be able to rapidly gate ROS-activated channels in the plasma membrane. The ROS would then need to cross the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm before interacting with TPC1. It can take 0.9 s to develop a stable gradient of ROS across plasma membranes (Bienert et al., 2006), although the maximum theoretical rate could be much faster (Vestergaard et al., 2012). Given the speed of the Ca2+ wave in the wild type, it should take only approximately 2.5 ms (TPC1 channel separation over the wave speed) to activate each TPC1 in sequence; thus, it is unlikely that the ROS would have time to trigger a direct effect on TPC1’s ability to mediate the initial propagation phase of the Ca2+ wave. The slower ROS-triggered inactivation of TPC1, therefore, may have an important role to play in terminating the wave once it has moved through the cell. ROS-based TPC1 inactivation also could lead to a refractory period where the channel is unable to support further Ca2+ increases, leading to the wave-like progression of the Ca2+ increase. Inherent to the model presented above is rapid triggering of TPC1 by ROS-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases. Although the SV channel has long been identified as being activated by cytosolic Ca2+ (Hedrich and Neher, 1987), large concentrations of Ca2+ are required (Guo et al., 2016). The ability of the SV channel to directly release Ca2+ also is a topic of some controversy (Hedrich and Marten, 2011), as large vacuolar Ca2+ concentrations inhibit the activation of TPC1 (Beyhl et al., 2009; Hedrich and Marten, 2011; Guo et al., 2016). The SV channel is known to be regulated by many other factors (for review, see Hedrich and Marten, 2011). For example, recent structural data have indicated a number of potential phosphorylation sites on TPC1 (Kintzer and Stroud, 2016), and the beet (Beta vulgaris) SV channel is activated by calmodulin (Pottosin et al., 2009). Such alternative regulatory mechanisms provide a wide range of other means for the activation of this channel as part of the Ca2+ wave transmission process. TPC1 also could be only indirectly responsible for the release of Ca2+ from the vacuole, possibly by controlling changes in membrane voltage that activate other channels (Peiter, 2011). Our modeling approach does not make any assumptions about TPC1’s role in mediating Ca2+ release, merely requiring that the activation of TPC1 leads to Ca2+ release, whether directly or indirectly. The knockout of TPC1 that slows Ca2+ wave transmission approximately 40-fold only delays the Ca2+ response at the site of direct NaCl treatment by 30 s (Choi et al., 2014), suggesting that TPC1 may have a more pronounced role in transmission than in the initial direct stress response, consistent with the lack of an obvious Ca2+ dynamics phenotype in response to stress in tpc1-2 when measured at the whole-plant level (Ranf et al., 2008). The model presented in Figure 6 also identifies two pools of Ca2+ that are likely to be important for generating the cytosolic Ca2+ wave, apoplastic, with influx through plasma membrane channels, and vacuolar, with influx to the cytosol, through TPC1 or a TPC1-related channel on the tonoplast. Thus, extracellular Ca2+ levels in the wall and lumenal Ca2+ levels in the vacuole may be other key regulators of Ca2+ wave propagation, especially as TPC1 is known to be responsive to both cytosolic and lumenal vacuolar Ca2+ levels as described above. While a role for extracellular Ca2+ signals is well established (e.g. in the stomatal response; Han et al., 2003; Nomura et al., 2008; Weinl et al., 2008), the potential for signaling-related dynamic changes of vacuolar lumenal Ca2+ levels remains poorly understood. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Conceptual model of the propagation of the salt stress-induced Ca2+/ROS waves. ROS (green arrows) are produced in RBOHD (green circles) and diffuse through the apoplast, activating ROS-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (light blue ellipse). These channels release Ca2+ into the cytosol (blue arrows) that activate TPC1 proteins (yellow circles), which, directly or indirectly, mediate Ca2+ release from the vacuole. Combined, this Ca2+ activates further RBOHD proteins, giving rise to a self-propagating ROS/Ca2+ wave. Passage between cells may be mediated by either diffusion of ROS through the apoplast or Ca2+ through the plasmodesmata.Our direct imaging of a spreading extracellular ROS increase shown in Figure 5 provides a strong supporting element for the ROS-assisted CICR model of wave propagation. The dynamics of a ROS wave have been largely inferred from, for example, the timing and spatial patterning of the activation of ROS-responsive promoters (Miller et al., 2009). However, we have now been able to show that an extracellular ROS increase accompanied the Ca2+ wave moving at approximately 400 µm s−1, suggesting a propagating ROS wave. This ROS wave is dependent on AtRBOHD and TPC1, consistent with the ROS-assisted Ca2+ wave model where ROS trigger Ca2+ increases that then propagate and trigger further distal ROS responses. It is important to note here that although this wave of ROS increase appears to be moving at approximately the same velocity as the Ca2+ increase, this measurement of rate must be interpreted with caution. The OxyBurst Green-BSA sensor is designed to be excluded from the cell wall. Thus, this imaging technique relies on the diffusion of ROS from the surface of the root to the medium and so likely incorporates a delay in appearance as the ROS move through the apoplast and accumulate in the medium. This caveat is especially relevant as the NaCl-triggered Ca2+ wave, and by implication the ROS-related events associated with it, are initiated at the cortex and endodermis, so ROS would need to transit the epidermal apoplast to begin to leave the root. Therefore, although we can say that an extracellular ROS increase accompanies the Ca2+ wave, defining whether the ROS appear before or concurrent with the Ca2+ increases must await the development of improved extracellular ROS imaging technology. However, the inhibition of the propagation of the Ca2+ wave by treatment with DPI or ascorbate (Fig. 3) and in the atrbohD mutant (Fig. 4) suggests that the Ca2+ wave is at least dependent on ROS production. The residual wave transmission seen with DPI could reflect an incomplete inhibition of RBOH activity by this pharmacological agent or the action of a parallel, DPI-resistant ROS-generating mechanism as part of the wave propagation mechanism. Our combination of mathematical modeling and experimental analysis supports the following model for the propagation of the systemic signal in response to salt. Locally, the application of salt triggers the movement of ions between various compartments in the cell, and in particular, the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm increases. This signal leads to the activation of RBOHD via its EF hand domains and via phosphorylation by Ca2+-binding kinases (Dubiella et al., 2013). As illustrated in Figure 6, local production of ROS by RBOHD is predicted to activate plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. ROS-sensitive Ca2+ channel activities have been monitored at the electrophysiological level in Arabidopsis root cells (Foreman et al., 2003; Demidchik and Maathuis, 2007; Ordoñez et al., 2014), and ROS-responsive candidates such as the annexins (Richards et al., 2014) have been identified at the molecular level, although their possible roles in Ca2+ wave transmission remain to be explored. This Ca2+ contributes to the activation of TPC1, resulting, directly or indirectly, in the release of more Ca2+ from the vacuole. ROS and Ca2+ diffuse within the apoplast and cytoplasm, respectively, activating neighboring channels until all the involved signaling proteins within a cell have been activated. The signaling molecules are able to diffuse between cells, ROS through the apoplast and Ca2+ through the plasmodesmata, where signaling in the next cell is activated. In the TPC1 overexpressor, the quantity of TPC1 channels is increased (Peiter et al., 2005), resulting in more Ca2+ being released and faster activation of RBOHDs and, therefore, a faster wave. Within the tpc1-2 mutant background, RBOHD and the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel form a linked propagation system. The observation that high concentrations of ascorbate can abolish the Ca2+ wave suggests that Ca2+ alone is insufficient to propagate the Ca2+ wave; therefore, in the rbohD mutant, it is possible that other sources of ROS act to give rise to the lower velocity wave. While the modeling work presented here assumes ROS propagation through the apoplast, we cannot exclude the possibility that Ca2+ diffusing through the plasmodesmata is responsible for transmitting the signal between adjacent cells, or indeed that the two species act in tandem (Fig. 6). A TPC1-mediated CICR wave acting alone seems unlikely, and that motivated us to look at ROS propagation, but the requirement for a ROS-activated plasma membrane Ca2+ channel means there also could be sources of Ca2+ influx within the plasmodesmatal plasma membrane itself that could contribute to a rapid transmission event. Unfortunately, the resolution of current imaging techniques is unable to distinguish these possibilities. TPC1 and AtRBOHD are expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant, so their distribution does not provide an obvious explanation for why the salt-induced Ca2+ wave preferentially transits through the cortical and endodermal cell layers. Similarly, candidates for the putative ROS-activated Ca2+-release channels, such as annexins and SKOR (Garcia-Mata et al., 2010; Richards et al., 2014), also are expressed throughout the root (Birnbaum et al., 2003). Thus, identifying the ROS-regulated channels involved with this signaling process, as well as other components that provide regulatory roles, represents a key challenge for the future that may provide important insights into the tissue-specific pattern of the Ca2+ wave.MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Growth Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0), mutants in AtRBOHD and TPC1 in the Col-0 background, and the TPC1 overexpression line (in the Col-0 background) were germinated and grown under sterile conditions on a thin layer of gel (approximately 2 mm thick) containing one-half-strength Epstein’s medium with 10 mm Suc and 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich) under 16 h of light/8 h of dark at 22°C for 6 d as described previously (Choi et al., 2014). AtrbohD was kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Bent (University of Wisconsin-Madison), and oxTPC1 and tpc1-2 were provided by Edgar Peiter (Martin-Luther-Universität) and Dale Sanders (John Innes Centre) and transformed with Yellow Cameleon Nano-65 GFP Ca2+ bioreporter as reported previously (Choi et al., 2014).Ratio Imaging Confocal ratio imaging was performed as described by Choi et al. (2014). Briefly, 7-d-old seedlings were grown as described above and imaged using a 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, with 458-nm excitation, 458-nm primary dichroic, and 462- to 505-nm (CFP) and 526- to 537-nm (cpVenus/FRET) emission selected using the microscope’s Meta detector. Images were analyzed using the Image Calculator in the FIJI analysis package (Schindelin et al., 2012), and ratio data from the sequential confocal images were converted to a pseudocolored kymogram using MultiExperiment Viewer software version 10.2 (Saeed et al., 2003). Due to uncertainties in the applicability of in vitro calibration of this reporter to in vivo responsiveness, data are presented as raw ratios of YFP (cpVenus) to CFP signal intensities. Increasing YFP-CFP ratio signal represents an increase in Ca2+ levels.Measuring Extracellular ROS with OxyBurst Green-BSA Extracellular ROS production was measured essentially as described by Monshausen et al. (2009). A total of 200 µg mL−1 OxyBurst Green (dihydro-2′,4,5,6,7,7′-hexafluorofluorescein)-BSA (Life Technologies) dissolved in growth medium was added to the root approximately 10 min prior to treatment at the root tip. A ROI of 50 × 50 µm was then imaged either 3,000 or 5,000 µm from the root tip using a 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope, using 458-nm primary dichroic, 458-nm excitation, and 526- to 537-nm emission using the microscope’s Meta detector.Inhibitor Treatments For inhibitor treatments, a small window (approximately 500 μm × 500 μm) was made in the gel in the middle region of the root, shootward of the root tip, using the tip of a syringe needle as a knife to carefully remove the gel using a dissecting microscope. Ten microliters of 25 to 200 μm DPI (NADPH oxidase inhibitor) or potassium ascorbate (ROS scavenger) made up in one-half-strength Epstein’s medium with 10 mm Suc was added to the gel window 30 min prior to salt treatment of the root tip. Control plants were treated similarly, but with 25 μL of one-half-strength Epstein’s medium with 10 mm Suc in the window. To prevent the gel from drying out, these samples were kept in a humid petri dish prior to confocal imaging.Total RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis For QPCR analysis, root and shoot samples of 6-d-old seedlings of wild-type Col-0 and oxTPC1 were harvested in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was then isolated from 50- to 200-mg tissue samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by removing residual genomic DNA using the TURBO DNase Kit (RNase-free DNase I; Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1–2 μg) was reverse transcribed into first-strand complementary DNA in a 40-µL reaction (25–50 ng total RNA µL−1) with ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs). QPCR analysis was done using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR system, and analysis was performed with the 7500 Software version 2.3 (Applied Biosystems). The Arabidopsis UBQ10 gene was used as an internal reference for standardization as described previously (Choi et al., 2014). First-strand complementary DNA proportional to 10 ng of genomic DNA-free starting total RNA was combined with 200 nm of each primer and 7.5 µL of 2× EvaGreen QPCR Master Mix with ROX passive reference dye (Biotium) in a final volume of 15 µL. QPCR was performed on a 96-well optical PCR plate (ABgene) using the following parameters: one cycle of 15 min at 95°C; 40 cycles of 20 s at 95°C, 30 s at 58°C, and 15 s at 65°C; and one cycle of dissociation from 58°C to 95°C with 0.5°C increments. Quantitation of the expression of AtTPC1 was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method as described previously (Choi et al., 2014). The QPCR primers used are AtUBQ10-qPCR-F (UBQ10 forward primer, 5′-CACACTCCACTTGGTCTTGCGT-3′), AtUBQ10-qPCR-R (UBQ10 reverse primer, 5′-TGGTCTTTCCGGTGAGAGTCTTCA-3′), AtTPC1-qPCR-F(i) (TPC1 forward primer, 5′-GCTCTATTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTG-3′), and AtTPC1-qPCR-R(j) (TPC1 reverse primer, 5′-GAAGAGTGTGACCATTCCATTGG-3′).Mathematical Modeling A full simulation of the CICR model, illustrated in Figure 1A, uses Equation 1 assuming a fast Ca2+ release. Under this assumption, each release site xi firing at ti contributes to a reference point at position x and at time t. The total concentration is the sum of these terms over all Ca2+ releases, i, . This method requires calculation of the firing times of all releases and, therefore, places an upper limit on the temporal step size of the algorithm. We typically used a step size Δt = 10−6 s. Concentrations, c, were scaled by the firing threshold, uc, . Simulations were performed with code developed in C++ using the GNU science library root-finding function to fit the model to observed wave velocities.Supplemental Data The following supplemental materials are available.

Copyright notice ID: 7610290 PMID: 32938754 The reactive oxygen species wave propagates through vascular bundles during the systemic response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants to excess light stress.Abstract Systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) are essential for plant survival during episodes of environmental stress. Recent studies highlighted a key role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in mediating systemic responses and SAA during light stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). These studies further identified the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) protein as a key player in mediating rapid systemic ROS responses. Here, we report that tissue-specific expression of RBOHD in phloem or xylem parenchyma cells of the rbohD mutant restores systemic ROS signaling, systemic stress-response transcript expression, and SAA to a local treatment of light stress. We further demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF are both required for local and systemic ROS signaling at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis. Taken together, our findings highlight a key role for RBOHD-driven ROS production at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis in mediating light stress–induced systemic signaling and SAA. In addition, they suggest that the integration of ROS, calcium, electric, and hydraulic signals, during systemic signaling, occurs at the vascular bundles.INTRODUCTION Plants and other multicellular organisms are able to transmit different chemical and physical signals over long distances, sometimes traversing their entire length. These signals coordinate the response of the entire organism to different stresses, pathogens, and/or other stimuli and are thought to play a key role in the acclimation, defense, and adaptation of different organisms to their environment (Choi et al., 2017; Takahashi et al., 2018; Kollist et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). In plants, a plethora of chemical and physical signals are transmitted from a single leaf or root tip subjected to stress (i.e., a local tissue) to the entire plant (i.e., systemic tissues). These signals, collectively termed systemic signals, include different chemicals and volatiles, such as salicylic acid, abscisic acid (ABA), and methyl jasmonate, as well as small peptides, and physical signals such as electric signals and hydraulic waves (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009; Szechyńska-Hebda et al., 2010; Devireddy et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018; Takahashi et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). In recent years, a role for two interlinked signal transduction molecules, that is, Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS), was identified in the systemic response of plants to different abiotic stimuli such as excess light stress or wounding. These two signals were further shown to propagate from cell to cell over long distances in plants and were termed the Ca2+ and ROS waves (Miller et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2014; Toyota et al., 2018; Zandalinas and Mittler, 2018; Fichman et al., 2019; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Open in a new tabThe ROS wave is essential for coordinating systemic metabolic responses that generate different metabolic signatures in different parts of the plant (Choudhury et al., 2018); for coordinating systemic transcriptomic responses that activate transcriptional networks essential for plant acclimation (Zandalinas et al., 2019); and for coordinating systemic physiological responses, such as changes in stomatal aperture (Devireddy et al., 2018, 2020). In addition, the ROS wave is required for successful plant acclimation to light and heat stresses (Suzuki et al., 2013; Devireddy et al., 2018; Zandalinas et al., 2019, 2020). The initiation, propagation, and maintenance of the ROS wave in response to abiotic stress is dependent on the plasma membrane–localized RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD; AT5G47910) protein (Miller et al., 2009; Zandalinas and Mittler, 2018; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). However, genetic evidence in the form of complementation studies, as well as cell biology studies elucidating the role of RBOHD in different plant tissues during systemic signaling, has thus far been lacking. RBOHD belongs to a family of 10 different proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), able to produce superoxide radicals at the apoplast in response to a cytosolic calcium and/or phosphorylation signal (Suzuki et al., 2011; Kadota et al., 2015; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). The superoxide radicals generated at the apoplast by RBOH proteins are dismutated spontaneously, or via superoxide dismutases present in the apoplast, to generate H2O2 that can enter cells via aquaporins (Mittler et al., 2011; Gilroy et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Mittler, 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2017; Clemente‐Moreno et al., 2019; Fichman and Mittler, 2020; García et al., 2020). Of the 10 RBOHs in Arabidopsis, RBOHD and RBOHF (AT1G64060) are the two primarily expressed in aboveground vegetative tissues (Torres et al., 2002; Kwak et al., 2003; Morales et al., 2016). Based on their relative speed, as well as their physical and chemical properties, four different systemic signals are thought to copropagate, or at least interact with each other, during rapid systemic signaling in plants. These include the ROS, Ca2+, hydraulic, and electric waves (Mittler et al., 2011; Gilroy et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Calcium waves and electrical signals are dependent on the function of the calcium-permeable glutamate receptor-like (GLR) GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 channels (Mousavi et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018; Wudick et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020), and calcium and ROS waves were proposed to be linked through the function of RBOHD (Mittler et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2016). RBOHD was further shown to be required for the propagation of certain electric signals in response to light stress (Suzuki et al., 2013). Although it is unknown how hydraulic waves are linked to electric, ROS, and calcium waves, it was proposed that different mechanosensitive channels (Basu and Haswell, 2017) could sense hydraulic waves at systemic tissues and convert them into calcium signals (Choi et al., 2017; Kollist et al., 2019; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Calcium signals can further influence ROS signals via the function of different calcium binding proteins and kinases/phosphatase molecular switches or by directly binding to the E and F helices (EF)-hand domains of RBOHD (Suzuki et al., 2011; Kadota et al., 2015; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Although the Ca2+, hydraulic, and electric waves were recently shown to propagate through the vascular bundles of plants, utilizing plant tissues such as phloem, xylem parenchyma, and bundle sheath cells (Mousavi et al., 2013; Sade et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020), the cell types and tissues through which the ROS wave propagates in plants are currently unknown (Fichman and Mittler, 2020; Fichman et al., 2020).RESULTS Complementation of Systemic ROS Signaling in the rbohD Mutant with RBOHD Driven by Different Tissue-Specific Promoters The RBOHD protein is expressed in almost all tissues of Arabidopsis, including epidermis, mesophyll, stomata, and vascular bundles (Hao et al., 2014; Morales et al., 2016). To determine in what tissues its expression is vital for systemic ROS signaling in response to a local treatment of excess high-light (HL) stress, we attempted to complement the rbohD mutant with different binary vectors driving the stable expression of RBOHD using its native promoter or different tissue-specific promoters (Figure 1; Supplemental Figures 1 and 2; Supplemental Table 1). The tissue-specific promoters chosen for our analysis were successfully used in previous studies to drive the expression of different proteins in their corresponding tissues (Funk et al., 2002; Hooker et al., 2002; Yoshimoto et al., 2003; Endo et al., 2007; Avci et al., 2008; Mustroph et al., 2009; Dhondt et al., 2010; Sawa and Kay, 2011; Cui et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Matías-Hernández et al., 2016). In addition, to confirm that the RBOHD protein, expressed under the control of the different tissue-specific promoters (Supplemental Table 1), accumulates in these tissues, we generated a second set of transgenic plants in which the RBOHD protein was tagged with the green fluorescence protein (GFP) at its N terminus, and we determined that the GFP signal was present in the correct tissues associated with the different tissue-specific promoters (Supplemental Figure 1; not used in Figures 1 to 3). To image excess light stress–driven local and systemic changes in ROS levels, we used the whole-plant live ROS imaging technique we recently developed that is based on the oxidation of dichlorofluorescein (DCF), fumigated as an 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (H2DCFDA) dye, into plants prior to the stress treatment (Fichman et al., 2019; Zandalinas et al., 2020).

Open in a new tab Complementation of Light Stress–Induced SAA in the rbohD Mutant with RBOHD Driven by Different Tissue-Specific Promoters. Light stress–induced systemic leaf cell injury (measured as electrolyte leakage) of the wild type (Columbia-0 [Col]), rbohD, and the different rbohD complemented Arabidopsis plants was determined. Systemic leaves were either untreated, nonpretreated, and unstressed (untreated, unstressed) or subjected to light stress following a pretreatment of one local leaf with light stress (pretreated, stressed). SAA is evident by a low level of electrolyte leakage in light-stressed systemic leaves (pretreated, stressed), which is similar to that of untreated and unstressed leaves (untreated, unstressed). Ten different plants each from two independent complemented lines for each construct (nos. 1 and 2) were subjected to light stress, and cell injury was measured in systemic leaves by electrolyte leakage.

Complementation of RBOHD expression in the rbohD mutant, using the native RBOHD promoter, completely restored light stress–induced local and systemic ROS responses (evident by accumulation of oxidized DCF; Figure 1; Fichman et al., 2019). By contrast, complementation of RBOHD expression using an epidermis-specific promoter (CER6; Hooker et al., 2002; Mustroph et al., 2009) or mesophyll-specific promoter (CAB3; Endo et al., 2007; Matías-Hernández et al., 2016) only partially restored light stress–induced local and systemic ROS responses, whereas complementation of RBOHD expression using a bundle sheath–specific promoter (SCR; Dhondt et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2014) failed to restore light stress–driven ROS responses (Figure 1). Complementation of local and systemic ROS responses to the wild-type levels (evident by accumulation of oxidized DCF) was however achieved using a xylem parenchyma–specific promoter (XCP1; Funk et al., 2002; Avci et al., 2008) or phloem-specific promoter (Sultr1;3; Yoshimoto et al., 2003; Sawa and Kay, 2011; Figure 1; Supplemental Figure 2). The results presented in Figure 1 and Supplemental Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate that RBOHD expression in the xylem parenchyma or phloem is essential for systemic ROS signaling in response to a local treatment of excess light stress. Restoring whole-leaf systemic ROS responses via expression of RBOHD in such a limited number of cells of the rbohD mutant (evident by accumulation of oxidized DCF; Figure 1; Supplemental Figures 1 and 2) further suggests that, under the conditions studied in Figure 1, other ROS-producing mechanisms might be involved in generating ROS in systemic tissues. These could include RBOHF or other apoplastic oxidases and/or cytosolic, mitochondrial, peroxisomal, or chloroplastic ROS-producing mechanisms (Mittler, 2017; Kollist et al., 2019).Complementation of Local and Systemic Zat12 Expression in the rbohD Mutant with RBOHD Driven by Different Tissue-Specific Promoters To determine whether the complementation of systemic ROS signaling in the rbohD mutant also restored systemic transcript expression in response to excess light stress, we determined the expression of the ZAT12 gene (AT5G59820) in local and systemic tissues of the different control and complemented lines using the ZAT12 promoter:luciferase reporter. The zinc finger protein ZAT12 was initially identified as a central regulator essential for light stress responses and acclimation in Arabidopsis (Iida et al., 2000). Further studies determined that ZAT12 plays an important role in the response of plants to many other abiotic stresses (Davletova et al., 2005). As shown in Figure 2, compared to the wild type, the systemic expression of ZAT12 in response to local application of HL stress, detected under the same experimental conditions used to visualize the ROS wave in Figure 1, was suppressed in the rbohD mutant. By contrast, local expression of ZAT12 was not. This finding demonstrated that ZAT12 expression is triggered in local tissues independent of RBOHD. By contrast, the systemic expression of ZAT12 was dependent on RBOHD during systemic responses to light stress. Similar to our findings with systemic ROS signaling in the different RBOHD tissue-specific complementation lines (Figure 1; Supplemental Figure 2), light stress–induced systemic expression of Zat12 could be restored to the wild-type levels only upon expression of RBOHD in the rbohD mutant using its own native promoter or the xylem parenchyma– or phloem-specific promoters (Figure 2). The results presented in Figure 2 demonstrate that RBOHD expression in the xylem parenchyma or phloem is essential for systemic transcript expression of the key light stress–response gene ZAT12 during the systemic response of Arabidopsis to a local treatment of HL stress. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Complementation of Light Stress–Induced Local and Systemic ZAT12 Expression in the rbohD Mutant with RBOHD Driven by Different Tissue-Specific Promoters. Representative time-lapse images of local and systemic ZAT12:luciferase activity in the wild type (Columbia-0 [Col]), rbohD, and the different ZAT12:luciferase-expressing double homozygous rbohD complemented Arabidopsis plants subjected to a 2-min local HL stress treatment (applied to the local leaf only) are shown on left; representative line graphs showing continuous measurements of ZAT12:luciferase activity in local and systemic leaves of the wild type, rbohD, and two independent homozygous complemented lines (nos. 1 and 2), over the entire course of the experiment (0 to 30 min), are shown in the middle (ROIs for some of them are indicated with white boxes); and statistical analysis of ZAT12:luciferase activity in local and systemic leaves at 0 and 30 min is shown on right (conducted for 10 different plants each from two independent lines; Student’s t test, sd, n = 20, *P < 0.05). All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Treated local leaves are indicated with a red circle. Bar = 1 cm.

Because RBOHD expression in the xylem parenchyma or phloem cells restored systemic ROS signaling and systemic expression of ZAT12 in the rbohD mutant (Figures 1 and 2; Supplemental Figure 2), it could potentially restore SAA following local application of HL stress. We therefore tested all complemented lines described in Figure 1 for SAA following a local HL stress treatment. For this purpose, we used an SAA assay based on measuring excess light stress–induced systemic leaf injury in the presence or absence of a short light stress pretreatment applied to a single local leaf (Suzuki et al., 2013; Devireddy et al., 2018; Zandalinas et al., 2019, 2020). As shown in Figure 3, complementing the rbohD mutant with RBOHD expressed via its native promoter, or the xylem parenchyma- or phloem-specific promoters, restored HL stress–driven SAA to the rbohD mutant. By contrast, complementing RBOHD expression in the rbohD mutant using the epidermis-, mesophyll-, or bundle sheath–specific promoters failed to restore SAA to light stress (Figure 3). The results presented in Figures 1 to 3 reveal that expression of RBOHD at the xylem parenchyma or phloem cells of the rbohD mutant is sufficient to restore systemic ROS signaling, expression of the ZAT12 light stress–response regulator, and SAA, to the rbohD mutant. Taken together, these findings underscore a key role for RBOHD, present at the vascular tissues (phloem or xylem parenchyma) of Arabidopsis, in mediating the systemic response of plants to light stress. Because the expression of RBOHD in such a limited subset of cells had such a dramatic effect on systemic ROS signaling, transcript expression and SAA (Figures 1 to 3; Supplemental Figure 2), other ROS-producing mechanisms might be required for mediating ROS accumulation in many of the other plant cells that do not express RBOHD in the rbohD mutant. Potential clues to the existence of such additional players in the systemic ROS signaling response of Arabidopsis to light stress include our current and previous findings that low levels of systemic ROS (evident by accumulation of oxidized DCF) can still be detected in the rbohD mutant (Figure 1; Fichman et al., 2019). As suggested above, one potential candidate for this function, based on its expression pattern and function (Torres et al., 2002; Kwak et al., 2003; Morales et al., 2016), is RBOHF.RBOHD and RBOHF Are Both Required for Mediating Systemic ROS Signaling in Response to a Local HL Stress Treatment To test whether RBOHF is also required for systemic ROS signaling during the response of Arabidopsis plants to light stress, we subjected the wild type, rbohD, rbohF, and rbohD rbohF double mutants (Torres et al., 2002; Kwak et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2009) to a local HL stress treatment and imaged local and systemic ROS levels (evident by accumulation of oxidized DCF) in these plants. As shown in Figure 4, rbohD, rbohF, and rbohD rbohF were all deficient in systemic ROS signaling in response to a local application of excess light stress. Interestingly, the low residual ROS levels, detected in the rbohD mutant (evident by accumulation of oxidized DCF; Figure 1; Fichman et al., 2019), can also be detected in the rbohF mutant (albeit weaker). By contrast, no residual ROS levels were detected in the rbohD rbohF double mutant (Figure 4). Fluorescence microscopy imaging of ROS levels (evident by DCF oxidation), conducted on petioles of local and systemic leaves of the different mutants following local application of light stress (Figure 5), revealed that low levels of ROS could be found at the vascular bundles of the rbohD or rbohF mutants at the local or systemic tissues in response to light stress. By contrast, ROS levels were undetected by fluorescence microscopy at the vascular bundles of local or systemic leaves of the rbohD rbohF double mutant (Figure 5). Although excess light-driven ROS was primarily detected at the vascular tissues of local and systemic leaves of the wild-type plants, in local leaves high ROS levels were also detected at other cell layers, such as the epidermis (Figure 5). While the detection of ROS at the epidermis was evident in the wild type and the rbohF mutant, similar levels were not detected in the rbohD or the rbohD rbohF double mutant. The findings presented in Figures 4 and 5 support a model in which RBOHD and RBOHF cooperate to drive local and systemic ROS signaling (evident by DCF oxidation) at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis during light stress and indicate that RBOHD might also control ROS levels at the epidermis of local leaves. Because the lack of RBOHD was sufficient to block the spread of a systemic ROS wave response from the local to the systemic leaves, even when H2O2 was directly applied to the local leaf (Supplemental Figure 3A), the suppressed systemic response of the rbohD or the rbohD rbohF double mutants may not simply result from the lack of ROS responses at the local tissue. Systemic ROS signaling may therefore require RBOHD expression at the local, as well as systemic tissues (Suzuki et al., 2013). Future studies using the different tissue-specific promoters (Figures 1 to 3; Supplemental Figure 2) to drive RBOHF expression in different tissues of the rbohF mutant are likely to sharpen our understanding of RBOHF function in mediating the ROS wave. Nonetheless, such studies are not likely to alter the key findings of this study revealing that expression of RBOHD in phloem and xylem parenchyma cells is required for transmitting the ROS wave during the systemic response of Arabidopsis to light stress.

RBOHF, RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG F.DISCUSSION A perpetual cell-to-cell process of ROS-induced ROS production, that is, the ROS wave, propagates from a local tissue subjected to stress to the entire plant and is required for the induction of different acclimation transcripts, metabolites, and physiological responses in systemic tissues that results in SAA of systemic tissues to stress (Miller et al., 2009; Mittler et al., 2011; Choudhury et al., 2018; Devireddy et al., 2018, 2020; Kollist et al., 2019; Zandalinas et al., 2019, 2020; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). This process was originally found to depend on a single protein, RBOHD (Miller et al., 2009; Fichman et al., 2019). The ROS wave results in enhanced ROS production in almost all cells of the plant (Fichman et al., 2019), and this pattern is in agreement with the tissue-specific expression map of RBOHD (Hao et al., 2014; Morales et al., 2016), suggesting that RBOHD in all plant tissues is involved in ROS production during this process. However, our current findings that restoring RBOHD expression solely in the xylem parenchyma or phloem cells of the rbohD mutant is sufficient to restore systemic whole-plant ROS signaling (Figure 1; Supplemental Figure 2) strongly suggest that other ROS-producing pathways and mechanisms might be involved in this response. Indeed, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, RBOHF that is present in the rbohD mutant is also required for this response. Although the expression pattern of RBOHF is not identical to that of RBOHD, it still covers almost all aboveground plant tissues (Morales et al., 2016). It is therefore possible that, at least at the vascular bundles or veins of Arabidopsis, RBOHD and RBOHF cooperate in driving whole-plant ROS production during the systemic response to a local application of light stress. In the absence of one of them, ROS do not accumulate to high enough levels to trigger a whole-plant ROS signaling response (Figures 4 and 5), while in the presence of both, the ROS wave that propagates through the vascular bundles of plants can trigger a whole-plant ROS signaling response that results in the induction of systemic stress-response transcript accumulation and SAA (Figures 1 to 5). Of course, other ROS-producing mechanisms such as apoplastic oxidases and/or cytosolic, mitochondrial, peroxisomal, or chloroplastic ROS-producing mechanisms (Mittler, 2017; Kollist et al., 2019) could also participate in this process. RBOH-dependent ROS production in response to light stress was recently reported in bundle sheath strands of rice (Oryza sativa; Xiong et al., 2020), further supporting our findings that ROS-mediated signaling at the vascular bundles or veins of plants plays a key role in systemic responses to light stress (Figures 1 to 5). The findings that restoring RBOHD expression in the xylem parenchyma or phloem is sufficient to restore whole-plant systemic ROS signaling further suggest that RBOHD function in these two cell types is complementary. Interestingly, the function of both GLR proteins GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 was previously shown to be required for the propagation of electric signals, the calcium wave, and potentially some ROS signal, but GLR3.3 is expressed in phloem cells, and GLR3.6 in xylem parenchyma cells (Mousavi et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2018; Toyota et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Lew et al., 2020; Shao et al., 2020). Taken together, our results could suggest an interesting scenario in which RBOHD and/or RBOHF function is required for the coupling of the ROS, calcium, and electric waves (Choi et al., 2017; Fichman and Mittler, 2020) in at least one of these tissues, or both, functioning together with either GLR3.3 and/or GLR3.6 (Fichman et al., 2020). In support of a link between the ROS wave and electric signals are also our previous findings that the propagation of certain types of electric signals is suppressed in the rbohD mutant (Suzuki et al., 2013). Because hydraulic waves are also thought to propagate through the vascular bundles (Sade et al., 2014; Gilroy et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Fichman and Mittler, 2020), our findings that RBOHD expression in xylem parenchyma or phloem is sufficient to restore whole-plant systemic ROS signaling could further suggest that the ROS, calcium, electric, and hydraulic waves are all integrated in these tissues. A key role for bundle sheath cells in mediating excess light stress–induced systemic responses was previously reported in Arabidopsis, highlighting veins as important hubs for ABA and ROS signaling (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009; Kangasjärvi et al., 2009; Fichman and Mittler, 2020). In support of this role, as well as the findings described in our current study (Figures 1 to 5), are our previous findings that systemic stomatal aperture closure responses occur faster the closer stomata are to leaf veins (Devireddy et al., 2020). The expression of RBOHD in vascular bundles may therefore drive ROS signaling in these cells, affecting the stomata closest to them first, during the systemic response to light stress (Devireddy et al., 2020). This spatial relationship could further be explained by an interaction between ABA signaling and ROS production occurring at the vascular bundles (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009; Kangasjärvi et al., 2009; Devireddy et al., 2018, 2020). Interestingly, although bundle sheath cells were shown to play a key role in systemic ABA and ROS signaling in response to abiotic stress (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009; Kangasjärvi et al., 2009), they were not found by our analysis to be essential for mediating the systemic ROS wave response (Figures 1 to 3). This finding could suggest that the role of bundle sheath cells in mediating systemic signaling is linked in Arabidopsis to that of phloem and/or xylem parenchyma cells and that these different cell layers could cooperate in the systemic response of plants to stress. Phloem and/or xylem parenchyma cells could therefore mediate the ROS wave, while bundle sheath cells could integrate it with ABA signaling. Taken together, our findings reveal that in addition to Ca2+, electric, and hydraulic signals (Mousavi et al., 2013; Sade et al., 2014; Toyota et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2020), ROS signals are also mediated through the plant vascular system. The potential integration of all these rapid systemic signals (Gilroy et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Fichman and Mittler, 2020; Fichman et al., 2020) could therefore occur at the vascular bundles of plants, underscoring the importance of these tissues in mediating plant acclimation to different abiotic stresses and other stimuli. Vascular bundles could therefore serve as the central rapid systemic signaling super highway of plants.METHODS Plant Material, Growth Conditions, and Constructs Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana cv Columbia-0), rbohD, rbohF, and rbohD rbohF plants (confirmed transposon insertion mutants; Torres et al., 2002; Kwak et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2009) were grown in peat pellets (Jiffy-7, Jiffy; http://www.jiffygroup.com/) at 23°C under short-day growth conditions (10-h-light/14-h-dark cycle, 50 µmol m−2 s−1; Supplemental Figure 4). For complementing the rbohD mutant, promoter fragments representing between 579 to 3000 bp upstream to the 5′ of the start codon of CER6 (AT1G68530; Hooker et al., 2002; Mustroph et al., 2009), CAB3 (AT1G29910; Endo et al., 2007; Matías-Hernández et al., 2016), SCR (AT3G54220; Dhondt et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2014), XCP1 (AT4G35350; Funk et al., 2002; Avci et al., 2008), Sultr1;3 (AT1G22150; Yoshimoto et al., 2003; Sawa and Kay, 2011), and RBOHD (AT5G47910; Supplemental Table 1; Torres et al., 2002) were isolated by PCR from genomic DNA, sequenced, ligated upstream to the RBOHD gene, and cloned into pCAMBIA2301 vectors. Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 was transformed with all constructs and used to generate transgenic homozygous rbohD plants. Transgenic homozygous rbohD plants expressing the luciferase reporter under the control of the Zat12 promoter were obtained as previously described by Miller et al. (2009) and complemented with the different vectors for RBOHD expression as described above. A third set of vectors for expressing RBOHD fused in frame to GFP (N-terminal fusion) under the control of the different promoters described above were also generated and characterized. Homozygous lines were obtained for all constructs described above, and two to three different homozygous lines were used for all GFP localization, ROS imaging, transcript expression analyses using luciferase imaging, and SAA, as described below. At least two different independent homozygous lines were used for each assay and at least 10 different individual plants from each line were analyzed and averaged (for a total of at least 20 different plants per time point per treatment).Light Stress, ROS, Luciferase and GFP Imaging, and Data Analysis To image whole-plant ROS levels, plants were fumigated with 50 μM H2DCFDA (excitation/emission, 495 nm/517 nm; Millipore-Sigma; Ortega-Villasante et al., 2018) in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% (v/v) Silwet L-77 (LEHLE seeds) using a portable mini nebulizer (Punasi Direct) for 30 min as previously described by Fichman et al. (2019) and Zandalinas et al. (2020). As a control for dye penetration, plants were fumigated with 50 μM H2DCFDA for 30 min, followed by fumigation with H2O2 as previously described in Supplemental Figures 3B and 3C, and by Fichman et al. (2019) and Zandalinas et al. (2020). In addition, plants were fumigated with 50 μM H2DCFDA for 30 min and then with 10 mM ascorbic acid or 5 mM glutathione for 10 min and then with 1 mM H2O2 for 5 min (Supplemental Figures 3B and 3C). For luciferase imaging, plants were sprayed with 1 mM luciferin (sodium salt; GOLD BioTechnology) solution according to Miller et al. (2009). Following H2DCFDA or luciferin application, local leaves were exposed to a light intensity of 1700 µmol m−2 s−1 for 2 min using a ColdVision fiber optic light-emitting diode light source (Schott; Supplemental Figure 4) as described by Devireddy et al. (2018) and Zandalinas et al. (2019, 2020). Imaging ROS accumulation (evident by DCF oxidation) and luciferase activity in response to a local treatment of light stress was conducted with an IVIS Lumina S5 platform using Living Image 4.7.2 software (PerkinElmer) as described by Miller et al. (2009), Fichman et al. (2019) and Zandalinas et al. (2020). Because of the relatively young age of plants used, the activity of luciferase controlled by the ZAT12 promoter was mainly detected at the edge of leaves (Miller et al., 2009; Fichman et al., 2019). GFP localization and DCF imaging were also performed by Lionheart FX fluorescence (BioTek) and TCS SP8 (Leica) multiphoton confocal microscopes. All experiments were repeated at least three times each with the wild type, rbohD, and two to three different transgenic rbohD complemented lines.Systemic Acquired Acclimation Assays A single leaf was pretreated for 15 min with a light intensity of 1700 µmol m−2 s−1. Plants were then incubated for 45 min under controlled conditions. Following the recovery period, a systemic leaf was exposed to a light intensity of 1700 µmol m−2 s−1 for 45 min. Systemic leaves were then analyzed for electrolyte leakage as described by Suzuki et al. (2013), Devireddy et al. (2018), and Zandalinas et al. (2019, 2020). Control plants were untreated (Suzuki et al., 2013; Devireddy et al., 2018; Zandalinas et al., 2019, 2020).Statistical Analyses Results are presented as the mean ± sd. Statistical analyses were performed by two-tailed Student’s t test (asterisks denote statistical significance at P < 0.05 with respect to controls; Supplemental Table 2; Suzuki et al., 2013; Choudhury et al., 2018; Devireddy et al., 2018; Fichman et al., 2019; Zandalinas et al., 2019, 2020).Supplemental Data Supplemental Figure 1.

    "title": "Real-time In Vivo Recording of Arabidopsis Calcium Signals During Insect Feeding Using a Fluorescent Biosensor",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614317/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Calcium ions are predicted to be key signaling entities during biotic interactions, with calcium signaling forming an established part of the plant defense response to microbial elicitors and to wounding caused by chewing insects, eliciting systemic calcium signals in plants. However, the role of calcium in vivo during biotic stress is still unclear. This protocol describes the use of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor to detect calcium signals in plants during feeding by a hemipteran pest. Hemipterans such as aphids pierce a small number of cells with specialized, elongated sucking mouthparts, making them the ideal tool to study calcium dynamics when a plant is faced with a biotic stress, which is distinct from a wounding response. In addition, fluorescent biosensors are revolutionizing the measurement of signaling molecules in vivo in both animals and plants. Expressing a GFP-based calcium biosensor, GCaMP3, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the real-time imaging of plant calcium dynamics during insect feeding, with a high spatial and temporal resolution. A repeatable and robust assay has been developed using the fluorescence microscopy of detached GCaMP3 leaves, allowing for the continuous measurement of cytosolic calcium dynamics before, during, and after insect feeding. This reveals a highly-localized rapid calcium elevation around the aphid feeding site that occurs within a few minutes. The protocol can be adapted to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, while the use of Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the rapid generation of mutants to facilitate the molecular analysis of the phenomenon.

    "introduction": "Introduction Calcium (Ca2+) is one of the most ubiquitous signaling elements in plants. A transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is decoded by a complex network of downstream components and is involved in the response to both abiotic and biotic stresses1,2. A rise in [Ca2+]cyt is one of the first responses to microbial elicitors, forming a common part of the plant defense response3,4,5. Rises in [Ca2+]cyt have also been observed in response to wounding caused by chewing insects, such as lepidopterans6,7. However, the potential role of plant Ca2+ signals in response to live biotic threats that cause damage to only a few cells has not been explored. The green peach aphid Myzus persicae is a hemipteran insect that represents a significant threat to world agriculture8,9, and Ca2+ efflux from the extracellular space has been observed in leaves infested with M. persicae10.This protocol outlines a robust and repeatable method for measuring plant Ca2+ signals while M. persicae feed from leaves using a fluorescent Ca2+ biosensor, with both aphids and GCaMP3 offering novel tools with which to dissect the role of Ca2+ during biotic interactions. Ca2+-selective microelectrodes were formerly used to measure [Ca2+] in plants11,12. More recently, bioluminescent and fluorescent approaches have become standardized. These biosensors bind Ca2+ and emit light, allowing for un-paralleled opportunities to study Ca2+ dynamics in both cells and whole tissues. Ca2+ biosensors can be injected as dyes or stably produced upon the introduction of the biosensor coding sequence into the genome of the organism via transformation (i.e., genetically encoded biosensors). The latter offers the major advantages of being easily expressed in live tissue and capable of subcellular localization13. The aequorin protein, isolated from Aequorea victoria (jellyfish) was the first genetically encoded Ca2+ biosensor deployed in plants14. As a bioluminescent protein, aequorin does not require excitation by external light, which avoids chromophore bleaching and autofluorescence15. Aequorin has been successfully used to measure [Ca2+] fluxes in response to various stimuli, including temperature16, pathogens17,18,19, salt stress20,21, and wounding7. However, it is disadvantaged by the relatively low signal intensity, making the detection of [Ca2+] fluxes in individual cells and from tissues with poor sensor expression difficult13. The development of Ca2+ biosensors that can fluoresce has complemented aequorin by allowing for detailed subcellular and tissue-level analysis of Ca2+ dynamics. One of the most common fluorescent biosensors are the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Cameleons. FRET Cameleons are composed of two proteins, typically CFP and YFP, which are brought into close contact by the conformational change induced by the binding of Ca2+ to a calmodulin domain in the CFP-YFP linker region. This contact allows the transfer of energy from CFP to YFP, and the resulting change in the fluorescence of these fluorophores allows for the accurate quantification of [Ca2+] through the calculation of the ratio of the fluorescence signals from the two fluorophores22. FRET Cameleons are superior to aequorin and non-ratiometric florescent dyes, as they are less affected by the expression level of the protein23 and often have a greater fluorescent yield, allowing for cellular and subcellular imaging23. For example, FRET Cameleons have been recently used to identify long-distance Ca2+ signals in plants and to resolve these to the cellular level24,25,26. A recent breakthrough with fluorescent GFP-based Ca2+ biosensors has been the development of highly sensitive single-fluorophore (single-FP) biosensors. Single-FP biosensors consist of a single circularly permutated GFP linked to a calmodulin and M13 peptide, with Ca2+ binding to calmodulin, resulting in a water-mediated reaction between calmodulin and GFP so as to protonate GFP and increase fluorescent yield27,28,29. Single-FP sensors offer several advantages over FRET Cameleons, including simpler experimental design and a potentially higher temporal resolution of imaging30. Although single-FP sensors cannot quantify absolute [Ca2+] as simply as FRET sensors, they are superior for the analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics of Ca2+ signals5,23. GCaMPs are one of the best-established single-FP sensors28 and have undergone several revisions to enhance their fluorescent yield, dynamic range, Ca2+ affinity, and signal-to-noise ratios31,32,33,34. The GCaMPs have been successfully used in animal systems, such as zebrafish motor neurons35 and fruit fly neuromuscular junctions34. Random mutagenesis of GCaMP3 has resulted in additional classes of single-FP sensors, including the ultrasensitive GCaMP636 and the GECOs29. The GECOs were recently used in Arabidopsis thaliana (henceforth referred to as Arabidopsis) to measure Ca2+ fluxes in response to ATP, chitin, and the bacterial elicitor flg22. This study also demonstrated that the R-GECO biosensor outperformed the FRET Cameleon YC3.6 in terms of maximal signal change and signal-to-noise ratio5. Because of the ease of use, high fluorescent yield, and high temporal resolution that can be achieved with GCaMP biosensors, GCaMP3 was genetically encoded in Arabidopsis under the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The genetic tools available for Arabidopsis research allow for the detailed molecular analysis of the Ca2+ signals measured by GCaMP3. In addition, the GCaMP3 biosensor can be visualized under a fluorescence microscope rather than a costlier confocal system. This protocol allows for whole-tissue imaging, essential when conducting experiments with live biotic stresses. The experiment is designed such that detached leaves from 35S::GCaMP3 plants are floated in water, to prevent insect escape and to restrict feeding to a specific tissue. The method outlined in this paper therefore allows for the analysis of leaf Ca2+ dynamics during feeding by M. persicae, resulting in the characterization of a novel plant signaling response. This method can also be adapted to work with other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species and microbial pathogens, and with other plant tissues, such as roots.",

    "results": "Representative Results Figure 3 andFigure 4arerepresentative results from an experiment comparing an aphid-treated leaf with an untreated control. A highly localized increase in GFP fluorescence can be seen around the feeding site within a few minutes in the majority of samples, whilst the Ca2+ dynamics in the untreated control leaf stay relatively stable (Figure 3A and 3B). It is also possible to observe secondary increases in GFP fluorescence after the initial peak in some experiments (Figure 3B). In up to 50% of treated leaves, the aphids do not settle and the samples should be discarded. Of the samples in which settling occurs, 27% of samples do not exhibit clear increases in GFP fluorescence around the feeding site (Figure 3C and Table 1); therefore, 25 - 30 replicate samples should be averaged for quantitative analysis. Visualization of the area and speed of the feeding site [Ca2+]cyt elevation should reveal a signal of around 110 µm travelling at 6 µm/s (Table 1). In addition, no [Ca2+]cyt elevations should be detected systemically within the leaf upon aphid treatment, either in the systemic midrib (Figure 4A) or the systemic lateral tissue regions (Figure 4B). A representative sample of [Ca2+]cyt dynamics over time is shown in Video 1. It is also possible to analyze aphid settling behavior by tracking the number and duration of individual settling events under the microscope. Representative results for these behaviors are shown in Table 1, showing that the aphids take around 10 min before settling, and when they do settle successfully, this lasts for 20 min on average. Therefore, the insects are settled in a single location for the entirety of the [Ca2+]cyt elevation.

    "discussion": "Discussion The method described in this paper allows for the real-time analysis of plant Ca2+ signaling during a biotic stress such as insect feeding. It demonstrates that one of the first plant responses to such threats is a localized [Ca2+]cyt elevation around the feeding site of the insect. Through the use of mutants, this method will allow for the the molecular and physiological characterization of such signals, which was not previously possible. A critical step in this protocol is to ensure that the detached leaves are not excessively disturbed during the detachment process (step 3.2) or when transferring insects to the leaves (step 4.5). Given that the current protocol provides a relative measurement of [Ca2+]cyt rather than an absolute concentration, it is vital that the microscope settings are kept constant throughout the experiment. There is also the potential for human bias during the selection of ROIs and the analysis of the data, and as such, it is recommended that the experiments are conducted double-blind. There are several significant advantages of measuring [Ca2+]cyt during biotic stress with this protocol. First, the use of a single fluorophore with a high fluorescent yield allows the imaging to be conducted on a stereomicroscope, which is less costly than using a confocal microscope. The use of a single fluorophore also makes data collection and analysis simple, as there is just one measurement to record. In addition, the use of a stereomicroscope allows for the imaging of entire leaves, which is essential given that many biotic interactions, including plant-aphid interactions, occur on a large spatial scale. The high temporal resolution of image capture possible with GCaMP3, based on the rapid disassociation of Ca2+ from the sensor after binding23,30 and the high florescent yield, allows for measurements to be taken up to every 5 s. Furthermore, the leaf assay prevents the escape of the insect, a key limiting step to conducting such experiments on whole plants (in preparation). The detached leaves also ensure that the insect feeds from a pre-defined location, allowing for the analysis of Ca2+ dynamics before, during, and after feeding. This protocol also ensures that leaves of similar developmental stages are used for analysis. The main disadvantage of this protocol originates from the use of a non-ratiometric biosensor. With single-FP biosensors, variation in GFP emission may result from experimental variables other than [Ca2+]cyt, such as changes in cellular pH, motion, or the expression level of the biosensor. These issues are not encountered with FRET Cameleons during FRET, as the transfer of energy from CFP to YFP only occurs upon Ca2+ binding. Other conditions that alter the fluorescent properties of the individual fluorophores are unlikely to mimic the opposing changes in intensity of CFP and YFP, and the ratiometric calculation that is used inherently normalizes the measurements for many of these other optical artifacts23,30. This makes estimations of absolute [Ca2+]cyt more reliable with FRET Cameleons. Consequently, GCaMP3 is best used as a biosensor to measure relative [Ca2+]cyt, although it is still sufficient to detect and characterize biological phenomena in plants5,(in preparation). Therefore, it is essential to use controls to show that the observed effect is due to Ca2+, including Ca2+-related genetic mutants(in preparation) or pharmacological Ca2+ channel inhibitors such as La3+. Importantly, single-FP biosensors typically display a greater fluorescent yield and greater dynamic range (i.e., an increase in florescence upon Ca2+ binding) than FRET Cameleons23, which makes GCaMP more suited to tissue-level imaging, while FRET Cameleons are a useful tool for cellular imaging with a confocal microscope5,25. During the execution of this protocol, it is possible that some issues will arise that require troubleshooting. For example, it is recommended that samples in which the control (untreated) leaf displays large [Ca2+]cyt elevations are discarded (step 6.3). Such transients are most likely the result of stress induced by the microscopy. Indeed, blue light is known to elicit Ca2+ signals38,39,40,41, and the high-intensity light might also result in temperature and osmotic stresses, both of which also elicit [Ca2+]cyt elevations21,25,42. Consequently, to reduce such stresses, it is important to conduct the experiment in a well-ventilated and temperature-controlled room and to avoid unnecessarily long exposure times. It is also important to not disrupt the leaves excessively during detachment or during the microscopy to prevent touch-elicited [Ca2+]cyt elevations43,44,45. Issues may also be encountered with insect settling. With M. persicae, the insects do not settle on the leaves in several samples. This could be a result of wound-elicited defense in the detached leaves46,47, or the disturbance of the insects by the blue light. Indeed, vision in M. persicae is governed by three photoreceptors, including one with a peak sensitivity of 490 nm48. Reducing the microscopy exposure and handling the aphids with care might reduce distress and encourage settling. The protocol outlined in the current paper gives new insights onto the molecular understanding of plant-insect interactions and the plant response to biotic stress. It allows for the visualization of one of the first plant responses to insect feeding and facilitates further investigations through the use of the considerable Arabidopsis genetic resources available. In addition, this protocol allows for the use of live organisms, as opposed to extracts49 or elicitors50. In the future, this technique could be applied to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, nematodes, or microbial pathogens, as well as to abiotic stresses. The GCaMP3 microscopy can also be modified to image other plant tissues, alternative ROIs on the leaf, or even whole plants. Furthermore, there is the potential for the biosensor to be genetically encoded in additional plant species. Consequently, the protocol outlined in this paper has the potential to undercover the molecular basis of Ca2+ signaling in a range of novel biotic interactions between plants and other species.",

A transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is decoded by a complex network of downstream components and is involved in the response to both abiotic and biotic stresses1,2. A rise in [Ca2+]cyt is one of the first responses to microbial elicitors, forming a common part of the plant defense response3,4,5. Rises in [Ca2+]cyt have also been observed in response to wounding caused by chewing insects, such as lepidopterans6,7. However, the potential role of plant Ca2+ signals in response to live biotic threats that cause damage to only a few cells has not been explored. The green peach aphid Myzus persicae is a hemipteran insect that represents a significant threat to world agriculture8,9, and Ca2+ efflux from the extracellular space has been observed in leaves infested with M. persicae10.This protocol outlines a robust and repeatable method for measuring plant Ca2+ signals while M. persicae feed from leaves using a fluorescent Ca2+ biosensor, with both aphids and GCaMP3 offering novel tools with which to dissect the role of Ca2+ during biotic interactions.

The latter offers the major advantages of being easily expressed in live tissue and capable of subcellular localization13. The aequorin protein, isolated from Aequorea victoria (jellyfish) was the first genetically encoded Ca2+ biosensor deployed in plants14. As a bioluminescent protein, aequorin does not require excitation by external light, which avoids chromophore bleaching and autofluorescence15. Aequorin has been successfully used to measure [Ca2+] fluxes in response to various stimuli, including temperature16, pathogens17,18,19, salt stress20,21, and wounding7. However, it is disadvantaged by the relatively low signal intensity, making the detection of [Ca2+] fluxes in individual cells and from tissues with poor sensor expression difficult13. The development of Ca2+ biosensors that can fluoresce has complemented aequorin by allowing for detailed subcellular and tissue-level analysis of Ca2+ dynamics. One of the most common fluorescent biosensors are the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Cameleons. FRET Cameleons are composed of two proteins, typically CFP and YFP, which are brought into close contact by the conformational change induced by the binding of Ca2+ to a calmodulin domain in the CFP-YFP linker region. This contact allows the transfer of energy from CFP to YFP, and the resulting change in the fluorescence of these fluorophores allows for the accurate quantification of [Ca2+] through the calculation of the ratio of the fluorescence signals from the two fluorophores22. FRET Cameleons are superior to aequorin and non-ratiometric florescent dyes, as they are less affected by the expression level of the protein23 and often have a greater fluorescent yield, allowing for cellular and subcellular imaging23. For example, FRET Cameleons have been recently used to identify long-distance Ca2+ signals in plants and to resolve these to the cellular level24,25,26. A recent breakthrough with fluorescent GFP-based Ca2+ biosensors has been the development of highly sensitive single-fluorophore (single-FP) biosensors. Single-FP biosensors consist of a single circularly permutated GFP linked to a calmodulin and M13 peptide, with Ca2+ binding to calmodulin, resulting in a water-mediated reaction between calmodulin and GFP so as to protonate GFP and increase fluorescent yield27,28,29. Single-FP sensors offer several advantages over FRET Cameleons, including simpler experimental design and a potentially higher temporal resolution of imaging30. Although single-FP sensors cannot quantify absolute [Ca2+] as simply as FRET sensors, they are superior for the analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics of Ca2+ signals5,23. GCaMPs are one of the best-established single-FP sensors28 and have undergone several revisions to enhance their fluorescent yield, dynamic range, Ca2+ affinity, and signal-to-noise ratios31,32,33,34. The GCaMPs have been successfully used in animal systems, such as zebrafish motor neurons35 and fruit fly neuromuscular junctions34. Random mutagenesis of GCaMP3 has resulted in additional classes of single-FP sensors, including the ultrasensitive GCaMP636 and the GECOs29. The GECOs were recently used in Arabidopsis thaliana (henceforth referred to as Arabidopsis) to measure Ca2+ fluxes in response to ATP, chitin, and the bacterial elicitor flg22. This study also demonstrated that the R-GECO biosensor outperformed the FRET Cameleon YC3.6 in terms of maximal signal change and signal-to-noise ratio5. Because of the ease of use, high fluorescent yield, and high temporal resolution that can be achieved with GCaMP biosensors, GCaMP3 was genetically encoded in Arabidopsis under the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The genetic tools available for Arabidopsis research allow for the detailed molecular analysis of the Ca2+ signals measured by GCaMP3. In addition, the GCaMP3 biosensor can be visualized under a fluorescence microscope rather than a costlier confocal system. This protocol allows for whole-tissue imaging, essential when conducting experiments with live biotic stresses. The experiment is designed such that detached leaves from 35S::GCaMP3 plants are floated in water, to prevent insect escape and to restrict feeding to a specific tissue. The method outlined in this paper therefore allows for the analysis of leaf Ca2+ dynamics during feeding by M. persicae, resulting in the characterization of a novel plant signaling response. This method can also be adapted to work with other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species and microbial pathogens, and with other plant tissues, such as roots.Protocol 1. Plant Preparation (Days 1 - 4) On day 1, sterilize 35S::GCaMP seeds using three 75% ethanol washes, 1 min per wash, and plate them on 100 mm2 square plastic plates with ¼-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (recipe: 1.1 g of Murashige and Skoog medium, 7.5 g of sucrose, 10 g of Formedium agar, and 1 L of de-ionized water)37. Stratify the seedlings in the dark for three days at 8 °C to obtain synchronous germination. On day 4 of the experiment, move the GCaMP seedlings to a controlled environment room (CER) at 23 °C, with a 16 h light and 8 h dark photoperiod. 2. Insect Rearing (Days 11 - 12) On day 11 of the experiment, add 15 adult M. persicae to 5-week-old soil-grown Arabidopsis plants using a moist artist's paint brush (size 2 or 4) (grown in a CER at 22 °C with 10 h light and 14 h dark photoperiod). Cage the aphids on the plant by placing clear plastic tubing (10 cm x 15 cm) around the plant and cap with a plastic lid. Leave the aphid-infested plants for 24 h in a CER at 22 °C with a 16-h light and 8-h dark photoperiod. On day 12 of the experiment, remove all adult M. persicae using a paintbrush. NOTE: Insects can be seen by eye on the plant. This gives a population of nymphs with a similar developmental age. Roughly 1 nymph per adult will be produced during this period. Leave the infested plants in a lower-temperature CER at 16 °C, with an 8 h light and 16 h dark photoperiod, to prevent the nymphs from increasing in size too rapidly. 3. Leaf Detachment (Day 19) On day 19 of the experiment, remove the 35S::GCaMP3 seedlings from the CER and detach the largest leaf from each plant using a pair of sharp scissors. Using a pair of tweezers, place the detached leaf into the well of a 96-well plate containing 300 µL of distilled water, abaxial surface facing up. Repeat for additional leaves (Figure 1). Open in a new tabFigure 1: 35S::GCaMP3 Leaf Assay. The largest leaf from each 16 day-old 35S::GCaMP3 Arabidopsis seedling is detached and floated on 300 µL of distilled water in a 96-well plate. Photo taken the day after detachment. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure. Cover the plate in clear plastic wrap and aluminum foil and leave at room temperature overnight to allow the stress of the detachment to subside.4. Fluorescence Microscopy (Days 20 - 22) On day 20 of the experiment, remove the 96-well plate from the aluminum foil and transfer it to a fluorescence stereomicroscope. Configure the stereo fluorescence microscope to excite GFP with a 450-490 nm light and to capture the fluorescent emission between 500 and 550 nm. Collect the aged aphids from the colony established on day 11 by removing the plant from the soil and placing it in a transparent box with a lid. Keep the insects contained in the box while conducting the experiment. Place the 96-well plate under the microscope. Alter the light exposure until the GCaMP3 fluorescence can be clearly visualized in the veins of the detached leaves. Keep the exposure constant for all experiments; for the current protocol, a 1-s exposure was used with a gain of 3.5 (Figure 2). Adjust the magnification and zoom of the microscope such that 4 wells can be observed in one frame; for the current protocol, a 7.8X magnification and a focus of -127.833 mm was used. Transfer one aphid to a detached leaf under the microscope using a moist paint brush. Leave an adjacent leaf untreated as a control, but lightly touch it with the paintbrush to mimic the touching that occurs during aphid transfer. Remember to place the plastic wrap back on top of the 96-well plate during microscopy to prevent the insect from escaping. Begin the fluorescence recording of the leaves in pairs (1 aphid-treated and 1 untreated) by clicking \"start experiment\" in the built-in microscope software (Figure 2). Record measurements for 50 min. NOTE: For the current protocol, a time interval of 5 s between measurements was used. After 50 min, stop recording by clicking on \"stop experiment\" and remove the aphid from the leaf. Save the fluorescence measurements as image files (e.g., tagged image file format, TIFF). Repeat the experiment with further pairs of leaves; imaging can be extended to image 2 pairs of leaves at once, allowing for the simultaneous imaging of 2 genotypes. Open in a new tab5. Data Collection Import the image files into Fiji (Image J) and convert them to 32 bits by clicking on \"Image\" > \"Type\" > \"32-bit;\" this allows for the conversion of the images into heatmap videos (see step 7). Discard the samples in which the aphids do not settle in one location for more than 5 min by viewing the insect movement under the microscope. NOTE: This is often the majority of samples, and up to 100 treatments may be required to find 30 samples exhibiting successful settling. Set the measurement scale to pixels (or convert to mm, if known) and the time frame to the same time interval as used during the microscopy by clicking on \"Image\" > \"Properties.\" Using the cursor, place a region of interest (ROI) around the area of tissue for GFP analysis. NOTE: In the current protocol, a circular ROI 50 pixels (0.65 mm) in diameter was used at 3 locations of interest: the aphid feeding site (Fs), a systemic region on the midrib of the leaf (Sm), and a systemic region adjacent to the midrib (\"lateral tissue,\" Sl) (Figure 2). Create the ROI by drawing an oval (use the \"oval tool\"), and edit the size using \"Edit\" > \"Selection\" > \"Specify.\" See Figure 2. For the untreated control, select ROIs in comparable regions of the leaf to those selected on the treated leaf (i.e., the same region of the leaf as where the aphid fed on the treated leaf) (Figure 2).

Use the Time Series Analyzer plugin by clicking \"Plugins\" > \"Time Series Analyzer\" to analyze the raw fluorescence values (F) in the ROI over time. Add the ROI of interest (\"Add [t]\"). Making sure that the ROI is selected, select \"get average;\" this will display a table of F values for each frame in that ROI. Copy this data into a spreadsheet. Calculate the area of the feeding site signal by first selecting the region using the \"freehand selection tool.\" Outline the maximal GFP signal and then calculate the area of this shape by clicking \"Analyze\" > \"Measure.\" Calculate the speed of the feeding site signal using the MTrackJ plugin by clicking \"Plugins\" > \"Tracking\" > \"MTrackJ.\" Click on the \"Add\" button and then click the cursor at the center of the signal when it is first visible. Click again on the edge of the signal at its point of furthest spread. Click \"measure\" to calculate the speed of the signal. 6. Data Analysis Define the point of aphid settling by playing through the image frames from the microscope in Fiji. NOTE: The time of settling is the frame during which the aphid stays in a single location for 5 min or more. The duration of settling events can also be calculated from the images in Fiji. Normalize the F data (ΔF/F) according to the equation ΔF/F = (F - F0)/F0, where F0 is the average baseline fluorescence calculated from the average of F over the first 60 frames of the recording before the aphid settled. Repeat for the untreated control. Plot the normalized GFP fluorescence (ΔF/F) over time for that ROI in the treated and untreated leaf. Discard samples (both leaves) if the untreated control shows large Ca2+ transients (i.e., ΔF/F rises above 0.2). Repeat until at least 20 - 30 viable samples have been analyzed per genotype. 7. Time-course Video Creation Convert the 32-bit image files into heatmaps using the NucMed_Image LUTs plugin by clicking \"Plugins\" > \"NucMed\" > \"Lookup tables.\" In the lookup tables menu, select \"blue green red\" to convert the images to heat maps. Enhance the contrast of the heatmap to highlight the aphid-elicited GFP signals using \"Process\" > \"Enhance contrast\" > \"Adjust saturated pixels %.\" Add time information using the Time Stamper plugin by clicking on \"Plugins\" > \"Time Stamper\". Set the \"starting time\" at \"0\" and the \"interval\" based on the time interval used for the microscopy (e.g., 5 s). Export this video as an audio video interleaved (AVI) file. NOTE: This video can then be edited further in other software packages (e.g., Microsoft Movie Maker). Representative Results Figure 3 andFigure 4arerepresentative results from an experiment comparing an aphid-treated leaf with an untreated control. A highly localized increase in GFP fluorescence can be seen around the feeding site within a few minutes in the majority of samples, whilst the Ca2+ dynamics in the untreated control leaf stay relatively stable (Figure 3A and 3B). It is also possible to observe secondary increases in GFP fluorescence after the initial peak in some experiments (Figure 3B). In up to 50% of treated leaves, the aphids do not settle and the samples should be discarded. Of the samples in which settling occurs, 27% of samples do not exhibit clear increases in GFP fluorescence around the feeding site (Figure 3C and Table 1); therefore, 25 - 30 replicate samples should be averaged for quantitative analysis. Visualization of the area and speed of the feeding site [Ca2+]cyt elevation should reveal a signal of around 110 µm travelling at 6 µm/s (Table 1). In addition, no [Ca2+]cyt elevations should be detected systemically within the leaf upon aphid treatment, either in the systemic midrib (Figure 4A) or the systemic lateral tissue regions (Figure 4B). A representative sample of [Ca2+]cyt dynamics over time is shown in Video 1. It is also possible to analyze aphid settling behavior by tracking the number and duration of individual settling events under the microscope. Representative results for these behaviors are shown in Table 1, showing that the aphids take around 10 min before settling, and when they do settle successfully, this lasts for 20 min on average. Therefore, the insects are settled in a single location for the entirety of the [Ca2+]cyt elevation.

(Right-click to download.)Discussion The method described in this paper allows for the real-time analysis of plant Ca2+ signaling during a biotic stress such as insect feeding. It demonstrates that one of the first plant responses to such threats is a localized [Ca2+]cyt elevation around the feeding site of the insect. Through the use of mutants, this method will allow for the the molecular and physiological characterization of such signals, which was not previously possible. A critical step in this protocol is to ensure that the detached leaves are not excessively disturbed during the detachment process (step 3.2) or when transferring insects to the leaves (step 4.5). Given that the current protocol provides a relative measurement of [Ca2+]cyt rather than an absolute concentration, it is vital that the microscope settings are kept constant throughout the experiment. There is also the potential for human bias during the selection of ROIs and the analysis of the data, and as such, it is recommended that the experiments are conducted double-blind. There are several significant advantages of measuring [Ca2+]cyt during biotic stress with this protocol. First, the use of a single fluorophore with a high fluorescent yield allows the imaging to be conducted on a stereomicroscope, which is less costly than using a confocal microscope. The use of a single fluorophore also makes data collection and analysis simple, as there is just one measurement to record. In addition, the use of a stereomicroscope allows for the imaging of entire leaves, which is essential given that many biotic interactions, including plant-aphid interactions, occur on a large spatial scale. The high temporal resolution of image capture possible with GCaMP3, based on the rapid disassociation of Ca2+ from the sensor after binding23,30 and the high florescent yield, allows for measurements to be taken up to every 5 s. Furthermore, the leaf assay prevents the escape of the insect, a key limiting step to conducting such experiments on whole plants (in preparation). The detached leaves also ensure that the insect feeds from a pre-defined location, allowing for the analysis of Ca2+ dynamics before, during, and after feeding. This protocol also ensures that leaves of similar developmental stages are used for analysis. The main disadvantage of this protocol originates from the use of a non-ratiometric biosensor. With single-FP biosensors, variation in GFP emission may result from experimental variables other than [Ca2+]cyt, such as changes in cellular pH, motion, or the expression level of the biosensor. These issues are not encountered with FRET Cameleons during FRET, as the transfer of energy from CFP to YFP only occurs upon Ca2+ binding. Other conditions that alter the fluorescent properties of the individual fluorophores are unlikely to mimic the opposing changes in intensity of CFP and YFP, and the ratiometric calculation that is used inherently normalizes the measurements for many of these other optical artifacts23,30. This makes estimations of absolute [Ca2+]cyt more reliable with FRET Cameleons. Consequently, GCaMP3 is best used as a biosensor to measure relative [Ca2+]cyt, although it is still sufficient to detect and characterize biological phenomena in plants5,(in preparation). Therefore, it is essential to use controls to show that the observed effect is due to Ca2+, including Ca2+-related genetic mutants(in preparation) or pharmacological Ca2+ channel inhibitors such as La3+. Importantly, single-FP biosensors typically display a greater fluorescent yield and greater dynamic range (i.e., an increase in florescence upon Ca2+ binding) than FRET Cameleons23, which makes GCaMP more suited to tissue-level imaging, while FRET Cameleons are a useful tool for cellular imaging with a confocal microscope5,25. During the execution of this protocol, it is possible that some issues will arise that require troubleshooting. For example, it is recommended that samples in which the control (untreated) leaf displays large [Ca2+]cyt elevations are discarded (step 6.3). Such transients are most likely the result of stress induced by the microscopy. Indeed, blue light is known to elicit Ca2+ signals38,39,40,41, and the high-intensity light might also result in temperature and osmotic stresses, both of which also elicit [Ca2+]cyt elevations21,25,42. Consequently, to reduce such stresses, it is important to conduct the experiment in a well-ventilated and temperature-controlled room and to avoid unnecessarily long exposure times. It is also important to not disrupt the leaves excessively during detachment or during the microscopy to prevent touch-elicited [Ca2+]cyt elevations43,44,45. Issues may also be encountered with insect settling. With M. persicae, the insects do not settle on the leaves in several samples. This could be a result of wound-elicited defense in the detached leaves46,47, or the disturbance of the insects by the blue light. Indeed, vision in M. persicae is governed by three photoreceptors, including one with a peak sensitivity of 490 nm48. Reducing the microscopy exposure and handling the aphids with care might reduce distress and encourage settling. The protocol outlined in the current paper gives new insights onto the molecular understanding of plant-insect interactions and the plant response to biotic stress. It allows for the visualization of one of the first plant responses to insect feeding and facilitates further investigations through the use of the considerable Arabidopsis genetic resources available. In addition, this protocol allows for the use of live organisms, as opposed to extracts49 or elicitors50. In the future, this technique could be applied to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, nematodes, or microbial pathogens, as well as to abiotic stresses. The GCaMP3 microscopy can also be modified to image other plant tissues, alternative ROIs on the leaf, or even whole plants. Furthermore, there is the potential for the biosensor to be genetically encoded in additional plant species. Consequently, the protocol outlined in this paper has the potential to undercover the molecular basis of Ca2+ signaling in a range of novel biotic interactions between plants and other species.Disclosures The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.Acknowledgments We would like to thank Grant Calder (John Innes Centre, U.K.) for the advice concerning microscopy.

A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and electrical signaling (‘trio signaling’) appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. The plant cell wall presents a plant-specific route for possible propagation of signals from cell to cell. However, the degree to which the cell wall limits information exchange between cells via transfer of small molecules through an extracellular route, or whether it provides an environment to facilitate transmission of regulators such as ROS or H+ remains to be determined. Similarly, the role of plasmodesmata as both conduits and gatekeepers for the propagation of rapid cell-to-cell signaling remains a key open question. Regardless of how signals move from cell to cell, they help prepare distant parts of the plant for impending challenges from specific biotic or abiotic stresses. Keywords: calcium, cell-to-cell communication, plasmodesmata, reactive oxygen species, systemic signalingINTRODUCTION Plants are constantly bombarded by stimuli and, through a combination of physiological and developmental responses, they adapt to their ever-changing environment. Although some stimuli such as changes in air temperature or day/night transitions essentially arrive simultaneously to aerial parts of the plant, many of the signals that are key to the plant’s success, including herbivory, touch or pathogen attack are perceived locally within the plant, but the responses they elicit are often propagated throughout the entire plant body. Thus, organs not directly receiving the stimulus respond to long-range signals exported from the site of perception. Such systemic signals include cell-to-cell, organ-to-organ (shoot-to-shoot, root-to-root, root-to-shoot and shoot-to-root) and, possibly, even plant-to-plant communication. This long-distance systemic signaling network essentially allows the whole plant to prepare for future challenges. These types of systemic responses can be divided into two major classes: (i) systemic acquired resistance (SAR), typically triggered by pathogens; and (ii) systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) that is induced by abiotic stress stimuli, such as high light, temperature, wounding and osmotic stress. These systemic signal response networks have been shown to improve plant fitness. For example, in Arabidopsis plants responding to a bacterial pathogen, a prior induction of SAR resulted in plants with increased biomass and greater than 50% more seed (Traw et al., 2007). Indeed, priming of defenses (i.e. the ability to mount a larger response after receiving an initial stress) occurs in response to many biotic and abiotic stress signals (Conrath et al., 2015) and, for example, in the case of SAR, the induced improvements in plant defense induction can be passed to the next generation (Luna et al., 2012). Such rapid signal propagation throughout the plant body has been proposed to occur through both symplastic (cytoplasmic) and apoplastic (extracellular) pathways. For example, on the symplastic side, the phloem has been shown to rapidly transport systemic signals ranging from proteins and mRNAs to small molecules and metabolites at rates of several hundred μm sec−1 (reviewed in Haroldsen et al., 2012; Turnbull and Lopez-Cobollo, 2013; Ham and Lucas, 2014). However, recent evidence suggests that many of the proteins trafficked in the phloem may simply be non-specifically lost from companion cells to the sieve elements and then passively caught and redistributed in the translocation stream (Paultre et al., 2016). Similarly, mRNA movement in phloem may be related to abundance in the companion cell/sieve tube complex, suggesting much of this mobile RNA pool may not be related to selective loading and trafficking of specific information containing molecules in the translocation stream (Calderwood et al., 2016). Indeed, grafting experiments have detected in excess of 2000 mobile RNAs trafficking between root stock and scion, which is perhaps more consistent with a large non-specific trafficking capacity than the targeted exchange of multiple key systemic regulators (Thieme et al., 2015). Thus, mobility alone does not necessarily reveal a messenger carrying specific systemic information. However, there are many cases where a role for phloem mobile signals in the regulation of distant target site activity has been demonstrated. For example, the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein has been shown to move in the symplasm from the site of light perception (the leaves) to distant target sites, where it elicits the transition from vegetative to floral meristem development. Thus, the FT protein produced by phloem companion cells is loaded to the sieve elements in a highly regulated process that is mediated by other factors such as FT INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (Liu et al., 2012). FT is then transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem via the symplastic pathway, resulting in its eventual interaction with FLOWERING LOCUS D, which then promotes flowering (Corbesier et al., 2007; Jaeger and Wigge, 2007; Mathieu et al., 2007). Critically, inhibiting FT movement prevents the transfer of flowering information (reviewed in Ham and Lucas, 2014). Indeed, a suite of such mobile signals has been defined that trigger systemic response to local stimuli. The molecules carrying this information range from hormones, proteins, RNAs and metabolites, to a rapid, self-reinforcing network of events related to a trio of regulators: reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and electrical signals (reviewed in Choi et al., 2016; Gilroy et al., 2016). The machinery behind the cell-to-cell propagating nature of each of these various rapid signaling systems is beginning to emerge (Figure 1; reviewed in Choi et al., 2016; Gilroy et al., 2016; Hedrich et al., 2016), as are candidates for sensors potentially directly triggering these systems, such as the OSCA1 osmotically responsive Ca2+ channel (Yuan et al., 2014). However, in this update, we will concentrate on asking what information content this signaling network is likely to carry and how the signal itself can move at speeds exceeding 1000 μm sec−1? That is, what are the challenges to a systemic signal that must traverse tens of cell lengths per second? Figure 1. Open in a new tab Salt-stress-associated Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave propagation in plants. A salt-stress-triggered cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) increase is dependent on the tonoplast-localized TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1) cation channel (Choi et al., 2014). The resultant [Ca2+]cyt increase is propagated through the cell in a wave front supported by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) that is either directly or indirectly supported by TPC1 action. In addition, H2O2 accumulation in the apoplast is generated by the PM-localized RBOHD NADPH oxidase, that is itself activated by Ca2+ through internal Ca2+-binding sites (EF-hands) and a variety of Ca2+-dependent, post-translational regulators (reviewed in Choi et al., 2016). The apoplastic transmission of accumulated extracellular H2O2 is thought to drive cell-to-cell transmission of the propagating wave (Evans et al., 2016).

In unicellular organisms such communication is crucial for sexual reproduction, and the formation, maintenance and differentiation of different cell populations such as crusts, biofilms, filaments, fruiting bodies and other communities (Claessen et al., 2014). In multicellular organisms cell-to-cell communication is essential for sexual reproduction, morphological development, physiological homeostasis, defense and acclimation to the environment (Raven et al., 2014). At a basic level and over short distances, cell-to-cell communication in plants is different from that of animal cells (Figure 2; Bloemendal and Kuck, 2013). Cell-to-cell communication in animal cells can be mediated through the secretion of small molecules to the medium between cells (that then trigger receptors on systemic target cells), the transfer of extracellular vesicles such as exosomes (30–150 nm) and microvesicles (100–1500 nm), or via direct cytosolic connections such as gap junctions (2–3 nm) and tunneling nanotubes (50–700 nm). In addition, many multicellular animals use a parallel signaling network, where rapid signaling is accomplished using cellular networks highly specialized to rapidly transmit electrical signal over long distances, i.e. a nervous system (reviewed in Goodenough and Paul, 2009; Herve and Derangeon, 2013). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Routes of cell-to-cell communication in plant and animal cells. Simplified models for the transmission of signals between two plant (a) and animal (b) cells are shown. Signals are transported between cells via secretion of molecules (a and b) or vesicles (b), or direct physical cell-to-cell connections (PDs in a, and gap junctions and tunneling nanotubes in b). CW, cell wall; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GJ, gap junction; PD, plasmodesma; PM, plasma membrane; TNT, tunneling nanotubes.In plants, the presence of the cell wall between cells constitutes a physical and chemical barrier that keeps neighboring cells at a larger physical distance from each other than most animal cells and so impacts on some of the possible cell-to-cell communication pathways outlined above (Figure 2). For example, because of the predicted size exclusion limit that is imposed by its constituent polysaccharide networks, the cell wall is likely to significantly limit or prevent extracellular vesicle transport between cells. The cell wall may also alter the chemistry of some small molecules that are secreted into the apoplast due to the presence of peroxidases, oxidases and other enzymes associated with it. In addition, the cell wall contains high levels of Ca2+ and other ions, and is kept at a significantly lower pH compared with that of the cytosol providing a unique chemical environment for signals to move within. However, many plant cells are connected by plasmodesmata (PD), which provide a more direct route for cell-to-cell communication. PD provide a symplastic connection for the transfer of ions, metabolites, hormones, proteins, RNAs and other molecules. Although animal cells have an extracellular matrix and cytoplasmic connections such as gap junctions, the plant cell wall and PD connections are structurally very different and represent plant-specific features that can impact rapid information transfer between cells.THE IMPACT OF PD ON RAPID SYSTEMIC SIGNALING Plasmodesmata have pore sizes of 20–50 nm, which represent highly regulated cellular transport points. Size exclusion limits of PD are typically measured between ~30 kDa (Imlau et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2005) and ~60–70 kDa (Rim et al., 2011), but are known to vary between cell types, their developmental status and especially in response to environmental stimuli. Even macromolecules such as large proteins can move through PDs to control developmental programs. For example, the Arabidopsis transcription factor SHORTROOT (SHR) is translocated from cells of the stele and the quiescent center to the endodermis via a PD-mediated route (Vaten et al., 2011), resulting in activation of another transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR; Helariutta et al., 2000; Nakajima et al., 2001). In the endodermis, SCR subsequently induces the expression of microRNAs 165 and 166, which are then translocated from the endodermis to pith tissues in the stele through PDs. In the pith, these microRNAs trigger a transcriptional cascade that establishes proper development of pericycle, protoxlem and metaxylem cells (Carlsbecker et al., 2010; Miyashima et al., 2011). Similarly, in the shoot apical meristem of maize, the KNOTTED1 transcriptional regulator is expressed in the L2 layer, but moves to the L1 layer through PDs via a chaperone-dependent mechanism in order to maintain stem cell homeostasis (Lucas et al., 1995; Xu et al., 2011). KNOTTED1 also increases the size exclusion limit of PD to facilitate its own motility. Indeed, PD conductivity can be regulated by an array of different factors (Figure 2; Lucas, 1995; Tilsner et al., 2016). For example, the size exclusion limit for PDs appears to be tightly regulated by callose deposition, and synthesis of this polymer responds to various stress conditions, such as wounding and pathogen attack (Samuels et al., 1995; Parre and Geitmann, 2005; Chen and Kim, 2009). In Arabidopsis, callose synthases are encoded by a 12-member gene family, with CALLOSE SYNTHASE 3 being localized on plasma membranes (PMs) and involved in depositing callose into cell wall (Vaten et al., 2011). As observed by electron microscopy, callose can accumulate in the cell wall surrounding the PD (Vaten et al., 2011). The accumulation of callose in this region is thought to constrict the size of the PD, and thereby restrict or block intercellular movement through the symplast. PDs are known to be enriched in specific proteins (Fernandez-Calvino et al., 2011) and lipids that likely lead to the recruitment of a host of regulators, making these structures exquisitely responsive to their cellular environment. For example, PDs show accumulation of sterols and sphinogolipids that could play a role in defining novel membrane microdomains. Indeed, this novel lipid environment has been proposed to be linked to regulating cell-to-cell connectivity of the PD as well as regulating their callose modifying enzyme activity (Grison et al., 2015). The symplastic movement of small molecules such as cytokinin, salicylic acid, auxin and gibberellic acid appear to be highly dependent on PD permeability (Kwiatkowska, 1991; Kwiatkowska and Malinowski, 1995; Bishopp et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014; Lee, 2015). Thus, both small and large signaling molecules can use the PD as a means to travel systemically from cell to cell, although we are still far from fully understanding the extent to which movement of these kinds of molecules via PDs contributes to systemic response throughout the plant.PD, THE APOPLAST AND TRIO-DRIVEN SYSTEMIC SIGNAL PROPAGATION In the context of rapid cell-to-cell, long-distance signaling mechanisms that mediate SAA in plants (Mittler et al., 2011; Gilroy et al., 2016), it is still unclear what role PD play in the propagation of ROS, Ca2+ and electric signals (Figure 2). There are three potential paths for the propagation of these signals from cell to cell. The first is independent of the PD, and might occur directly across cell walls that separate neighboring cells (Figure 2; ‘apoplastic through cell wall’). The second is via symplastic connections provided by PD, either through the cytosolic cavity, or traversing the endoplasmic reticum (ER) membranes that permeate the PD. The third might occur along the outer surface of the PD between the PM and surrounding cell wall (‘apoplastic not through cell wall’). While there are analogous mechanisms for cell-cell communication in animal cells (e.g. gap junctions provide a cytoplasmic connection between adjacent cells as do PD, although it is important to note that at a structural level, gap junctions and PDs are very different; Figure 2), an important difference is the potential enhancing or buffering influence of the plant cell wall. For the rapid systemic auto-propagating ROS wave, genetic evidence indicates a requirement for the respiratory burst homolog (RBOH) protein RBOHD (Miller et al., 2009; Mittler et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2016). The propagation rate of this ROS-related system ranges from ~400 to 1400 μm sec−1 depending on the type of stress and the type of tissues receiving stress. For example, a salt-stress-triggered apoplastic ROS wave moved through the root at ~400 μm sec−1, whereas wound-induced activation of the ROS system moved in the aerial parts of the plant in excess of 1000 μm sec−1. These speeds were calculated from measuring the timing of either the systemic appearance of ROS in the apoplast (salt stress; Evans et al., 2016) or activation of a very rapid (20 sec transcript accumulation response time; Suzuki et al., 2015) transcriptional reporter (ZAT12pro:LUC) shown to require ROS changes for its systemic induction (wounding; Miller et al., 2009). The current model is that a ROS burst triggers neighboring RBOHs to make another ROS burst, thereby providing a mechanism for a ROS-induced ROS propagation along the surface of the PM. However, in moving this ROS wave from one cell to the next, it is not clear how the wave propagates across the distance that separates neighboring cells. Cell walls represent a significant barrier, not only because of the distance created between cells, but also because the apoplast can provide a high antioxidative capacity that can quench a ROS signal. However, quenching can also be a factor in ROS diffusing through a symplastic connection. Thus, one model for propagating a ROS signal to the next cell is to simply continue the RBOH-mediated ROS-induced ROS burst along the continuum of PM that spans the PD. However, RBOHD has not been observed as a prominent protein in the Arabidopsis plasmodesmal proteome, making it unclear if this simple model is correct (Fernandez-Calvino et al., 2011). Regardless of the specific pathway, isolated plasmodesmal fractions appear to contain a range of ROS-processing enzymes such as peroxidases that would likely regulate ROS dynamics, either on the surface of the PD, or within the symplastic connection (Fernandez-Calvino et al., 2011). An alternative model for propagating the ROS wave from cell to cell is that a different signaling molecule is used as a relay to traverse the symplastic or apoplastic connections. For example, the Ca2+ transients observed in the context of long-distance signaling are assisted by RBOHD-generated ROS (Evans et al., 2016), and vice versa, with Ca2+ signals being implicated in activating RBOHD to generate ROS (Figure 1; Dubiella et al., 2013; Kadota et al., 2015). Because the mobility of Ca2+ in the wall is highly restricted, for example by Ca2+ interactions with free carboxylic groups of pectins, it is generally thought that Ca2+ waves propagate between cells via symplastic connections provided by PD. Indeed, cytosolically targeted Ca2+ imaging bioprobes were instrumental in initially discovering this Ca2+ wave system (Choi et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2014; Kiep et al., 2015). However, it is not clear if the source of Ca2+ is from influx pathways associated with the PM or ER membranes that traverse the PD, or a simple diffusion of Ca2+ through the cytoplasmic cavity. Nevertheless, modeling suggests a simple cytosolic diffusion-based PD transit cannot support the speed of Ca2+ wave propagation seen in vivo (Evans et al., 2016). Thus, the Ca2+ wave propagation through PDs is likely to involve regulation of Ca2+ channels associated with either the PM or ER (Gilroy et al., 2016). A third alternative is the propagation of an electrical signal along the PM connection through the PD. Mechanisms based on, for example, the gating of voltage-sensitive Ca2+-permeable channels could then initiate Ca2+-coupled ROS-response pathways, linking the Ca2+, ROS and electrical signaling into a single interconnected network. In addition, it is possible that electric waves could jump between cells using a different mechanism that does not utilize PD (Gilroy et al., 2016). Further research is needed to address this and all other questions outlined above.CELL TYPE SPECIFICITY AND SIGNAL PROPAGATION In addition to the currently open question as to the precise route that transfers rapid systemic signals between adjacent plant cells, understanding the role that the plant cell types or tissues play in mediating these systemic signals also holds promise to help reveal mechanism and function. Thus, while the ROS wave was detected in the apoplast of epidermal cells (Miller et al., 2009), rapid systemic signaling in response to abiotic stress also occurs via the phloem tissue and its companion cells (reviewed in Gilroy et al., 2014; Hedrich et al., 2016). In addition, rapidly propagating signals could also be transferred via parenchyma and other cell types, with, for example, the rapid Ca2+ wave triggered by local salt treatment preferentially propagating through the cortex and endodermal cell layers in the root (Choi et al., 2014). What makes each of these tissues uniquely suited to carry specific stress-related systemic signals remains unknown. From the standpoint of number, size and PD characteristics, phloem tissue, companion cells and the epidermis contain a high number of cellular connections and could be a good pathway for the transfer of different systemic signals that propagate through both the apoplast and PD. Moreover, the transport of coupled signals such as ROS and Ca2+ waves (Gilroy et al., 2014, 2016), Ca2+ and electric signals (Mousavi et al., 2013), and/or ROS and electric signals (Suzuki et al., 2013) suggests that many of these signals use the same tissues and cell types as a conduit, and are not mediated via spatially separated routes. Future studies utilizing more sensitive and specific imaging tools for the ROS, Ca2+ and perhaps even electric signals should help resolve these important questions.WHEN A TRIO IS MORE THAN A TRIO: OTHER SIGNALS IN THE APOPLAST In addition to ROS signals, the apoplast is also a conduit for systemic changes in extracellular pH and exhibits changes in electrical signals that result from ion flow across the membranes of underlying cells, such as seen in response to mycorrhizal fungus and to wounding (Felle et al., 2009; Zimmermann et al., 2009; Mousavi et al., 2013). Thus, rapid acidification of the apoplast in response to inoculation of the roots with chlamydospores of the mycorrhizal fungus Piriformospora indica was observed in the root elongation zone within seconds to minutes in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). However, surface pH also subsequently decreased by 1 unit in the shootward systemic leaves, suggesting activation of the H+-ATPase at the PM both in local and systemic tissues in response to biotic stress (Felle et al., 2009). The systemic signal in this case would be moving at several hundred μm sec−1. Similarly, salt stress to the root system triggers a systemic apoplastic pH increase in the leaves in maize (Geilfus et al., 2015). These observations raise the question of whether H+ ions exported from the cytosol to the apoplast are themselves transmitted to systemic tissues or, perhaps more likely, is some other signal, such as a propagating electrical wave to activate PM-localized H+-ATPases to acidify the apoplast at distal locations? To answer these questions, measurement of the apoplast pH changes in local and systemic tissues with pH biosensors such as pHusion (Gjetting et al., 2012) or wall targeted pHuji (Shen et al., 2014) should shed light on how the surface pH changes when plants perceive biotic or abiotic stress. Importantly, it is unknown whether these pH changes themselves convey information, or if they are simply occurring as a consequence of changes in the activity of the PM-localized H+-ATPase that is altering other features of the cell such as cytosolic pH or membrane potential. Long-distance electrical signals monitored, for example, as surface potential changes have been detected with propagation speeds ranging from 100 sec to >1000 μm sec−1 (reviewed in Choi et al., 2016). This variability in speeds may well relate to the type of stress triggering the signaling events (e.g. wounding versus salt stress), the site of local stress perception (e.g. root versus leaf) and the cell types through which the signal propagates (e.g. parenchyma versus vasculature). In Fava bean and barley leaves, similar to the apoplastic systemic pH changes, wounding stress triggered electrical signals that were initially detected in the local wounded leaf, and displayed a long-distance systemic movement at a rate of 800–1600 μm sec−1 (Zimmermann et al., 2009). These wound-induced systemic electrical signals are also thought to be controlled by activating PM-localized H+-ATPases, indicating a possible association of the extracellular systemic pH and the apoplastic long-distance electrical signals. In Arabidopsis leaves, wounding-associated long-distance electrical signals are also detectable using surface potential monitoring electrodes (Mousavi et al., 2013). This long-distance wounding-associated electrical wave traverses the plant at the rate of 1000 μm sec−1 and is dependent on clade III glutamate receptor-like channels (GLR3.3 and 3.6). These GLR-mediated long-range electrical signals appear to play key roles in regulating defense-related gene expression markers, such as JAZ7 and JAZ10, as well as accumulation of biologically active jasmonate isoleucine (JA-Ile; Mousavi et al., 2013). Indeed, the GLR family has also been implicated in modulating features of electrical signaling in the phloem’s symplastic route for systemic signal propagation, with roles in both propagating and limiting the spread of the signal (Hedrich et al., 2016). Because the apoplast is the compartment directly facing the plant’s environment, regulating, the composition of this apoplastic space provides a first layer of defense against pathogen attacks and other environmental stresses (Delaunois et al., 2014). Therefore, it has been long speculated that apoplastic macromolecules such as proteins and oligosaccharides are likely involved in sensing initial environmental interactions and potentially generating or sustaining long-distance signaling. The dynamic nature of cell wall peptide signals is highlighted by the work of Hafidh et al. (2016) who demonstrated that tobacco pollen tubes secrete >800 proteins during pollen tube growth. Major classes of secreted proteins were <20 kDa and played critical roles in guiding male pollen tubes to female ovules to facilitate fertilization. This secretome analysis during pollen tube growth hints at the wealth of macromolecules that are dynamically released to the apoplast. These apoplastic peptides can function not only as important developmental regulators, but mechanistic analysis of the small secreted peptide RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR shows that these kinds of regulators could also conceivably play roles in systemic signaling. Thus, RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR and its cognate receptor-like kinase FERONIA likely relay information about the status of the cell wall (Shih et al., 2014) and modulate both Ca2+ and H+ dynamics (Haruta et al., 2008, 2014). However, whether such signals are contributing to modulating systemic signaling or potentially even move in a systemic manner themselves remains to be fully defined.INTEGRATING SYSTEMIC SIGNALING As noted above, many messengers have been described to carry information between cells to generate systemic biological responses, including electric signals, RNA molecules, peptides and proteins, phytohormones, ionic changes and ROS (Choi et al., 2016; Gilroy et al., 2016; Hedrich et al., 2016; Tilsner et al., 2016). Given the identification of azelaic acid (Jung et al., 2009) and glycerol-3-phosphate (Chanda et al., 2011) as novel, rapidly accumulating, mobile signals likely involved in SAR in recent years, it is likely that there are many currently unidentified plant messengers to be discovered. However, compared with ‘slow’ mobile messengers, such as jasmonic and salicylic acids that take several minutes to accumulate and then induce SAR within several hours (Truman et al., 2007), the propagation rate of ROS and Ca2+ waves as well as electric signaling is rapid, ranging from ~100 to >1000 μm sec−1 (Choi et al., 2016). It is possible that Ca2+, ROS and electrical signals all function together as a rapid systemic signal carrying specific information about a local stress to distal parts of the plant (Miller et al., 2009; Mousavi et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2016). Such specific information would allow the plant to elicit highly focused responses to prepare against further challenges associated with a particular stress (Conrath et al., 2015). For example, the rapid ROS-mediated activation of SAA in the Arabidopsis localized high light stress response protects distal naive rosette or cauline leaves against a subsequent light stress treatment that would have otherwise been lethal (Miller et al., 2009; Szechynska-Hebda et al., 2010; Suzuki et al., 2013). The specificity of the systemic signal is dependent on the ability of that signal to elicit responses in unaffected tissue to protect or defend the plant from a second occurrence of that same or tightly associated stress (e.g. salinity or drought both share osmotic stress facets). In some cases, however, cross-protection is also seen, in which one type of locally applied stress is capable of generating a protective response or acclimation to another type of biotic or abiotic stress (Traw et al., 2007; Perez and Brown, 2014). These types of experiments indicate that a significant degree of overlap exists between systemic signaling events and the mechanisms that respond to it. Yet, in other instances different local stimuli such as heat stress, high light and wounding stress induce distinct stress-specific SAAs that share little overlap in expression of transcripts and metabolites, resulting in very limited to no cross-protection (Suzuki et al., 2013). These observations of stress-specific SAAs support the hypothesis that a general non-specific signal is produced and then exported from the local tissue that functions to prime SAA or SAR, but that this initial local signal is not sufficient to protect the systemic tissue from the specific subsequent stress (Figure 3). The fact that ROS and Ca2+ waves and electrical signals appear in response to many different stimuli suggests that either stimulus-specific signals are encoded within the spatial and temporal dynamics of these waves, or that they may be acting as an initial, general priming signal, preparing the plant to respond in a more selective way to subsequent, stimulus-specific signals. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Model of possible propagation of general and stress-specific systemic signals. Local stress stimuli triggers changes in membrane potentials, increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] and activation of RBOHD-mediated oxidative burst leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, i.e. trio signaling. The association between the signals generates a wave that rapidly spreads throughout the plant in an auto-propagating manner, traversing through the apoplast outside the cell and/or symplastically through PD. This initial signaling wave acts as a priming signal, which is required, but not sufficient for systemic acquired acclimation (SAA). The priming wave activates the core environmental stress response genes (CESRs). Following the general signaling wave, depending on the type of stress, a second wave of systemic stress-specific systemic signaling starts, activating stress-specific genes and cellular mechanisms that facilitate SAA against the same type of stress that triggered the initial response. APX2, ascorbate peroxidase; GLR, GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE channels; JA, jasmonic acid; AsA, ascorbic acid; RBOHD, respiratory burst oxidative homolog D; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; HL, high light; HSR, heat stress response; HS, heat stress; WSR, wounding stress response; HLSR, high light stress response; ABA, abscisic acid; MBF1c, multiprotein bridging factor 1c, PD, plasmodesmata.From an evolutionary point of view, sending a general stress message to all parts of the plant may be an efficient means to rapidly prepare all of its tissues for the upcoming challenges and increase its survival chances. As it can often take several hours for pathogens to spread from an infected tissue to healthy tissue, or for damages caused by environmental changes to reach a critical point of massive tissue disruption, there would be enough time for a slower more specific signal to develop and move to distal parts of the plant that are already primed to facilitate stronger stress-specific resistance or acclimation response. A possible mechanism of signal propagation based on the interaction of the trio of messengers (Ca2+, ROS and electrical signals) is outlined in Figure 3, where changes in these messengers act to propagate a priming signal, with stimulus-specific information being encoded in another downstream signal transduction system operating in parallel. However, the idea of an initial priming wave of ROS, Ca2+ and electric signals, which is followed by stimulus-specific messengers, raises several questions that pose future challenges. (i) How are the ROS, Ca2+ and electrical signals integrated to provide a general priming signal and how could this general message be perceived in target tissues? (ii) What is the relationship between the general systemic signal and the following specific signals? Are they dependent or independent? (iii) What triggers the accumulation of the specific secondary message in the systemic tissue? (iv) How would a general priming signal prepare the systemic tissues for an improved subsequent specific response? The ROS-responsive transcription factor ZAT12 is one of the best-known markers for transcript-level systemic activation and may provide clues as to what a general priming mechanism may look like. ZAT12 transcription is activated by ROS (Davletova et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2009; Suzuki et al., 2015) and by the Ca2+ wave (Choi et al., 2014) within 20–60 sec of stress perception (Suzuki et al., 2015). ZAT12 is also part of a cluster of Arabidopsis early-inducing genes commonly responsive to a wide range of abiotic stresses. Indeed, this grouping was classified as containing plant general response genes and core environmental stress response components (CESR; Ma and Bohnert, 2007; Hahn et al., 2013). These genes may represent the frontline of general systemic response to the initial priming signal common to most abiotic stresses. It can therefore be postulated that CESR genes are also likely targets for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory/signaling components that are activated by ROS/redox changes induced by the NADPH oxidase (RBOH) family. NADPH oxidase-mediated activation cascades are well-described in human growth hormone-induced oxidative signaling, in which an increase in intracellular concentration of H2O2 switches off redox-responsive phosphatases, driving signal transduction by enabling kinase activity (Finkel, 2011). Similar oxidative-signaling cascades may well be activated by plant RBOHs. Further, ZAT12 is a direct target of transcriptional regulators such as ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (Chang et al., 2013) and CIRCADEAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1; Lai et al., 2012), as well as a host of other regulatory proteins including bZIP29, NAC91 (Ben Daniel et al., 2016) and probably many other unidentified transcriptional regulators. Some of these Zat12 and other CESR gene regulators may act as redox-sensitive proteins that are either directly activated by dithiol-disulfide exchanges between cysteine residues or indirectly by other post-transcription modifications, such as phosphorylation. Such post-translational regulation would provide a pathway to translate the trio of Ca2+/ROS/electrical signals, via its ROS component, to transcriptional regulation of general stress response genes that represent the priming effect in the systemic tissue. A signal-carrying specificity would need to modulate this general priming response system. Clues to this process may again be seen in the ROS responsive network. For example, the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) acts as a heat-stress-specific component of SAA signaling (Suzuki et al., 2013), showing a transient increase in systemic leaves after 10 min of heat stress is applied at a distal site. Yet, ABA accumulation was dependent on ROS production by RBOHD. These findings suggest that the specific signal, in this case ABA, is modulated by the systemic ROS (priming) signal. Thus, we hypothesize that complex synergistic relationships exist between the initial priming signaling wave and stress-specific signals. These interactions may influence one another, governing both the general priming events of systemic response and associated stimulus-specific changes. Such regulatory loops may perhaps help to explain some of the perplexing questions of the rapid systemic signaling system, such as why the ROS or Ca2+ waves are required but not sufficient for the induction of a complete SAA response (Miller et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2014).Acknowledgments The authors apologize to the many research groups whose work is not cited in this review due to space limitation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability, whereas plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have evolved systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that trigger long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with environmental challenges. Here, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library identifies a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously defined wound signal essential for activating plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibits attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncover GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling events in plants. Our findings offer new insights into highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against herbivory and pathogen invasion. Subject terms: Herbivory, Biotic, Wounding",
    "introduction": "Introduction Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian nervous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then activate ion channels, and consequently produce ion flux1, thereby inducing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation for neurotransmission1–4. Plants are characterized by lack of a nervous system but still have the ability to systematically communicate the environmental signals from the site of perception to the distal tissues5. In response to herbivorous insect attack or wounding at local leaves, wound signaling molecules are released at the damaged plant cells, and may bind corresponding receptors to trigger propagation of slow wave potentials (SWPs)6–9, initiate transmission of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt)10–15, and consequently activate biosynthesis of defensive phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA), thereby mediating expression of defense-responsive genes for systemic defense responses in plants7,8,11,12,16–18. Many different types of chemical substances were revealed as neurotransmitters that induce long-distance ionic responses to effectively mediate neurotransmission in mammals4. However, in plant kingdom, only an amino acid and a protein, namely the glutamate (Glu) and the recently discovered “Ricca’s factor” β-THIOGLUCOSIDE GLUCOHYDROLASE (TGG) are so far defined as wound signals that depend on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) protein, the homologous protein of mammalian ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs), to activate systemic plant defense response6,7,11. In this study, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library19 identified a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that highly accumulated Glu, the previously defined molecule crucial for activation of plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibited attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncovered GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance propagation of calcium-based defense signaling events.",
    "methods": "Methods Plant materials and growth condition hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52) was obtained from the rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library in our previous study19,20. pad2-1 was ordered from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC). Seeds of GCaMP3 were from Simon Gilroy (Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin). The GCaMP3/pad2-1 was generated by genetic crosses using standard procedures. GCaMP3/glr3.3 and GCaMP3/glr3.6 mutants were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 in WT plants overexpressing GCaMP3. To generate the transgenic plant expressing 35S::PAD2-6myc/pad2-1 (PAD2/pad2-1), the coding sequence of PAD2 (AT4G23100) was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300, and then transformed into pad2-1. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized with 20% bleach, sown on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. After incubation in the dark at 4 °C for 2 days, plates were cultivated in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a 16 h/8 h light/dark (long day, LD) photoperiod. After 7 days, seedlings were then transplanted into soil and grown under the same condition. For insect feeding and pathogen inoculation assays, plants were grown in soil for 4–5 weeks at 22 °C with a 10 h/14 h light/dark (short day, SD) photoperiod. For real-time calcium imaging assay, plates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 days in the dark and then transferred to 22 °C with a SD photoperiod for 6–7 days. Seedlings were then transferred onto new plates and grown for additional 14–16 days prior to use. Real-time [Ca2+]cyt imaging in the entire plant Transgenic Arabidopsis plants stably expressing GCaMP3 were imaged with a motorized epifluorescence (SZX10, Olympus) stereomicroscope equipped with a 1 × objective lens and a C13440 digital camera (ORCA-Flash4.0 V3, Hamamatsu Photonics). The GFP-based Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3 was excited using mercury lamp (X-Cite 120 Q, Excelitas). The green fluorescent signal was acquired every 2 s with the C13440 camera using Standard imaging software (Olympus). Using ImageJ software, GCaMP3 signals were analyzed overtime at regions of interest (ROI). The equation ΔF/F0 = (F-F0)/F0 was used to calculate the fractional fluorescence changes. F0 denotes the average baseline fluorescence determined by the average of F over the frames of the recording before treatment. The entire leaf area was selected as ROI for Ca2+ signal analysis. Application of amino acids, tripeptides and chemical agents GSH, Glu-Pro-Ala, L-Glu, and sorbitol were dissolved in growth medium [1/2 × MS salts, 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.05% (w/v) MES], which was then adjusted to pH 5.1. 5 μL of the solution was applied to the cut edge of leaf 1 after 30 min recovery period after pre-cutting for assessment of small molecules-induced Ca2+ signal transmission. In contrast, a longer recovery period of 5 h post pre-cutting was required for the assessment of small molecules-activated gene expression levels. GSH at concentrations of 0.001 mM, 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 25 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM, which are within or exceeding its physiological concentrations, were selected for analyzing GSH-triggered systemic calcium-based defense signaling in vitro. GGsTOP (HY-108467, MCE) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with water. LaCl3 was dissolved into 0.05% (v/v) Silwet L-77 in water to make a 50 mM solution and then 10 μL was applied to a piece of Kiwmwipes placed on a petiole for at least 30 min prior to adding GSH. CRISPR/Cas9 vector construction and plant transformation Egg cell-specific promoter-controlled CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to generate glr3.3 and glr3.6 single mutants. CRISPR/Cas9 vector was constructed according to previous studies44. Target sequence was selected by CRISPR-PLANT (https://www.genome.arizona.edu/crispr/). All the vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using electroporation. Arabidopsis plants were transformed using the floral dip methods. The primers used for cloning are shown in Supplementary Data 5. DNA extraction and mutation detection 1–5 mg frozen leaf tissues were used for DNA extraction through SDS method. The extracted genomic DNA was then used as a template to amplify the desired fragments in each of the target genes using primers flanking the target sites. PCR products were directly sequenced using Sanger method to identify mutation. Superimposed sequence chromatograms produced by biallelic and heterozygous mutations were decoded by DSDecode (http://dsdecode.scgene.com/) and manual analyses. Total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR TransZol RNA kit (ET101-01, TransGen Biotech) was used to extract total RNA from Arabidopsis plants according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA in a 20 μL reaction by cDNA Synthesis SuperMix kit (AT311-03, TransGen Biotech). qRT-PCR was performed in QuantStudio 3 realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) using ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Low ROX Premixed) (Q331-02, Vazyme). The 2-ΔΔCt analysis method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of each sample. JA and JA-Ile quantification in leaf tissues Metabolite extraction and quantification of JA and JA-Ile in leaf tissues were performed according to previously described methods using AB Sciex 4500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, MA, USA) equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC™ BEH C18 column (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm)45. d5-JA was added to the extraction solvent (isopropanol: formic acid at 99.5: 0.5, v/v) as internal standard. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was applied in negative mode with mass transitions (precursor ions/product) as followed: 209.12 > 59.01 for JA, 322.20 > 130.09 for JA-Ile, and 214.15 > 62.03 for d5-JA. A 10 min gradient elution program was applied for target compounds separation with 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (A) and pure water (B) as mobile phase with a 200 μL/min flow rate. Then, mass spectra data were processed and calculated using AB SCIEX analyst software (version 1.6.3, AB SCIEX, MA, USA) with calculation curves made with standards. Measurement of endogenous Glu and GSH in Arabidopsis Leaf tissues were collected and directly ground into powder in liquid nitrogen. Then, 100 mg of powder was weighed accurately and transferred into a 2 mL centrifuge tube. 10 µL of stable isotope internal standard (5 µg/mL 13C2-15N-GSH, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added to each sample before extraction. Then, 1.5 mL of extraction buffer (80% methanol with 0.1% formic acid, v/v) was added, with vortexing for sample resuspension. After a 15 min centrifugation at 14000 × g, the supernatants were diluted 10 times, and 100 µL was transferred to sample vials for further detection. Target compounds were detected with a 6500 plus QTrap mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, USA) coupled with a ACQUITY UPLC H-Class system, equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) probe. Extracts were separated by a synergi Hydro-RP column (2.0 × 100 mm, 2.5 μm, phenomenex). A binary solvent system was used, in which mobile phase A consisted of 2 mM Triisobutylamine adjusted with 5 mM acetic acid in 100% water, and mobile phase B of 100% methanol. An 8 min gradient with flow rate of 500 μL/min was used as follows: 0–1.0 min at 2% B; 1.0-6 min, 5–40% B; 6–7 min, 98% B; 7.1-8 min, 2% B. Column chamber and sample tray were held at 35 °C and 10 °C, respectively. Data were acquired in multiple reaction monitor (MRM) mode with mass transitions (precursor ions/product) as followed: 308.1 > 179.1 for GSH, 147.9 > 83.9 for Glu and 311.0 > 181.9 for 13C2-15N-GSH. The nebulizer gas (Gas1), heater gas (Gas2), and curtain gas were set at 55, 55, and 35 psi, respectively. The ion spray voltage was 4500 V in positive mode. The optimal probe temperature was determined to be 500 °C. Calibration curves of Glu and GSH were made with standards, and the concentration of GSH was calculated by internal-standard method with 13C2-15N-GSH as internal standard, while the concentration of Glu was calculated by external-standard method. The SCIEX OS software (version 1.6, AB SCIEX, MA, USA) was applied for metabolite identification and concentration calculation. Insect feeding assay with Spodoptera exigua S. exigua larvae (2nd instar) were purchased from Jiyuan Baiyun Industry Co., Ltd (China). For feeding assays, 2nd instar S. exigua larvae were first underwent 24 h of starvation treatment in growth chamber and were then gently placed on 5 week-old plants. Two S. exigua larvae were placed on a plant. Larval weights were measured 7 days after feeding. Representative S. exigua larvae recovered from corresponding plants were killed by 75% ethanol solution and photographed by stereomicroscope (SZX10, Olympus) equipped with a 0.75 × objective lens and a digital camera (SC180, Olympus). Botrytis cinerea infection assay Conidiospores were collected from B. cinerea (B0510) plates and diluted to ~1 × 106 conidiospores/mL in PDB medium (Potato Dextrose Broth, BD). For drop-inoculation assay, 5 μL B. cinerea spores was dropped on the center of each detached leaf. Subsequently the detached leaves were placed in dark with high humidity for 2–3 days. Phenotypes were imaged with a digital camera and the lesion sizes were measured using Digimizer software (v3.1.2.0, Belgium, Germany). For spray-inoculation assay, 4 week-old soil-grown seedlings were sprayed evenly with B. cinerea conidiospores and kept in high humidity for 2–3 days. The disease severity was classified into four grades: healthy (H, green), light symptoms (L, pale green), severe symptoms (S, orange-yellow), or completely dead (D, red). PDB buffer served as mock in these infection assays. As described in previous studies45–47, the assessment of B. cinerea biomass was determined by real-time PCR quantification of the fungal CUTINASE signal (Z69264) in relation to Arabidopsis ACTIN2. RNA sequencing and data analysis RNA integrity was checked using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Low-quality reads were removed from the raw reads using Cutadapt48 and Trimmomatic49 software to get clean reads. Clean reads were mapped to the corresponding reference genome using HISAT2 software50. Gene expression levels and read count of each gene were calculated using StringTie software51. The R package DEseq2 (v1.16.1) was used to identify the differentially expressed genes based on the following criteria: padj < 0.05 and |log2FoldChange | > 152. Venn diagramming, GO enrichment analysis was performed using TBtools (v2.007)53. Structure prediction and molecular docking The ab initio structure predictions of AtGLR3.3 protein were implemented by RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold 2 through ColabFold54–56. The homology modelling of AtGLR3.3 was conducted using SWISS-MODEL with AtGLR3.4 crystallography model (7lzh) template30,57. Ligand mol2 files of GSH and Glu were generated by Avogadro 1.2.058. Prepdock website (https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/servers/html/prepdock.html) and AutoDockTools 1.5.7 software were used for adding hydrogens and symmetry related waters, computing Gasteiger charges, and detecting torsion root59. Molecular dockings were performed on AutoDock Vina 1.2.0 software and CB-DOCK2 website60,61. For AutoDock Vina, the grid box was setting up with a range spacing of 0.897 Å, number of points in x, y and z dimensions as 52, 54, and 70 respectively and center grid box for x, y and z as 173.571, 198.031, and 203.573 respectively for the ATD of AtGLR3.3. Docking of LBD was conducted with 0.756 Å in range spacing. The number of points in x, y and z dimensions was 60, 56, and 78. The center grid box was 172.151, 160.102, and 157.178 in xyz-coordinates. The results were visualized and the polar contacts between ligands and their receptor were detected on PyMOL 2.5.8 software. Hydrogen bonds were determined on UCSF ChimeraX 1.7.1 software with distance tolerance of 0.400 Å and angle tolerance of 20.000°62. Statistical analysis All data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0, SPSS, and R software and presented by Adobe Illustrator. Means and deviations were reported in the Figures and the corresponding figure legends.

    "results": "Results Identification of GSH as a signaling molecule that activates long-distance plant defense signaling events During the genetic screening of the rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library19,20 for mutants with altered defense response to a disastrous plant fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea), we identified a mutant, termed hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52), which exhibited obvious susceptibility to B. cinerea infection (Supplementary Fig. 1). A single gene AT4G23100 was identified with PCR analysis on the mutant genomic DNA19,20. To further verify that the decreased resistance in the hr-52 mutant is caused by the interference with AT4G23100 gene, we obtained the previously reported mutant pad2-1 with the Ser298Asn substitution (S298N) within AT4G2310021 to assess its responses to B. cinerea infection and insect attack. The results showed that pad2-1 exhibited severe susceptibility to B. cinerea and Spodoptera exigua, a globally agricultural pest, while genetic transformation of pad2-1 with PAD2 (AT4G23100) completely restored the resistance (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Our results together with the previous findings21–23 demonstrate that AT4G23100 gene is essential for plant defense response against B. cinerea infection and insect attack. It was known that the AT4G23100 gene encodes the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalyzing the reaction between Glu and cysteine for generation of glutamylcysteine in the GSH biosynthesis pathway24. We found that a high level of Glu (875.42 μg/g FW) was accumulated in the pad2-1 mutant compared to WT (494.96 μg/g FW) while the GSH content in pad2-1 (4.91 μg/g FW) was severely decreased to 5.9% of WT (82.94 μg/g FW) (Fig. 1a, b). It is surprising that such a high level of Glu failed to induce plant defense in pad2-1 (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3), which seems to be inconsistent with the previously defined role of Glu as a critical wound signal that activates plant defense response11. The observed susceptibility in the GSH-deficient pad2-1 mutant suggests an indispensable role for GSH in plant defense, which encourages us to further investigate whether GSH acts as wound signal to trigger long distance calcium-based defense signaling events. Fig. 1. Defense signaling events are attenuated in GSH-deficient pad2-1 mutant plant. Open in a new tab a, b Contents of GSH (a) and Glu (b) in Col-0, pad2-1, PAD2/pad2-1#1 and PAD2/pad2-1#3 plants.

Statistical significance was determined by two-sided Welch’s t-test. i Percentage of cases with [Ca2+]cyt transmission for each systemic leaf in GCaMP3 and GCaMP3/pad2-1 plants wounded at leaf 1. 16 GCaMP3 and 17 GCaMP3/pad2-1 plants were subjected to observation of [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence and only systemic leaf showing obvious [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence was calculated as a case with [Ca2+]cyt transmission. Statistical significances compared to GCaMP3 was assessed using Fisher’s exact test, indicated as follows: *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, n.s. denotes not significant. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To verify the role of GSH in activating long-distance plant defense signaling events, we wounded leaf 1 of pad2-1 and Col-0, and then measured the accumulation of wound-induced plant defensive hormonal molecules in leaf 6, considering that leaf n shares direct vascular connections with leaves n ± 5 and n ± 8 while leaves n ± 3 may represent contact parastichies formed by proximal but unconnected vasculature in adult Arabidopsis rosettes7,25. Consistent with the reduced plant resistance in pad2-1, the defensive phytohormone jasmonates were obviously decreased in the leaf 6 of pad2-1 to ~63.04% (for JA) and ~45.81% (for JA-Ile) of those in Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1c, d). Moreover, the expression of JA-inducible defense marker genes OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ7 was also significantly attenuated in leaf 6 of pad2-1 compared to Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1e). These results suggest that GSH might serve as a critical signaling molecule essential for activation of plant systemic defense signaling events. To further explore the underlying mechanism of GSH in activating systemic plant defense responses, we introduced the [Ca2+]cyt reporter GCaMP3 into pad2-1, generating GCaMP3/pad2-1 plant, to investigate whether the GSH-deficient mutant attenuated the wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission. Upon mechanical wounding of leaf 1, both amplitude and kinetics of [Ca2+]cyt propagation in leaf 6 were reduced in GCaMP3/pad2-1 compared with GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 1f, g; Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). The peak value of [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence changes in leaf 6 of GCaMP3/pad2-1 was reduced to ~44.15% of that in GCaMP3 (Fig. 1h). Consistently, the percentage of each systemic leaf that showed apparent increased [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence was reduced in GCaMP3/pad2-1 (Fig. 1i). These data reinforce the role of GSH in triggering the wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation in plants. Taken together, the above-mentioned data suggest that GSH might serve as an important wound signal that triggers wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission, activates JA biosynthesis, and regulates plant defense responses. GSH triggers long-distance [Ca2+]cyt transmission To further validate that GSH acts as a wound signal triggering long-distance plant defense signaling events, we applied GSH (with Glu and sorbitol as positive and negative controls, respectively) to leaf 1 of the GCaMP3 plants and visualized the systemic [Ca2+]cyt in the whole seedlings (Fig. 2a, b). Intriguingly, the fast and transient increase of [Ca2+]cyt was notably triggered in systemic leaves (including leaf 3, 4, and 6) by GSH (Supplementary Movie 3) at the level comparable to that induced by Glu (Fig. 2a). Specifically, [Ca2+]cyt rapidly increased to the peak value in leaf 6 at ~230 s upon treatment on leaf 1 with GSH rather than sorbitol (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 4), and more distal leaves showed [Ca2+]cyt propagation with the increased GSH concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was dramatically repressed by pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with the Ca2+ channel inhibitor LaCl3 (Fig. 2e-g). To exclude the possibility that GSH is cleaved by enzymes to release glutamate for Ca²⁺ signal propagation, we employed GGsTop, a well-known chemical inhibitor that specifically targets gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), the enzyme responsible for converting GSH to Glu26. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in the Ca²⁺ signaling response when GSH was used in combination with GGsTop compared to that of GSH treatment alone (Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that GSH was not converted to Glu for activation of systemic Ca2+ signaling. Additionally, we synthesized another tripeptide (Glu-Pro-Ala), which contains glutamate along with two different amino acids, and investigated its effects in triggering systemic Ca2+ signal propagation in plants. Unlike GSH treatment, application of Glu-Pro-Ala failed to induce long-distance transmission of Ca²⁺ signal in plants (Supplementary Fig. 7), reinforcing the role of GSH as a signaling molecule that effectively triggers systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation in plants.

Data are mean ± SD (n = 5 for g, n = 3 for h). Statistical significance was determined by two-sided Welch’s t-test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Consistently, GSH application on leaf 1 significantly induced the expression of defense-responsive genes (OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ10) in leaf 6 (by ~5.6, ~8.6 and ~5.7 folds), which is comparable to that induced by Glu (Fig. 2d). Moreover, pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with LaCl3 severely reduced the GSH-inducible expression of defense genes in systemic leaves (Fig. 2h), verifying that propagation of [Ca2+]cyt is required for GSH-induced defense gene expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GSH acts as an important wound signal in triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling. GSH activates the transcriptional expression of defense-related genes in plant systemic leaves To get deeper insights into the GSH-triggered systemic defense signaling events in plants, we performed transcriptome profiling on leaf 6 collected after 1 h application of GSH to leaf 1 of WT plants. We identified 378 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the systemic leaf of GSH-treated plants compared to non-stimulated mock control plants (Supplementary Data 1). Among them, 354 genes including a large number of key defense-responsive genes were upregulated while 24 genes were downregulated (Fig. 3a), which is well consistent with the tendency of transcriptome data from plants in response to wounding, namely, more transcripts are upregulated than downregulated27,28. Gene Ontology analysis (GO) of these DEGs further revealed significant enrichment of terms associated with plant defense signaling, including defense response, cellular responses to JA, response to wounding, and response to hormone (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Data 2). Consistent with the transcriptome analysis, qRT-PCR also showed that expression of defense marker genes (CYP94C1, JAZ13, LOX4, OPR3, JAZ5, JAZ7, and JAZ10) was highly induced in the systemic leaf tissues of GSH-treated plants (Fig. 3c, d; Supplementary Fig. 8). These data provide an overview of the GSH-induced gene expression in plant systemic leaf tissues and further indicate the important role of GSH in triggering plant long-distance defense signaling.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further investigate the relations between GSH and Glu in plant wound response, we generated transcriptome data sets from leaf 6 1 h after wounding leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 3) or application of Glu to leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 4), and then compared these data to that induced by GSH. This comparison showed that 207 DEGs were co-regulated by wounding and GSH treatment, while 228 DEGs were found in both GSH and Glu treatment groups. Moreover, a total of 267 DEGs from GSH- and Glu-treated groups existed in wounding treatment, among which 126 genes were co-regulated by GSH, Glu and wounding, 81 genes were only regulated by GSH and wounding, and 60 genes were only regulated by Glu and wounding (Fig. 3e). These overlapped genes which are co-regulated by GSH, Glu, and wounding or independently regulated by GSH and wounding, Glu and wounding are all mainly involved in plant defense signaling, including plant response to wounding, stress, JA, and biotic stimulus, regulation of cell communication, and innate immune response, suggesting that GSH and Glu are involved in wound-induced plant systemic defense response. GLR3.3 is required for GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation GLR proteins which generally contain an amino-terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain (TMD), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), have broad agonist profiles including glycine, cysteine, methionine, Glu and GSH29–32. Specially, Glu-triggered long-distance [Ca2+]cyt propagation is dramatically inhibited in glr3.3glr3.6 mutant11. To figure out whether GSH-triggered long-distance calcium signaling depends on GLR3.3 and GLR3.6, we compared the GSH-triggered Ca2+-related signaling events among the glr3.3, glr3.6 and WT plants containing the GCaMP3 reporter (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Fig. 9). Interestingly, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was severely reduced in the GCaMP3/glr3.3 (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Movie 4). However, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was not markedly attenuated in GCaMP3/glr3.6, which is similar to that of GCaMP3 plant (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Movie 5). Consistently, the GSH-inducible expression of defense marker gene OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ10 was significantly repressed in the GCaMP3/glr3.3, but not obviously inhibited in the GCaMP3/glr3.6 and the GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 4c). These results suggest that GLR3.3 plays a dominant role in regulating GSH-induced [Ca2+]cyt propagation. Similar to the systemic calcium signal transmission upon GSH treatment, Glu-induced [Ca2+]cyt propagation in systemic leaves were strongly inhibited in GCaMP3/glr3.3 while remained unaffected in GCaMP3/glr3.6 (Supplementary Fig. 10), confirming that Glu-induced long-distance calcium wave is also dependent on GLR3.38,11.

GCaMP3 data from Fig. 2c are reproduced (gray lines) to aid in comparison. Data are mean ± SD (n = 5, 9, 9 for GCaMP3/glr3.3, GCaMP3/glr3.6, GCaMP3 in (b), n = 3 for (c)). Statistical significance was determined by two-sided Welch’s t-test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To characterize the interaction between GLR3.3 and GSH, the predicted structure of GLR3.3 was used to perform molecular docking. The binding model showed that Glu binds to the LBD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3LBD) (Supplementary Fig. 11), which is consistent with the recent report about the Glu binding to the GLR3.3LBD29. While GSH was predicted to bind the ATD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3ATD), which is remarkably different from Glu in terms of binding domains and contacting amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 11). Consistent with the predicted interaction between GLR3.3ATD and GSH (Supplementary Fig. 11), recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data revealed that GSH binds the ATD of GLR3.430, another GLR protein with high sequence similarity to GLR3.3, reinforcing that GSH might bind the ATD domain of GLR3.3 for activation of ion channel. Together with the genetic evidence showing GLR3.3 is required for both GSH- and Glu-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 10), these results collectively suggest that GSH and Glu may bind to different domains of GLR3.3 for activating ion channel activity and triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling. Taken together, our results shown in Figs. 1–4 suggest that GSH serves as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance propagation of [Ca2+]cyt waves in a GLR3.3-dependent manner, thus inducing rapid JA biosynthesis in systemic leaf organs to protect plants from herbivory ahead of time.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Initiation of a rapid defense against biotic attacks and mechanical damages is crucial for plant survival in changing environment. Due to lack of a nervous system, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to systemically deliver the wound signal from the site of injured organs to the distal undamaged tissues, which helps them be well-prepared for upcoming dangers33. In this study, we find that the GSH-deficient mutant, in spite of the highly accumulated Glu previously defined as a critical wound signal essential for activating plant defense events, showed impaired plant defense signaling events (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. 1-3). We further define GSH as a critical wound signal that depends on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling in plants (Figs. 2–4; Supplementary Figs. 5-11). Intriguingly, in the animal nervous system, GSH has been identified as a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter34–36, suggesting a potential conceptual parallel in GSH-mediated signal transmission across different kingdoms of life. Moreover, we noticed that GSH and Glu induced distinct [Ca2+]cyt transmission patterns in systemic leaves. Specifically, the spread of systemic [Ca2+]cyt triggered by GSH is preferentially initiated from marginal veins and rapidly transmitted to the mid veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 6), whereas Glu mediated [Ca2+]cyt transmission mainly propagated from mid veins to marginal veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 7). Re-examination of the data shown in the previous study revealing Glu as a wound signal also supports our observation that Glu triggers [Ca2+]cyt transmission with the direction of mid-to-marginal veins11. Intriguingly, the transmission pattern of wounding-induced [Ca2+]cyt contained both directions of the mid-to-marginal veins and the marginal-to-mid veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 8). Future work to elucidate the mechanisms and biological significance of different [Ca2+]cyt transmission patterns induced by GSH and Glu would help us to further understand the highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against insect attack. When plants are subjected to insect herbivory or mechanical wounding, they rapidly activate the JA signaling pathway in whole plant tissues, which in turn mediates the systemic defense responses against insects10–12,37. In our study, we defined GSH as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance [Ca2+]cyt transmission for activation of JA biosynthesis in distal organs, thereby inducing plant systemic defense response (Figs. 1–4). Interestingly, as shown in our transcriptome data, in addition to the pronounced enrichment of genes associated with JA signaling in systemic leaf tissues after GSH treatment, genes responsive to other defense phytohormones such as ethylene and salicylic acid, which are responsible for plant resistance to pathogen infection, are also highly upregulated (Supplementary Data 1), implying that GSH might also act as a signaling molecule to activate the plant systemic immune response. Previously recognized as an antioxidant, GSH is intricately linked with reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling38. Our transcriptome analysis also revealed that genes responsive to oxidative stress were significantly induced in the systemic leaf tissues following GSH treatment (Supplementary Data 1). Given that both calcium and ROS signals play a role in mediating plant systemic defense responses to wounding11,12,39–41, exploring the potential involvement of ROS in GSH-triggered systemic defense response would be interesting. Wound-induced systemic defense signaling requires the involvement of GLR ion channel proteins, such as GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. Our study found that the GSH-triggered long-distance calcium-mediated defense response was suppressed in GCaMP3/glr3.3 but nearly unaffected in GCaMP3/glr3.6 (Fig. 4). Similar to GSH, it was also observed that Glu depends on GLR3.3 rather than GLR3.6 to initiate the systemic calcium-based defense signaling (Supplementary Fig. 10). Considering the recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, which revealed that GSH and Glu could bind to different domains of GLR3.4 for ion channel activation30, it would be intriguing to investigate whether GSH binds to GLR3.3 and further determine the potential relationship between GSH and Glu in activating GLR3.3. Furthermore, in contrast to GSH and Glu, the recently identified Ricca’s factor TGGs, was shown to rely on both GLR3.6 and GLR3.3 to trigger the systemic defense response6. It would be exciting to further uncover the signal interactions among Glu, TGGs, and GSH in wound-induced systemic defense signaling. Given that various chemical substances have been identified as neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in mammals, eliciting long-distance ionic responses that effectively mediate neurotransmission, identification of more systematic signaling molecules in the future would offer new insights into the complex systemic defense signaling in plants. The successful transmission of neural signals from one cell to another in animals relies on the mutual conversion of chemical signals (neurotransmitters) and electrical signals, where ion fluxes are induced by neurotransmitters and the release of neurotransmitters is dependent on electrical signals1,2,42. In contrast, little is known about how signaling substances are transmitted in plants to activate long-distance signaling. Previous studies suggest that the dispersal of elicitors such as Glu may rely on bulk flow and diffusion14. Given that GSH has a molecular weight similar to that of amino acids, a plausible scenario is that when plants experience mechanical damage or insect attack, a large volume of GSH from the intracellular region may surge into the apoplastic region, inducing calcium influx by activation of the GLR3.3 ion channel. With the action of diffusion and bulk flow of GSH within the vascular bundles, calcium signals can be rapidly transmitted between leaves. In addition to the diffusion and bulk flow theory, other theories have also been proposed, such as the osmoelectric siphon model, which is based on membrane depolarization leading to cell water shedding into the apoplast followed by membrane repolarization and water uptake43. More recently, osmotic pressure has been suggested to induce the systemic apoplastic release of signaling molecules like Glu15. Future studies aimed at uncovering the potential mechanisms underlying GSH-triggered systemic Ca2+ signal transmission would be fascinating.",

Copyright notice ID: 11850895 PMID: 39994230 Abstract Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability, whereas plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have evolved systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that trigger long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with environmental challenges. Here, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library identifies a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously defined wound signal essential for activating plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibits attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncover GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling events in plants. Our findings offer new insights into highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against herbivory and pathogen invasion. Subject terms: Herbivory, Biotic, Wounding Li et al. identified GSH as a signaling molecule that triggers wound-induced systemic [Ca2 +]cyt transmission, activates JA biosynthesis, and regulates plant defense responses, highlighting the complex mechanisms of plant systemic defense signaling.Introduction Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian nervous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then activate ion channels, and consequently produce ion flux1, thereby inducing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation for neurotransmission1–4. Plants are characterized by lack of a nervous system but still have the ability to systematically communicate the environmental signals from the site of perception to the distal tissues5. In response to herbivorous insect attack or wounding at local leaves, wound signaling molecules are released at the damaged plant cells, and may bind corresponding receptors to trigger propagation of slow wave potentials (SWPs)6–9, initiate transmission of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt)10–15, and consequently activate biosynthesis of defensive phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA), thereby mediating expression of defense-responsive genes for systemic defense responses in plants7,8,11,12,16–18. Many different types of chemical substances were revealed as neurotransmitters that induce long-distance ionic responses to effectively mediate neurotransmission in mammals4. However, in plant kingdom, only an amino acid and a protein, namely the glutamate (Glu) and the recently discovered “Ricca’s factor” β-THIOGLUCOSIDE GLUCOHYDROLASE (TGG) are so far defined as wound signals that depend on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) protein, the homologous protein of mammalian ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs), to activate systemic plant defense response6,7,11. In this study, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library19 identified a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that highly accumulated Glu, the previously defined molecule crucial for activation of plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibited attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncovered GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance propagation of calcium-based defense signaling events.Results Identification of GSH as a signaling molecule that activates long-distance plant defense signaling events During the genetic screening of the rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library19,20 for mutants with altered defense response to a disastrous plant fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea), we identified a mutant, termed hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52), which exhibited obvious susceptibility to B. cinerea infection (Supplementary Fig. 1). A single gene AT4G23100 was identified with PCR analysis on the mutant genomic DNA19,20. To further verify that the decreased resistance in the hr-52 mutant is caused by the interference with AT4G23100 gene, we obtained the previously reported mutant pad2-1 with the Ser298Asn substitution (S298N) within AT4G2310021 to assess its responses to B. cinerea infection and insect attack. The results showed that pad2-1 exhibited severe susceptibility to B. cinerea and Spodoptera exigua, a globally agricultural pest, while genetic transformation of pad2-1 with PAD2 (AT4G23100) completely restored the resistance (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Our results together with the previous findings21–23 demonstrate that AT4G23100 gene is essential for plant defense response against B. cinerea infection and insect attack. It was known that the AT4G23100 gene encodes the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalyzing the reaction between Glu and cysteine for generation of glutamylcysteine in the GSH biosynthesis pathway24. We found that a high level of Glu (875.42 μg/g FW) was accumulated in the pad2-1 mutant compared to WT (494.96 μg/g FW) while the GSH content in pad2-1 (4.91 μg/g FW) was severely decreased to 5.9% of WT (82.94 μg/g FW) (Fig. 1a, b). It is surprising that such a high level of Glu failed to induce plant defense in pad2-1 (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3), which seems to be inconsistent with the previously defined role of Glu as a critical wound signal that activates plant defense response11. The observed susceptibility in the GSH-deficient pad2-1 mutant suggests an indispensable role for GSH in plant defense, which encourages us to further investigate whether GSH acts as wound signal to trigger long distance calcium-based defense signaling events. Fig. 1. Defense signaling events are attenuated in GSH-deficient pad2-1 mutant plant. Open in a new tab a, b Contents of GSH (a) and Glu (b) in Col-0, pad2-1, PAD2/pad2-1#1 and PAD2/pad2-1#3 plants.

Statistical significance was determined by two-sided Welch’s t-test. i Percentage of cases with [Ca2+]cyt transmission for each systemic leaf in GCaMP3 and GCaMP3/pad2-1 plants wounded at leaf 1. 16 GCaMP3 and 17 GCaMP3/pad2-1 plants were subjected to observation of [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence and only systemic leaf showing obvious [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence was calculated as a case with [Ca2+]cyt transmission. Statistical significances compared to GCaMP3 was assessed using Fisher’s exact test, indicated as follows: *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, n.s. denotes not significant. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To verify the role of GSH in activating long-distance plant defense signaling events, we wounded leaf 1 of pad2-1 and Col-0, and then measured the accumulation of wound-induced plant defensive hormonal molecules in leaf 6, considering that leaf n shares direct vascular connections with leaves n ± 5 and n ± 8 while leaves n ± 3 may represent contact parastichies formed by proximal but unconnected vasculature in adult Arabidopsis rosettes7,25. Consistent with the reduced plant resistance in pad2-1, the defensive phytohormone jasmonates were obviously decreased in the leaf 6 of pad2-1 to ~63.04% (for JA) and ~45.81% (for JA-Ile) of those in Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1c, d). Moreover, the expression of JA-inducible defense marker genes OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ7 was also significantly attenuated in leaf 6 of pad2-1 compared to Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1e). These results suggest that GSH might serve as a critical signaling molecule essential for activation of plant systemic defense signaling events. To further explore the underlying mechanism of GSH in activating systemic plant defense responses, we introduced the [Ca2+]cyt reporter GCaMP3 into pad2-1, generating GCaMP3/pad2-1 plant, to investigate whether the GSH-deficient mutant attenuated the wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission. Upon mechanical wounding of leaf 1, both amplitude and kinetics of [Ca2+]cyt propagation in leaf 6 were reduced in GCaMP3/pad2-1 compared with GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 1f, g; Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). The peak value of [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence changes in leaf 6 of GCaMP3/pad2-1 was reduced to ~44.15% of that in GCaMP3 (Fig. 1h). Consistently, the percentage of each systemic leaf that showed apparent increased [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence was reduced in GCaMP3/pad2-1 (Fig. 1i). These data reinforce the role of GSH in triggering the wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation in plants. Taken together, the above-mentioned data suggest that GSH might serve as an important wound signal that triggers wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission, activates JA biosynthesis, and regulates plant defense responses.GSH triggers long-distance [Ca2+]cyt transmission To further validate that GSH acts as a wound signal triggering long-distance plant defense signaling events, we applied GSH (with Glu and sorbitol as positive and negative controls, respectively) to leaf 1 of the GCaMP3 plants and visualized the systemic [Ca2+]cyt in the whole seedlings (Fig. 2a, b). Intriguingly, the fast and transient increase of [Ca2+]cyt was notably triggered in systemic leaves (including leaf 3, 4, and 6) by GSH (Supplementary Movie 3) at the level comparable to that induced by Glu (Fig. 2a). Specifically, [Ca2+]cyt rapidly increased to the peak value in leaf 6 at ~230 s upon treatment on leaf 1 with GSH rather than sorbitol (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 4), and more distal leaves showed [Ca2+]cyt propagation with the increased GSH concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was dramatically repressed by pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with the Ca2+ channel inhibitor LaCl3 (Fig. 2e-g). To exclude the possibility that GSH is cleaved by enzymes to release glutamate for Ca²⁺ signal propagation, we employed GGsTop, a well-known chemical inhibitor that specifically targets gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), the enzyme responsible for converting GSH to Glu26. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in the Ca²⁺ signaling response when GSH was used in combination with GGsTop compared to that of GSH treatment alone (Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that GSH was not converted to Glu for activation of systemic Ca2+ signaling. Additionally, we synthesized another tripeptide (Glu-Pro-Ala), which contains glutamate along with two different amino acids, and investigated its effects in triggering systemic Ca2+ signal propagation in plants. Unlike GSH treatment, application of Glu-Pro-Ala failed to induce long-distance transmission of Ca²⁺ signal in plants (Supplementary Fig. 7), reinforcing the role of GSH as a signaling molecule that effectively triggers systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation in plants. Fig. 2. GSH triggers [Ca2+]cyt propagation and defense gene expression in systemic leaves.

Statistical significance was determined by Dunnett’s test. e [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence signal imaging of GCaMP3 plants pretreated with LaCl3 or Silwet-L77 after 100 mM GSH application to leaf 1 (L1) (white arrow, 0 s).

Data are mean ± SD (n = 5 for g, n = 3 for h). Statistical significance was determined by two-sided Welch’s t-test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Consistently, GSH application on leaf 1 significantly induced the expression of defense-responsive genes (OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ10) in leaf 6 (by ~5.6, ~8.6 and ~5.7 folds), which is comparable to that induced by Glu (Fig. 2d). Moreover, pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with LaCl3 severely reduced the GSH-inducible expression of defense genes in systemic leaves (Fig. 2h), verifying that propagation of [Ca2+]cyt is required for GSH-induced defense gene expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GSH acts as an important wound signal in triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling.GSH activates the transcriptional expression of defense-related genes in plant systemic leaves To get deeper insights into the GSH-triggered systemic defense signaling events in plants, we performed transcriptome profiling on leaf 6 collected after 1 h application of GSH to leaf 1 of WT plants. We identified 378 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the systemic leaf of GSH-treated plants compared to non-stimulated mock control plants (Supplementary Data 1). Among them, 354 genes including a large number of key defense-responsive genes were upregulated while 24 genes were downregulated (Fig. 3a), which is well consistent with the tendency of transcriptome data from plants in response to wounding, namely, more transcripts are upregulated than downregulated27,28. Gene Ontology analysis (GO) of these DEGs further revealed significant enrichment of terms associated with plant defense signaling, including defense response, cellular responses to JA, response to wounding, and response to hormone (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Data 2). Consistent with the transcriptome analysis, qRT-PCR also showed that expression of defense marker genes (CYP94C1, JAZ13, LOX4, OPR3, JAZ5, JAZ7, and JAZ10) was highly induced in the systemic leaf tissues of GSH-treated plants (Fig. 3c, d; Supplementary Fig. 8). These data provide an overview of the GSH-induced gene expression in plant systemic leaf tissues and further indicate the important role of GSH in triggering plant long-distance defense signaling.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further investigate the relations between GSH and Glu in plant wound response, we generated transcriptome data sets from leaf 6 1 h after wounding leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 3) or application of Glu to leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 4), and then compared these data to that induced by GSH. This comparison showed that 207 DEGs were co-regulated by wounding and GSH treatment, while 228 DEGs were found in both GSH and Glu treatment groups. Moreover, a total of 267 DEGs from GSH- and Glu-treated groups existed in wounding treatment, among which 126 genes were co-regulated by GSH, Glu and wounding, 81 genes were only regulated by GSH and wounding, and 60 genes were only regulated by Glu and wounding (Fig. 3e). These overlapped genes which are co-regulated by GSH, Glu, and wounding or independently regulated by GSH and wounding, Glu and wounding are all mainly involved in plant defense signaling, including plant response to wounding, stress, JA, and biotic stimulus, regulation of cell communication, and innate immune response, suggesting that GSH and Glu are involved in wound-induced plant systemic defense response.GLR3.3 is required for GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation GLR proteins which generally contain an amino-terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain (TMD), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), have broad agonist profiles including glycine, cysteine, methionine, Glu and GSH29–32. Specially, Glu-triggered long-distance [Ca2+]cyt propagation is dramatically inhibited in glr3.3glr3.6 mutant11. To figure out whether GSH-triggered long-distance calcium signaling depends on GLR3.3 and GLR3.6, we compared the GSH-triggered Ca2+-related signaling events among the glr3.3, glr3.6 and WT plants containing the GCaMP3 reporter (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Fig. 9). Interestingly, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was severely reduced in the GCaMP3/glr3.3 (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Movie 4). However, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was not markedly attenuated in GCaMP3/glr3.6, which is similar to that of GCaMP3 plant (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Movie 5). Consistently, the GSH-inducible expression of defense marker gene OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ10 was significantly repressed in the GCaMP3/glr3.3, but not obviously inhibited in the GCaMP3/glr3.6 and the GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 4c). These results suggest that GLR3.3 plays a dominant role in regulating GSH-induced [Ca2+]cyt propagation. Similar to the systemic calcium signal transmission upon GSH treatment, Glu-induced [Ca2+]cyt propagation in systemic leaves were strongly inhibited in GCaMP3/glr3.3 while remained unaffected in GCaMP3/glr3.6 (Supplementary Fig. 10), confirming that Glu-induced long-distance calcium wave is also dependent on GLR3.38,11. Fig. 4. GSH induces systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation and defense gene expression in a GLR3.3-dependent manner. Open in a new tab a [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence signal imaging of GCaMP3, GCaMP3/glr3.3 and GCaMP3/glr3.6 plants after 100 mM GSH application (white arrow, 0 s) to leaf 1 (L1).

GCaMP3 data from Fig. 2c are reproduced (gray lines) to aid in comparison. Data are mean ± SD (n = 5, 9, 9 for GCaMP3/glr3.3, GCaMP3/glr3.6, GCaMP3 in (b), n = 3 for (c)). Statistical significance was determined by two-sided Welch’s t-test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To characterize the interaction between GLR3.3 and GSH, the predicted structure of GLR3.3 was used to perform molecular docking. The binding model showed that Glu binds to the LBD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3LBD) (Supplementary Fig. 11), which is consistent with the recent report about the Glu binding to the GLR3.3LBD29. While GSH was predicted to bind the ATD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3ATD), which is remarkably different from Glu in terms of binding domains and contacting amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 11). Consistent with the predicted interaction between GLR3.3ATD and GSH (Supplementary Fig. 11), recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data revealed that GSH binds the ATD of GLR3.430, another GLR protein with high sequence similarity to GLR3.3, reinforcing that GSH might bind the ATD domain of GLR3.3 for activation of ion channel. Together with the genetic evidence showing GLR3.3 is required for both GSH- and Glu-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 10), these results collectively suggest that GSH and Glu may bind to different domains of GLR3.3 for activating ion channel activity and triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling. Taken together, our results shown in Figs. 1–4 suggest that GSH serves as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance propagation of [Ca2+]cyt waves in a GLR3.3-dependent manner, thus inducing rapid JA biosynthesis in systemic leaf organs to protect plants from herbivory ahead of time.Discussion Initiation of a rapid defense against biotic attacks and mechanical damages is crucial for plant survival in changing environment. Due to lack of a nervous system, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to systemically deliver the wound signal from the site of injured organs to the distal undamaged tissues, which helps them be well-prepared for upcoming dangers33. In this study, we find that the GSH-deficient mutant, in spite of the highly accumulated Glu previously defined as a critical wound signal essential for activating plant defense events, showed impaired plant defense signaling events (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. 1-3). We further define GSH as a critical wound signal that depends on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling in plants (Figs. 2–4; Supplementary Figs. 5-11). Intriguingly, in the animal nervous system, GSH has been identified as a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter34–36, suggesting a potential conceptual parallel in GSH-mediated signal transmission across different kingdoms of life. Moreover, we noticed that GSH and Glu induced distinct [Ca2+]cyt transmission patterns in systemic leaves. Specifically, the spread of systemic [Ca2+]cyt triggered by GSH is preferentially initiated from marginal veins and rapidly transmitted to the mid veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 6), whereas Glu mediated [Ca2+]cyt transmission mainly propagated from mid veins to marginal veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 7). Re-examination of the data shown in the previous study revealing Glu as a wound signal also supports our observation that Glu triggers [Ca2+]cyt transmission with the direction of mid-to-marginal veins11. Intriguingly, the transmission pattern of wounding-induced [Ca2+]cyt contained both directions of the mid-to-marginal veins and the marginal-to-mid veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 8). Future work to elucidate the mechanisms and biological significance of different [Ca2+]cyt transmission patterns induced by GSH and Glu would help us to further understand the highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against insect attack. When plants are subjected to insect herbivory or mechanical wounding, they rapidly activate the JA signaling pathway in whole plant tissues, which in turn mediates the systemic defense responses against insects10–12,37. In our study, we defined GSH as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance [Ca2+]cyt transmission for activation of JA biosynthesis in distal organs, thereby inducing plant systemic defense response (Figs. 1–4). Interestingly, as shown in our transcriptome data, in addition to the pronounced enrichment of genes associated with JA signaling in systemic leaf tissues after GSH treatment, genes responsive to other defense phytohormones such as ethylene and salicylic acid, which are responsible for plant resistance to pathogen infection, are also highly upregulated (Supplementary Data 1), implying that GSH might also act as a signaling molecule to activate the plant systemic immune response. Previously recognized as an antioxidant, GSH is intricately linked with reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling38. Our transcriptome analysis also revealed that genes responsive to oxidative stress were significantly induced in the systemic leaf tissues following GSH treatment (Supplementary Data 1). Given that both calcium and ROS signals play a role in mediating plant systemic defense responses to wounding11,12,39–41, exploring the potential involvement of ROS in GSH-triggered systemic defense response would be interesting. Wound-induced systemic defense signaling requires the involvement of GLR ion channel proteins, such as GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. Our study found that the GSH-triggered long-distance calcium-mediated defense response was suppressed in GCaMP3/glr3.3 but nearly unaffected in GCaMP3/glr3.6 (Fig. 4). Similar to GSH, it was also observed that Glu depends on GLR3.3 rather than GLR3.6 to initiate the systemic calcium-based defense signaling (Supplementary Fig. 10). Considering the recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, which revealed that GSH and Glu could bind to different domains of GLR3.4 for ion channel activation30, it would be intriguing to investigate whether GSH binds to GLR3.3 and further determine the potential relationship between GSH and Glu in activating GLR3.3. Furthermore, in contrast to GSH and Glu, the recently identified Ricca’s factor TGGs, was shown to rely on both GLR3.6 and GLR3.3 to trigger the systemic defense response6. It would be exciting to further uncover the signal interactions among Glu, TGGs, and GSH in wound-induced systemic defense signaling. Given that various chemical substances have been identified as neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in mammals, eliciting long-distance ionic responses that effectively mediate neurotransmission, identification of more systematic signaling molecules in the future would offer new insights into the complex systemic defense signaling in plants. The successful transmission of neural signals from one cell to another in animals relies on the mutual conversion of chemical signals (neurotransmitters) and electrical signals, where ion fluxes are induced by neurotransmitters and the release of neurotransmitters is dependent on electrical signals1,2,42. In contrast, little is known about how signaling substances are transmitted in plants to activate long-distance signaling. Previous studies suggest that the dispersal of elicitors such as Glu may rely on bulk flow and diffusion14. Given that GSH has a molecular weight similar to that of amino acids, a plausible scenario is that when plants experience mechanical damage or insect attack, a large volume of GSH from the intracellular region may surge into the apoplastic region, inducing calcium influx by activation of the GLR3.3 ion channel. With the action of diffusion and bulk flow of GSH within the vascular bundles, calcium signals can be rapidly transmitted between leaves. In addition to the diffusion and bulk flow theory, other theories have also been proposed, such as the osmoelectric siphon model, which is based on membrane depolarization leading to cell water shedding into the apoplast followed by membrane repolarization and water uptake43. More recently, osmotic pressure has been suggested to induce the systemic apoplastic release of signaling molecules like Glu15. Future studies aimed at uncovering the potential mechanisms underlying GSH-triggered systemic Ca2+ signal transmission would be fascinating.Methods Plant materials and growth condition hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52) was obtained from the rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library in our previous study19,20. pad2-1 was ordered from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC). Seeds of GCaMP3 were from Simon Gilroy (Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin). The GCaMP3/pad2-1 was generated by genetic crosses using standard procedures. GCaMP3/glr3.3 and GCaMP3/glr3.6 mutants were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 in WT plants overexpressing GCaMP3. To generate the transgenic plant expressing 35S::PAD2-6myc/pad2-1 (PAD2/pad2-1), the coding sequence of PAD2 (AT4G23100) was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300, and then transformed into pad2-1. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized with 20% bleach, sown on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. After incubation in the dark at 4 °C for 2 days, plates were cultivated in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a 16 h/8 h light/dark (long day, LD) photoperiod. After 7 days, seedlings were then transplanted into soil and grown under the same condition. For insect feeding and pathogen inoculation assays, plants were grown in soil for 4–5 weeks at 22 °C with a 10 h/14 h light/dark (short day, SD) photoperiod. For real-time calcium imaging assay, plates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 days in the dark and then transferred to 22 °C with a SD photoperiod for 6–7 days. Seedlings were then transferred onto new plates and grown for additional 14–16 days prior to use.Real-time [Ca2+]cyt imaging in the entire plant Transgenic Arabidopsis plants stably expressing GCaMP3 were imaged with a motorized epifluorescence (SZX10, Olympus) stereomicroscope equipped with a 1 × objective lens and a C13440 digital camera (ORCA-Flash4.0 V3, Hamamatsu Photonics). The GFP-based Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3 was excited using mercury lamp (X-Cite 120 Q, Excelitas). The green fluorescent signal was acquired every 2 s with the C13440 camera using Standard imaging software (Olympus). Using ImageJ software, GCaMP3 signals were analyzed overtime at regions of interest (ROI). The equation ΔF/F0 = (F-F0)/F0 was used to calculate the fractional fluorescence changes. F0 denotes the average baseline fluorescence determined by the average of F over the frames of the recording before treatment. The entire leaf area was selected as ROI for Ca2+ signal analysis.Application of amino acids, tripeptides and chemical agents GSH, Glu-Pro-Ala, L-Glu, and sorbitol were dissolved in growth medium [1/2 × MS salts, 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.05% (w/v) MES], which was then adjusted to pH 5.1. 5 μL of the solution was applied to the cut edge of leaf 1 after 30 min recovery period after pre-cutting for assessment of small molecules-induced Ca2+ signal transmission. In contrast, a longer recovery period of 5 h post pre-cutting was required for the assessment of small molecules-activated gene expression levels. GSH at concentrations of 0.001 mM, 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 25 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM, which are within or exceeding its physiological concentrations, were selected for analyzing GSH-triggered systemic calcium-based defense signaling in vitro. GGsTOP (HY-108467, MCE) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with water. LaCl3 was dissolved into 0.05% (v/v) Silwet L-77 in water to make a 50 mM solution and then 10 μL was applied to a piece of Kiwmwipes placed on a petiole for at least 30 min prior to adding GSH.CRISPR/Cas9 vector construction and plant transformation Egg cell-specific promoter-controlled CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to generate glr3.3 and glr3.6 single mutants. CRISPR/Cas9 vector was constructed according to previous studies44. Target sequence was selected by CRISPR-PLANT (https://www.genome.arizona.edu/crispr/). All the vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 using electroporation. Arabidopsis plants were transformed using the floral dip methods. The primers used for cloning are shown in Supplementary Data 5.DNA extraction and mutation detection 1–5 mg frozen leaf tissues were used for DNA extraction through SDS method. The extracted genomic DNA was then used as a template to amplify the desired fragments in each of the target genes using primers flanking the target sites. PCR products were directly sequenced using Sanger method to identify mutation. Superimposed sequence chromatograms produced by biallelic and heterozygous mutations were decoded by DSDecode (http://dsdecode.scgene.com/) and manual analyses.Total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR TransZol RNA kit (ET101-01, TransGen Biotech) was used to extract total RNA from Arabidopsis plants according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA in a 20 μL reaction by cDNA Synthesis SuperMix kit (AT311-03, TransGen Biotech). qRT-PCR was performed in QuantStudio 3 realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) using ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Low ROX Premixed) (Q331-02, Vazyme). The 2-ΔΔCt analysis method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of each sample.JA and JA-Ile quantification in leaf tissues Metabolite extraction and quantification of JA and JA-Ile in leaf tissues were performed according to previously described methods using AB Sciex 4500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, MA, USA) equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC™ BEH C18 column (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) (50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm)45. d5-JA was added to the extraction solvent (isopropanol: formic acid at 99.5: 0.5, v/v) as internal standard. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was applied in negative mode with mass transitions (precursor ions/product) as followed: 209.12 > 59.01 for JA, 322.20 > 130.09 for JA-Ile, and 214.15 > 62.03 for d5-JA. A 10 min gradient elution program was applied for target compounds separation with 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (A) and pure water (B) as mobile phase with a 200 μL/min flow rate. Then, mass spectra data were processed and calculated using AB SCIEX analyst software (version 1.6.3, AB SCIEX, MA, USA) with calculation curves made with standards.Measurement of endogenous Glu and GSH in Arabidopsis Leaf tissues were collected and directly ground into powder in liquid nitrogen. Then, 100 mg of powder was weighed accurately and transferred into a 2 mL centrifuge tube. 10 µL of stable isotope internal standard (5 µg/mL 13C2-15N-GSH, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added to each sample before extraction. Then, 1.5 mL of extraction buffer (80% methanol with 0.1% formic acid, v/v) was added, with vortexing for sample resuspension. After a 15 min centrifugation at 14000 × g, the supernatants were diluted 10 times, and 100 µL was transferred to sample vials for further detection. Target compounds were detected with a 6500 plus QTrap mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, USA) coupled with a ACQUITY UPLC H-Class system, equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) probe. Extracts were separated by a synergi Hydro-RP column (2.0 × 100 mm, 2.5 μm, phenomenex). A binary solvent system was used, in which mobile phase A consisted of 2 mM Triisobutylamine adjusted with 5 mM acetic acid in 100% water, and mobile phase B of 100% methanol. An 8 min gradient with flow rate of 500 μL/min was used as follows: 0–1.0 min at 2% B; 1.0-6 min, 5–40% B; 6–7 min, 98% B; 7.1-8 min, 2% B. Column chamber and sample tray were held at 35 °C and 10 °C, respectively. Data were acquired in multiple reaction monitor (MRM) mode with mass transitions (precursor ions/product) as followed: 308.1 > 179.1 for GSH, 147.9 > 83.9 for Glu and 311.0 > 181.9 for 13C2-15N-GSH. The nebulizer gas (Gas1), heater gas (Gas2), and curtain gas were set at 55, 55, and 35 psi, respectively. The ion spray voltage was 4500 V in positive mode. The optimal probe temperature was determined to be 500 °C. Calibration curves of Glu and GSH were made with standards, and the concentration of GSH was calculated by internal-standard method with 13C2-15N-GSH as internal standard, while the concentration of Glu was calculated by external-standard method. The SCIEX OS software (version 1.6, AB SCIEX, MA, USA) was applied for metabolite identification and concentration calculation.Insect feeding assay with Spodoptera exigua S. exigua larvae (2nd instar) were purchased from Jiyuan Baiyun Industry Co., Ltd (China). For feeding assays, 2nd instar S. exigua larvae were first underwent 24 h of starvation treatment in growth chamber and were then gently placed on 5 week-old plants. Two S. exigua larvae were placed on a plant. Larval weights were measured 7 days after feeding. Representative S. exigua larvae recovered from corresponding plants were killed by 75% ethanol solution and photographed by stereomicroscope (SZX10, Olympus) equipped with a 0.75 × objective lens and a digital camera (SC180, Olympus). Botrytis cinerea infection assay Conidiospores were collected from B. cinerea (B0510) plates and diluted to ~1 × 106 conidiospores/mL in PDB medium (Potato Dextrose Broth, BD). For drop-inoculation assay, 5 μL B. cinerea spores was dropped on the center of each detached leaf. Subsequently the detached leaves were placed in dark with high humidity for 2–3 days. Phenotypes were imaged with a digital camera and the lesion sizes were measured using Digimizer software (v3.1.2.0, Belgium, Germany). For spray-inoculation assay, 4 week-old soil-grown seedlings were sprayed evenly with B. cinerea conidiospores and kept in high humidity for 2–3 days. The disease severity was classified into four grades: healthy (H, green), light symptoms (L, pale green), severe symptoms (S, orange-yellow), or completely dead (D, red). PDB buffer served as mock in these infection assays. As described in previous studies45–47, the assessment of B. cinerea biomass was determined by real-time PCR quantification of the fungal CUTINASE signal (Z69264) in relation to Arabidopsis ACTIN2.RNA sequencing and data analysis RNA integrity was checked using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Low-quality reads were removed from the raw reads using Cutadapt48 and Trimmomatic49 software to get clean reads. Clean reads were mapped to the corresponding reference genome using HISAT2 software50. Gene expression levels and read count of each gene were calculated using StringTie software51. The R package DEseq2 (v1.16.1) was used to identify the differentially expressed genes based on the following criteria: padj < 0.05 and |log2FoldChange | > 152. Venn diagramming, GO enrichment analysis was performed using TBtools (v2.007)53.Structure prediction and molecular docking The ab initio structure predictions of AtGLR3.3 protein were implemented by RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold 2 through ColabFold54–56. The homology modelling of AtGLR3.3 was conducted using SWISS-MODEL with AtGLR3.4 crystallography model (7lzh) template30,57. Ligand mol2 files of GSH and Glu were generated by Avogadro 1.2.058. Prepdock website (https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/servers/html/prepdock.html) and AutoDockTools 1.5.7 software were used for adding hydrogens and symmetry related waters, computing Gasteiger charges, and detecting torsion root59. Molecular dockings were performed on AutoDock Vina 1.2.0 software and CB-DOCK2 website60,61. For AutoDock Vina, the grid box was setting up with a range spacing of 0.897 Å, number of points in x, y and z dimensions as 52, 54, and 70 respectively and center grid box for x, y and z as 173.571, 198.031, and 203.573 respectively for the ATD of AtGLR3.3. Docking of LBD was conducted with 0.756 Å in range spacing. The number of points in x, y and z dimensions was 60, 56, and 78. The center grid box was 172.151, 160.102, and 157.178 in xyz-coordinates. The results were visualized and the polar contacts between ligands and their receptor were detected on PyMOL 2.5.8 software. Hydrogen bonds were determined on UCSF ChimeraX 1.7.1 software with distance tolerance of 0.400 Å and angle tolerance of 20.000°62.Statistical analysis All data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0, SPSS, and R software and presented by Adobe Illustrator. Means and deviations were reported in the Figures and the corresponding figure legends.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (1.7MB, pdf) 41467_2025_57239_MOESM2_ESM.pdf (122.8KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (63.5KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 2 (40.7KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 3 (334.1KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 4 (65KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 5 (10.9KB, xlsx) Supplementary Movie 1 (2.6MB, mp4) Supplementary Movie 2 (2.6MB, mp4) Supplementary Movie 3 (4.8MB, mp4) Supplementary Movie 4 (4.9MB, mp4) Supplementary Movie 5 (4.9MB, mp4) Supplementary Movie 6 (16.9MB, mp4) Supplementary Movie 7 (16.6MB, mp4) Supplementary Movie 8 (8.9MB, mp4) Reporting Summary (1.1MB, pdf) Transparent Peer Review file (1.1MB, pdf) Source data Source Data (784.5KB, xlsx) Acknowledgements We thank Simon Gilroy (Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin) for providing us with the GCaMP3 seeds.

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.

    "introduction": "Introduction As a possible integral feature of life support systems, plants offer the potential to provide food, replenish the air, filter water, and improve the mental health of the crew during long-duration missions in space. Therefore, at a practical level, plants are being intensively studied to assess their ability to adequately fulfill these roles in the spaceflight environment [reviewed in (Wheeler, 2017)]. In addition, a growing number of plant spaceflight studies are addressing the quest for fundamental knowledge about how plant biology operates. Thus, the spaceflight environment provides conditions that are inaccessible on Earth, such as growth in microgravity and exposure to cosmic radiation, providing a unique opportunity to dissect responses under conditions that plant biology has not encountered during its evolutionary history [reviewed in (Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016; Paul et al., 2013a)]. These studies are now generating extensive characterizations of the responses of diverse plant species to spaceflight. As part of the output from this research, there is an ever-increasing set of genome-scale analyses that range from transcriptomics [e.g., (Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019; Herranz et al., 2019; Vandenbrink et al., 2019)] and proteomics [e.g., (Mazars et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Basu et al., 2017)] to epigenomics [e.g., (Zhou et al., 2019)]. These datasets help catalog the plant response to growing in space. For example, the omics database maintained by The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab program (GeneLab, 2019) contains, at the time of writing, data from over 200 spaceflight-related experiments, with about 20 plant-focused studies, mainly from research conducted using the Space Shuttle and International Space Station. In addition, similar spaceflight and related data from e.g., the Japanese, Chinese, and European space agencies have been deposited in a range of other publicly accessible data repositories such as  GEO (Barrett et al., 2013) and the European CATdb (Gagnot et al., 2008). Each experiment has multiple spaceflight samples and often compares the responses of wild-type and mutants in spaceflight to parallel ground-based controls performed on the Earth. Research groups have then mined, e.g., the patterns of transcriptional change seen in individual experiments to reveal potential underlying plant responses to spaceflight. Thus, changes in the expression of heat shock proteins [e.g., (Zupanska et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019)], cell wall peroxidases [e.g., (Correll et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019)], and a general response to oxidative stress [e.g., (Sugimoto et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2019)] have all emerged as response signatures identified in some, but not all, plant spaceflight transcriptomes. However, the scale of the available data now poses challenges when making such comparisons between diverse experiments. Thus, (1) the datasets are distributed across multiple repositories, posing potential issues with accessibility and interoperability, (2) the bioinformatics-based analytical approaches used between published studies are often very different, making robust comparisons of differences drawn from the literature challenging, (3) the sheer scale of the data makes it hard to perform more than a few comparisons between experiments before its volume becomes limiting, and (4) it is often difficult to present these kinds of broad-scale comparative analyses in a visually accessible, intuitive manner for use by a broad scientific audience. To address these challenges, we have developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST; a compilation of the abbreviations and terms used throughout, along with a brief definition of each is presented as a glossary in the Appendix ) database. TOAST uses a database management software called Qlik (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA) to aggregate and visualize plant spaceflight omics-level data from multiple repositories. It applies a uniform set of analytical steps to the data and makes visualization of massive datasets accessible, allowing for interactive comparisons between experiments. The database also provides links to experiment metadata and a suite of online tools to enhance the scope of potential further analysis. In this publication we present an overview of the TOAST database and provide examples of how it can both validate previously published inferences as to likely spaceflight-imposed stress responses and mine across the plant spaceflight transcriptomics data to facilitate the generation of new hypotheses.",

Such comparisons will provide an important source of hypotheses to then be experimentally tested. TOAST provides a data-rich environment with which to explore the commonalities and differences in the responses of plants to spaceflight and spaceflight-related environments in an accessible and intuitive format. The TOAST database has been released as a publicly available, web-based environment (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) along with an online tutorial at https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata. At present, TOAST provides a tool to aid the plant biology community. However, the underlying TOAST architecture is biological kingdom agnostic; through use of orthologous matrix mapping, we are working to extend TOAST to facilitate similar data exploration across the wealth of biological systems that are being analyzed in spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 7076552 PMID: 32265943 Abstract Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments. Keywords: Arabidopsis thaliana, spaceflight, transcriptomics, RNAseq, microarray, proteomics, bioinformatics, QlikIntroduction As a possible integral feature of life support systems, plants offer the potential to provide food, replenish the air, filter water, and improve the mental health of the crew during long-duration missions in space. Therefore, at a practical level, plants are being intensively studied to assess their ability to adequately fulfill these roles in the spaceflight environment [reviewed in (Wheeler, 2017)]. In addition, a growing number of plant spaceflight studies are addressing the quest for fundamental knowledge about how plant biology operates. Thus, the spaceflight environment provides conditions that are inaccessible on Earth, such as growth in microgravity and exposure to cosmic radiation, providing a unique opportunity to dissect responses under conditions that plant biology has not encountered during its evolutionary history [reviewed in (Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016; Paul et al., 2013a)]. These studies are now generating extensive characterizations of the responses of diverse plant species to spaceflight. As part of the output from this research, there is an ever-increasing set of genome-scale analyses that range from transcriptomics [e.g., (Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019; Herranz et al., 2019; Vandenbrink et al., 2019)] and proteomics [e.g., (Mazars et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Basu et al., 2017)] to epigenomics [e.g., (Zhou et al., 2019)]. These datasets help catalog the plant response to growing in space. For example, the omics database maintained by The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab program (GeneLab, 2019) contains, at the time of writing, data from over 200 spaceflight-related experiments, with about 20 plant-focused studies, mainly from research conducted using the Space Shuttle and International Space Station. In addition, similar spaceflight and related data from e.g., the Japanese, Chinese, and European space agencies have been deposited in a range of other publicly accessible data repositories such as  GEO (Barrett et al., 2013) and the European CATdb (Gagnot et al., 2008). Each experiment has multiple spaceflight samples and often compares the responses of wild-type and mutants in spaceflight to parallel ground-based controls performed on the Earth. Research groups have then mined, e.g., the patterns of transcriptional change seen in individual experiments to reveal potential underlying plant responses to spaceflight. Thus, changes in the expression of heat shock proteins [e.g., (Zupanska et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019)], cell wall peroxidases [e.g., (Correll et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019)], and a general response to oxidative stress [e.g., (Sugimoto et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2019)] have all emerged as response signatures identified in some, but not all, plant spaceflight transcriptomes. However, the scale of the available data now poses challenges when making such comparisons between diverse experiments. Thus, (1) the datasets are distributed across multiple repositories, posing potential issues with accessibility and interoperability, (2) the bioinformatics-based analytical approaches used between published studies are often very different, making robust comparisons of differences drawn from the literature challenging, (3) the sheer scale of the data makes it hard to perform more than a few comparisons between experiments before its volume becomes limiting, and (4) it is often difficult to present these kinds of broad-scale comparative analyses in a visually accessible, intuitive manner for use by a broad scientific audience. To address these challenges, we have developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST; a compilation of the abbreviations and terms used throughout, along with a brief definition of each is presented as a glossary in the Appendix ) database. TOAST uses a database management software called Qlik (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA) to aggregate and visualize plant spaceflight omics-level data from multiple repositories. It applies a uniform set of analytical steps to the data and makes visualization of massive datasets accessible, allowing for interactive comparisons between experiments. The database also provides links to experiment metadata and a suite of online tools to enhance the scope of potential further analysis. In this publication we present an overview of the TOAST database and provide examples of how it can both validate previously published inferences as to likely spaceflight-imposed stress responses and mine across the plant spaceflight transcriptomics data to facilitate the generation of new hypotheses.A Broad Set of Available Data Underlies the TOAST Data Exploration Environment As a first step toward designing a comprehensive tool for the analysis of plant spaceflight omics-level data, we categorized the breadth of data available to support such an exploration environment. As most studies have generated transcriptomics data, we have focused on these datasets, although the TOAST database also includes the currently few available proteomic (Mazars et al., 2014; Ferl et al., 2015; Basu et al., 2017) and epigenomic (Zhou et al., 2019) plant spaceflight datasets. NASA's GeneLab program maintains a publicly accessible data repository that brings together a large amount of such genome-scale spaceflight data (GeneLab, 2019). Although the GeneLab site has the highest density of these kinds of spaceflight-related datasets, the global spaceflight research community has deposited a large amount of data generated by similar genome-scale experiments in other data repositories such as -GEO (Barrett et al., 2013) and CATdb (Gagnot et al., 2008). Figure 1 presents an analysis of the spectrum of plant species and experimentation available for incorporation into a plant-focused data exploration environment (see Supplementary Table 1 for the source list of the plant biology data repositories). The most highly researched plant is Arabidopsis thaliana, being the predominant plant model for molecular analysis, with the Col-0 ecotype most frequently chosen for spaceflight experimentation. Rice [Oriza sativa; (Jin et al., 2015)], mizuna [Brassica rapa; (Sugimoto et al., 2014)], and the fern Ceratopteris richardii (Salmi and Roux, 2008) have also been the focus of similar molecular analysis. Figure 1A breaks down the available data into species and genotype versus analytical approach (e.g., microarray or RNAseq technologies), showing that the majority of the available data has been generated using Affymetrix microarrays or Illumina-based RNAseq to monitor patterns of gene expression. Figure 1B further shows that although the predominant sample analyzed in multiple plant spaceflight experiments is the whole seedling, data is available from several experiments using cell cultures and from individual organs dissected after the plants had been grown in space. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Publicly available spaceflight transcriptomics datasets. (A) Relationships between species, ecotype, genotype (i.e., mutant or wild type) growth environment and assay technique for datasets from plants experiencing spaceflight.

For example, there are multiple experiments using similar species and analyzing similar tissues; transcriptomics data for Arabidopsis is particularly extensive. We set a minimum criterion for inclusion in the initial iteration of TOAST to be studies where statistically rigorous analyses can be applied. This approach means datasets are required to contain three or more biological replicates and at present only spaceflight experiments on Arabidopsis and rice fulfill this requirement. We have therefore imported all of the available, replicated Arabidopsis and rice plant spaceflight datasets into the TOAST database. In addition, we have added a series of ground-based datasets addressing spaceflight-related factors, such as effects of increased radiation or exposure to oxidative stress on Earth as the foundation with which to build the TOAST exploration environment (these datasets are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 ).TOAST Design Philosophy and Data Structure As noted above, the underlying software engine behind TOAST is the Qlik Associative Engine (Qlik Technologies Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA). We chose to use Qlik as it not only provides the tools to develop and administer the underlying relational database but also allows the user to readily see what other information in the database is associated with their current query via a software feature built into QLIK named the Qlik Associative Data Engine. In addition, Qlik integrates graphic visualization packages that allow intuitive, interactive exploration and analysis of the data. Such tools help ensure the data will be more readily accessible not only to plant space biology researchers and bioinformaticians but also to a much broader community, including non-specialists and students. Data was therefore imported into a Qlik-managed database ( Supplementary Table 1 ) to generate the associative database outlined in Figure 2 that forms the foundation of TOAST functionality. However, the various data sources use a variety of indices for gene identification that range from Affymetrix microarray probe name (i.e., the Affymetrix microarray technology's specific technical name for the DNA probe used to identify a particular gene) to Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI) locus codes [i.e., unique gene identifiers assigned by the consortium of researchers forming the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative; (Kaul et al., 2000)]. We therefore first re-indexed all the datasets to use Entrez gene identifiers (Maglott et al., 2011). Entrez is the  ()'s database for gene-specific information and it assigns gene identifiers, or codes, that uniquely identify a particular gene. The advantage of these identifiers in tracing a gene from one dataset to another is that they form a uniform, well-curated indexing system specifically developed to be applied across all organisms. Entrez gene names uniquely identify individual genes and importantly, the system has been developed to expand as new genes are identified. Thus, re-indexing the gene identifiers in TOAST from the varied standards used in the imported datasets to their Entrez identifiers served several purposes: (1) it allows for comparisons within the TOAST database via a uniform labeling system, (2) it facilitates data exchange with other databases and analytical tools, anchoring the data to the global Entrez standard, and (3) it builds scalability into the database architecture as Entrez identifiers are designed to provide a standard for indexing all current and future documented genes. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Database structure underlying TOAST 4.5. Each dataset within TOAST includes a series of pre-computed factors for each gene: minimally including fold-change, P-value, Q-value, and a yes/no value for whether the fold-change for each gene is significant at P < 0.05. These pre-computed values greatly speed the real-time processing of interactive visualizations within the TOAST user interface. The identifiers in the raw data, such as Transcript ID from RNAseq, Probe ID for Microarray, or TAIR ID are translated to their unique Entrez and Ensembl IDs to allow for uniform indexing within TOAST itself and to facilitate passing of analyzed data produced by TOAST analyses to exterior sites and tools. Within TOAST, the strings of molecular ID's from a dataset are both directly transferred to a series of data visualization and exploration tools and are imported into a series of analytical packages accessing a range of databases that have been imported into the TOAST environment. These databases include: the Genome Ontology (GO) consortium databases that allow analysis of the relationships between gene lists of interest and known biological processes, the SUBA4 database which catalogs predicted subcellular locales for each gene, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database that analyzes relationships to known cellular pathways, and Ensembl's Orthologous Matrix database, allowing TOAST to make comparisons between species. The outputs of these analytical modules are then passed to TOAST's interactive data visualization tools to help explore each dataset. Results from the visualizations are in turn returned as lists of Gene IDs to allow for reiterative analyses.If the original authors' data structure matched that of our database model (minimally, fold-change, P-value, Bonferroni corrected Q-value), we imported their analysis that incorporated their statistical models for calculating P- and Q-values. However, some of the publicly available microarray dataset analyses lacked some of these minimum requirements (most typically missing a statistical analysis of significance of reported changes) and so had to be reprocessed for incorporation into TOAST. For this reanalysis (exclusively Affymetrix ATH1 microarray data), we used R-studio codes provided courtesy of NASA's GeneLab. R is a programming language widely used in the statistical analysis of scientific data (https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and R-studio is commercially produced software that aids with the development of programs using R (R-Studio Inc. Boston, MA, USA). These R-studio codes were customized for each experimental design to provide the required fields of fold-change, P-, and Bonferroni corrected Q-values using Robust Multichip Average (RMA) quantile normalization (Irizarry et al., 2003), a technique that accounts for variation across multiple microarray chips used in these analyses. These codes can be found at https://github.com/dr-richard-barker/NASA-GeneLab-MicroArray-Codes. Further analysis was then performed on the imported data from Arabidopsis Affymetrix and CATMA microarrays and rice Affymetrix microarrays, converting probeIDs to Entrez gene identifiers. RNAseq data was reprocessed by importing the raw FASTQ files (i.e., the files containing the nucleotide sequences identified by the sequencing machine) into CyVerse [the cloud computing infrastructure supported through the National Science Foundation's Directorate of Biological Sciences; (Merchant et al., 2016)] and then analyzed using a series of software steps (analysis pipeline) of: HiSAT to first generate BAM files from the FASTQ files. BAM, or Binary compressed sequence Alignment Map files contain information on the alignment of each read from the sequencing machine to the genome. BAM files were then processed by the BAMtoCounts software package to create a counts matrix that holds the number of reads that have mapped to a particular transcript. Finally differential expression analysis for each transcript was calculated using the DESeq/EdgeR approach (Love et al., 2014) as part of the iDEP R-Shiny application. iDEP is a software package for the R programming language designed to process genetic data. iDEP uses R-Shiny, a further R software package that allows for easy development of interactive web-based applications (Ge et al., 2018). Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) and counts per million reads mapped (CPM) were calculated as described in Choi et al. (2019). We used the TAIR10 annotation that describes genetic loci within the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence (Lamesch et al., 2012) and the associated genes were linked to Gene Ontology (GO) molecular function and biological processes databases that catalog the annotated functions and processes linked with each genetic locus. These GO descriptions allow testing of whether genes annotated as being associated with specific molecular functions or biological processes are over represented in a particular dataset (Ashburner et al., 2000; Carbon et al., 2019). Consensus sub-cellular location predictions were imported from the SUBA4 subcellular locale database (Hooper et al., 2017). SUBA4 uses multiple weighted lines of empirical evidence for protein localization in addition to aggregating subcellular targeting predictions from >20 programs, providing a broad-scale survey of likely subcellular association for the protein product of each transcript. As these databases use a variety of gene identifiers for their indexing, a table was developed within the Qlik database to translate between these various identifiers and the Entrez indexing within TOAST. This matrix linked the TAIR AGI with the associated Affymetrix microarray Probe IDs, RNAseq transcript IDs, along with associated Ensembl ID [imported from the Ensemble BioMart plant database; (Zerbino et al., 2018)], Entrez ID and if available, the Gene Symbols (i.e., the commonly used gene name). Rice cell culture microarray results from the Shenzhou 8 mission (Kindly provided by Dr. Peipei Xu, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology and Dr. Weiming Cai, Chinese Academy of Sciences) were also integrated into TOAST. To allow comparison to the Arabidopsis data, we adopted an orthologous matrix (OM) database-driven approach. Thus, the Ensembl genome database project (Kersey et al., 2018) has developed software to analyze the structure of the genomes of different organisms to identify genes between species that originated from a common ancestral gene prior to speciation [i.e., orthologous genes; (Altenhoff et al., 2018)], allowing researchers to ask if, e.g., transcriptome responses between species reflect similar patterns of classes of gene expression. To allow such comparisons within the TOAST database, we needed to be able to translate rice microarray probe IDs to orthologous Arabidopsis gene identifiers. We therefore imported the OM table from Ensembl, i.e., the table that links the rice and Arabidopsis orthologs through their Ensembl gene IDs. We then linked the rice microarray probe IDs provided in the imported rice datasets within this table to their corresponding Ensemble IDs, allowing mapping between the Arabidopsis and rice orthologs.The TOAST User Interface Figure 3 shows the web interface for TOAST, which launches as an overview menu of dashboard icons. Clicking on the first few dashboards links to introductory materials about space or Arabidopsis research providing an entry point for the non-specialist. Most of the remaining icons are links to datasets from individual experiments. The design of each icon gives quick visual information on the nature of the experiment (spacecraft, plant type, hardware, assay type) and clicking on the icon opens the particular dataset. The final set of icons represent links to online tools that can be used to further analyze the results emerging from using the TOAST database. The linked tools are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 . Figure 3. Open in a new tab The TOAST 4.5 user interface. (A) The web interface for TOAST launches an overview menu of dashboard icons allowing the user to directly access the introductory materials, omics data, and related analysis tools. (B) Each icon provides a visual summary of the data or tools that it links to including elements such as spaceflight vehicle (e.g., Shuttle, ISS, Shenzou vs ground-based experimentation), the growth hardware used, plant/seedling vs cell culture experiment, RNAseq vs microarray vs proteomics, species and ecotype and dataset identifier (e.g., GLDS number).Within TOAST, each dataset is presented to the user as an interactive dashboard with Log10-fold change and measure of statistical significance (P-value) provided for each locus as shown in Figure 4 . We have used P- rather than Q-value as our initial metric of significance to provide as broad an overview of significantly differentially expressed genes as possible. Q-values are corrected P-values that take into account the cumulative errors that occur when making multiple tests of significance within a large dataset. The Q-value is available in the downloadable data tables (see below), allowing users to apply this more stringent statistical metric as needed. Volcano plots (plots of fold-change versus statistical significance of that change for each gene ID) were chosen as the main way to visualize both the statistical analysis and the degree of gene induction or repression. A side table displays the gene identifier, the gene symbol, the fold-change and P-value and Q-value for each locus. The user can toggle on and off the P-value statistical significance filters on the volcano plot to rapidly assess the strength of the inferences to be drawn from the results that they are visualizing. All of these data can also be downloaded and used with a range of other databases that are linked in the TOAST overview menu ( Figure 3 ). TOAST 4.5 includes a GO database (Ashburner et al., 2000; Carbon et al., 2019) that provides real time feedback on the ontology of the subsets of genes selected. Tabs above the interactive bar charts allow access to four main types of annotation: GO Molecular function (16,504 categories), GO Cellular component (15,383 categories), GO Biological process (15,644 categories), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways [KEGG; (Kanehisa et al., 2017)]. KEGG is a widely used database that categorizes genes into the cellular pathways in which they are involved. In addition, gene selections can be interactively compared against the AGRIS transcription factor database [1,851 loci; (Palaniswamy et al., 2006)], the TAIR10 microRNA database (Lamesch et al., 2012), or be filtered using a selection of over 60 manually curated gene families. A further selection allows comparison to known sites of spaceflight-induced epigenetic modification (Zhou et al., 2019). These filters are applied using a drop-down menu.  PubMed links to any associated publication are also embedded alongside these data analysis tools to provide the critical context of the original published experimental descriptions and analyses (a summary of literature linked within TOAST is shown in Supplementary Table 1 ). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Graphical user interface for typical dataset. Clicking on a volcano plot also activates an interactive graphical tool for manual selection of groups of genes of interest. *Defaults to showing 33.43K, i.e., all Entrez identifiers, until a filter or gene selection is applied. Inset, a lasso tool allows user selection of data points from volcano plot in addition to activation of filters such as on significance of change, KEGG Pathway, or GO annotation.These data exploration features were implemented using D3 JavaScript software libraries executed within the Qlik environment, connecting the spaceflight data, its pre-computed statistics ( Figure 2 ) and information on functional ontology. This system architecture facilitates user interaction with massive amounts of data in real time. Thus, as shown in Figure 5 , the user selects a dashboard containing their initial dataset of interest. The software then allows them to interactively select genes or groups of genes either manually from the volcano plots, by filtering using gene ontology terms, or via a text-based interface as described above. As the user explores the data, they can apply further rounds of filtering and/or manual selection of groups of genes. These stacked filters spawn to all other datasets such that opening another dashboard of information on another experiment will show the equivalently filtered results. Further filtering of these newly opened data will, in turn, filter back on the original and all other datasets. This reiterative filtering approach allows the user to focus on an ever smaller number of genes selected by comparisons across multiple experiments. These results can be exported as a spreadsheet and/or passed to other web-based analytical sites linked within the TOAST interface. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Overview of use of the TOAST 4.5 database. (1a) The user selects an initial study of interest and then can review the summary of its metadata to ensure it is the correct focus for study (1b). The dataset is then opened and (2) when the study is selected an interactive dashboard launches and the user has a direct link to any associated manuscript. Gene filtering: statistical (3a), gene ontology (3b), and other related functional filters can be applied to focus the number of loci being visualized in the volcano plot (3c) to genes of interest. In addition, the volcano plot itself can be interactively manually filtered using a graphical selection tool. All filters can be toggled on and off using selectable tabs at the top of the interface (3d). If an interesting subset of loci are selected the user can activate the download option (4a) and save the related data in word or xml format (4b). (5) The user can also perform further bioinformatic and statistical analysis with other online tools linked from the main user interface.TOAST Metadata App A custom metadata app is also incorporated as a tool for use with TOAST (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata). This additional relational database provides data visualization tools that use the metadata associated with each dataset to find associations in factors such as experimental design parameters, hardware, and features of the spaceflight mission between different experiments in TOAST 4.5. GeneLab provides a rich array of metadata associated with its datasets. Most of the other non-GeneLab datasets incorporated into TOAST do not provide these kinds of metadata summaries and so we manually curated both the GeneLab and non-GeneLab datasets within TOAST 4.5 to provide equivalent metadata for all. These experiment-related factors are presented in Supplementary Table 3 and drive the visualizations presented in the metadata app. Figure 6A shows the main dashboard for the metadata app. Clicking on an icon launches the associated dashboard where interactive visualizations can, in turn, filter on the range of factors that are presented ( Figure 6B ). This architecture allows the user to explore commonalities in the available plant biology data in TOAST 4.5 ranging from lighting conditions, hardware or plant age at time of assay to analytical approach and even PI of the group performing the experiment (See Supplementary Table 3 for comprehensive list of factors). Within the app there are several places where “ROS meta-analysis variable” appears on the visualization. This description is used to denote that the data comes from a published meta-analysis of many publicly available microarray experiments related to responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS) called “The ROS-wheel” (Willems et al., 2016). Thus, for this particular comparative dataset there is not a single value of, e.g., for light level or plant age (as it is an aggregation of many individual experiments). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Analysis of metadata within the TOAST 4.5. (A) Initial dashboards allow access to comparisons between a range of experiment-related factors such as lighting conditions, growth environment, and plant genotypes. (B) A typical dashboard for metadata exploration, in this case for light conditions and age of seedling. Preset filters for e.g., lab group performing the research and growth and radiation environments are available to the user and the identity of the filtered datasets is shown in the bottom left window.Overview of the Plant RNAseq and Microarray Data Within TOAST 4.5 For the RNAseq data in TOAST, 42,220 transcript IDs are assigned to one of 37,019 distinct TAIR10 gene models. However, only 33,550 transcripts were detected within the data imported into TOAST 4.5 as being expressed either on Earth or during spaceflight. For microarrays, TOAST 4.5 links data gathered from 22,810 Arabidopsis Affymetrix probes IDs, 7,370 CATMA probe IDs, and 75,070 rice probe IDs. For Arabidopsis, the 42,220 Entrez loci ID's are associated with 13,750 detected proteins and, if it has been assigned, to one of the 25,270 Gene Symbols [drawn from the TAIR and ATTED II (Obayashi et al., 2018) gene databases combined]. For rice, 75,000 Affymetrix probe IDs are linked to the Arabidopsis Ensembl ID as described above. Note, in some microarrays a subset of the probes used have the potential for cross-hybridization and so to report on multiple gene responses. Similarly, many microarrays have redundant probes for each gene (e.g., in addition to gene unique probes, the ATH1 microarray also has 309 probes that redundantly monitor 148 genes). Where we have imported the original authors' analyses, we have used their approach to identifying and filtering these effects. When we had to reanalyze a dataset to conform to our requirements of presenting fold-change and P- and Q-values, then where a probe was identified as showing potential cross-hybridization effects, we have assigned a gene ID with both gene identifiers. Thus, e.g., a data point derived from a potentially cross-hybridizing probe represented on a volcano plot of fold-change versus significance would simultaneously show both gene IDs. For redundant probes, it is known that these often do not agree on expression levels (Cui and Loraine, 2009). This is likely due to the fact that each probe hybridizes to a different point on the gene and so effects such as differential splicing of that gene will cause probes to behave differently in the gene expression analysis. To be as inclusive as possible, the maximum value amongst each redundant probeset was therefore used. Most of the microarray data within the TOAST database is associated with the Affymetrix ATH1 chip, with Illumina-based RNAseq being the second most regularly used approach. For these experiments, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown under a range of growth hardware and lighting conditions. Experiments in the Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs) produced dark-grown samples in cassettes (Petri dish fixation units, PDFUs) that are sealed prior to launch [e.g., (Kwon et al., 2015; Basu et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019)]. Light-grown material was produced in the European Modular Cultivation System [EMCS, with variable RGB lighting and atmospheric and temperature control, e.g., (Correll et al., 2013; Herranz et al., 2019; Vandenbrink et al., 2019)], in SIMBOX [Science in Microgravity Box, LED lighting, e.g., (Fengler et al., 2015)], and in Petri dishes under 24 h LED light in the Veggie hardware [e.g., (Beisel et al., 2019)] or in the Advanced Biological Research System [ABRS, LED lighting; (Paul et al., 2013b)]. Both the EMCS and SIMBOX have a centrifuge, providing the capability for an extremely informative on-orbit 1 x g control [and for investigating other fractional g environment, e.g., (Correll et al., 2013; Fengler et al., 2015)]. The WS ecotype has been grown in the BRIC, ABRS, Veggie, and in Petri dishes attached to the ISS cabin wall (in both dim diffuse light and in total darkness). Thus, as data from a wide range of experiments has been imported into TOAST, it is important to assess the likely impact of features such as hardware, tissue samples, and seedling age when making comparisons between datasets. For example, differences in atmospheric control and lighting may have important influences on plant responses. Thus, plants grown in the BRIC (darkness, sealed system) might show altered hypoxic response when compared to those in the EMCS (lighting and atmospheric control). Careful attention to the parallel ground controls and, if available, on-orbit centrifuge data are critical to helping understand the extent of such effects. In addition to hardware and growth environment, some specific data features may also impact user analyses. For example, the Ler-0 ecotype was grown in both the EMCS and BRIC but the fact that different microarray technologies [Agilent vs Affymetrix; (Correll et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2017)] were used in each study needs to be taken into account when making comparisons. This is because results from these different measurement approaches, even when applied to replicate samples have been reported to differ in some cases [e.g., (Del Vescovo et al., 2013)]. Similarly, during the ABRS APEX01 study, Col-0 and WS samples were combined and then separated into roots, stems, and leaves for transcriptional analysis (Paul et al., 2013b). Therefore, when using these datasets allowance for the mixed ecotypes in the sample would need to be made. In addition to seedlings, cell cultures have been subjected to spaceflight. Thus, Zupanska et al. (2013) compared Arabidopsis seedlings and wild type cell cultures grown in the dark within the BRIC. Subsequent spaceflight experiments saw comparisons between wild-type Arabidopsis cell cultures and those with mutations in the genes for ALTERED RESPONSE TO GRAVITY 1 (ARG1; a well-studied Arabidopsis gene related to gravity sensing) and HEAT SHOCK FACTOR 2a [HSF2a; a key heat shock response-related transcriptional regulator; (Zupanska et al., 2017; Zupanska et al., 2019)]. Fengler et al. (2015) also flew Arabidopsis and rice cell cultures in the SIMBOX hardware on the Shenzhou-8 spacecraft. Interestingly, despite a large number of differences in the methodologies used in the preparation of the Arabidopsis cell cultures between these various experiments (notably culture age and hardware), TOAST analysis identifies three genes that are significantly differentially expressed in all sets of experiments (AT5G48560, CRY2-INTERACTING BHLH 2; AT1G73260, KUNITZ TRYPSIN INHIBITOR 1, and AT2G15220, a basic secretory protein family member). The sharing of such responses across multiple cell culture spaceflight experiments implies these changes in transcription may be linked to a common element of the spaceflight environment that impacts a physical factor related to spaceflight at a cellular-level. Facilitating such rapid, comparative analyses is a major focus of the TOAST 4.5 architecture.Non-Spaceflight Datasets Within TOAST Many ground-based analyses are relevant to specific aspects of the spaceflight environment. Therefore, several non-spaceflight datasets have been added to the TOAST database to aid with these comparative analyses. Thus, as you move further from the protection of the Earth's magnetic field radiation levels experienced by biological systems increase. Studies using ATH1 microarrays that study radiation effects on plants are therefore also included within TOAST. In these ground-based experiments, wild-type WS seedlings and mutants compromised in DNA repair (atm-1, atr-1) were treated with both gamma photons and high-charge, high-energy (HZE) radiation and their transcriptional response monitored (Culligan et al., 2006; Missirian et al., 2014). These studies provide fingerprints of transcriptional response to both increased radiation and increasing levels of DNA damage for comparison to the changes seen in spaceflight datasets. Likewise, data from Arabidopsis cell cultures grown while either experiencing magnetic levitation or growth on random positioning machines (Manzano et al., 2012) are also included in TOAST 4.5. These two techniques have been used to mimic elements of the spaceflight environment such as reduced contact with the substrate and disruption of directional cues normally derived from 1 x g on Earth, providing further useful comparisons to spaceflight responses. These gene expression datasets were obtained using the CATMA microarray technology and so some care should be taken when making comparisons to data from experiments using the ATH1 Affymetrix microarray as these two technologies are not identical and e.g., the data from the CATMA arrays was analyzed using the slightly older TAIR9 genome annotation to assign gene IDs (Lamesch et al., 2012). The BRIC hardware is one of the most widely used plant growth systems for spaceflight and so TOAST also contains a dataset related to growth of plants in the BRIC hardware on Earth to help provide context for analyses in that particular piece of equipment (Basu et al., 2017). Many spaceflight samples are also preserved on orbit in the chemical fixative RNAlater and so TOAST includes a dataset on the effects of RNAlater on Arabidopsis seedlings (GLDS-38). In addition, as there are several spaceflight studies that present data on root responses to spaceflight, a root tip transcriptome (Krishnamurthy et al., 2018) and root tissue gene expression mapping (Birnbaum et al., 2003) are also included for comparative analyses. It is important to note that the ground-based studies incorporated into TOAST are not an exhaustive survey of the publicly available datasets but are intended as an entry point for such comparative analysis. A summary of the non-spaceflight datasets incorporated into TOAST 4.5 is presented in Supplementary Table 1 .TOAST Confirms and Extends Previous Transcriptome Analyses Oxidative stress has been highlighted as a likely spaceflight-related response in multiple experiments. Therefore, TOAST 4.5 also includes datasets/dashboards for comparative “ROS wheel” analyses. The ROS wheel (Willems et al., 2016) is a meta-analysis of 79 Affymetrix ATH1 microarray studies related to Arabidopsis redox homeostasis experiments. It provides a comprehensive overview of ROS and oxidative stress-related transcriptional signatures, allowing TOAST to filter for ROS-related events within spaceflight datasets. For example, Choi et al. (2019) noted the “high light early” oxidative stress signature from the ROS wheel as a common feature of the responses of Arabidopsis in the BRIC-19 spaceflight experiment. “High light early” is one of the groupings (clades) of response defined in the ROS wheel analysis and refers to the common ROS-related transcriptional signature seen in a set of experiments all exposing plants to a high light intensity stress for between 30 min and 2 h. Figure 7 shows that reanalysis with TOAST confirms this patterning with ~⅓ of the genes significantly altered in spaceflight in Col-0 in the BRIC19 experiment also being significantly modulated in the ROS wheel “high light early” response clade. The power of these comparative approaches is shown using TOAST to perform similar analyses on other spaceflight transcriptomes. Thus, in (Beisel et al., 2019); the APEX3-2 experiment (GLDS-218; using the Veggie hardware and Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype) TOAST analysis reveals that at 4 days of growth on orbit, 533 of the significantly differentially expressed genes in the root in response to spaceflight were also seen in the “high light early” clade of the ROS wheel. This pattern is reiterated through the time-course of the experiment (day 8, 295 transcripts and at day 11, 29 in the root and 265 in the shoot tissues). Analyses across other spaceflight experiments ( Supplementary Table 4 ) shows that such regulation of “high light early” genes is seen in many flight experiments using whole seedlings. Interrogation with the metadata app shows these experiments mostly include plants grown in the dark, suggesting that while the triggering of a “high light early” oxidative stress pathway may be a common response of plant biology to some feature of the spaceflight environment, this is unlikely to be due to high light levels. Figure 7. Open in a new tab TOAST confirms the “high light early” ROS response from spaceflight data. The “high light early” clade in the ROS wheel analysis represents 8.87K transcripts from a total of 21.33K transcripts detected, or 41.5% of all transcripts.Cross-Species Analyses Using TOAST TOAST 4.5 also allows for seamless cross-species comparisons that offer the possibility to reveal fundamental elements of plant biology response to spaceflight. For example, when we used TOAST to compare the significantly differentially expressed genes in rice cell cultures grown on the Shenzhou 8 spacecraft with the Arabidopsis cell cultures from the same flight, 483 orthologous loci were identified (filtering on P-value <0.05, Q-value < 0.05 and for genes mapping to unique Ensembl gene Identifiers; Supplementary Table 5 ). The expression of, for example, genes encoding receptor-like kinases thought to be involved in response to pathogens were altered in both species, indicating that spaceflight-induced changes in the response system to biotic stress might be a conserved plant spaceflight response. Importantly, these samples were grown under sterile conditions on orbit, suggesting these responses were triggered without pathogen stimulus. In addition, both cell cultures showed changes in the expression of genes related to cell wall structure, a theme already highlighted in several reports on Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight [e.g., (Choi et al., 2014; Kwon et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017)] and readily discernable as a transcriptional pattern from TOAST analyses of these same spaceflight samples. Comparison between the datasets from these cell culture samples grown under microgravity with those in the 1 x g on-orbit centrifuge control module within the SIMBOX hardware of this experiment showed 111 of the genes that were significantly differentially expressed in spaceflight vs ground controls in both Arabidopsis and rice cultures were also differentially expressed in the flight vs 1 x g centrifuge ( Supplementary Table 5 ). That is, these genes were most likely not responding to the microgravity component of the spaceflight environment (which is nullified by centrifugation). Thus, some other feature(s) of spaceflight, such as increased background radiation or the development of microgravity-induced hypoxia [e.g., (Choi et al., 2019)] may be affecting this particular response.TOAST: Survey of Spaceflight Responsive Genes Implies Alterations in Mitochondrial Function Manual inspection of the subcellular locations presented in the TOAST interface suggested to us a potentially common element: mitochondria-related transcripts appeared to often be significantly altered in spaceflight samples. Therefore, to more closely identify possibly conserved spaceflight-related changes to mitochondrial function, 2,290 genes annotated as belonging to the “mitochondrion” were selected using the “GO subcellular location” tool embedded in TOAST's graphical user interface as shown in Figure 8A . Using this filter, significantly differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05) were acquired from the analyses of Arabidopsis Col-0 plants grown in space in either light or dark conditions. In total, 1,233 unique differentially expressed mitochondrial genes were identified from the following light-grown experiments: root tips in CARA (GLDS-120), roots from both four and 8 day old seedlings cultivated in APEX-03's Veggie growth system (GLDS-218), the elongation zones of seedlings (GLDS-208), and undifferentiated cell cultures flown in Shenzhou 8's SIMBOX plant growth hardware (Fengler et al., 2015). Figure 8B shows that of these 1,233 differentially expressed transcripts, 382 were identified as being shared between at least two datasets, with eight genes being shared across all four experiments ( Supplementary Table 5 ). When further comparisons were made using different sample times or assay types as a further distinction within these data ( Figure 8C ), only one gene, alternative Oxidase 1A (AOX1A) was found to be common amongst the significantly differentially expressed genes in all conditions of the four selected experiments. These results suggest analysis of plant mitochondrial functioning during spaceflight may be a fruitful area of research. Indeed, Sugimoto et al. (2014) previously identified an alternative oxidase in mizuna grown on the ISS in the Lada growth chamber (i.e., in the light) as showing 9.2-fold induction during spaceflight. While the majority of the selected experiments report induction of AOX1A, instances of repression were also identified in roots extracted from four day and 8 day old seedlings grown in APEX-03's Veggie growth system.

(D) Similar analysis but for dark grown plant samples. (E) The effects of spaceflight on the alternative oxidase gene family in dark grown samples. Maximum likelihood tree of AOX gene family generated using ClustalW alignment with Mega-X software (www.megasoftware.net). Venn diagrams plotted using jvenn (Bardou et al., 2014).Furthermore, AOX1A is significantly induced in both the SIMBOX “Flight Static” vs “Ground Static” analyses (i.e. samples grown in microgravity compared to ground controls), and in the ‘Flight Centrifuge' vs “Ground Static” comparisons (i.e., plants grown at 1 x g on orbit vs ground controls not in a centrifuge). However, no significant difference of expression is observed when comparing the “Flight Static” vs “Flight Centrifuge” environments. These results highlight the power of being able to make comparisons to an on-board 1 x g control. The data suggest that the induction of AOX1A in light-grown undifferentiated cells is likely not a microgravity-driven event but reflects some other aspect of the spaceflight environment, such as increased radiation exposure, possible development of hypoxia or altered fluid dynamics. The datasets chosen for the TOAST analysis above that highlight AOX1A originate from experiments with samples grown under light. To explore whether the light environment might be playing a role in this suite of responses, several “dark-grown” spaceflight studies of the Col-0 ecotype were also selected using the TOAST metadata app: etiolated seedlings and undifferentiated cell cultures grown aboard BRIC19 (GLDS-37), BRIC20 (GLDS-38), BRIC16 (GLDS-17, GLDS-44), and etiolated root tips extracted from the CARA experiment (GLDS-120). Comparisons between these datasets revealed no commonly regulated genes ( Figure 8D ) and AOX1A was only significantly differentially expressed in the BRIC19 study in this analysis. Therefore, we examined the spaceflight-related transcriptional responses in the other members of the AOX gene family ( Figure 8E ). Indeed, other alternative oxidases are differentially expressed in these other “dark-grown” experiments, with each AOX gene being differentially expressed in at least one selected “dark-grown” study ( Figure 8E ). Given these altered expression patterns of members of the AOX family in multiple experiments, these results suggest that the regulation of alternative oxidases in response to spaceflight-associated stressors would be a strong candidate for future research studies. Thus, this analysis in TOAST suggests a potentially widespread alteration in mitochondrial function in plants experiencing spaceflight, but many questions arise from these observations. Is an alternative oxidase pathway being triggered by spaceflight stress? Could mitochondrial dysfunction be a significant element in the oxidative stress responses seen in plant spaceflight data, as suggested e.g., for mammalian ocular tissues (Mao et al., 2013) or osteoblasts experiencing microgravity (Michaletti et al., 2017)? This kind of comparative data mining highlights the possibilities for hypothesis generation supported by the TOAST environment. However, here it is important to note some of the limitations inherent in these kinds of analyses. For example, hypoxia is thought to be imposed during spaceflight by local oxygen consumption and associated depletion around metabolically active tissues. The reduced convective gas mixing inherent in microgravity (Porterfield, 2002) then lowers oxygen resupply leading to development of a depletion zone around these tissues. Such hypoxic stress would be an obvious potential modulator of mitochondrial function. Yet, hypoxic signatures do not readily emerge from GO analysis of the transcript profiles of the plant spaceflight datasets, yet hypoxia is a term that GO enrichment analyses can highlight. Thus, one possibility is that another, yet to be defined, physical element(s) of the spaceflight environment may act to drive these changes in mitochondrial function. However, the formation of hypoxic environments due to microgravity is likely to be very different from how hypoxia either develops naturally on Earth, or can be experimentally imposed in ground-based experimentation. For example, the steep local oxygen depletion zones that form in microgravity are more likely to be disrupted by convective gas mixing on Earth. This observation highlights one of the important caveats of relying strongly on GO analyses to understand spaceflight data. Gene ontology analyses match patterns of gene expression to those seen under particular conditions on Earth. Therefore, how well treatments on Earth mimic conditions developing during spaceflight may affect the sensitivity of such GO analyses for defining these spaceflight responses. Similarly, it is important to ask how much batch effects might be superimposed on any particular analysis (Leek et al., 2010). Batch effects are where measurements are impacted by a non-biological treatment related factor that systematically changes the measurement. For example, for RNAseq, a batch effect might be differences in patterns of gene expression related to the day a particular set of samples was processed for sequencing rather than the biological treatment of the samples. For microarray analyses it could be differences imposed by different batches of microarray being used for different sets of samples. Batch effects can be complex to resolve but statistical approaches such as surrogate variable analysis (Leek and Storey, 2007; Leek et al., 2010) can be used on a case-by-case basis by the researcher to estimate the sensitivity of a particular dataset's analysis to these kinds of effects and so help build a case for the robustness of the analysis.Conclusions As the volume of spaceflight omics-level data increases, its power will lie in researchers' ability to mine both within and across multiple datasets. Such comparisons will provide an important source of hypotheses to then be experimentally tested. TOAST provides a data-rich environment with which to explore the commonalities and differences in the responses of plants to spaceflight and spaceflight-related environments in an accessible and intuitive format. The TOAST database has been released as a publicly available, web-based environment (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) along with an online tutorial at https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata. At present, TOAST provides a tool to aid the plant biology community. However, the underlying TOAST architecture is biological kingdom agnostic; through use of orthologous matrix mapping, we are working to extend TOAST to facilitate similar data exploration across the wealth of biological systems that are being analyzed in spaceflight.Data Availability Statement The datasets analyzed for this study can be found in the GeneLab data repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Author Contributions RB developed the database.
