    "abstract": "Abstract Astronauts exhibit an assortment of clinical abnormalities in their eyes during long-duration spaceflight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in the retina or alters the epigenetic clock. The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were maintained under similar housing conditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing. We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Several biological pathways involved in retinal diseases such as macular degeneration were significantly altered. Our results indicated that spaceflight decelerated the retinal epigenetic clock. This study demonstrates that spaceflight impacts the retina at the epigenomic and transcriptomic levels, and such changes could be involved in the etiology of eye-related disorders among astronauts. Keywords: spaceflight, DNA methylome, transcriptome, epigenetic clock",
    "introduction": "Introduction The spaceflight environment contains two major risk factors, irradiation and microgravity, which are thought to induce adverse effects on astronauts’ vision and central nervous systems,1–4 and in particular, the eye and retina.5,6 Studies reported that more than 30% of astronauts returning from Space Shuttle missions or the International Space Station (ISS) were diagnosed with eye problems that reduced visual acuity.3,7 Furthermore, a recent study showed that spaceflight induced significant apoptosis in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) of mice.8 Previous work has also shown that many genes involved in oxidative stress and mitochondria-associated apoptosis are altered in the retinas of space-flown mice, and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis plays an important role in response to space irradiation in mouse retinas.9–11 Previous research on space-induced visual impairment in astronauts has primarily utilized proteomics and microarray technologies to better understand the biological effects of spaceflight on the mouse retina; these studies collectively reveal that spaceflight alters the expression of certain genes and proteins involved in cell death, mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, neuronal and glial cell loss, and axonal degeneration in mice.9,12 Although there are studies analyzing the transcriptome in human retinas, none has been done under spaceflight conditions.13–16 Thus, the mechanisms underlying the spaceflight-induced vision impairment remain largely unknown. Even though spaceflight-induced transcriptomic reprogramming in mouse retinas was recently reported,17 there has been no study of the effects of spaceflight on the retina methylome or the epigenetic clocks of animals or humans. There is great enthusiasm both within the scientific community and society in general with the ambitious plans for the return of manned missions to the moon and long-duration (>300 days) space travel to Mars and beyond. However, a comprehensive assessment of the adverse effects on the human body is still incomplete. In a recent NASA Twins Study, some persistent changes in gene expression, DNA damage, telomeres, neuro-ocular and cognitive function were observed when comparing the spaceflight twin brother to his earth-bound twin.18 It has also been shown that long-duration spaceflight changes gene regulation at both the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, although the majority of these changes return to the preflight level six months after returning to earth. As part of a NASA research consortium to accelerate spaceflight risk characterization and to gather omics data to allow robust predictions of cellular response in organisms exposed to long-duration spaceflight, we investigated the DNA methylome, epigenetic clock and transcriptome of retinas from mice flown on a long-duration 37-day mission, the human equivalent of 4.1 years, as part of the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) project. We identified differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spaceflight and ground control mice. In addition, as epigenetic clocks have been used to predict tissue biological ages and age-related diseases in both humans19 and mice20,21, we calculated spaceflight-induced epigenetic clock based on the DNA methylation at unique CpG sites of mouse retinas to predict the retinal tissue aging due to the spaceflight. This study provides new insights into the visual impairment due to long-duration spaceflight.",
    "methods": "Methods Study design Figure 1 illustrates the overall study design. The 16-week-old female C57 BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in this study as part of the NASA RR-1 project consortium. This project was approved by the NASA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Both spaceflight and ground control animals were housed in NASA's animal enclosure modules (AEM), with control mice being exposed to the same environment conditions (12-hour light cycle, temperature and humidity) as those flown on the International Space Station (ISS). Control animals were kept inside an environmental simulator (ISSES) at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the spaceflight animals were transported to the ISS by SpaceX4 on September 21, 2014. All animals were fed with a special NASA food bar diet and their health was checked daily. The spaceflight mice were euthanized and frozen on-orbit after 37 days of flight, while ground control mice were simultaneously euthanized and frozen under identical conditions. After the frozen carcasses were returned to KSC, the ocular tissues were removed from both groups. DNA and RNA were extracted from the same retinal sample and were used for library constructions using NuGEN Ovation® RRBS and Ovation® Mouse RNA-seq library construction kits, respectively. Libraries were multiplexed with unique sample indices, pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550. FastQ files were subject to FastQC, adapter and low-quality reads trimming before mapping to mouse genome  GRCm38. Differential CpG methylation regions and differential expressed genes were determined after mapping and counting, and the resulting DMR and DEG lists were subject to IPA and DAVID gene functional analysis. The epigenetic clock was determined using the MouseEpigeneticClock script developed by Stubbs et al. (2017).20 Dissection and preservation of the mouse ocular samples At the time of dissections, both eyes were dissected from the carcasses thawed at room temperature for 15–20 minutes. The eyes were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80 °C. The frozen whole eye samples were micro-dissected in the ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fine spring scissors were used to separate the cornea from the sclera to access the retina. The retina was carefully detached from the sclera. The retina, cornea, and lens were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C before DNA and RNA isolations. DNA and RNA isolations Retinal tissues (4–20 mg) were homogenized with Precellys CKM beads (Hilden, Germany) in 350 µl of Qiagen RLT plus buffer. The genomic DNA (gDNA) and total RNA were isolated using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After isolation, RNA and DNA were frozen and kept at −80 °C until further use. Isolated RNA samples were quantified using NanoDrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific, Chino, CA). DNA and RNA were further quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and RNA Broad Range Kit, respectively (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and RNA ScreenTape (Santa Clara, CA). All RNA samples had an integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 7.2 to 8.1. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) library construction One hundred (100) ng of gDNA was used to construct RRBS DNA-seq library using the Ovation® RRBS Methyl-Seq System (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the MspI enzyme, which cuts the DNA at CCGG sites, was used to digest gDNA into fragments. The fragments were directly subject to end blunting and phosphorylation in preparation for ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. A unique index, out of 16 indices, was used for each individual sample for multiplexing. The ligation products were repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60 °C–10 min, 70 °C–10 min, hold at 4 °C). The products of the final repair reaction were used for bisulfite conversion using QIAGEN EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit according to Qiagen's protocol. Bisulfite-converted DNA was then amplified (Mastercycler® pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and bead-purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP beads. RNA-seq library construction The Ovation® Mouse RNA-Seq System 1–16 (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) was used to construct RNA-seq libraries according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA spiked with 1 µl of 1:500 diluted ERCC Mix 1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used to start cDNA synthesis. Following the primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products (130 µl/each sample) were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4 °C for 200 seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. The products were then subject to end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. A custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version 5 for mouse was used to allow strand selection. Finally, the libraries were amplified on a PCR thermocycler for 17 cycles (Mastercycler® pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN); and quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kit on Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The quality and peak size were determined using the D1000 ScreenTape on Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RRBS and RNA-seq library sequencing The RRBS libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550, 75 bp, single-end read, whereas the RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on both Illumina NextSeq 550 and HiSeq 4000, pair-end reads (75 bpx2), at the Loma Linda University (LLU) Center for Genomics. Bioinformatics pipelines For the RRBS data, we used a pipeline that integrates the read quality assessment (FastQC, v0.11.6), trimming process (TrimGalore,40 v0.4.5, NuGEN diversity trimming and N6 de-duplicate scripts), alignment (Bismark,41 v0.16.34), and differential methylation analysis using MethylKit42 (v0.1.0) and DMAP43 (v2.8.1). This pipeline facilitates a rapid transition from sequencing reads to a fully annotated CpG methylation report for biological interpretation. Briefly, the RRBS raw fastq data were first trimmed using Trim Galore. The mouse genome  GRCm38 downloaded from iGenome (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html/Musmusculu/Mus_musculus__GRCm38.tar.gz), was used as a reference genome. Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome with Bismark (v0.16.34) by default parameter settings. The methylation call files including the location of each CpG site and the methylation percentage were generated by the bismark_methylation_extractor function. The aligned SAM files were further processed through DMAP to generate CpG region profile using function ‘diffmeth’ (options: -A 40, 220, -N -I 6). The CpG regions with coverage by a minimum 20 reads in all samples were used for further analysis. For the RNA-seq data, we adopted the pipelines used in our recent publications44,45 for mRNA-seq data visualization, which integrated the QC (FastQC,46 ShortRead,47 v1.48.0), trimming process (trimmomatic,48 v0.35), alignment (Tophat2,49 v2.2.1), reads quantification (cufflinks,50 v2.2.1), and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis (cuffdiff,51 v 2.2.1) for mRNA-seq data analyses. Briefly, the RNA-seq raw fastq data were first trimmed using Trimmomatic (options: Leading: 20, Trailing:20, Crop:75, Headcrop:5, Slidingwindow: 4:15, Minlen: 35). The trimmed reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome ( GRCm38) using TopHat2 (default parameter settings). The aligned bam files were then processed using Cufflinks for gene quantification. The reads that were unable to align to the mouse genome were converted to fastq format using SamToFastq function in Picard (v1.11.4) for ERCC mapping and calculation in which the reads were mapped to ERCC transcripts and quantified using TopHat2 and Cufflinks (default parameter settings). The genes with FPKM ≥ 1 in all samples were used for DEG analysis. The DEGs were identified by Cuffdiff with FDR ≤ 0.3, and fold change (FC) ≥ 1.2 (P ≤ 0.05). All bioinformatics pipelines were run with default parameters if not specified otherwise. Epigenetic clock calculation We used a mouse epigenetic clock algorithm developed by Stubbs et al. (2017)20 to estimate the biological age of the retinas of spaceflight mice, using the MouseEpigeneticClock script on the methylation coverage files with default parameter of read depth threshold at 5. The mouse age estimator, based on the methylation of 329 CpG loci, was shown to accurately measure the epigenetic clock—biological age across multiple mouse tissues.19 Gene networks, pathway and functional annotation analyses The analyses on the gene networks, canonical and bio-functional pathways regulated by spaceflight at both DNA methylome and transcriptome were performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen). The sets of 177 differentially expressed genes and 643 differentially methylated genes were input into the IPA database to discover canonical, diseases and bio-functional networks possibly regulated by spaceflight. The complete IPA analysis summary is shown in the supplementary files. We also applied the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) to the lists of DEGs and DMGs to identify the functional enrichment of the spaceflight-induced gene expression changes to biologically relevant categories. PCA computation and statistical analysis PCA components were computed from normalized gene expression counts of 177 DEGs, or the beta values of all differentially methylated CpGs. Specifically, the missing values in input data were handled by the ‘imputePCA’ function from R package ‘missMDA’ (v1.18). Then, PCA was performed using ‘prcomp’ (scale = FALSE) function from R package ‘stats’ (v3.6.2). Finally, the contributions of each PCA component were extracted using ‘get_eigenvalue’ function. For DEG analysis, an FC ≥ 1.2 with P ≤ 0.05 (FDR ≤ 0.3) was used as a threshold to select DEGs. For DMG analysis, a methylation change ≥ 10% (FDR ≤ 0.05) was used as a threshold to select DMGs. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and DAVID Functional Annotation Tool to identify canonical pathways. For other statistics analysis, data were presented as mean ± SD, and were analyzed using two-tailed Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey's post hoc test. P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Experimental number (N) represents the number of animals tested in each group.",
    "results": "Results Study design and overall QC of RRBS DNA methylome and RNA-seq transcriptome data To study the effects of spaceflight on retinal tissue epigenomic and transcriptomic changes, we constructed 18 reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) libraries with one sample being removed from downstream analysis due to low quality (8 flight vs. 9 ground control mice) and 18 RNA-seq libraries (9 flight vs. 9 ground control mice). Figure 1 shows the study design. Fragment sizes of RRBS library were between 200 and 500 bp, with a peak around 300 bp. RNA-seq library size distribution ranged between 200–500 bp, with a peak around 280 bp. To monitor the quality of the RNA-seq, we also added External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls in an amount equivalent to about 1% of the total RNA in each sample before RNA-seq library construction. We generated ∼778 million reads of 75-bp single-end RRBS DNA methylome data and 764 million reads (75 bp × 2) of pair-end RNA-seq transcriptomic data, corresponding to an average of ∼45.8 million (N = 17) sequence reads per RRBS sample, and 42.5 million (N = 18) sequence reads per RNA-seq sample (Supplementary Table S3). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Study design. This study was under the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) project consortium. Spaceflight mice after flight were euthanized and frozen on orbit. The retinas were isolated from both the ground habitat control and flight mice after returning to ground. RNA and DNA were extracted from the retinas, and then RRBS and RNA-seq libraries were constructed to obtain DNA methylome and transcriptome, respectively. Retinal epigenetic age was calculated using MouseEpigeneticClock script. Disease and bio-functional pathways were generated using the DAVID GO functional annotation and the Ingenuity Pathway through Analysis (IPA) based on DMGs & DEGs.High-quality reads were obtained from both RRBS and RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig. S1). We aligned the RRBS DNA-seq methylome data, 75 bp single reads to the  mouse GRCm38 genome. On average, 62.48% of the reads were aligned to the genome with an average of 26.3 million (N = 17) aligned reads per sample (Supplementary Table S3). The aligned reads were further annotated, resulting in an average of 1.84 million (N = 17) CpG sites covered by at least 10 reads. For RNA-seq transcriptomic data, we aligned the 75 × 2 bp fastq reads to the  mouse GRCm38 genome,  GRCm38 gene model, and ERCC transcripts. Overall, ∼85.05% (N = 18) of the reads were aligned to the genome uniquely, and 0.35% (N = 18) to the ERCC transcripts. Among the reads aligned to the genome, 56.03% (N = 18) to the exons, 20.88% (N = 18) to the introns. Scatterplots of ERCC log2 (FPKM) vs. log2 (spike-in concentration) showed an overall linear relationship (R2 = 0.94) between the observed and the expected transcripts of the ERCC spike-in controls (Supplementary Fig. S1G). Global epigenomic and transcriptomic changes in the retinas of spaceflight mice Overall, 31.2 million CpGs, ranging from 1.6 million to 2.1 million CpGs per sample, were used to study the genome-wide CpG methylation patterns in terms of the relationship to the genomic features. The profiling CpG methylation patterns revealed that the spaceflight mice were hypomethylated globally compared to ground mice (P = 0.034, two-tailed t-test, Fig. 2A). A significant lower CpG methylation level was observed within CG islands compared to CpG shores in both ground and spaceflight mice (P < 2.2E−16, two-tailed t-test). In addition, the level of methylation was significantly higher in the introns compared to exons in both groups (P < 2.2E−16, two-tailed t-test). The methylation at the transcription starting site (TSS) had the lowest methylation compared to other genomic regions (promoter, exon and intron) in both spaceflight and ground mice. Furthermore, 62.5% of the 643 differentially methylated genes were hypomethylated and 37.5% were hypermethylated (Fig. 2B). Annotation of differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) revealed that a large portion of the DMCs were located in introns, followed by intergenic regions and exons. About 15% of the DMCs were located in promoters (Fig. 2C). Principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2D) and hierarchial cluster analysis (HCA) (Fig. 2E) based on DMCs showed a clear difference between spaceflight and ground control mice. Overall, the methylation data clearly demonstrated that spaceflight induced profound DNA methylation changes. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Spaceflight caused global epigenomic changes in mouse retina.

(E) HCA plots based on DMCs. (F) Epigenetic ages calculated using Stubb's age estimator based on retinal methylomes.As DNA methylation has been successfully used to predict epigenetic clock—biological age,22 we determined the epigenetic clocks of the retinas of spaceflight and control mice, using Stubbs’ epigenetic clock predictor.20 The differences of Stubbs’ predicted biological ages between the spaceflight and ground control mice were tested using Welch's two-sample t-test, which showed a significant age deceleration in spaceflight mice relative to ground mice (1.7 vs. 2.4 weeks, P = 0.049 on two-tailed t-test) (Fig. 2F). It is worth noting that the predicted epigenetic ages were much younger than the true chronological ages (21.2 weeks). Our RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis identified 177 DEGs (fold change ≥ 1.2, P ≤ 0.05 and FDR ≤ 0.3), including both up- and down-regulated genes (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S1). Similar to what was observed in the methylome dataset, a distinct separation was observed between the spaceflight and ground control mice based on both the PCA and HCA on the DEGs (Figs. 3B and 3C). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Spaceflight induced global alterations on gene expression and the distribution of DMCs and DEGs across chromosomes. (A) Volcano plot showing significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs, fold change > 1.2 and P ≤ 0.05). Red and blue triangle indicates the number of up-regulated or down-regulated DEGs, respectively. DEGs with more than 50% expression change are highlighted in red (up-regulated) and blue (down-regulated). (B) PCA using the spaceflight induced DEGs. The normalized expressions of 177 DEGs were used for PCA computation and no sample was filtered out. (C) HCA plots based on DEGs between spaceflight mouse retinas and ground controls. (D) Circos plot showing the distribution of DMCs and DEGs across chromosomes. Y chromosome was excluded as only female mice were used in the study.We further examined the alteration patterns due to the spaceflight on the DNA methylome and transcriptome across chromosomes using Circos plotting (Fig. 3D). Despite that differentially methylated regioins (DMRs) were observed on each chromosome (chromosome Y was excluded as only female mice were used in this study), the DMRs were not evenly distributed across chromosome as well as at certain particular chromosome regions, suggesting that some chromosomes or regions were more prone to methylation modification. For instance, Chr X harbored the most DMRs, followed by Chr 4 and 7. In addition, some regions, e.g., Chr 4: 95 278 373–155 343 067 and Chr 2: 118 262 949–159 068 995, exhibited locally enriched DMRs. Although many DMRs were observed in certain chromosomes, e.g., Chr 2, 4, 5, 14, and X, there were fewer DEGs in these chromosomes (61 DMRs vs. 3 DEGs observed on Chr X; 30 DMRs vs. 14 DEGs observed on Chr 11), suggesting a differential or relatively less sensitive response in the gene expression of retinal tissue to spaceflight. Biological functions and pathways affected by spaceflight in mouse retinas at transcriptome and DNA methylome, respectively Pathways and functions affected in mouse retina by spaceflight based on DEGs The IPA based on DEGs identified many significantly enriched canonical pathways (negative log10[P-value] >1.3, i.e., P ≤ 0.05) due to spaceflight (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S2). A large number of enriched pathways had a significantly negative Z-score (suppressed) and were associated with down-regulated DEGs (Figs. 4A and 4C). Enriched canonical pathways mainly belonged to two biological processes: 1) the junction/connection including G6P signaling, osteoarthritis signaling, and ILK signaling pathways; and 2) the inflammation/proliferation including PDGF signaling, CXCR4 signaling, actin cytoskeleton signaling, and NF-κB signaling. Many other biological pathways, such as hepatic fibrosis, IGF-1 signaling, epithelial adherent junction, and tight junction (Supplementary Table S2), were enriched by spaceflight with significant P values, but zero Z-scores due to a lack of other relevant supporting evidence. These pathways were functionally linked to the extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Notably, many of the genes in the above pathways enriched and impacted by spaceflight in this study were also observed in NASA Twins Study,18 such as Ilk, Pdgf, Cxcr4, Igf-1 and Nf-κb. At the individual gene level, a large number of DEGs fell into the categories of wound healing/cell growth/cell motility, inflammation defense, mitochondria metabolism, and oxidative stress (Table 1, Fig. 4A). In summary, the IPA analysis indicated impaired cell-to-cell connection and subsequent repair. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Functional enrichments based on spaceflight induced DEGs and DMGs.

Open in a new tabIn addition, based on the functional similarity, the DAVID analysis identified 47 genes out of 177 DEGs as secreted/extracellular proteins, and 17 genes of those 47 DEGs were the EMC components (Table 2). Furthermore, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, wound healing process, and insulin-like growth (IGF) factor signaling were enriched by 12, 9.9, and 6 folds, respectively, in spaceflight mouse retinas as compared to those housed in AEM (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1, P ≤ 0.01). Several genes enriched in the TGF-β group, such as Pdgfra, Nog, and Dcn, were significantly down-regulated (P ≤ 0.05, N = 9 per group). The transcriptional factors such as hormone-retinoid receptors Nr4a1, Nr4a3, zinc finger transcriptional factor Egr1, and connective tissue growth factor Ctgf were observed to be down-regulated in spaceflight mouse retinas (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, the majority of the top up-regulated DEGs were the structural protein genes, like Krt1, Krt10, and Adamts3, which is consistent with the notion that spaceflight activates inflammation and cell survival mechanisms. In summary, consistent with the IPA analysis, the David functional analysis suggested that spaceflight compromised cell proliferation and mobility necessary for retinal wound healing. Table 2.

The enriched groups with a P-value ≤ 0.05 were listed.Pathways and functions affected in mouse retina by spaceflight based on DMGs We identified 434 hypomethylated and 209 hypermethylated genes, using 10% difference on methylation and P < 0.05 (N = 9 for each group) as criteria (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S1). Out of those 643 DMGs, 118 had at least one differentially methylated cytosine located within a CpG island and 108 had DMC located in the promoter regions (34 hypomethylation and 74 hypermethylation) (Fig. 2C), indicating epigenetic regulation of transcriptional changes in spaceflight compared to ground control mice. Furthermore, 22 hypermethylated genes and 35 hypomethylated genes had DMCs located in both CpG islands and exon areas. We used the DAVID Functional Clustering to examine how spaceflight-induced methylome changes would affect retinal cell function. The data revealed that a substantial amount of DMGs were linked to cell structure and tissue morphology, with significant P values and fold enrichment (Figs. 4B and 4D and Supplementary Table S2). Specifically, 35 DMGs were related to the cell junction, 17 DMGs were related to the extracellular matrix, and 8 DMGs were related to the tight junction. Another 20 DMGs were members of collagen and fibronectin gene families, with fold enrichment values of 3.4 (P < 0.05) and 3.1 (P < 0.01), respectively. Further, functional clustering revealed that DNA methylation might play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and organism development (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2). For instance, 24 DMGs were linked to cell differentiation and 38 DMGs were linked to multicellular organism development. In addition, 6 DMGs (fold enrichment value of 8.1, P < 0.01) were positive regulators of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and several other DMGs were the components of Hippo and TGF-β signaling pathways. DMGs-based functional analysis demonstrated consistent shifts in cell function and agreed well with those observed in transcriptome analysis. DMGs-based IPA analysis portrayed a concerted hypermethylation on several retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway genes (Supplementary Fig. S2). Among those were Rho (rhodopsin; light perception), Vegfa (vascular endothelial growth factor A), Tgfb1 (cell growth factor), Bcl2l11 (apoptosis facilitator), Mmp2 (matrix metallopeptidase 14), Wnt5a (transcription factor), and N32e1 (retinal transcription factor). Consistent with the changes in RA signaling, Nxph1 gene, which is involved in neuronal synaptic transmission, was highly methylated. Genes with decreased methylation included Smad2, Smad3, Sod3, Tnfrsf19, Edn2, and Dnmt3l (Supplementary Table S2). Six mitochondrial membrane solute transporter genes (Slc22a2, Slc25a25, Slc25a33, Slc35f3, Slc6a17, and Slc6a8) were hypomethylated, suggesting that mitochondrial function was affected during spaceflight. Further functional analysis suggested that spaceflight could induce morphological changes in many retinal cell types. The putative morphology changes were evidenced by the extensive functional overlaps of 9 DMGs (5 hypermethylated: Erc2, Neurog2, ATP8A2, App,andRarg; 4 hypomethylated: Rho, Vegfa, Hes1,andDiscam) (Supplementary Table S2). Particularly, functional enrichment analysis indicated that at least two DMGs were involved in the abnormal morphological development in horizontal cells, photoreceptor cells, retinal layer cells, and retinal rods on the photo-receptor side and bipolar cells and neurons on the transmitter side. Our recent study of RR-9 flight mice also confirmed the spaceflight-induced photoreceptor abnormalities with differentially expressed genes belonging to retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and retinal detachment pathways.17 In the current study, DMGs were detected to be involved in abnormal morphological development in horizontal cells, photoreceptor cells, retinal layer cells, and retinal rods on the photo-receptor side and bipolar cells and neurons on the transmitter side (Supplementary Table S2). Integration analysis of genes regulated at both transcription and DNA methylation levels We identified 5 genes in the mouse retinas regulated by spaceflight that are present both in the DEG and DMG lists: Col8a2, Jun/Juneb, Maf, Mid1ip1, and Tsc22d3 (Figs. 5A and 5B, Supplementary Table S1). It is worth noting that Mid1ip1, a cellular growth regulator, was hypomethylated in its promoter, exon, and CpG island regions, but its transcription was down-regulated (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, although Col8a2 (a collagen gene), Maf (a transcription factor), and Junb (a transcription factor) had significant changes in both transcription and DNA methylation, the differentially methylated CpGs were far from their gene bodies (Supplementary Table S1). Hypomethylation was found in the intron and CpG island regions for Tsc22d3, whereas its transcription was suppressed (Fig. 5B). Figure 5.

(C) Correlation between the gene expression and DNA methylation of different location of gene for the five overlapping genes. Blue, spaceflight mouse retina; orange, ground control mouse retina.In order to understand the regulatory role of DNA methylation on transcription, we performed Pearson correlation analysis between DNA methylation and gene expression at gene body level, using all CpGs annotated to the 5 overlapping genes (Fig. 5C). Overall, there were mild to moderate correlations (|R| values between 0.3−0.7), nevertheless with no consistent trend between DNA methylation in the gene body and their gene expressions. For examples, in Col8a2 gene, a moderate positive correlation between DNA methylations at upstream 1 to 5 kb region (R = 0.49, P = 0.066) but a moderate negative correlation (R = −0.55, P = 0.0410) at exons with its gene expression were observed. In Junb gene, a moderate positive correlation (R = 0.68, P = 0.01) between DNA methylation at 5′ UTR and its gene expression was observed. In Tsc22d3 gene, a moderate negative correlation (R = −0.58, P = 0.019) was observed between DNA methylation at upstream 1 to 5 kb region and its gene expression. Weak negative correlations were observed between DNA methylations in all gene body regions of Maf and its gene expression, while weak positive correlations were observed between DNA methylations in all parts of Mid1ip1 gene and its gene expression. Genes and pathways regulated by spaceflight at both transcription and DNA methylation levels The functional analysis based on both DEGs and DMGs revealed that the genes involved in ECM and focal adhesion were the main regulatory targets in the retinas by spaceflight. We found that ECM genes like collagen, laminin, thrombospondin (Thbs), and integrins included CD44, syndecan, and VLA protein β subunit 1, 3, and 8, were regulated at transcriptional level, whereas other genes like tenascin and integrin VLA α subunit 2, 7 and 8, were regulated at DNA methylation level by spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Though simultaneously changes at both the transcription and DNA methylation levels were not observed in many genes, an integration analysis identified many DEGs and DMRs were enriched in the ECM/cell junction functional group, suggesting that the genes and gene networks in the ECM/cell junction were more sensitive to the stress of spaceflight in the mouse retinas. This notion of convergent regulation is illustrated in Figs. 4C and 4D. We examined the DEGs and DMGs involved in HIPPO, TGF-β, and Wnt signaling pathways (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Our analysis showed that Fzd, a transmembrane receptor in Wnt pathway, was significantly downregulated in gene expression; while Tfg-βr, a transmembrane receptor in TGF-β pathway, was hypermethylated. Fzd and Tfg-βr interact with a variety of extracellular signal molecules to activate signaling cascade, of which many downstream signal components were found in either the DEG or DMG lists, including the genes responsible for apoptosis and proliferation,such asSmad2/3, CK1δ/ε, Axin, CycD, and αPkc. Furthermore, the epithelial adherent, a cell surface receptor for calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, was hypomethylated. Overall, the integrated gene network and pathway analysis strongly suggested a coordinated response at the transcriptome and methylome levels in the spaceflight mice.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Approximately one in three astronauts flying on long-duration space missions experience visual impairment and morphologic changes to their eyes that include choroidal and retinal folds, optic disc edema, focal areas of retinal ischemia (i.e., cotton wool spots), globe flattening, and hyperopic shifts. This collection of ocular disorders, as first reported by Mader and colleagues,3 has been termed as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). A number of factors associated with spaceflight have been proposed to initiate SANS, including headward fluid shifts induced by weightlessness, space radiation, and high ambient CO2 levels within the spacecraft. A variety of potential mechanisms have also been proposed to account for the unusual physiologic and pathologic neuro-ophthalmic findings, including elevations in intracranial pressure (ICP) from cephalad fluid shifts, altered autoregulation of cerebral perfusion, impaired cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the brain and orbital optic nerve sheath through venous, glymphatic, and lymphatic drainage systems, and disruption of blood-brain, blood-retinal, and blood-optic nerve barrier function.23 This seemingly multifaceted pathological process, which varies from astronaut to astronaut, indicates a complex origin for these neuro-ophthalmic findings associated with SANS. Results from the present study of spaceflight-induced alterations in DNA methylome and transcriptome demonstrated that retinal cell homeostasis was disrupted during spaceflight, and that the primarily impacted genes belonged to several physiologically relevant cellular processes and pathways. These included processes and pathways associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial function, tissue remodeling, fibrosis and angiogenesis. Further, the integrated DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome analysis demonstrated that spaceflight had profound effects on ECM/cell junction and cell proliferation/apoptosis signaling in the retina. Although these data did not address all the possible mechanisms involved in the etiology of SANS, they provided crucial insight into the potential adverse consequences of spaceflight on the retina that could be functionally important for maintaining proper visual acuity among astronauts. Multi-dimensional genome-wide analyses have been applied to interrogate vision function, aging and diseases.4,24–26 In this study, we characterized the retinal tissue epigenomic reprogramming, along with the transcriptomic changes of mouse retinas after a period of 37-day spaceflight, the human equivalent of 4.1 years. The differential gene expression analysis revealed a few distinctive yet interconnected pathways that may have been affected by spaceflight, such as inflammatory and cancer-prone pathways, i.e., interleukin and chemokine pathways (Fgfr1, Fos, Cxcr4 genes); cell structure maintenance pathways, i.e., ECM and keratins; and the cell death, cell differentiation, and survival pathways, i.e., VEGF, TSP1, TGF-β signaling and DNA repair. These findings support the notion that environmental conditions during spaceflight, such as microgravity and space radiation, induce retinal structure damage and the counteractive cell response,9 leading to similar conditions of known disease states such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).16,27 A recent study by Cheng et al. showed that even though mice do not have macula, mimicking diseased photoreceptor metabolism profile in mice caused macular degeneration-like pathologies similar to that in humans and leading to blindness.28 Consistent with what has been reported on retinal disorders,14 we identified six genes in the spaceflight mouse retinas that were associated with AMD (Adamts, Col8a, Htr, Igfb, Slc, Tgfbr). We also found that the mitochondrial small molecule transporter family genes such as Slc4a7, Slc6a17, Slc22a8, Slc22as, Slc25a2, and Slc31a2 were among the top DEGs and DMGs induced by spaceflight in the mouse retinas. A gene expression change of a small molecule transporter in ocular tissue was also observed in a previous spaceflight study, which was linked to oxidative damage in leading to mitochondrial apoptosis and cell death in retina.9 Many other structural proteins, such as collagen, keratin and actin, were also downregulated under spaceflight conditions. The suppression of these genes has been shown to trigger chronic inflammation, fibrosis, retinopathy, and cancer.29 Notably, several genes in the retinoic acid metabolism pathway were hypermethylated in spaceflight mice. RA receptors repress the activity of transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB, and therefore have potential anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, the expressions of several genes (Wnt5a, Vegf, and Tnf) in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway were altered by spaceflight. Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a pathogenic role in AMD, and it is believed that certain changes in AMD likely lead to inflammation or a cancer-like disease state.30 Intraocular pressure (IOP) impacts cell adhesion and connection, promotes detachment of cell from ECM, leading to apoptosis and optical nerve damage.31,32 Our transcriptomic and epigenomic studies on spaceflight mouse retinas showed that ECM-receptor components were among the most altered genes in spaceflight mouse retinas relative to that in ground control mice (Table 1). We found that the expression of myocilin (encoded by Myoc), a structural component that regulates IOP, was significantly suppressed, suggesting an adverse effect of microgravity on IOP regulation. Another significantly altered gene family in the spaceflight mouse retinas was simple epithelial keratins (SEKs), which are primarily expressed in single-layered simple epithelia. An important feature of SEKs is that one specific SEK pair (one type I SEK and one type II SEK) predominate in an epithelial cell where they form noncovalent heteropolymers.33 Our transcriptomic data showed both Krt1 and Krt10 were significantly upregulated, suggesting that the spaceflight mice might have been subject to some structural repair in the retinas. However, the expression of another corneal epithelial SEK, Krt12, was significantly suppressed. Beside its structural roles, Krt12 is generally regarded as a specific corneal epithelial differentiation marker34 and a reduced expression of Krt12 gene may suggest an impaired cell differentiation under spaceflight condition. The transcriptomic data revealed spaceflight down-regulated wound-healing and cell proliferation genes (Tgfb2, Tgfb3, Igfbp4, Igfbp5, Igfbp6, Pdgfra, and Dcn) in mouse retinas. Furthermore, many transcriptional regulators were also downregulated in the spaceflight mouse retinas, including hormone-retinoid receptors Nr4a1 and Nr4a3, zinc finger transcriptional factor Egr1, connective tissue growth factor Ctgf, and serine protease inhibitors Serpine2, Serpinf1, Serpinh1 and Serping. These transcriptional factors play critical roles in regulating cell survival, proliferation, axial eye growth,35 morphogenesis of the lens and optic vesicle development.36,37 The methylomic data also suggested that spaceflight may impact cell cycle and DNA repair as indicated by the IPA analysis-based DMGs, which showed that R-SMAD binding protein, TGF-β receptor signaling, and WNT signaling pathways were all enriched. The recent NASA Twins Study,18 also showed that the gene expression changed for genes related to cell growth, proliferation and angiogenesis in CD4 and CD8 cells, indicating that the activation of wound-repairing pathways are not limited to retinal tissue in spaceflight. This is the first report on an epigenetic age alteration in retinal tissue during spaceflight. The data indicated that the retinas of spaceflight mice tended to have a younger epigenetic age (deceleration of age) compared to that of ground control animals (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, in the NASA Twin Study, the results showed that the spaceflight twin had an elongated telomere length relative to his ground-based twin brother, suggesting slower aging in space.18 Thus, there seems to be some evidence that spaceflight-induced age deceleration occurs in mice and humans. There also seems to be some similarity in the aging deceleration of the retinal epigenetic clocks of spaceflight mice and that in mice with ovariectomy or on a high-fat diet.20,21 It is worth noting that the predicted epigenetic age based on retinal methylation was much younger than the chronological age (2−3 weeks as predicted by retinal DNA methylation clock vs. 21 weeks per chronological age). A couple of factors might have contributed to this discrepancy. First, the retinal tissue DNA methylation data was not included in Stubbs's epigenetic clock training dataset,20 and therefore, the retinal epigenetic age was not well represented by Stubb's algorithm. Second, the retina is a heterocellular tissue and its epigenetic age might be over-represented by epigenetically younger cells. As a matter of fact, Horvath reported that several tumors exhibited decelerated epigenetic clocks and that malignant cancer tissues were much younger than anticipated.19,38 Nevertheless, our spaceflight mouse retinal epigenetic clock analysis showed that spaceflight significantly decelerated retinal epigenetic age. This age deceleration may suggest an activation of remodeling or compensatory pathways that are dormant under normal physiological conditions.39 In summary, this study is the first to investigate the effects of spaceflight on both DNA methylome and transcriptome in retinal tissue. Interestingly, the results indicate that spaceflight decelerated epigenetic clock in the mouse retina, i.e., the mice flown in space showed younger biological ages than the ground control mice. Despite this positive finding, the results also demonstrated that retinal cell homeostasis was disrupted during spaceflight. The primarily impacted genes by spaceflight belong to several physiologically relevant cellular processes and pathways, including those associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial function, tissue remodeling, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. The functional analysis integrating both DNA methylome and transcriptome demonstrated that spaceflight had particularly profound effects on two important biological processes, i.e., ECM/cell junction and cell proliferation/apoptosis signaling in the retina (Figs. 4C and 4D, Supplementary Fig. S3).",

Copyright notice ID: 8220224 PMID: 34179686 Abstract Astronauts exhibit an assortment of clinical abnormalities in their eyes during long-duration spaceflight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in the retina or alters the epigenetic clock. The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were maintained under similar housing conditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing. We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Several biological pathways involved in retinal diseases such as macular degeneration were significantly altered. Our results indicated that spaceflight decelerated the retinal epigenetic clock. This study demonstrates that spaceflight impacts the retina at the epigenomic and transcriptomic levels, and such changes could be involved in the etiology of eye-related disorders among astronauts. Keywords: spaceflight, DNA methylome, transcriptome, epigenetic clockIntroduction The spaceflight environment contains two major risk factors, irradiation and microgravity, which are thought to induce adverse effects on astronauts’ vision and central nervous systems,1–4 and in particular, the eye and retina.5,6 Studies reported that more than 30% of astronauts returning from Space Shuttle missions or the International Space Station (ISS) were diagnosed with eye problems that reduced visual acuity.3,7 Furthermore, a recent study showed that spaceflight induced significant apoptosis in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) of mice.8 Previous work has also shown that many genes involved in oxidative stress and mitochondria-associated apoptosis are altered in the retinas of space-flown mice, and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis plays an important role in response to space irradiation in mouse retinas.9–11 Previous research on space-induced visual impairment in astronauts has primarily utilized proteomics and microarray technologies to better understand the biological effects of spaceflight on the mouse retina; these studies collectively reveal that spaceflight alters the expression of certain genes and proteins involved in cell death, mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, neuronal and glial cell loss, and axonal degeneration in mice.9,12 Although there are studies analyzing the transcriptome in human retinas, none has been done under spaceflight conditions.13–16 Thus, the mechanisms underlying the spaceflight-induced vision impairment remain largely unknown. Even though spaceflight-induced transcriptomic reprogramming in mouse retinas was recently reported,17 there has been no study of the effects of spaceflight on the retina methylome or the epigenetic clocks of animals or humans. There is great enthusiasm both within the scientific community and society in general with the ambitious plans for the return of manned missions to the moon and long-duration (>300 days) space travel to Mars and beyond. However, a comprehensive assessment of the adverse effects on the human body is still incomplete. In a recent NASA Twins Study, some persistent changes in gene expression, DNA damage, telomeres, neuro-ocular and cognitive function were observed when comparing the spaceflight twin brother to his earth-bound twin.18 It has also been shown that long-duration spaceflight changes gene regulation at both the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, although the majority of these changes return to the preflight level six months after returning to earth. As part of a NASA research consortium to accelerate spaceflight risk characterization and to gather omics data to allow robust predictions of cellular response in organisms exposed to long-duration spaceflight, we investigated the DNA methylome, epigenetic clock and transcriptome of retinas from mice flown on a long-duration 37-day mission, the human equivalent of 4.1 years, as part of the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) project. We identified differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spaceflight and ground control mice. In addition, as epigenetic clocks have been used to predict tissue biological ages and age-related diseases in both humans19 and mice20,21, we calculated spaceflight-induced epigenetic clock based on the DNA methylation at unique CpG sites of mouse retinas to predict the retinal tissue aging due to the spaceflight. This study provides new insights into the visual impairment due to long-duration spaceflight.Results Study design and overall QC of RRBS DNA methylome and RNA-seq transcriptome data To study the effects of spaceflight on retinal tissue epigenomic and transcriptomic changes, we constructed 18 reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) libraries with one sample being removed from downstream analysis due to low quality (8 flight vs. 9 ground control mice) and 18 RNA-seq libraries (9 flight vs. 9 ground control mice). Figure 1 shows the study design. Fragment sizes of RRBS library were between 200 and 500 bp, with a peak around 300 bp. RNA-seq library size distribution ranged between 200–500 bp, with a peak around 280 bp. To monitor the quality of the RNA-seq, we also added External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls in an amount equivalent to about 1% of the total RNA in each sample before RNA-seq library construction. We generated ∼778 million reads of 75-bp single-end RRBS DNA methylome data and 764 million reads (75 bp × 2) of pair-end RNA-seq transcriptomic data, corresponding to an average of ∼45.8 million (N = 17) sequence reads per RRBS sample, and 42.5 million (N = 18) sequence reads per RNA-seq sample (Supplementary Table S3). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Study design. This study was under the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) project consortium. Spaceflight mice after flight were euthanized and frozen on orbit. The retinas were isolated from both the ground habitat control and flight mice after returning to ground. RNA and DNA were extracted from the retinas, and then RRBS and RNA-seq libraries were constructed to obtain DNA methylome and transcriptome, respectively. Retinal epigenetic age was calculated using MouseEpigeneticClock script. Disease and bio-functional pathways were generated using the DAVID GO functional annotation and the Ingenuity Pathway through Analysis (IPA) based on DMGs & DEGs.High-quality reads were obtained from both RRBS and RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig. S1). We aligned the RRBS DNA-seq methylome data, 75 bp single reads to the  mouse GRCm38 genome. On average, 62.48% of the reads were aligned to the genome with an average of 26.3 million (N = 17) aligned reads per sample (Supplementary Table S3). The aligned reads were further annotated, resulting in an average of 1.84 million (N = 17) CpG sites covered by at least 10 reads. For RNA-seq transcriptomic data, we aligned the 75 × 2 bp fastq reads to the  mouse GRCm38 genome,  GRCm38 gene model, and ERCC transcripts. Overall, ∼85.05% (N = 18) of the reads were aligned to the genome uniquely, and 0.35% (N = 18) to the ERCC transcripts. Among the reads aligned to the genome, 56.03% (N = 18) to the exons, 20.88% (N = 18) to the introns. Scatterplots of ERCC log2 (FPKM) vs. log2 (spike-in concentration) showed an overall linear relationship (R2 = 0.94) between the observed and the expected transcripts of the ERCC spike-in controls (Supplementary Fig. S1G).Global epigenomic and transcriptomic changes in the retinas of spaceflight mice Overall, 31.2 million CpGs, ranging from 1.6 million to 2.1 million CpGs per sample, were used to study the genome-wide CpG methylation patterns in terms of the relationship to the genomic features. The profiling CpG methylation patterns revealed that the spaceflight mice were hypomethylated globally compared to ground mice (P = 0.034, two-tailed t-test, Fig. 2A). A significant lower CpG methylation level was observed within CG islands compared to CpG shores in both ground and spaceflight mice (P < 2.2E−16, two-tailed t-test). In addition, the level of methylation was significantly higher in the introns compared to exons in both groups (P < 2.2E−16, two-tailed t-test). The methylation at the transcription starting site (TSS) had the lowest methylation compared to other genomic regions (promoter, exon and intron) in both spaceflight and ground mice. Furthermore, 62.5% of the 643 differentially methylated genes were hypomethylated and 37.5% were hypermethylated (Fig. 2B). Annotation of differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) revealed that a large portion of the DMCs were located in introns, followed by intergenic regions and exons. About 15% of the DMCs were located in promoters (Fig. 2C). Principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2D) and hierarchial cluster analysis (HCA) (Fig. 2E) based on DMCs showed a clear difference between spaceflight and ground control mice. Overall, the methylation data clearly demonstrated that spaceflight induced profound DNA methylation changes. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Spaceflight caused global epigenomic changes in mouse retina.

(E) HCA plots based on DMCs. (F) Epigenetic ages calculated using Stubb's age estimator based on retinal methylomes.As DNA methylation has been successfully used to predict epigenetic clock—biological age,22 we determined the epigenetic clocks of the retinas of spaceflight and control mice, using Stubbs’ epigenetic clock predictor.20 The differences of Stubbs’ predicted biological ages between the spaceflight and ground control mice were tested using Welch's two-sample t-test, which showed a significant age deceleration in spaceflight mice relative to ground mice (1.7 vs. 2.4 weeks, P = 0.049 on two-tailed t-test) (Fig. 2F). It is worth noting that the predicted epigenetic ages were much younger than the true chronological ages (21.2 weeks). Our RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis identified 177 DEGs (fold change ≥ 1.2, P ≤ 0.05 and FDR ≤ 0.3), including both up- and down-regulated genes (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S1). Similar to what was observed in the methylome dataset, a distinct separation was observed between the spaceflight and ground control mice based on both the PCA and HCA on the DEGs (Figs. 3B and 3C). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Spaceflight induced global alterations on gene expression and the distribution of DMCs and DEGs across chromosomes.

DEGs with more than 50% expression change are highlighted in red (up-regulated) and blue (down-regulated). (B) PCA using the spaceflight induced DEGs. The normalized expressions of 177 DEGs were used for PCA computation and no sample was filtered out. (C) HCA plots based on DEGs between spaceflight mouse retinas and ground controls. (D) Circos plot showing the distribution of DMCs and DEGs across chromosomes. Y chromosome was excluded as only female mice were used in the study.We further examined the alteration patterns due to the spaceflight on the DNA methylome and transcriptome across chromosomes using Circos plotting (Fig. 3D). Despite that differentially methylated regioins (DMRs) were observed on each chromosome (chromosome Y was excluded as only female mice were used in this study), the DMRs were not evenly distributed across chromosome as well as at certain particular chromosome regions, suggesting that some chromosomes or regions were more prone to methylation modification. For instance, Chr X harbored the most DMRs, followed by Chr 4 and 7. In addition, some regions, e.g., Chr 4: 95 278 373–155 343 067 and Chr 2: 118 262 949–159 068 995, exhibited locally enriched DMRs. Although many DMRs were observed in certain chromosomes, e.g., Chr 2, 4, 5, 14, and X, there were fewer DEGs in these chromosomes (61 DMRs vs. 3 DEGs observed on Chr X; 30 DMRs vs. 14 DEGs observed on Chr 11), suggesting a differential or relatively less sensitive response in the gene expression of retinal tissue to spaceflight.Biological functions and pathways affected by spaceflight in mouse retinas at transcriptome and DNA methylome, respectively Pathways and functions affected in mouse retina by spaceflight based on DEGs The IPA based on DEGs identified many significantly enriched canonical pathways (negative log10[P-value] >1.3, i.e., P ≤ 0.05) due to spaceflight (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S2). A large number of enriched pathways had a significantly negative Z-score (suppressed) and were associated with down-regulated DEGs (Figs. 4A and 4C). Enriched canonical pathways mainly belonged to two biological processes: 1) the junction/connection including G6P signaling, osteoarthritis signaling, and ILK signaling pathways; and 2) the inflammation/proliferation including PDGF signaling, CXCR4 signaling, actin cytoskeleton signaling, and NF-κB signaling. Many other biological pathways, such as hepatic fibrosis, IGF-1 signaling, epithelial adherent junction, and tight junction (Supplementary Table S2), were enriched by spaceflight with significant P values, but zero Z-scores due to a lack of other relevant supporting evidence. These pathways were functionally linked to the extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Notably, many of the genes in the above pathways enriched and impacted by spaceflight in this study were also observed in NASA Twins Study,18 such as Ilk, Pdgf, Cxcr4, Igf-1 and Nf-κb. At the individual gene level, a large number of DEGs fell into the categories of wound healing/cell growth/cell motility, inflammation defense, mitochondria metabolism, and oxidative stress (Table 1, Fig. 4A). In summary, the IPA analysis indicated impaired cell-to-cell connection and subsequent repair. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Functional enrichments based on spaceflight induced DEGs and DMGs.

Open in a new tabIn addition, based on the functional similarity, the DAVID analysis identified 47 genes out of 177 DEGs as secreted/extracellular proteins, and 17 genes of those 47 DEGs were the EMC components (Table 2). Furthermore, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, wound healing process, and insulin-like growth (IGF) factor signaling were enriched by 12, 9.9, and 6 folds, respectively, in spaceflight mouse retinas as compared to those housed in AEM (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1, P ≤ 0.01). Several genes enriched in the TGF-β group, such as Pdgfra, Nog, and Dcn, were significantly down-regulated (P ≤ 0.05, N = 9 per group). The transcriptional factors such as hormone-retinoid receptors Nr4a1, Nr4a3, zinc finger transcriptional factor Egr1, and connective tissue growth factor Ctgf were observed to be down-regulated in spaceflight mouse retinas (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, the majority of the top up-regulated DEGs were the structural protein genes, like Krt1, Krt10, and Adamts3, which is consistent with the notion that spaceflight activates inflammation and cell survival mechanisms. In summary, consistent with the IPA analysis, the David functional analysis suggested that spaceflight compromised cell proliferation and mobility necessary for retinal wound healing. Table 2.

The enriched groups with a P-value ≤ 0.05 were listed.Pathways and functions affected in mouse retina by spaceflight based on DMGs We identified 434 hypomethylated and 209 hypermethylated genes, using 10% difference on methylation and P < 0.05 (N = 9 for each group) as criteria (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S1). Out of those 643 DMGs, 118 had at least one differentially methylated cytosine located within a CpG island and 108 had DMC located in the promoter regions (34 hypomethylation and 74 hypermethylation) (Fig. 2C), indicating epigenetic regulation of transcriptional changes in spaceflight compared to ground control mice. Furthermore, 22 hypermethylated genes and 35 hypomethylated genes had DMCs located in both CpG islands and exon areas. We used the DAVID Functional Clustering to examine how spaceflight-induced methylome changes would affect retinal cell function. The data revealed that a substantial amount of DMGs were linked to cell structure and tissue morphology, with significant P values and fold enrichment (Figs. 4B and 4D and Supplementary Table S2). Specifically, 35 DMGs were related to the cell junction, 17 DMGs were related to the extracellular matrix, and 8 DMGs were related to the tight junction. Another 20 DMGs were members of collagen and fibronectin gene families, with fold enrichment values of 3.4 (P < 0.05) and 3.1 (P < 0.01), respectively. Further, functional clustering revealed that DNA methylation might play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and organism development (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2). For instance, 24 DMGs were linked to cell differentiation and 38 DMGs were linked to multicellular organism development. In addition, 6 DMGs (fold enrichment value of 8.1, P < 0.01) were positive regulators of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and several other DMGs were the components of Hippo and TGF-β signaling pathways. DMGs-based functional analysis demonstrated consistent shifts in cell function and agreed well with those observed in transcriptome analysis. DMGs-based IPA analysis portrayed a concerted hypermethylation on several retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway genes (Supplementary Fig. S2). Among those were Rho (rhodopsin; light perception), Vegfa (vascular endothelial growth factor A), Tgfb1 (cell growth factor), Bcl2l11 (apoptosis facilitator), Mmp2 (matrix metallopeptidase 14), Wnt5a (transcription factor), and N32e1 (retinal transcription factor). Consistent with the changes in RA signaling, Nxph1 gene, which is involved in neuronal synaptic transmission, was highly methylated. Genes with decreased methylation included Smad2, Smad3, Sod3, Tnfrsf19, Edn2, and Dnmt3l (Supplementary Table S2). Six mitochondrial membrane solute transporter genes (Slc22a2, Slc25a25, Slc25a33, Slc35f3, Slc6a17, and Slc6a8) were hypomethylated, suggesting that mitochondrial function was affected during spaceflight. Further functional analysis suggested that spaceflight could induce morphological changes in many retinal cell types. The putative morphology changes were evidenced by the extensive functional overlaps of 9 DMGs (5 hypermethylated: Erc2, Neurog2, ATP8A2, App,andRarg; 4 hypomethylated: Rho, Vegfa, Hes1,andDiscam) (Supplementary Table S2). Particularly, functional enrichment analysis indicated that at least two DMGs were involved in the abnormal morphological development in horizontal cells, photoreceptor cells, retinal layer cells, and retinal rods on the photo-receptor side and bipolar cells and neurons on the transmitter side. Our recent study of RR-9 flight mice also confirmed the spaceflight-induced photoreceptor abnormalities with differentially expressed genes belonging to retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and retinal detachment pathways.17 In the current study, DMGs were detected to be involved in abnormal morphological development in horizontal cells, photoreceptor cells, retinal layer cells, and retinal rods on the photo-receptor side and bipolar cells and neurons on the transmitter side (Supplementary Table S2).Integration analysis of genes regulated at both transcription and DNA methylation levels We identified 5 genes in the mouse retinas regulated by spaceflight that are present both in the DEG and DMG lists: Col8a2, Jun/Juneb, Maf, Mid1ip1, and Tsc22d3 (Figs. 5A and 5B, Supplementary Table S1). It is worth noting that Mid1ip1, a cellular growth regulator, was hypomethylated in its promoter, exon, and CpG island regions, but its transcription was down-regulated (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, although Col8a2 (a collagen gene), Maf (a transcription factor), and Junb (a transcription factor) had significant changes in both transcription and DNA methylation, the differentially methylated CpGs were far from their gene bodies (Supplementary Table S1). Hypomethylation was found in the intron and CpG island regions for Tsc22d3, whereas its transcription was suppressed (Fig. 5B). Figure 5.

(C) Correlation between the gene expression and DNA methylation of different location of gene for the five overlapping genes. Blue, spaceflight mouse retina; orange, ground control mouse retina.In order to understand the regulatory role of DNA methylation on transcription, we performed Pearson correlation analysis between DNA methylation and gene expression at gene body level, using all CpGs annotated to the 5 overlapping genes (Fig. 5C). Overall, there were mild to moderate correlations (|R| values between 0.3−0.7), nevertheless with no consistent trend between DNA methylation in the gene body and their gene expressions. For examples, in Col8a2 gene, a moderate positive correlation between DNA methylations at upstream 1 to 5 kb region (R = 0.49, P = 0.066) but a moderate negative correlation (R = −0.55, P = 0.0410) at exons with its gene expression were observed. In Junb gene, a moderate positive correlation (R = 0.68, P = 0.01) between DNA methylation at 5′ UTR and its gene expression was observed. In Tsc22d3 gene, a moderate negative correlation (R = −0.58, P = 0.019) was observed between DNA methylation at upstream 1 to 5 kb region and its gene expression. Weak negative correlations were observed between DNA methylations in all gene body regions of Maf and its gene expression, while weak positive correlations were observed between DNA methylations in all parts of Mid1ip1 gene and its gene expression.Genes and pathways regulated by spaceflight at both transcription and DNA methylation levels The functional analysis based on both DEGs and DMGs revealed that the genes involved in ECM and focal adhesion were the main regulatory targets in the retinas by spaceflight. We found that ECM genes like collagen, laminin, thrombospondin (Thbs), and integrins included CD44, syndecan, and VLA protein β subunit 1, 3, and 8, were regulated at transcriptional level, whereas other genes like tenascin and integrin VLA α subunit 2, 7 and 8, were regulated at DNA methylation level by spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Though simultaneously changes at both the transcription and DNA methylation levels were not observed in many genes, an integration analysis identified many DEGs and DMRs were enriched in the ECM/cell junction functional group, suggesting that the genes and gene networks in the ECM/cell junction were more sensitive to the stress of spaceflight in the mouse retinas. This notion of convergent regulation is illustrated in Figs. 4C and 4D. We examined the DEGs and DMGs involved in HIPPO, TGF-β, and Wnt signaling pathways (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Our analysis showed that Fzd, a transmembrane receptor in Wnt pathway, was significantly downregulated in gene expression; while Tfg-βr, a transmembrane receptor in TGF-β pathway, was hypermethylated. Fzd and Tfg-βr interact with a variety of extracellular signal molecules to activate signaling cascade, of which many downstream signal components were found in either the DEG or DMG lists, including the genes responsible for apoptosis and proliferation,such asSmad2/3, CK1δ/ε, Axin, CycD, and αPkc. Furthermore, the epithelial adherent, a cell surface receptor for calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, was hypomethylated. Overall, the integrated gene network and pathway analysis strongly suggested a coordinated response at the transcriptome and methylome levels in the spaceflight mice.Discussion Approximately one in three astronauts flying on long-duration space missions experience visual impairment and morphologic changes to their eyes that include choroidal and retinal folds, optic disc edema, focal areas of retinal ischemia (i.e., cotton wool spots), globe flattening, and hyperopic shifts. This collection of ocular disorders, as first reported by Mader and colleagues,3 has been termed as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). A number of factors associated with spaceflight have been proposed to initiate SANS, including headward fluid shifts induced by weightlessness, space radiation, and high ambient CO2 levels within the spacecraft. A variety of potential mechanisms have also been proposed to account for the unusual physiologic and pathologic neuro-ophthalmic findings, including elevations in intracranial pressure (ICP) from cephalad fluid shifts, altered autoregulation of cerebral perfusion, impaired cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the brain and orbital optic nerve sheath through venous, glymphatic, and lymphatic drainage systems, and disruption of blood-brain, blood-retinal, and blood-optic nerve barrier function.23 This seemingly multifaceted pathological process, which varies from astronaut to astronaut, indicates a complex origin for these neuro-ophthalmic findings associated with SANS. Results from the present study of spaceflight-induced alterations in DNA methylome and transcriptome demonstrated that retinal cell homeostasis was disrupted during spaceflight, and that the primarily impacted genes belonged to several physiologically relevant cellular processes and pathways. These included processes and pathways associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial function, tissue remodeling, fibrosis and angiogenesis. Further, the integrated DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome analysis demonstrated that spaceflight had profound effects on ECM/cell junction and cell proliferation/apoptosis signaling in the retina. Although these data did not address all the possible mechanisms involved in the etiology of SANS, they provided crucial insight into the potential adverse consequences of spaceflight on the retina that could be functionally important for maintaining proper visual acuity among astronauts. Multi-dimensional genome-wide analyses have been applied to interrogate vision function, aging and diseases.4,24–26 In this study, we characterized the retinal tissue epigenomic reprogramming, along with the transcriptomic changes of mouse retinas after a period of 37-day spaceflight, the human equivalent of 4.1 years. The differential gene expression analysis revealed a few distinctive yet interconnected pathways that may have been affected by spaceflight, such as inflammatory and cancer-prone pathways, i.e., interleukin and chemokine pathways (Fgfr1, Fos, Cxcr4 genes); cell structure maintenance pathways, i.e., ECM and keratins; and the cell death, cell differentiation, and survival pathways, i.e., VEGF, TSP1, TGF-β signaling and DNA repair. These findings support the notion that environmental conditions during spaceflight, such as microgravity and space radiation, induce retinal structure damage and the counteractive cell response,9 leading to similar conditions of known disease states such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).16,27 A recent study by Cheng et al. showed that even though mice do not have macula, mimicking diseased photoreceptor metabolism profile in mice caused macular degeneration-like pathologies similar to that in humans and leading to blindness.28 Consistent with what has been reported on retinal disorders,14 we identified six genes in the spaceflight mouse retinas that were associated with AMD (Adamts, Col8a, Htr, Igfb, Slc, Tgfbr). We also found that the mitochondrial small molecule transporter family genes such as Slc4a7, Slc6a17, Slc22a8, Slc22as, Slc25a2, and Slc31a2 were among the top DEGs and DMGs induced by spaceflight in the mouse retinas. A gene expression change of a small molecule transporter in ocular tissue was also observed in a previous spaceflight study, which was linked to oxidative damage in leading to mitochondrial apoptosis and cell death in retina.9 Many other structural proteins, such as collagen, keratin and actin, were also downregulated under spaceflight conditions. The suppression of these genes has been shown to trigger chronic inflammation, fibrosis, retinopathy, and cancer.29 Notably, several genes in the retinoic acid metabolism pathway were hypermethylated in spaceflight mice. RA receptors repress the activity of transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB, and therefore have potential anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, the expressions of several genes (Wnt5a, Vegf, and Tnf) in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway were altered by spaceflight. Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a pathogenic role in AMD, and it is believed that certain changes in AMD likely lead to inflammation or a cancer-like disease state.30 Intraocular pressure (IOP) impacts cell adhesion and connection, promotes detachment of cell from ECM, leading to apoptosis and optical nerve damage.31,32 Our transcriptomic and epigenomic studies on spaceflight mouse retinas showed that ECM-receptor components were among the most altered genes in spaceflight mouse retinas relative to that in ground control mice (Table 1). We found that the expression of myocilin (encoded by Myoc), a structural component that regulates IOP, was significantly suppressed, suggesting an adverse effect of microgravity on IOP regulation. Another significantly altered gene family in the spaceflight mouse retinas was simple epithelial keratins (SEKs), which are primarily expressed in single-layered simple epithelia. An important feature of SEKs is that one specific SEK pair (one type I SEK and one type II SEK) predominate in an epithelial cell where they form noncovalent heteropolymers.33 Our transcriptomic data showed both Krt1 and Krt10 were significantly upregulated, suggesting that the spaceflight mice might have been subject to some structural repair in the retinas. However, the expression of another corneal epithelial SEK, Krt12, was significantly suppressed. Beside its structural roles, Krt12 is generally regarded as a specific corneal epithelial differentiation marker34 and a reduced expression of Krt12 gene may suggest an impaired cell differentiation under spaceflight condition. The transcriptomic data revealed spaceflight down-regulated wound-healing and cell proliferation genes (Tgfb2, Tgfb3, Igfbp4, Igfbp5, Igfbp6, Pdgfra, and Dcn) in mouse retinas. Furthermore, many transcriptional regulators were also downregulated in the spaceflight mouse retinas, including hormone-retinoid receptors Nr4a1 and Nr4a3, zinc finger transcriptional factor Egr1, connective tissue growth factor Ctgf, and serine protease inhibitors Serpine2, Serpinf1, Serpinh1 and Serping. These transcriptional factors play critical roles in regulating cell survival, proliferation, axial eye growth,35 morphogenesis of the lens and optic vesicle development.36,37 The methylomic data also suggested that spaceflight may impact cell cycle and DNA repair as indicated by the IPA analysis-based DMGs, which showed that R-SMAD binding protein, TGF-β receptor signaling, and WNT signaling pathways were all enriched. The recent NASA Twins Study,18 also showed that the gene expression changed for genes related to cell growth, proliferation and angiogenesis in CD4 and CD8 cells, indicating that the activation of wound-repairing pathways are not limited to retinal tissue in spaceflight. This is the first report on an epigenetic age alteration in retinal tissue during spaceflight. The data indicated that the retinas of spaceflight mice tended to have a younger epigenetic age (deceleration of age) compared to that of ground control animals (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, in the NASA Twin Study, the results showed that the spaceflight twin had an elongated telomere length relative to his ground-based twin brother, suggesting slower aging in space.18 Thus, there seems to be some evidence that spaceflight-induced age deceleration occurs in mice and humans. There also seems to be some similarity in the aging deceleration of the retinal epigenetic clocks of spaceflight mice and that in mice with ovariectomy or on a high-fat diet.20,21 It is worth noting that the predicted epigenetic age based on retinal methylation was much younger than the chronological age (2−3 weeks as predicted by retinal DNA methylation clock vs. 21 weeks per chronological age). A couple of factors might have contributed to this discrepancy. First, the retinal tissue DNA methylation data was not included in Stubbs's epigenetic clock training dataset,20 and therefore, the retinal epigenetic age was not well represented by Stubb's algorithm. Second, the retina is a heterocellular tissue and its epigenetic age might be over-represented by epigenetically younger cells. As a matter of fact, Horvath reported that several tumors exhibited decelerated epigenetic clocks and that malignant cancer tissues were much younger than anticipated.19,38 Nevertheless, our spaceflight mouse retinal epigenetic clock analysis showed that spaceflight significantly decelerated retinal epigenetic age. This age deceleration may suggest an activation of remodeling or compensatory pathways that are dormant under normal physiological conditions.39 In summary, this study is the first to investigate the effects of spaceflight on both DNA methylome and transcriptome in retinal tissue. Interestingly, the results indicate that spaceflight decelerated epigenetic clock in the mouse retina, i.e., the mice flown in space showed younger biological ages than the ground control mice. Despite this positive finding, the results also demonstrated that retinal cell homeostasis was disrupted during spaceflight. The primarily impacted genes by spaceflight belong to several physiologically relevant cellular processes and pathways, including those associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial function, tissue remodeling, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. The functional analysis integrating both DNA methylome and transcriptome demonstrated that spaceflight had particularly profound effects on two important biological processes, i.e., ECM/cell junction and cell proliferation/apoptosis signaling in the retina (Figs. 4C and 4D, Supplementary Fig. S3).Methods Study design Figure 1 illustrates the overall study design. The 16-week-old female C57 BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in this study as part of the NASA RR-1 project consortium. This project was approved by the NASA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Both spaceflight and ground control animals were housed in NASA's animal enclosure modules (AEM), with control mice being exposed to the same environment conditions (12-hour light cycle, temperature and humidity) as those flown on the International Space Station (ISS). Control animals were kept inside an environmental simulator (ISSES) at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the spaceflight animals were transported to the ISS by SpaceX4 on September 21, 2014. All animals were fed with a special NASA food bar diet and their health was checked daily. The spaceflight mice were euthanized and frozen on-orbit after 37 days of flight, while ground control mice were simultaneously euthanized and frozen under identical conditions. After the frozen carcasses were returned to KSC, the ocular tissues were removed from both groups. DNA and RNA were extracted from the same retinal sample and were used for library constructions using NuGEN Ovation® RRBS and Ovation® Mouse RNA-seq library construction kits, respectively. Libraries were multiplexed with unique sample indices, pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550. FastQ files were subject to FastQC, adapter and low-quality reads trimming before mapping to mouse genome  GRCm38. Differential CpG methylation regions and differential expressed genes were determined after mapping and counting, and the resulting DMR and DEG lists were subject to IPA and DAVID gene functional analysis. The epigenetic clock was determined using the MouseEpigeneticClock script developed by Stubbs et al. (2017).20Dissection and preservation of the mouse ocular samples At the time of dissections, both eyes were dissected from the carcasses thawed at room temperature for 15–20 minutes. The eyes were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80 °C. The frozen whole eye samples were micro-dissected in the ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fine spring scissors were used to separate the cornea from the sclera to access the retina. The retina was carefully detached from the sclera. The retina, cornea, and lens were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C before DNA and RNA isolations.DNA and RNA isolations Retinal tissues (4–20 mg) were homogenized with Precellys CKM beads (Hilden, Germany) in 350 µl of Qiagen RLT plus buffer. The genomic DNA (gDNA) and total RNA were isolated using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After isolation, RNA and DNA were frozen and kept at −80 °C until further use. Isolated RNA samples were quantified using NanoDrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific, Chino, CA). DNA and RNA were further quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and RNA Broad Range Kit, respectively (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and RNA ScreenTape (Santa Clara, CA). All RNA samples had an integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 7.2 to 8.1.Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) library construction One hundred (100) ng of gDNA was used to construct RRBS DNA-seq library using the Ovation® RRBS Methyl-Seq System (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the MspI enzyme, which cuts the DNA at CCGG sites, was used to digest gDNA into fragments. The fragments were directly subject to end blunting and phosphorylation in preparation for ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. A unique index, out of 16 indices, was used for each individual sample for multiplexing. The ligation products were repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60 °C–10 min, 70 °C–10 min, hold at 4 °C). The products of the final repair reaction were used for bisulfite conversion using QIAGEN EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit according to Qiagen's protocol. Bisulfite-converted DNA was then amplified (Mastercycler® pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and bead-purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP beads.RNA-seq library construction The Ovation® Mouse RNA-Seq System 1–16 (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) was used to construct RNA-seq libraries according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA spiked with 1 µl of 1:500 diluted ERCC Mix 1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used to start cDNA synthesis. Following the primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products (130 µl/each sample) were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4 °C for 200 seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. The products were then subject to end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. A custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version 5 for mouse was used to allow strand selection. Finally, the libraries were amplified on a PCR thermocycler for 17 cycles (Mastercycler® pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN); and quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kit on Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The quality and peak size were determined using the D1000 ScreenTape on Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).RRBS and RNA-seq library sequencing The RRBS libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550, 75 bp, single-end read, whereas the RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on both Illumina NextSeq 550 and HiSeq 4000, pair-end reads (75 bpx2), at the Loma Linda University (LLU) Center for Genomics.Bioinformatics pipelines For the RRBS data, we used a pipeline that integrates the read quality assessment (FastQC, v0.11.6), trimming process (TrimGalore,40 v0.4.5, NuGEN diversity trimming and N6 de-duplicate scripts), alignment (Bismark,41 v0.16.34), and differential methylation analysis using MethylKit42 (v0.1.0) and DMAP43 (v2.8.1). This pipeline facilitates a rapid transition from sequencing reads to a fully annotated CpG methylation report for biological interpretation. Briefly, the RRBS raw fastq data were first trimmed using Trim Galore. The mouse genome  GRCm38 downloaded from iGenome (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html/Musmusculu/Mus_musculus__GRCm38.tar.gz), was used as a reference genome. Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome with Bismark (v0.16.34) by default parameter settings. The methylation call files including the location of each CpG site and the methylation percentage were generated by the bismark_methylation_extractor function. The aligned SAM files were further processed through DMAP to generate CpG region profile using function ‘diffmeth’ (options: -A 40, 220, -N -I 6). The CpG regions with coverage by a minimum 20 reads in all samples were used for further analysis. For the RNA-seq data, we adopted the pipelines used in our recent publications44,45 for mRNA-seq data visualization, which integrated the QC (FastQC,46 ShortRead,47 v1.48.0), trimming process (trimmomatic,48 v0.35), alignment (Tophat2,49 v2.2.1), reads quantification (cufflinks,50 v2.2.1), and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis (cuffdiff,51 v 2.2.1) for mRNA-seq data analyses. Briefly, the RNA-seq raw fastq data were first trimmed using Trimmomatic (options: Leading: 20, Trailing:20, Crop:75, Headcrop:5, Slidingwindow: 4:15, Minlen: 35). The trimmed reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome ( GRCm38) using TopHat2 (default parameter settings). The aligned bam files were then processed using Cufflinks for gene quantification. The reads that were unable to align to the mouse genome were converted to fastq format using SamToFastq function in Picard (v1.11.4) for ERCC mapping and calculation in which the reads were mapped to ERCC transcripts and quantified using TopHat2 and Cufflinks (default parameter settings). The genes with FPKM ≥ 1 in all samples were used for DEG analysis. The DEGs were identified by Cuffdiff with FDR ≤ 0.3, and fold change (FC) ≥ 1.2 (P ≤ 0.05). All bioinformatics pipelines were run with default parameters if not specified otherwise.Epigenetic clock calculation We used a mouse epigenetic clock algorithm developed by Stubbs et al. (2017)20 to estimate the biological age of the retinas of spaceflight mice, using the MouseEpigeneticClock script on the methylation coverage files with default parameter of read depth threshold at 5. The mouse age estimator, based on the methylation of 329 CpG loci, was shown to accurately measure the epigenetic clock—biological age across multiple mouse tissues.19Gene networks, pathway and functional annotation analyses The analyses on the gene networks, canonical and bio-functional pathways regulated by spaceflight at both DNA methylome and transcriptome were performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen). The sets of 177 differentially expressed genes and 643 differentially methylated genes were input into the IPA database to discover canonical, diseases and bio-functional networks possibly regulated by spaceflight. The complete IPA analysis summary is shown in the supplementary files. We also applied the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) to the lists of DEGs and DMGs to identify the functional enrichment of the spaceflight-induced gene expression changes to biologically relevant categories.PCA computation and statistical analysis PCA components were computed from normalized gene expression counts of 177 DEGs, or the beta values of all differentially methylated CpGs. Specifically, the missing values in input data were handled by the ‘imputePCA’ function from R package ‘missMDA’ (v1.18). Then, PCA was performed using ‘prcomp’ (scale = FALSE) function from R package ‘stats’ (v3.6.2). Finally, the contributions of each PCA component were extracted using ‘get_eigenvalue’ function. For DEG analysis, an FC ≥ 1.2 with P ≤ 0.05 (FDR ≤ 0.3) was used as a threshold to select DEGs. For DMG analysis, a methylation change ≥ 10% (FDR ≤ 0.05) was used as a threshold to select DMGs. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and DAVID Functional Annotation Tool to identify canonical pathways. For other statistics analysis, data were presented as mean ± SD, and were analyzed using two-tailed Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey's post hoc test. P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Experimental number (N) represents the number of animals tested in each group.Supplementary Material pbab012_Supplemental_Files Click here for additional data file.

Keywords: Vestibular, motion detection, spatial orientation, gravity perceptionINTRODUCTION The vestibular otolith receptors have evolved to detect linear motion and head position with respect to gravity. These are essential functions, about which all coordinated and reflexive movements, as well as spatial orientation and navigation through space depend. However, little is known about otolith system development. Most studies have focused upon either stereocilia (Denman-Johnson and Forge 1999, Kido et al. 1993; Mbiene et al. 1984), otoconia formation (Blasiole et al. 2006; Dickman et al. 2004; Hughes et al. 2004; Kido et al. 1993), or the molecular genetics underlying macular formation and hair cell fate (Bever et al. 2003; Sienknecht and Fekete 2008; Oh et al. 1996; Shen et al. 2008). Here, we performed a comprehensive morphological examination of otolith receptor formation and maturation into adulthood. These studies were conducted in quail, a non-altricial species, where a rapid embryogenesis (16 days incubation) of a functional vestibular system must occur so that upon hatching, regulation of posture, gaze, and spatial orientation is intact. Otolith receptors in amniotes contain two types of hair cells and three afferent types with distinct morphological innervation patterns. Type I hair cells are innervated by an enclosing calyceal terminal while type II hair cells are innervated by bouton terminals (Wersäll, 1956). The different hair cell types are not heterogeneous throughout the maculae, but instead exhibit regional distributions that have been characterized in mammals (Desai et al., 2005; Fernandez et al., 1990; Lysakowski and Goldberg, 2008), amphibians (Baird and Schuff 1994), reptiles (Xue and Peterson 2006; Severinsen et al., 2003) and birds (Jørgensen and Anderson 1973; Rosenhall 1970; Si et al., 2003; Zakir et al., 2003). In birds, a type I hair cell rich zone lies within a unique area, termed the “striola” (Werner, 1933), which also differs in receptor cell density and otoconia formation (Jörgensen and Andersen, 1973; Rosenhall, 1970; Si et al., 2003; Zakir et al., 2003). Outside the striola, lies the extrastriola, which is populated primarily by type II hair cells in birds. Currently, little information exists regarding how the two cell types become regionally distributed during development. Each hair cell contains a bundle of stereocilia and a lone kinocilium. The eccentric position of the kinocilium defines a morphological polarization (Wersäll, 1956; Wersäll et al., 1965) that also determines the cellular response amplitude and spatial tuning (Hudspeth and Corey 1977; Shotwell et al. 1981). Across the epithelium, hair cell polarizations are topographically organized, with an imaginary line running through the epithelium about which stereocilia are oppositely directed (Jörgensen and Andersen, 1973; Rosenhall, 1970; Si et al., 2003; Zakir et al., 2003). The mechanisms responsible for morphological polarization (also termed planar cell polarity) have been well studied, particularly in auditory hair cells (Dabdoub and Kelley, 2005; Davies et al., 2005; Denman-Johnson and Forge, 1999). However, questions remain as to how the broader organization of the topographic map in the otolith organs is developed. The primary afferents that innervate the otolith receptors have been known to differ in their morphology since early anatomists first described them over a century ago (Retzius, 1884; Cajal, 1908; 1909; Lorente de Nó, 1926). Macular innervation has been thoroughly examined only in chinchillas and pigeons, where three fiber classes were identified (Fernández et al., 1990; Si et al., 2003; Zakir et al., 2003). Calyx afferents contain only calyceal terminals to innervate type I hair cells. Bouton afferents contain en passant and boutons terminaux to innervate only type II hair cells. Dimorph afferents innervate both type I and II hair cells, with calyceal and bouton terminals. These three afferent types also exhibit specific regional distributions. In pigeons, calyx and dimorph afferents are exclusive to the striola region in the utricular macula but are spread wider into the extrastriola epithelium in the saccule (Si et al., 2003; Zakir et al., 2003). In contrast, bouton afferents are exclusively located in the extrastriola regions and a unique band of type II cells that flanks the reversal line of the utricle. Less is known regarding the development of macular afferent innervation. Fink and Morest (1977) reported that bouton afferents develop in chicks before calyceal bearing afferents, but their study did not address the formation of regional differences in macular innervation. The present study sought to provide insights regarding otolith receptor formation throughout development in quail. Here, we focused on hair cell distribution, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation of the otolith maculae. Combined with our earlier work on otoconia (Dickman et al., 2004), we sought to provide further understanding of the morphological organization of these receptors.METHODS Animals All experiments were conducted in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Otolith organ tissues were collected and analyzed at ten time points during embryonic development (E6-15; hatch on day 16), as well as at three post-hatch (P) developmental times including P1, P7 and adult (8 weeks post-hatch). Newborn and adult quail were either sacrificed with CO2 (SEM, immunohistochemistry) or perfused through the heart with aldehyde fixatives (neural tracers), while embryonic quail were sacrificed with cold narcosis. The head was bisected, the brain removed, and the utricle and saccule otolith organs dissected free from the temporal bone. The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee at Washington University and conformed to guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health regarding animal use.Macular growth curves Fresh tissue whole mounts of utricles and saccules were placed in 9:1 glycerol:PBS on a glass slide and coverslipped. The peripheral margins of the utricular and saccular sensory epithelia were traced using video microscopy and the planimeter feature in the anatomical reconstruction program (Neurolucida, MBF Biosciences, Williston VT).Scanning Electron Microscopy Receptor tissues used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were placed into 0.1M cacodylate buffered saline (CBS). The otoconia and otolith membrane were removed, and the maculae placed into in a 3% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde fixative solution in CBS for 16 hours at 4°C. Tissues were rinsed, then dehydrated in a graded series of acetones and dried in 100% tetramethylsilane. The sublimated tissue was mounted on aluminum studs, coated with palladium, and viewed with a Hitachi 2600 SEM microscope at 20kV (for details, see Huss and Dickman, 2003).Hair cell planar polarity and density SEM micrographs of the otolith maculae were used to obtain a set of serial images across the central macular epithelia (lateral to medial – utricle; superior to inferior – saccule). Images for E6-E10 maculae were taken at 9000×, while images of E12-adult maculae were taken at 5000x. The micrographs for each macula were reconstructed as a montage and the planar polarity for each hair cell in the view was measured. For better visualization of stereocilia bundles (see Fig. 3B), some maculae were sonicated to shear the bundles from the apical surface of the cell (Corwin, 1977). Each cell’s polarization was determined by drawing a vector from the shortest stereocilia to the kinocilium (Denman-Johnson and Forge, 1999). The vector angle was measured using a compass rosette overlaid on the receptor epithelium (see Fig. 3A). In the utricular macula, the anterior pole was designated as 0°, the medial edge direction was designated as 90°, and the lateral edge as 270°. For saccular maculae, the superior edge was set at 90°, the inferior edge was oriented to 270°. Normalized distances were measured with the lateral edge (utricles) or superior edge (saccules) of the epithelium = 0μm. In addition, the polarization of cells across the entire macular surface was mapped. First, SEM images (5000x) were serially obtained across the epithelial surface. Arrows were drawn on the surface outline indicating the planar polarity of cells within each of the immediate high magnification views, until the entire epithelium was mapped. Figure 3. Open in a new tabThe SEM montages were also used to count the number of immature hair cells across the sensory epithelium. Hair cells were classified as immature when: 1) stereocilia length was shorter or equal to the supporting cell microvilli, 2) lack of, or small, area free of microvilli around the stereocilia bundle on the apical surface of the hair cell and 3) stereocilia length being equal to the kinocilium length. The location of the kinocilia within the immature hair cell bundles were designated as either internal or external. Internal kinocilia appeared within the stereocilia bundle (centered or eccentric), while external kinocilia appeared at the outer edge of the bundle. In order to measure hair cell density, stereocilia bundles were counted from SEM images (×1200) taken at two different macular locations, including the striolar and extrastriolar regions (central epithelium from anterior – posterior). For all maculae, the counting frame regions were 2,500μm2. Age dependent shrinkage factors were applied to adjust the actual surface area counted.Immunohistochemistry Tissues used for whole mount immunohistochemistry were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Some maculae were sectioned, others prepared for whole mount imaging. For sectioning, tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT medium, and frozen in isopentane. Sections (10μm) were cut, mounted on slides, and stored at −80 °C. Next, endogenous peroxidases were blocked for 30 minutes in 1% hydrogen peroxide in 90% methanol. Whole mount utricles and saccules were permeabilized in 2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 hours. Tissue sections and whole endorgans were then blocked with 1% BSA, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum in PBS. Afferent nerve endings were labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody against class III β-tubulin (Tuj1, Covance, Denver, PA; Lee et al., 1990). Type I hair cells were labeled with a polyclonal antibody raised against purified chicken brain tenascin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; AB19013). Tenascin immunoreactivity was eliminated by cross-reaction with purified tenascin-C (Chemicon, CC115). All primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000. When the final chromagen was DAB, the tissue was incubated in ABC solution (Vector Elite ABC kit) and reacted in DAB solution (see below).Apoptosis Utricles and saccules were dissected and fixed as described above. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked for 30 minutes in 1% hydrogen peroxide in 90% methanol. Tissues were permeabilized in 2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Apoptotic cells were labeled with the TUNEL method using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Branford CT). The tissue was incubated in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme solution for 16 hours, then rinsed. Non-specific tissue sites were blocked with 1% BSA, 1% Triton X-100 and 2% normal sheep serum in PBS. The tissue was then incubated in peroxidase linked anti-fluorescein antibody for 16 hours at 4°C. DAB labeling was carried out as described above. The endorgans were mounted on glass slides, coverslipped and viewed on a Nikon E-600 light microscope. Darkly stained hair cell nuclei were counted across the entire sensory epithelium, at a focal plane near the apical epithelial surface in at least four endorgans per age group. Only hair cell nuclei are located in the upper levels of the epithelium (Desai et al., 2005; Rüsch et al., 1998; Si et al., 2003), with support cell nuclei restricted to a thin layer deep in the epithelium adjacent to the stroma.Retrograde neural tracers Two different neural tracing methods were utilized. For embryos and P1 quails, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was applied to the cut vestibular nerve just medial to Scarpa’s ganglion and a pellet of recrystallized HRP (Sigma, Type VI) was applied to the nerve end. Next, a small opening was made in the cartilaginous temporal bone near the utricle to expose the vestibular sensory tissue to medium. The half head was incubated in oxygenated Medium 199 (Invitrogen) for 4 hours at 20°C to allow for HRP transport. The maculae were then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and permeabilized in 2% triton X-100 in 0.1M Tris buffer, for 16 hours at 4°C. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked with 1% hydrogen peroxide in 90% methanol. Next, the HRP enzyme was visualized using 0.5mg/ml DAB, 0.05% hydrogen peroxide and 0.005% nickel cobalt in PBS. The tissue was dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols, cleared in propylene oxide and embedded in Durcupan (EM Sciences, Hatfield PA). Sections were cut (10μm), mounted on slides, stained with Richardson’s solution (1960), and coverslipped. For adult tissues, better morphological detail was achieved with the use of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA, 10K MW, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) as a neural tracer. Four adult quail were anesthetized with isoflurane and BDA was ionophoretically injected into the vestibular nuclei. After a seven day survival period, the animals were euthanized and an intralabyrinthine perfusion of 3% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% acrolein in CBS was performed. The maculae were dissected free, the otoconia and otolith membrane were removed. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked as described previously and the tissue was incubated in 10μg/ml of avidin-HRP (Vector Labs, Burlingame CA) in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. The reaction was initiated using DAB as described above. The tissues were then dehydrated, embedded in Durcupan and serially sectioned at 10μm.Afferent reconstruction Afferent reconstructions were performed on fibers innervating the four adult utricular macula that had been labeled with BDA. Detailed methodology for afferent reconstructions can be found in our previous studies (Si et al., 2003; Zakir et al., 2003). Briefly, all utricular reconstructed terminal morphologies were taken from serial sections (10μm) through the macula (animals with efferent somas labeled were excluded). For each section, a contour of the epithelial surface was drawn using video microscopy (Nikon E600, 60x oil) and a 3D image analysis reconstruction program. Next, a 3D map of the epithelial surface was plotted using the traced contours. Each reconstructed afferent was characterized as to terminal type and the measured locations within the epithelium were noted. For each traced afferent, a number of morphological parameters were quantified, including: axon diameter, number of fiber branches, branch order, total fiber length, fiber volume, innervation area, number of type I hair cells/calyceal terminal, calyceal volume, and number of bouton terminals/fiber (for details, see: Si et al, 2003; Zakir et al., 2003).Statistical analyses All statistical comparisons were performed using analyses of variance (ANOVA) with commercial software (Statistica; Statsoft, Tulsa OK). All post hoc comparisons were made using the Sheffé follow-up test. Proportional relationships were investigated using Pearson product-moment correlations.RESULTS Growth of the sensory epithelium The total areas of the utricular and saccular receptor epithelia were measured (n = 3 - 16 maculae) for each developmental day from E6–E15, P0 (hatch), and for post-hatch days P1 (24 hours post-hatch), P7, and P48 (adult). Initially, both the utricular and saccular maculae increased in area at about the same rate during early embryonic development, as shown in Figure 1A. Little growth occurred between days E6 and E7, however both maculae doubled in size between E7 and E8. Continued grow was observed at an accelerated rate through hatching at E16. During embryogenesis, there were a few days where no growth occurred, such as E12 and E14. Different growth rates were observed for the two otolith organs, with an overall larger receptor epithelium growing faster for the utricle as compared to the saccule. After hatching, the saccular macula underwent almost no growth, while the utricular macula continued to increase in size until reaching asymptotic levels by P7. The rates of growth for both the utricular and saccular maculae followed a sigmoidal function (Fig. 1A), with significantly different slopes (1.8 – utricle; 1.3 - saccule). By adulthood, the mean utricular area of 96.8 × 104μm2 (±8 × 104μm2, n = 9) was nearly double that of the saccule (45.0 × 104μm2 ±2.7 × 104μm2, n=10) (F(1,17) = 391.2, p<0.001). Figure 1. Open in a new tabHair cell density Stereocilia bundles were quantified from counting frames taken at similar locations across the receptor epithelium (see Methods). Four utricular and four saccular maculae were each examined at E6 - E15, P7 and P42 (adult) developmental days. As shown in Figure 1B, initially the mean hair cell densities in the striolar regions of both maculae exhibited significantly faster maturation rates as compared to extrastriolar regions (Utricle - E6: F(1,4) 7.9, p<0.05; E8: F(1,6) = 39.2, p<0.001; and E10: F(1,6) = 37.2, p<0.001; Saccule - E6 (F(1,6) = 353.6, p<0.001), E8 (F(1,6) = 41.1, p<0.001) and E10 (F(1,6) = 6.8, p<0.05). Later in development, hair cell density actually decreased from E8 to E10; likely due to the rapid growth in size of the epithelium (Fig. 1A). From E12 until adulthood, the extrastriolar regions exhibited increased hair cell densities that remained fairly constant during post-hatch development (Fig. 1B). These differences in regional density can be attributed to two factors. First, the macula forms initially around the striolar region and expands outward, with increased growth through the extrastriola region as the epithelia matures. Second, in adult quail, type I hair cells are primarily located in the striolar region and these hair cells have a much larger apical size than type II hair cells. Type II hair cells are located throughout the macula, but are the only hair cell type found in the extrastriola region.Programmed cell death Often in neural development, cellular proliferation is accompanied by programmed cell death. The number of apoptotic cells (dark stain) was counted across the entire utricular and saccular maculae at different developmental stages (normalized for epithelial size), as illustrated in Figure 2. Few apoptotic cells were observed during early embryogenesis (Fig. 2A, D). However at E14 (Fig. 2B, D) a significant increase in programmed cell death was observed for both the utricle (F(1,16) = 14.2, p<0.01) and saccule (F(1, 10) = 20.0, p<0.01). Thereafter, the density of apoptotic hair cells decreased steadily through adulthood (Fig. 2C, D). Apoptotic cells were more concentrated in the striolar regions of the maculae and appeared coincident with the development of type I hair cells (see below). Figure 2. Open in a new tabHair cell planar polarity In order to examine the formation of stereocilia planar polarity, the morphological polarizations of hair cells were quantified at different developmental stages. As shown in Figure 3A for one E8 utricle, a 50μm wide counting frame was first indexed across the central macular surface (dorsal to ventral – saccule; medial to lateral – utricle). Next, orientation vectors were drawn for each hair cell (Fig. 3B, adult utricle) within the counting frame and vector angles measured (Fig. 3A). Angles from all hair cells in the counting frames from two maculae each from E6 - E8, E10, E12, E15, P7 and adult developmental days were determined, then plotted as a function of normalized distance, as shown in Figure 4. To quantify these formation patterns, linear regression analyses were performed for cell orientations with normalized distance values between 0.3 and 0.8 (central macula), with the variance being used as a measure of polarity maturation. Figure 4. Open in a new tabIn early development, stereocilia bundles in the otolith maculae exhibited substantial variation in morphological polarization. For example, at E6 orientation angles were widely distributed (regression r2 values of 0.15), with neighboring cells having polarities that could differ by as much as 180 degrees (Fig. 4A, E). Most utricular hair cells located in the lateral portion of the macula (distance values near 0.0) were initially oriented toward the anterior (0o, or 360o) to lateral (270o) edges of the macula. An incremental change in bundle orientation from anterior to lateral to posterior (Fig 4A) (increase in normalized distance) was observed for cells located in the lateral-to-medial dimension of the utricular macula. Further, at E6 a few cells in the lateral utricular macula had reversed their orientation to be directed toward the medial edge (90° angles), thus marking the initiation of the reversal zone. Similar orientations were observed for the E6 saccular macula (Fig. 4E). By E7 however, hair cells were beginning to orient themselves in a pattern that approximated that of the adult (regression variance of r2 = 0.49; Fig. 4B). As shown in Figures 3C & E, a reversal line of opposing hair cell polarity ran along the lateral and anterior edges of the adult utricular macula. However, on the medial edge, hair cells were directed in an anti-parallel organization. This pattern was reflected in the polarization angle plots of Figure 4D, where the opposing reversal line was observed at a normalized distance of 0.2 and the anti-parallel zone at a distance of 0.9. By E8, the utricular polarizations were equal to that of the adult. In the saccular macula, the maturation was delayed compared to the utricle. First, in the adult saccule, a single C-shaped reversal line was observed, as shown in Figures 3D & F. The saccular counting frame bisected the reversal line at normalized distances of approximately 0.25 and 0.8 in the adult (Fig. 4H). At E7 (Fig. 4F), saccular hair cells in these zones were beginning to exhibit bundle orientations more similar to the mature patterns, with even less variation observed at E8 (r2 = 0.90). By E10 (r2 = 0.92), the polarization angles for utricular hair cells were not different from that observed in the adult (r2 = 0.94, Fig. 4D). In the saccular macula, a final mature pattern (r2 = 0.94; Fig. 4H) was not complete until E12 (r2 = 0.93). Stereocilia bundle orientations were also used to determine the topographic polarization distribution in the adult quail maculae. As shown in Figures 3E and F, a complex pattern of hair cell planar polarities was observed. In the lateral and anterior utricular macula, orientation vectors were inwardly directed toward an opposing reversal line (dotted, Fig. 3C, E). However, in the medial extrastriolar region, orientation vectors were directed in an anti-parallel fashion along a second reversal line (dashed lines, Fig. 3C, E). In the saccular macula, opposing reversals were directed away from the reversal line throughout the epithelium, except for a small area in the inferior portion of the saccule where cells exhibited obtuse angles (Fig. 3D, F). In addition, in the striolar regions of both maculae, hair cells exhibited bundles with numerous short stereocilia (Fig. 3G), while in the extrastriolar regions bundles contained fewer, but longer, stereocilia (Fig. 3H).Striola formation Vertebrate maculae have a specialized region termed the striola. Recently, Moravec and Peterson (2004) observed that type I hair cells in turtles could be distinguished by their stereocilia bundles, having significantly more numerous and shorter cilia than type II hair cells. Although quantitative analyses of stereocilia formation and confirmation of cell type were outside the scope of the present investigation, we none-the-less applied a similar metric to adult quail in an attempt to differentiate type I and type II hair cell location across the macular surfaces. Surprisingly, a fairly distinct border between zones containing putative type I hair cells (short stereocilia, Fig. 3G) and zones containing only putative type II hair cells (long stereocilia, Fig. 3H) was observed. As shown in Figures 3C and 3D, the striolar regions (solid white lines) were regionally restricted and could be characterized as the primary zones that contained putative type I cells. Mixed in with these type I hair cells, were cells with longer and fewer stereocilia (putative type II cells), although much less numerous. In contrast, extrastriola regions contained only putative type II hair cells. These demarcations were next applied to embryonic maculae in order to determine at what point in development the striolar regions becomes defined. We observed that the first striolar margins formed at E10. The stereocilia bundles of most hair cells in E10 and younger embryos appeared similar to those of putative type II cells and varied little across the sensory epithelia, including areas that would later develop into the striolar region. As described in more detail below, it appears that before E10 – E12, no mature type I hair cell phenotype is present in the maculae. However, after E12, type I hair cells developed to populate the striolar regions and the regional differences in stereocilia bundle morphology became more defined.Stereocilia bundle formation As shown in Figure 5 (E8 utricle), immature hair cells could be identified by unique stereocilia bundle characteristics. These included a short kinocilium, short stereocilia of nearly equal length, and the lack of a clear zone free of support cell microvilli around the hair cell bundle. In addition, the location of the kinocilium within the bundle varied and could be either internal (Fig. 5A, B) or external (Fig. 5C) to the other stereocilia. Fig. 5A shows an immature hair cell with a kinocilium located at the center of the stereocilia bundle. Denman-Johnson and Forge (1999) described similar bundle morphologies as “enfant cells” in embryonic mice. Fig. 5B shows another immature hair cell type with its kinocilium located asymmetrically, but still within, the stereocilia bundle. Still other immature hair cells exhibited external kinocilia eccentric to the stereocilia bundle, as is universally true for mature hair cells. All three immature cells (Fig. 5A, B, C) had equivalent diameter bundles (~1μm), suggesting that they were of a similar level of development. Although a quantitative analysis was not performed, as a comparison mature hair cells across the epithelium generally exhibited apical diameters ranging between 4 - 9μm. It was observed that neighboring cells in the receptor epithelium were often at different stages of development. As shown in Fig. 5D, immature (arrow), intermediate (lower center) and mature (upper right) stereocilia formations were all observed in close proximity. Figure 5. Open in a new tabThese immature bundle characteristics were used to quantify cell maturation throughout development. In E5 quail, the sensory epithelia were thickly covered with microvilli and a few small, poorly defined stereocilia bundles were observed (data not shown). However, at E6, distinct stereocilia bundles could be identified, with most of the utricular (88%) and all of the saccular (100%) hair cells exhibiting immature stereocilia bundles. Of these (n = 400), slightly less than half (45%, n = 167) had internal kinocilia while the rest exhibited external kinocilia (Figure 5F). By E7, the number of immature hair cells had declined to approximately half of the total population (n=335) and to less than 20% (total n = 1144) by E8 (Fig. 5E). Of these immature bundles, nearly one third had internal kinocilia while the remaining ones were external. As embryonic development continued from E10 - hatching, most cells had mature bundle configurations. Only 6 - 12% out of 1382 cells counted were immature, with fewer kinocilia being internal (Fig. 5E-F). By adulthood, less than 1% of all observable hair bundles (n = 1432) were considered to be immature. The maturation of hair cells followed an exponential time course for both maculae (Fig. 5E). Consequently, as the number of immature hair cells decreased, the percentage of cells with external kinocilia increased (Fig. 5F). In terms of epithelial location, during early embryogenesis most immature bundles were found in the future striolar region (normalized distance 0.2 – 0.5), as shown for the utricular macula in Figure 5F. This region corresponds to that exhibiting the largest increase in cell proliferation (Fig 1B). By E10 however, most immature bundles were located in the extrastriolar regions of both maculae (Fig. 5G).Afferent innervation during development In order to examine the development of afferent innervations and cellular differentiation, neural tracers and immunohistochemistry markers were utilized. Macular afferents were examined in at least four animals for each developmental time point between E6 – E15, P7 and adult. In addition to neural tracers, nerve fibers and calyx afferent terminals were labeled with an antibody against class III β-tubulin (Tuj1). Tuj1 is a neuron specific marker that has been well characterized for visualization properties in vestibular tissue (Perry et al., 2003; Molea et al., 1999). As shown in Figure 6, afferent innervation of the vestibular sensory epithelia began early, coincident with the receptor hair cell differentiation. At E6, a number of small nerve fibers had penetrated the receptor epithelium (Fig. 6A – C). Most of these early developing fibers were characterized by either elongated (Fig. 6A) or elliptical (Fig. 6B) growth cones that coursed toward the apical epithelial surface with few branch points or arborizations. These growing fibers appeared to be targeting differentiated receptor cells at the apical portions of the epithelium. By E8, nerve fibers demonstrated terminal swellings on or near developing hair cells (Fig. 6D-E) with more numerous arborizations (Fig. 6F). At E10, cup-shaped proto-calyceal terminals were first observed to be forming around the basolateral area of some hair cells (Fig. 6G-I). By E12, calyceal terminals were observed that encapsulated many presumptive type I hair cells, while others continued to form (Fig. 6J-L). Most of these fibers contained both calyceal terminals and additional branches with bouton terminals or growth cones, indicative of dimorph type afferents. In whole mount preparations viewed from the apical surface, the striolar region was identifiable from large clusters of calyceal terminals. These calyces were formed into discrete structures surrounding one or several presumptive type I hair cells (Fig. 6L). At E14, a number of mature calyceal terminals were observed, with endings that fully enveloped hair cells up to their apical surface (Fig. 6M - N). Many of these calyceal terminals enveloped multiple type I hair cells and had no observable branch fibers. Thus, at this point in development, true calyx fibers were first observed in abundance. In addition, at E14, the 4 - 6 cell wide type II band, devoid of type I cells, had formed and encompassed the reversal line in the striola (Fig. 6O). Figure 6. Open in a new tabType I hair cell and striolar localization in adult maculae It is known that calyceal terminals exclusively localize type I hair cells in the adult vestibular sensory epithelium. However their absence during development does not preclude type I cell formation (Rüsch et al., 1998). Thus, a more specific type I hair cell marker was also sought. Based upon previous reports that suggested that the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin could be exclusively expressed in type I hair cells (Swartz and Santi, 1999; Warchol and Speck, 2007), we used a tenascin antibody in an attempt to identify the formation of type I hair cells in embryonic and adult maculae. First, the localization of tenascin in type I hair cells was examined in adult quail maculae by double labeling with both β-tubulin (green) and tenascin (red) antibodies, as shown in Figure 7 of an adult utricle. β-tubulin was expressed throughout the calyceal terminal and in portions of the afferent fibers (Fig. 7A). Tenascin, in contrast, was expressed in the outer portion of the type I hair cell membrane, forming distinct rings when viewed from the surface at different focal planes (Fig. 7B). When merged (Fig. 7C), the tenascin expression was confined within the larger calyceal structures, suggesting again that tenascin is located in hair cell specific proteins and not in the innervating calyceal terminal. In Figure 7D - F, a single image from the lateral region of a sectioned P7 utricle has been double labeled. Here, calyceal terminals were clearly labeled with β-tubulin, while the tenascin expression was observed in the hair cell outer membrane, the basement membrane, and punctate label in innervating afferent fibers of the sensory epithelium (Fig. 7E). We next examined tenascin expression in embryonic maculae and found that labeling of any sort (except the basement membrane) was extremely weak in early embryos (E6 – E8). In later stage embryonic maculae (E10 – E12), tenascin could only be found in punctate formations in hair cells. However, by E14, tenascin expression was observed to be similar to that shown for P7 and adult maculae. Figure 7. Open in a new tabAfferent innervation patterns in adult maculae As shown in Figure 8, three distinct fiber types including calyx (Fig. 8A), dimorph (Fig. 8B), and bouton (Fig. 8C) innervation patterns were all observed in quail. From the traced fibers, 3D anatomical reconstructions for 69 individual afferent fibers (20 calyx, 23 dimorph, and 26 bouton) were performed (Fig. 8D-F). The locations of all afferents that were quantified through anatomical reconstructions are shown in Figure 8G, where a regional topography of afferent types was observed. Calyx afferents were confined to the striolar region, as were most of the dimorph afferents. A very few dimorph fibers were also located in the extrastriola (one reconstructed, several others noted but not reconstructed). All bouton afferents were either located in the extrastriola, or in the narrow type II band that flanked the reversal line. Bouton afferents innervating the type II band did not exhibit branching patterns that crossed the reversal line, so that only hair cells of similar morphological polarity were innervated. Figure 8. Open in a new tabMorphometric parameters from the three different classes of afferents were compared, with mean values and ranges listed in Table 1. For calyx afferents, a single large parent axon (average diameter of 3.0μm (SD±0.7) entered the neuroepithelium, then generally ended with a single calyceal terminal that innervated several hair cells. Although the number of hair cells ranged between 1 -8, most calyceal terminals contained 3 - 5 type I hair cells, with a mean value of 4.2 (SD±1.8). Correspondingly, the calyceal terminals for calyx afferents were large, occupying an average 294.9μm2 (SD±122.9) of area in the striolar epithelium. By comparison, the calyx fibers exhibited the simplest arborization patterns of all afferents (Table 1). Table 1.

Dimorph afferents contained both calyceal and bouton terminals that innervated type I and type II hair cells (Fig. 8B, E). Most (95%) of the observed dimorph afferents were located in the striolar region, intermixed with the calyx afferents. A few dimorph afferents also had terminal branch fields that innervated the type II band and the striolar region (Fig. 8G). Dimorph axon diameters were significantly smaller than the calyx afferents (Table 1), varying between 1.0 – 3.2 μm with a mean value of 2.4μm (SD±0.6). Simple dimorph afferents contained a single branch off the parent axon, while the most complex afferent quantified contained 41 branch fibers (out to the 10th order). The mean number of branches for the dimorph afferents was 14.7 (SD±9.7), which was significantly higher than calyx afferents (Table 1). Dimorph calyceal terminals contained significantly fewer type I hair cells than calyx units (Table 1), with a mean of 2.1 (SD±1.2) cells/calyceal terminal. For innervation of type II cells, simple dimorph afferents could have a single branch with only one bouton terminal, or they could be complex with many branches (maximum = 41) and multiple bouton terminals (maximum = 46). Thus, dimorph innervation areas were significantly larger than those of calyx afferents, with a mean value of 449.5μm2 (SD±139.8). Due to the longer parent axons and the more extensive arborization patterns of dimorphs, the mean fiber length of 150.9μm (SD ±72.9) was significantly larger than that of only 44μm (SD±15.2) for calyx afferents (Table 1). However, due to the smaller diameter of the dimorph fibers as compared to calyx units, there was no difference in overall fiber volume. The terminal field areas for the dimorph afferents were significantly larger than calyx afferents, with areas ranging between 179 μm2 for simple fibers to 711μm2 for the most complex afferent profiles. Bouton afferents were characterized by en passant and bouton terminals that exclusively terminated upon type II hair cells. Bouton afferent diameters were significantly smaller than those of the calyx afferents, with a mean value of 2.0μm; but were only marginally smaller than dimorph afferents (Table 1). After entering the neuroepithelium, bouton afferents varied greatly in the size and complexity of their arborization patterns. The simplest afferent quantified contained only five branch fibers and an equal number of bouton terminals, while the most complex afferent had 63 branches out to the 12th order. With a mean number of 29.2 (SD±15.9) branches per fiber, the bouton afferents were significantly more arborous than either the dimorph or calyx afferents (Table 1). The mean fiber length of 270.1μm (SD±147.8) for the bouton afferents was significantly larger than both of the two other classes of fibers. Extensive branching was also correlated with increased terminals, where the mean number of boutons (35.3) was more than twice that observed for the dimorph afferents, a significant finding (Table 1). For bouton afferents, the innervation areas had a mean value of 627.3μm2 that was significantly larger than that for either the calyx or dimorph afferents (Table 1).DISCUSSION Our findings represent a comprehensive study of the development of the vestibular otolith receptors in birds. We addressed three primary questions. First, how do the specific regional distributions of type I and II hair cells develop across the epithelium? We observed that type II hair cells develop first, followed later by the appearance of type I hair cells. This was true even in macular regions that would later be densely populated by type I hair cells. Second, how do the directional polarization maps develop? We observed that planar cell polarity patterns migrate through several days of embryogenesis to reach an adult topographic form. Third, how do the three afferent types develop into regional distributions across the macula? We found that bouton afferents develop first. Calyceal terminals form later on dimorph afferents and true calyx afferents do not appear until the last stage of development. At maturity, we found the regional distribution of calyx, dimorph and bouton afferent terminals in the adult quail utricle to be similar to that reported for pigeons. Macular growth and hair cell development Similar to growth rates reported for chicks, quail macular areas develop at an exponential rate, with near completion by the first post-hatch week (Goodyear et al., 1999; Kido et al., 1993). Hair cell formation in quail also followed a similar trajectory as reported for chicks (Goodyear et al., 1999; Roberson et al., 1992; Jørgensen and Mathiesen, 1988), where the early hair cell growth occurred in the striolar regions followed by the extrastriola. In the striolar regions, a high concentration of type I hair cells was found, leading to decreased densities due to larger cell size. Coupled to the proliferation of hair cells, programmed cell death was initiated late in development, but declined to low finite values after hatching that continued into adulthood; similar to the 1% apoptotic turnover rates reported for chicks by Kil et al. (1997).Stereocilia development and polarization Morphological polarization of hair cells is important, since stereocilia displacement determines the directional sensitivity of the hair cell (Hudspeth and Corey, 1977) and provides the basis for spatial coding (Fernández and Goldberg, 1976; Flock, 1964; Si et al., 1997). The development of planar cell polarity in hair cells has been well described for the auditory system (Kaltenbach et al., 1994; Tilney et al., 1988; Tilney et al., 1992 review), but less so for the vestibular system (Denman-Johnson and Forge, 1999; Mbiene et al., 1984). Here, the polarization maps for both maculae in adult quail were established. Similar to many vertebrates, hair cell polarizations are directed toward the reversal line in the utricle (Baird and Schuff, 1994; Lewis and Li, 1975; Lu and Popper, 1998; Platt, 1975; Severinsen et al., 2003; Si et al., 2003; Wersäll et al., 1965), but away from the reversal line in the saccule (Jørgensen and Andersen, 1973; Lindeman, 1969; Spoendlin, 1964; Zakir et al., 2003). In birds, the reversal line is located in the striola region, toward the lateral and anterior edges of the epithelium (Si et al., 2003), with an anti-parallel arrangement observed along the medial extrastriola border. In mammals, the macular reversal zones are centrally located, with no region of anti-parallel organization shown to date (Fernández et al., 1990; Li et al., 2008; Lindeman, 1969). In contrast to the utricle, the quail saccule had a C-shaped reversal zone, similar to that seen in cormorants (Jørgensen and Andersen, 1973). However, in other species, the saccular reversal zone is J-shaped or S-shaped such as in pigeons (Zakir et al., 2003), many fish (Edds-Walton and Fay, 1995; Platt, 1975; Popper and Northcutt, 1983; Popper and Saidel, 1990) and mammals (Desai et al., 2005; Lindeman, 1969; Spoendlin, 1964). In quail, we found that planar cell polarity occurred early in development. Many immature bundle formations exhibited an internal kinocilium that must migrate to an external position for polarity to be established. Nearly 90% of the measured cells exhibited immature stereocilia bundles early in development, but by E10, most cells were polarized. In immature bundles, more than 40% had internal kinocilia. Recently, several genes encoding adherence proteins (e.g., Flamingo, Frizzled, Scribble, Van Gogh) have been shown to be necessary for determining planar polarity in vestibular hair cells (Davies et al., 2005; Montcouqouil et al., 2003; 2006; Wang et al., 2006). The proteins reside eccentrically in the apical surface and are thought to guide the kinocilium of each cell to the peripheral edge, thereby establishing the morphological polarization. In quail, polarity cues appear to be present as early as E7, and possibly E6, to initiate the morphological polarization of hair cells regionally across the macular surfaces. The planar polarities for hair cells were not randomly distributed, but instead established orientations that migrated as development progressed. By E10, the polarization maps were fully formed to an adult pattern in the utricle, complete with reversal zones, while the saccular map lagged behind by approximately one developmental day. The cues that regulate the map formation are unknown. Recent studies have suggested that signaling morphogens in the cochlea (where all hair cells have similar orientations) could produce a diffusion gradient across the epithelium to direct cellular polarity (Dabdoub and Kelley, 2005). However, in the vestibular maculae, hair cells have regional variations in morphological polarization and even different types of reversal zones, so multiple morphogens working in directional cascades would seem to be necessary. Recently, Warchol and Speck (2007) reported that the transcription factor GATA3 is expressed selectively beneath the perpendicular reversal zones in the chick utricle and lagena, but is absent in the oppositely directed reversal zone of the saccule. These authors suggest that GATA3 may induce morphogens that could direct a perpendicular reversal zone. They also suggest that it is possible that GATA3 plays a role in development of the unique type II band of hair cells in the utricle and lagena that is not present in the saccule. In the end, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying development of hair cell polarization in the vestibular receptor organs.Afferent development It is known that in chicks and mice, at E5 and E13.5 respectively, vestibular hair cells begin to differentiate and migrate toward the epithelial surface early in development, (Friedmann, 1969; Ruben, 1967; Goodyear et al., 1995); before nerve fiber penetration into the sensory epithelium occurs (Friedmann, 1969). In quail, the initial afferent fibers entering the maculae appeared to be directed toward developing hair cells, consistent with the suggestion that hair cells supply chemical guidance cues to direct fiber growth. In fact, it has been reported that hair cells release neurotrophins, including BDNF and NT3, which are known to bind to specific afferent receptors (TrkB and TrkC, respectively) to direct growing fibers toward their targets (Ernfors et al., 1995; Fritzsch et al., 1998; Tessarollo et al., 2004). In quail, bouton terminals were observed early in development, largely in close approximation to hair cells, similar to findings reported for chick embryos (Ginzberg and Gilula, 1980). No developing calyceal terminals were observed until later in development, around E10. These early calyceal terminals consisted of cup shaped endings at the hair cell base, which were later followed by terminal finger-like projections that extended along the sides of the hair cell towards the apex. Similar descriptions for calyceal formation have been reported for chick maculae (Fink and Morest, 1977; Friedmann and Bird, 1967; Ginzberg and Gilula, 1980). Most of these initial proto-calyceal terminals were formed on fibers with extant branching fiber segments which contained terminal boutons. It appears certain that calyceal terminals develop on existing bouton fibers, and thereby trans-differentiate into dimorph afferents at E10 – E12. Many of these fibers are expected to remain dimorph afferents. However, it was not until late in embryonic development, at E14, that isolated calyx afferents were first observed. Since bouton fibers appear to trans-differentiate into dimorph units, it is also likely that some fraction of the dimorph fibers become induced (by as yet unknown factors) to shed their small branch segments with bouton endings and trans-differentiate into calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells. We have recently proposed that a similar trans-differentiation process occurs during regenerative re-innervation of the vestibular epithelia (Haque et al., 2009; Zakir and Dickman, 2006). Alternatively, it is possible that new afferent fibers destined to form calyx innervations grow into the epithelium late in development. More research is needed to answer the question. As a comparison, calyceal terminal formation begins essentially at birth in rodents and continues for several post-natal weeks (Rüsch et al., 1998). However, many mammalian type I hair cells become differentiated prior to calyceal formation, again suggesting that morphogenic factors give direct signaling cues for calyceal terminal development (Lysakowski, 1999; Rüsch et al., 1998).Afferent innervation patterns At the terminal phase of development, bouton, dimorph, and calyx afferents were all observed in quail maculae, similar to other amniote vertebrates (Fernández et al., 1990; Si et al., 2003; Zakir et al., 2003). In the utricle, calyceal bearing afferents were principally located in the striola while bouton afferents innervated the extrastriola and type II band, similar to the organization reported for pigeons (Si et al., 2003; Zakir et al., 2003). In both species, calyceal bearing afferents are more broadly distributed throughout the saccular macula (Jørgensen and Andersen, 1973; Rosenhall, 1970; Si et al., 2003; Zakir et al., 2003). As a comparison, mammalian and turtle calyx afferents are restricted to a narrow striolar region (Desai et al., 2005; Leonard and Kevetter, 2002; Moravec and Peterson, 2004; Xue and Peterson, 2008), while in mammals dimorph afferents are found broadly throughout the epithelium. Bouton afferents are exclusively located in the mammalian extrastriolar region (Fernández et al., 1990). We have previously suggested that type I hair cells and calyceal terminals in otolith receptors may be increasing in numbers through selective adaptation (Zakir et al., 2003). For example, Type I hair cells are not present in fish or amphibians (Baird and Schuff, 1994; Chang et al., 1992), but first appear in reptiles and birds in limited numbers (Si et al., 2003; Moravec and Peterson; 2004; Zakir et al., 2003). The number of type I hair cells and calyceal terminals increases in mammals where the highest concentrations have been observed (Fernández et al., 1990; Desai et al., 2005; Lysakowski and Goldberg, 2008). In quail, calyx afferents had the largest diameter axons, with short unbranched fibers that terminated in large calyceal terminals. On average, calyces contained 4 type I hair cells, fewer than the value of 7 for pigeons (Si et al., 2003), but more than the 1 – 3 hair cells generally observed in mammalian calyces (Desai et al., 2005; Fernández et al., 1990). Quail dimorph afferents were the most diverse in terms of innervation. Their parent axons were smaller than calyx fibers, yet their innervation patterns were more complex with multi-branched fibers that innervated a larger area of the utricular epithelium. There were fewer type I hair cells per calyceal terminal in dimorphs (average of 2) than calyx afferents. A similar diversity in pigeon utricular dimorph afferents was reported, except that pigeon dimorphs (like calyx afferents) were typically larger and more complex than those of quail (Si et al., 2003). In chinchillas, dimorph fibers were more widely spread throughout the macular epithelium than observed in birds (Fernández et al., 1990). Finally, quail bouton afferents had the smallest diameter axons of all fiber types, yet they were the most complex with the most branches, the largest arborization profiles, and the largest innervation areas. For comparison, the average number of 35 bouton terminals in quail afferents was identical to the mean value of 35 reported for chinchillas (Fernández et al., 1990), but less than the value of 60 for pigeons (Si et al., 2003) or nearly 150 for frogs (where only type II hair cells exist; Baird and Schuff, 1994). Unfortunately, there remains a paucity of data relating differences in afferent physiological responsiveness to the striking differences in fiber innervation pattern. What is known is that fibers innervating the central maculae in chinchillas, where the calyx afferents are located, have the most irregular discharge rates, the highest sensitivities, and the most advanced phase values to linear acceleration as compared to extrastriola innervating afferents (Goldberg et al., 1990). In pigeons, we previously reported that utricular afferents exhibit some of the highest sensitivities to linear acceleration of any species examined to date (Si et al., 1997). These fibers also responded to high frequency stimuli with advanced phase values, but whether these fibers had calyceal terminals or not is unknown. No data currently exist for quail. To the best of our knowledge, neural recordings of developing vestibular afferents during embryogenesis have not been performed in any species. Still, otolith receptors must begin functioning early in many birds as vestibular evoked potentials could be elicited using linear acceleration in E19 chick embryos (Jones and Jones, 2000). Further, upon hatching, quail begin to forage and feed themselves, so a functioning vestibular system must exist. During development, it would appear that bouton afferents become responsive first, followed later by calyceal bearing fibers. Questions regarding development sequences of physiological responses and vestibular mediated behaviors remain the subject of future investigations. Certainly, differences in hair cell organization and innervation morphology throughout the maculae serve to provide important functional distinctions.Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Mark Warchol for valuable discussions.

However, the spatial and temporal relationships between converging inputs and how these contribute to vestibular behaviors is not well understood. In the current study, we used discrete rotational and translational motion stimuli to characterize canal- and otolith-driven response components of convergent non-eye movement (NEM) neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex of alert pigeons. When compared to afferent responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation. Convergent otolith signals also had similar mean gain and phase values to the afferent population but were spatially well-matched with the corresponding canal signals, cell-by-cell. However, neither response component alone nor a simple linear combination of these components was sufficient to predict actual net responses during combined canal-otolith stimulation. We discuss these findings in the context of previous studies of pigeon vestibular behaviors, and we compare our findings to similar studies in other species. Keywords: vestibular, sensory convergence, brainstemINTRODUCTION The vestibular system consists of biological sensors that detect head movements in space. The semicircular canals and otolith organs detect angular and linear head accelerations, respectively. In the brainstem, canal and otolith afferents terminate on neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC). Neuroanatomical studies in many species have shown overlap between canal and otolith afferent projection regions in the brainstem (Carleton and Carpenter 1984; Dickman and Fang 1996; Kevetter and Perachio 1986; Kuruvilla et al. 1985; Newlands and Perachio 2003; Schwarz and Schwarz 1986). Direct convergence of canal and otolith afferents onto single VNC neurons has also been demonstrated using electrical nerve stimulation (Uchino et al. 2000; Zakir et al. 2000). Further, electrophysiological recordings from VNC neurons using discrete rotational and translational stimuli have characterized the dynamic properties and tuning characteristics of both convergent and non-convergent cells (Dickman and Angelaki 2002; Kasper, Schor and Wilson 1988; Tomlinson, McConville and Na 1996; Yakushin, Raphan and Cohen 2006). What are the functional implications of canal-otolith convergence in the VNC? One of the primary functions of VNC neurons is to generate compensatory eye, head and limb movements that stabilize gaze and posture during motion. In primates and many other animals, eye-in-head responses (vestibuloocular, VOR) make a significant contribution to gaze stability during passive body rotation (Keshner and Peterson 1995; Meier and Dieringer 1993; Newlands et al. 1999). Eye responses are driven by the activity of distinct categories of eye movement-related (EM) neurons in the VNC (Angelaki, Green and Dickman 2001; Beraneck and Cullen 2007; Brettler and Baker 2001; Cullen, Chen-Huang and McCrea 1993; McConville, Tomlinson and Na 1996; Precht 1979; Roy and Cullen 2002; Scudder and Fuchs 1992). However, head-on-body responses (vestibulocollic, VCR) also contribute to gaze stability (Keshner and Peterson 1995; Peng et al. 1999), driven in part by a heterogeneous population of non-eye movement related (NEM) neurons in the VNC (Gdowski and McCrea 1999; Kasper, Schor and Wilson 1988; McCrea et al. 1999; Roy and Cullen 2004; Wilson and Peterson 1978). In pigeons, the head response provides the primary means for active gaze stabilization, with magnitudes that far exceed that of the eye-in-head response when the head is free to move (Gioanni 1988; Haque and Dickman 2005). In a previous study, we used discrete combinations of canal and otolith stimulation to demonstrate that pigeons integrate these signals when generating eye and head responses to rotation (McArthur and Dickman 2008). Results were consistent with a linear combination of canal- and otolith-generated response components during rotational VOR. However, while canal and otolith components of rotational VCR were spatially aligned, the net head responses to combination stimuli were inconsistent (particularly in phase) with a simple linear combination model. Thus, the convergence of canal- and otolith-related inputs onto the central neurons generating these head responses needs to be characterized, to give some insight into how these signals might be integrated to produce the observed behavior. In the current study, we used simple motion stimuli to characterize canal-otolith convergence onto single NEM neurons in the VNC. Earth-vertical axis (EVA) rotations were used to characterize neural responses to canal inputs in the absence of dynamic otolith stimulation. Linear translations were used to characterize responses to otolith inputs in the absence of dynamic canal stimulation. Earth-horizontal axis (EHA) rotations dynamically stimulate the canals and otolith organs, since these rotations reorient the head relative to gravity and change the net linear acceleration sensed by the otolith organs. Thus, EHA rotations were used to characterize responses to combined canal and otolith stimulation, to provide a foundation for our understanding of how these signals are neurally integrated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Twelve adult pigeons (Columba livia, 400–700g, Double T Farm, Glenwood IA) were used in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Animals in Research, as well as those approved by the Institutional Animal Studies Committee. The animals were housed and cared for in the Laboratory Animal Facilities under veterinary supervision. The protocol and analyses were adapted from a previous study in primates (Dickman and Angelaki 2002). Surgical procedures General anesthesia was achieved using isofluorane gas (3–5% in O2) via endotracheal intubation. Heart rate was monitored, and core temperature (40°C) was maintained with a heating pad. Each bird was surgically implanted with a delrin head stud and a recording electrode guide platform. An incision was made along the skull midline, and the underlying periosteum was removed from the bone. The head was positioned stereotaxically with the beak angled approximately 12° downward, such that upright orientation of the head stud and recording platform corresponded on average to alignment of the horizontal canals with an earth-horizontal plane (Dickman 1996). The head stud (5x5x10mm) was attached to the skull with titanium self-tapping screws and secured with dental acrylic. In addition, a circular delrin recording platform (15mm diameter, 5mm depth) was attached to the skull posterior to the head stud. The platform was pre-drilled with a staggered array of holes (0.8mm apart) that extended from the midline to the area overlying the vestibular nerves (bilaterally). After surgery, butorphanol (10mg/kg) was administered for post-operative pain, and the head wound margin was kept clean with betadine washes and antibiotic ointment. Following a 5–7 day recovery period, five pigeons underwent an additional surgery to implant a scleral search coil in one eye to monitor eye movements. The coil was constructed of three turns of multi-stranded wire (Teflon-coated, 41-gauge stainless steel, A-M Systems) and coated in a thin layer of Araldite epoxy (Huntsman). Under surgical anesthesia (as described above), a circumferential incision was made in the conjuctiva to allow visualization of the sclera. In pigeons, the sclera is calcified near the cornea, so the coil was attached to the posterior margin of the scleral globe with 8-0 prolene sutures. Coil wire leads were threaded through the bone of the posterior orbit and underneath the skin to exit near the head stud. The conjuctiva was approximated over the coil and closed with 8-0 vicryl sutures. Lead wires were soldered to a nanoconnector (Omnetics) and secured next to the head stud with dental acrylic. After surgery, butorphanol (10mg/kg) was administered for post-operative pain, and ophthalmic antibiotic ointment (bacytracin/neomycin) was applied to the operated eye. Pigeons were allowed to fully recover (7–10 days) before being used in experiments.Recording procedures For each experiment, the pigeon was placed in a padded body holder, and the head stud was fixed in an upright position to the body holder. The holder was then secured to a servo-controlled rotator/sled system (Neurokinetics) driven by a PC and programmable interface (CED Model 1401plus, Cambridge Electronic Design). Stimulus control and data acquisition were performed using custom scripts written for the interface environment (Spike2, Cambridge Electronic Design). All stimuli were delivered along axes that passed through the center of the pigeon’s head (i.e. intersection of nasooccipital and interaural axes), and all experiments were performed in total darkness with the pigeon head-fixed. Stimulus delivery was monitored using a rate sensor and 3-axis linear accelerometer mounted near the animal’s head, the outputs of which were low-pass filtered (200Hz, 6-pole Bessel), digitized, and stored for off-line analyses. A three-field AC magnetic coil system (CNC Engineering) mounted to the motion system was used to monitor eye movements. The coil system provided a 5-in homogeneous magnetic field cube centered about the pigeon’s head. Eye coil signals were also low-pass filtered (200Hz, 6-pole Bessel), digitized, and stored. However, the eye movement signals were primarily used online to categorize cells as eye movement sensitive (EM) or non-eye movement sensitive (NEM) neurons. Extracellular recordings from single neurons in the vestibular nuclei were obtained using epoxy-coated tungsten microelectrodes (FHC, 10–15MΩ). The electrode was inserted into a 26-gauge stainless steel guide tube, advanced through one of the pre-drilled guide holes in the recording platform, then manipulated in depth with a remote control hydraulic microdrive (FHC). Neural activity was amplified, filtered (300Hz-10kHz), and passed through a dual time-amplitude window discriminator (BAK Instruments). Single-unit spikes triggered acceptance pulses that were stored as events for off-line analyses. The stereotaxic coordinates of the vestibular nuclei have been mapped in pigeons (Dickman and Fang 1996), and we used these coordinates to guide our recording site locations. Reconstruction of electrode tracks indicated that most neurons were recorded from the superior (SVN) or lateral (LVN) vestibular nuclei.Experimental protocol During each electrode penetration, we searched for spontaneously active neurons that were sensitive to 0.5Hz sinusoidal rotations and linear translations along any of the three cardinal head axes. We also monitored spontaneous activity in the absence of motion, to determine if each cell was responsive to extra-vestibular cues such as eye movements. For the subset of pigeons implanted with a scleral search coil, voltages corresponding to eye movements were monitored and compared to neural firing in real time. For pigeons without a search coil, large eye movements (gaze shifts) were directly observed by the experimenter in the light. If a neuron’s firing rate correlated with eye movements (i.e. modulation with changes in eye position, burst and/or pause in firing during saccades), that neuron was classified as eye movement-sensitive (EM) and excluded from the current study. Some neurons exhibited firing rate modulations in the absence of motion that were not clearly correlated with eye movements, possibly due to proprioceptive, somatosensory, or motor efferent input. In practice, only those motion-sensitive neurons that did not significantly modulate their firing rates in the absence of motion were classified as non-eye movement (NEM) neurons and studied further. Once identified, each NEM neuron was tested during sinusoidal rotational and translational stimuli. Stimulus orientations were expressed relative to a head-fixed right-handed coordinate system (see Figure 1). The x-, y- and z-axes corresponded to the pigeon’s nasooccipital, interaural and dorsoventral axes, respectively. Positive rotations were right ear-down, nose-down, and leftward. Positive translations were forward, leftward, and upward. Each neuron was typically tested at a minimum of five different axes of earth-horizontal linear translation (0.5Hz, +0.2g), including fore-aft (x-axis) and lateral (y-axis) motion. Earth-vertical axis (EVA) rotations (0.5Hz, +20o/s) were also delivered, with the pigeon’s head (and body) positioned at a minimum of five static orientations relative to the earth-vertical axis – including upright, 30° nose-up, 30° nose-down, 30° right ear-down, and 30° left ear-down. Finally, a subset of neurons were also tested during earth-horizontal axis (EHA) rotations (0.5Hz, 20°/s), with a minimum of five different axis orientations including roll (x-axis) and pitch (y-axis). FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Responses of a single representative convergent neuron to dynamic motion stimulation of semicircular canals only (A: Earth-vertical axis rotation, EVAR), otolith organs only (B: Linear translation), and both canals and otolith organs simultaneously (C: Earth-horizontal axis rotation, EHAR). Single-unit action potentials are plotted as instantaneous firing rates (IFR). Stimulus feedback for each motion trial is also shown (angular velocity, °/s; linear acceleration, g). Axis orientations are expressed relative to the head cardinal axes, using the right-hand rule.Data analyses All data analyses were performed off-line using custom scripts in Matlab (Mathworks). For each motion trial, a neuron’s stored spike times (events) were converted to instantaneous firing rates (IFR), computed as the inverse of the interspike intervals and assigned to the end of each interval. Steady-state stimulus feedback and IFR data were fit with sinusoidal functions at the fundamental stimulus frequency using nonlinear least-squares minimization (Levenberg-Marquardt). The relationship between motion stimulus and neural response was evaluated by comparing the parameters of their sinusoidal fits. Neural sensitivity (also referred to as gain) served as a comparison of the amplitude of the neural response (DC-to-peak) to the amplitude of the stimulus. Neural phase indicated the temporal relationship between the peak of the neural response and the peak of the stimulus, expressed as a phase angle (°) within a single representative sinusoidal cycle. For example, if the stimulus frequency was 0.5Hz and the peak of the neural response preceded the peak of the stimulus by 0.5s, the phase of the neural response relative to the stimulus would be computed as +90° (since 0.5s corresponds to one-fourth of a full cycle). For translational stimuli, neural sensitivity was expressed as the amplitude of IFR modulation divided by the amplitude of linear acceleration modulation (spk/s per g), and neural response phase was computed as the phase angle difference (°) between peak IFR and peak head-horizontal linear acceleration. For rotational stimuli, sensitivity was expressed as the amplitude of IFR modulation divided by the amplitude of angular velocity modulation (spk/s per °/s), and phase was computed as the phase angle difference (°) between peak IFR and peak angular velocity. Based on their sensitivity to rotation and translation, neurons were classified according to their likely vestibular afferent inputs (Angelaki, Bush and Perachio 1993; Dickman and Angelaki 2002; Estes, Blanks and Markham 1975). EVA rotation dynamically stimulates the semicircular canals but not the otolith organs, so neurons that responded to at least one axis of EVA rotation were considered to receive either direct or indirect input from semicircular canal afferents. Similarly, since linear translation dynamically stimulates the otolith organs but not the canals, neurons that responded to at least one axis of linear translation were considered to receive direct or indirect otolith afferent inputs. After examining the distribution of gain values across neurons, we selected a value of 0.1 spk/s per °/s during EVA rotation or 10 spk/s per g during linear translation (for at least one axis of stimulation) as the minimum gain of a neuron identified as receiving canal or otolith input, respectively. Neurons with gains exceeding the criterion value for both EVA rotation and linear translation were classified as canal-otolith convergent neurons, and only these neurons were considered further. This method may have excluded some neurons that in fact received convergent inputs but with lower sensitivities. For each convergent neuron, we characterized the nature of its canal and otolith inputs by fitting cosine tuning functions to the responses recorded during EVA rotation and linear translation, respectively. Then, we used these tuning functions to determine the orientation of the earth-horizontal axis (EHA) rotation that would evoke maximum modulation of each input (canal- and otolith-related) and the corresponding amplitude and timing of that modulation relative to the EHA rotation stimulus. Finally, for a subset of neurons, we characterized the actual net response to EHA rotation and compared its tuning parameters to those predicted by a simple linear summation of the canal and otolith inputs. For any cosine tuning function, there will be two possible orientations of the maximum sensitivity vector, oriented 180° apart in space with equal gains but opposite phase values. For each cell, we have reported data for the maximum sensitivity vectors corresponding to phase values within the range +90°, unless otherwise noted. Though neurons were recorded bilaterally, maximum sensitivity vector orientations and phase values were reported as though all neurons were recorded from the left hemisphere. For example, a neuron with a maximum sensitivity EVA rotation vector oriented upward preferred ipsilateral (leftward) rotation, according to the right hand rule. EVA rotation A three-dimensional cosine tuning function was fit to the sensitivity and phase values obtained from each neuron’s responses during EVA rotations (0.5Hz, 20o/s), yielding a maximum sensitivity vector for the semicircular canal (CANAL) inputs with direction αCANAL, sensitivity SCANAL, and phase θCANAL (Dickman 1996; Dickman and Angelaki 2002).Linear translation A two-dimensional cosine tuning function was fit to the sensitivity and phase values obtained from each neuron’s responses during earth-horizontal translations (0.5Hz, 0.2g), yielding a maximum sensitivity vector for otolith organ (OTO) inputs with direction αOTO, sensitivity SOTO, and phase θOTO. A two-dimensional spatiotemporal convergence (STC) tuning function was also fit to the translation response data (Angelaki, Bush and Perachio 1993; Angelaki and Dickman 2000; Bush, Perachio and Angelaki 1993; Dickman and Angelaki 2002) and compared to the cosine tuning function for goodness-of-fit, using the variance accounted for: VAF = 1 − (sum square error of the fit/sum square difference of the data from its mean) (Dickman and Angelaki 2002). For each neuron, we used the translation tuning function with the best fit (i.e. highest VAF) for further analyses. However, since the simple cosine function provided a good description of tuning for most neurons tested, we did not consider STC response behavior further in the current study.EHA rotation – otolith stimulation To facilitate an understanding of the analyses used to predict and characterize responses to EHA rotation, we present here a description of the canal and otolith organ components of EHA rotational stimulation experienced by the animal. When the head was positioned upright, the head-vertical axis was considered to be parallel to earth-vertical, and the otolith organs responded to a static linear acceleration due to gravity, represented as a 1g vector directed upward along the head-vertical axis. (Note: This vector is oriented upward because the otolith organs – like all linear accelerometers – signal the vector deviation from freefall, not the vector of force due to gravity.) During sinusoidal EHA rotation, the orientation of the linear acceleration vector swings in the head within the plane of rotation. One can decompose the vector orientation into a head-vertical modulation component and a head-horizontal component, both of which vary as a function of the head’s angular displacement (i.e. orientation relative to gravity). The head-horizontal component of linear acceleration modulates at the same frequency as rotation, with peak amplitude equal to one minus the sine of the peak displacement angle. The head-vertical component of net linear acceleration modulates at the 2nd harmonic of the rotation frequency, with an amplitude equal to one minus the cosine of the peak displacement angle. For example, consider the case of 0.5Hz EHA rotation about the pitch axis with peak velocity of 20°/s. The peak head tilt is ~6.4° ( = peak velocity/2*pi*frequency), and the head rotates between +6.4° (nose-down) and −6.4° (nose-up). The head-horizontal (fore-aft/nasooccipital) linear acceleration modulates around 0g with modulation amplitude of sin(6.4 °); thus, it modulates from −0.1g (nose-down) and +0.1g (nose-up). The head-vertical (up-down/dorsoventral) linear acceleration modulates around +1g with modulation amplitude of cos(6.4°). However, this modulation in head-vertical acceleration modulates at the 2nd harmonic of the rotation frequency, equal to +0.99g at both nose-down and nose-up positions. Note that the modulation in head-vertical linear acceleration (0.01g) is an order of magnitude smaller than the modulation in head-horizontal linear acceleration (0.1g).EHA rotation – predicted canal and otolith inputs To predict the canal input response to EHA rotation (0.5Hz, 20°/s), we projected the three-dimensional EVA rotational maximum sensitivity vector (αCANAL) into the head-horizontal plane and expressed its orientation as a polar angle relative to the positive x-axis (canalvec). The corresponding sensitivity (canalS) and phase (canalphase) values were computed from the three-dimensional EVA rotation tuning function. To predict the otolith input response to EHA rotation, we needed to account for the fact that head-horizontal linear acceleration along the neuron’s preferred axis (αOTO) would result from EHA rotation along a perpendicular axis. Thus, there were two axes of maximum otolith sensitivity during EHA rotation, each 90o away from αOTO. For each neuron, we chose the axis orientation (otovec) closest to that cell’s canalvec, also expressed as a polar angle relative to the positive x-axis (though this analysis was repeated in some cases with the otovec chosen to match canal and otolith phase values). The two-dimensional translation tuning function was used to compute the corresponding otolith response sensitivity (otoS) and phase (otophase), which were expressed relative to the apparent EHA angular velocity to facilitate comparison to canalS and canalphase. For EHA rotation, otolith-related sensitivity relative to angular velocity equals the sensitivity relative to linear acceleration times the ratio of peak linear acceleration to peak angular velocity (0.1g/20°/s). Otolith input phase relative to angular velocity equals the phase relative to linear acceleration plus 90° (since linear acceleration leads angular velocity by 90° during EHA rotation; see Figure 1C). The relationship between predicted canal- and otolith-driven contributions to EHA rotation responses was assessed cell-by-cell, by fitting linear regressions relating canalvec to otovec, canalS to otoS, and canalphase to otophase, using a procedure modified for use with two dependent variables. This procedure minimizes perpendicular errors between actual data points and the estimated linear regression through them, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (obtained by bootstrapping) may be asymmetrical. The significance of the regression was assessed by calculating R and p values (alpha = 0.05). If the linear regression provided a significant fit to the data and if the range defined by the confidence intervals on the slope included a value of one, we concluded that the regression slope was not significantly different from unity, indicating a cell-by-cell match between canal and otolith inputs for a given response parameter. If the linear regression did not provide a significant fit to the data, we concluded that canal and otolith input values were not linearly related, and the regression was not plotted in the corresponding figure.EHA rotation – actual vs. predicted net responses For the subset of neurons with sufficient data, actual responses to EHA rotation were compared to responses predicted by a linear combination of canal and otolith response components. Actual EHA rotation maximum sensitivity vectors (αEHAR), sensitivity (SEHAR), and phase (θEHAR) values were obtained by fitting a two-dimensional cosine tuning function to the available EHA rotation data. We selected the axis of EHA rotation that yielded the highest predicted sensitivity value and defined the corresponding axis orientation. sensitivity, and phase as the predicted αEHAR, SEHAR, and θEHAR, respectively. To calculate the predicted αEHAR, SEHAR, and θEHAR values, we performed a linear summation (in the complex plane) of the canal and otolith responses to each axis of EHA rotation (sampled every 1°), based on the EVA rotation and linear translation tuning functions, respectively. To assess the relationship between actual and predicted values, we fit a linear regression for two dependent variables (as described above) to the data for αEHAR, SEHAR, and θEHAR. If the linear regression provided a significant fit to the data and if the range defined by the confidence intervals on the slope included a value of one, we concluded that the regression slope was not significantly different from unity, indicating that the linear summation model provided a good estimate of the actual response to EHA rotation. If the linear regression did not provide a significant fit to the data, we concluded that there was not a significant linear relationship between actual and predicted values, and the regression was not plotted in the corresponding figure.RESULTS Responses were obtained from 56 convergent neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC), each of which was sensitive to both rotational and linear translational motion. Responses from a single representative convergent neuron are shown in Figure 1. To characterize the canal and otolith response components separately, we used stimuli that dynamically stimulated only one receptor type at a time: earth-vertical axis (EVA) rotations to stimulate the canals (Figure 1A) and linear translations to stimulate the otolith organs (Figure 1B). Then, we recorded neural responses to earth-horizontal axis (EHA) rotations (Figure 1C), which stimulated both otolith organs and the semicircular canals. We compared the actual neural responses to EHA rotation with the predicted combined response based on a linear combination of canal- and otolith-related responses. Canal-only responses: earth-vertical axis rotations Thirty-seven convergent neurons were characterized during EVA rotations (0.5Hz, 20°/s). The static orientation of the head was varied relative to the earth-vertical axis, and three-dimensional cosine tuning functions were fit to the responses for each neuron. From these tuning functions, we derived each cell’s maximum canal-related sensitivity vector (αCANAL), which corresponded to the axis of EVA rotational motion that would drive the strongest firing rate modulation for that neuron. These unit vectors are plotted in head-referenced space in Figure 2A. For comparison, the mean maximum sensitivity vector orientations for horizontal (red), anterior (blue) and posterior (green) canal afferents in pigeons were also plotted (Dickman 1996). Maximum sensitivity vectors were distributed throughout head-centered space and were not clustered around canal afferent vectors, similar to convergent neurons observed in macaques (Dickman and Angelaki 2002). However, there were relatively few neurons that preferred rotation around the nasooccipital (roll) axis, in contrast to previous studies in both cats (Kasper, Schor and Wilson 1988; Perlmutter et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 1992) and primates (Dickman and Angelaki 2002). Next, maximum neural sensitivities (SCANAL) and phase values (θCANAL) were plotted for each neuron (Figure 2B). Semicircular canal afferent response means (triangles; ± standard deviations indicated by rectangles) were plotted for comparison (Dickman 1996). Convergent neuron sensitivity values varied between 0.2 and 5.9 spk/s per °/s, with a mean value of 1.1 spk/s per °/s (SD = 1.2 °), lower than the typical sensitivity values for canal afferents. Phase values varied widely, from −64.1° to 65.2°, but generally led head velocity by 10–30° (mean = 21.7°, SD = 29.5°), similar to the typical phase behavior of canal afferents. There was no apparent systematic relationship between sensitivity and phase for the neurons sampled. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Responses of convergent neurons (n=37) to earth-vertical axis (EVA) rotation (0.5Hz, 20°/s). A: Axes of maximum sensitivity (αCANAL) are plotted as unit vectors in three-dimensional head space. Mean maximum sensitivity vectors for pigeon horizontal (red), anterior (blue), and posterior (green) canal afferents are also shown (thick lines; Dickman 1996). B: Maximum sensitivity (SCANAL) and phase (θCANAL) values are expressed relative to angular velocity, with the population mean indicated by the open circle. Mean sensitivity and phase values (open triangles) are also shown for pigeon horizontal (red), anterior (blue), and posterior (green) canal afferents (Dickman 1996). Boxes indicate afferent means ± standard deviation.Otolith-only responses: linear translations Forty-three convergent neurons were characterized during earth-horizontal axis linear translations (0.5Hz, 0.2g), and two-dimensional cosine tuning functions were fit to each cell’s responses. The response for each cell was represented by the maximum otolith-related sensitivity vector (αOTO) and plotted in head-referenced space (Figure 3A). Pigeon otolith afferents innervating the utricle (i.e. those oriented to respond maximally to head-horizontal linear accelerations) had maximum sensitivity vectors that clustered near the interaural axis (68% fell within +30° of the interaural axis; Si, Angelaki and Dickman 1997). In contrast, central convergent neurons preferred a wider range of horizontal translation directions, with some tendency to cluster near canal planes (Figure 3A). The scarcity of neurons with maximal responses to nasooccipital translation agrees with previous findings in rodents (Angelaki, Bush and Perachio 1993), cats (Kasper, Schor and Wilson 1988; Perlmutter et al. 1999; Wilson et al. 1992), and primates (Dickman and Angelaki 2002). Maximum sensitivity values (SOTO) and the associated response phases (θOTO) were plotted in Figure 3B, and mean pigeon otolith afferent data were plotted for comparison (Si, Angelaki and Dickman 1997). Convergent neuron sensitivity values ranged between 19.0 and 460.2 spk/s per g, with a mean value of 166.7 spk/s per g (SD = 98.9). Thus, the distribution of sensitivity values for convergent neurons was lower than but overlapping with the distribution for otolith afferents (Si, Angelaki and Dickman 1997). Phase values also varied widely and included both phase lags and phase leads (between −79.4° and 89.2°), with a mean value of 15.1° (SD = 41.1) – in contrast to the otolith afferents, which primarily led head acceleration by 10° to 45°. As with semicircular canal inputs, there was no apparent systematic relationship between sensitivity and phase in this sample of convergent central neurons. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Responses of convergent neurons (n=43) to earth-horizontal linear translation (0.5Hz, 0.2g). A: Axes of maximum sensitivity (αOTO) are plotted as unit vectors in two-dimensional head space. B: Maximum sensitivity (SOTO) and phase (θOTO) values are expressed relative to linear acceleration, with the population mean indicated by the open circle. The mean pigeon otolith afferent sensitivity and phase is indicated by the open triangle, and the box indicates the corresponding standard deviation (Si, Angelaki and Dickman 1997).Relationship between canal and otolith inputs Next, we examined the relationship between canal- and otolith-related responses for 25 convergent VNC neurons. In a previous study, we demonstrated that pigeons integrate canal and otolith signals to generate compensatory responses to EHA rotation (McArthur and Dickman 2008). Thus, we transformed the maximum sensitivity vectors for canal (αCANAL) and otolith (αOTO) response components, to predict each component’s maximum sensitivity vector for EHA rotation (see Methods for details). Each vector was expressed as its orientation relative to the forward nasooccipital axis (canalvec for canal input, otovec for otolith input; Figure 4A). For most neurons, their convergent canal and otolith inputs were spatially aligned, such that both response components would be maximally stimulated by EHA rotation around the same axis. Thus, the linear regression relating canalvec and otovec values had a slope that was not significantly different from unity (slope = 1.2, 95% CI = [0.9, 1.4], R = 0.92, p < 0.001). A similar spatial alignment between convergent inputs was observed in rats (Angelaki, Bush and Perachio 1993) and cats (Perlmutter et al. 1999) but not monkeys (Dickman and Angelaki 2002; Yakushin, Raphan and Cohen 2006). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Predicted responses of canal and otolith inputs to convergent neurons (n=25) during earth-horizontal axis (EHA) rotation (0.5Hz, 20°/s). Significant linear regressions (solid) are plotted through the available data, and the unity slope line (dotted) is plotted for comparison. A: Axes of maximum sensitivity for canal (canalvec) and otolith (otovec) inputs to each neuron, expressed as polar angle orientations relative to the positive x-axis. Regression slope = 1.2 (95% CI = [0.9, 1.4], R = 0.92, p < 0.001. Unity slope line +30° (shaded) is plotted for comparison. B: Response sensitivity values of canal (canalS) and otolith (otoS) inputs to each neuron, expressed relative to angular velocity. Open symbols indicate those neurons with very low (<0.1) predicted canal sensitivity to EHA rotation. C: Response phases of canal (canalphase) and otolith (otophase) inputs to each neuron, expressed relative to angular velocity.The corresponding sensitivity and phase values for each response component (both expressed relative to EHA rotation velocity), however, did not match. As shown in Figure 4B, canal (canalS) and otolith (otoS) response components were predicted to have sensitivity values that could vary significantly from one another for a single convergent neuron, with the canal sensitivity sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the otolith sensitivity. There was not a consistent linear relationship between these values, even when those neurons with very small predicted canal sensitivity to EHA rotation were excluded from the data (linear regression: R = 0.13, p = 0.55; excluded neurons indicated by open symbols in Figure 4B). There also was not a significant linear relationship between canalphase and otophase (linear regression: R = 0.18, p = 0.39; Figure 4C). During EHA rotation around the maximum sensitivity axis, the canal-driven response modulated approximately in-phase with or slightly leading angular velocity, while the otolith-driven response tended to respond in-phase with angular position or acceleration (i.e. lag or lead angular velocity by 90°). It was possible that this temporal mismatch was a result of how we selected the orientation of the otovec. Due to the nature of a cosine tuning function, there are two maximum sensitivity vectors in a given plane, with equal sensitivity values but opposite orientations and phase values. For each neuron, we originally selected the otovec orientation that aligned it more closely with the corresponding canalvec. However, when we selected the otovec to maximize temporal alignment between canal and otolith phase values instead, these values (canalphase and otophase) were still mismatched (data not shown). Thus, convergent canal and otolith inputs onto single central vestibular neurons were spatially matched for synergistic modulation during EHA rotation, but convergent inputs had different gains and phases relative to the rotational stimulus.Combined canal and otolith stimulation: responses to EHA rotation For eleven neurons with sufficient data, we fit two-dimensional tuning functions to observed EHA rotation responses (0.5Hz, 20°/s), yielding the orientation of each cell’s actual maximum sensitivity vector (αEHAR) and the corresponding response sensitivity (SEHAR) and phase (θEHAR). These values were compared to those predicted by a simple linear summation of canal- and otolith-driven responses (Figure 5), derived from EVA rotation and linear translation responses, respectively. Actual and predicted maximum sensitivity vectors were well-aligned spatially across neurons, as indicated by the fact that the actual and predicted αEHAR values were linearly related with a slope that was not significantly different from unity (slope = 0.99, 95% CI = [0.7, 1.4], R = 0.9, p < 0.001; Figure 5A). However, actual and predicted sensitivity and phase values were not so well-matched. The linear combination model underestimated the maximum sensitivity value (SEHAR) of some neurons and overestimated it for others (Figure 5B), though the linear regression through the data might have reached significance with the addition of more neurons with similar properties (slope = 0.7, 95% CI = [0.1, 2.1], R = 0.6, p = 0.06). Further, the model yielded phase values that were further out of phase with angular velocity than the actual EHA responses, which were clustered around 0° (Figure 5C), and there was no significant linear relationship between actual and predicted phase values (linear regression: R = 0.4, p = 0.3). Thus, convergent neurons kept their responses approximately in-phase with angular velocity during EHA rotation (similar to the canal-driven input alone), despite the phase offset that would have been introduced by the otolith response if canal and otolith components were simply summed. FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Actual responses to earth-horizontal axis (EHA) rotation (0.5Hz, 20°/s) were compared to predicted responses based on a linear summation of canal- and otolith-related responses.

Earth-vertical axis (EVA) rotations stimulated the semicircular canals but not the otolith organs, and earth-horizontal linear translations stimulated the otolith organs but not the canals. Central neuron responses to EVA rotation resembled canal afferent responses in that they were approximately in-phase with rotational velocity or led it by <90° (Dickman 1996). Also, convergent neuron responses led translational linear acceleration by <45°, on average, similar to otolith afferents (Si, Angelaki and Dickman 1997). However, spatial preferences differed significantly between central convergent neurons and vestibular afferents. While canal afferents prefer rotation in canal planes, convergent VNC cells preferred axes of rotation that varied widely in space. Further, otolith-driven responses in the VNC were spatially matched to canal-driven responses, such that the same axis of earth-horizontal axis (EHA) rotation dynamically modulated both components. However, during EHA rotation about this preferred axis, canal and otolith inputs were typically 90° out of phase with one another and had different sensitivities. Canal-related spatial preferences are more closely related to behavior than to canal afferents The canal component responses modulated approximately in-phase with angular velocity but had preferred axes of EVA rotation that were widely distributed in the head, in contrast to the restricted spatial preferences of the canal afferents (Dickman 1996). In other species, central convergence of multiple afferents innervating non-coplanar canals has been suggested as a mechanism for producing this spatial diversity in central neurons (Angelaki, Bush and Perachio 1993; Dickman and Angelaki 2002; Eron et al. 2008; Kasper, Schor and Wilson 1988; Perlmutter et al. 1999; Wilson et al. 1992; Yakushin, Raphan and Cohen 2006). The need to have central NEM neurons with preferred axes of rotation that differ from canal planes is likely tied to the demands of vestibulospinal reflexes. Muscles receiving vestibulospinal inputs are often maximally activated by rotation about the nasooccipital or roll axes (Baker, Goldberg and Peterson 1985; Wilson et al. 1986). In fact, although central neurons’ response vectors are not restricted to canal planes, their distribution in head-referenced space is not homogeneous and appears to be related to species-specific behaviors. For example, in cats, vestibular limb responses are stronger during roll rotation than during pitch rotation (Wilson et al. 1986), and the majority of central neurons indeed prefer roll or near-roll rotation (Kasper, Schor and Wilson 1988; Perlmutter et al. 1999; Wilson et al. 1992). In pigeons, we found that most central convergent neurons preferred pitch or near-pitch rotations. While the pigeon head response is larger overall for yaw rotation than for either pitch or roll (Gioanni 1988; Dickman, Beyer and Hess 2000; Haque and Dickman 2005), the vestibular tail response during flight is most prominent for pitch rotations (McArthur and Dickman 2011). Thus, the distribution of canal-related maximum sensitivity vectors is likely biased to accommodate the behavioral needs of each animal according to the specific instabilities encountered under natural conditions.Convergent canal- and otolith-related responses are spatially aligned Convergent VNC neurons showed a stronger preference for linear translation within canal planes than did the otolith afferents, which loosely tend to prefer interaural translation (Si, Angelaki and Dickman 1997). There was also a paucity of convergent VNC cells with maximum sensitivity vectors near the nasooccipital axis, similar to central convergent neuron populations recorded in rats (Angelaki, Bush and Perachio 1993) and monkeys (Dickman and Angelaki 2002; Zhou et al. 2006). Further, VNC convergent neurons exhibited a striking spatial alignment between canal- and otolith-driven responses, consistent with maximal activation of both canal and otolith inputs during EHA rotation around the same axis. Similar spatial alignment has been observed in rats (Angelaki, Bush and Perachio 1993) and cats (Perlmutter et al. 1999), while the majority of convergent neurons in monkeys did not exhibit this spatial input alignment (Dickman and Angelaki 2002). What is the functional significance of the spatial alignment of convergent inputs in NEM neurons in the vestibular brainstem? For pigeons and other lateral-eyed animals, both canal and otolith stimulation contribute to compensatory eye and head responses that stabilize gaze during rotation relative to gravity (i.e. EHA rotation; pigeon: Dickman and Angelaki 1999; Dickman, Beyer and Hess 2000; McArthur and Dickman 2008; mouse: Harrod and Baker 2003; rat: Brettler et al. 2000; rabbit: Barmack 1981). Specifically in pigeons, we have demonstrated that a dynamic net head-horizontal linear acceleration signal improves the phase of both eye and head responses to EHA tilt (McArthur and Dickman 2008). Indeed, the canal- and otolith-driven components of these responses are spatially aligned with one another when examined separately (Dickman and Angelaki 1999; McArthur and Dickman 2008). Thus, the fact that otolith inputs were spatially aligned with canal inputs for central neurons supports the idea that the functional role of otolith signals in pigeons is to cooperate with primarily canal-driven reflexes, rather than generating other, primarily otolith-driven reflexes with different spatial demands (e.g. translational VOR in primates).Sensitivity and phase for convergent canal- and otolith-related inputs are mismatched While the spatial preferences of convergent canal and otolith inputs to VNC neurons were coincident, the sensitivity and phase values predicted for these inputs during EHA rotation were not. In fact, though canal and otolith EHA rotational sensitivities were distributed across a similar range, the values for any given neuron could be quite different in that either input could be much higher than the other. Moreover, both canal and otolith inputs seemed to retain the phase characteristics of their afferent populations on average, with canal inputs responding in-phase with angular velocity (Dickman and Correia 1989) and otolith inputs in-phase with linear acceleration (Si, Angelaki, and Dickman 1999). Thus, there was little overlap in the phase distribution for canal and otolith input phases, and these values were mismatched for individual neurons. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the canal and otolith components of the rotational VCR in pigeons also had mismatched gain and phase values (McArthur and Dickman 2008). The otolith component was nearly in-phase with angular velocity (phase ~ 0°), while the canal component had a nearly compensatory phase for angular velocity (phase ~ −180°). Further, the gain of the canal-driven VCR was an order of magnitude larger than the gain of the otolith-driven component. Thus, both behavioral and neural responses were consistent with mismatched sensitivity and phase values for canal- and otolith-associated components in the reflex circuitry of the vestibular nuclei.Convergent inputs do not sum linearly during EHA rotation EHA rotation dynamically modulates both canal and otolith inputs to convergent neurons. How do neurons integrate these two types of inputs when both are dynamically stimulated? One possibility was that convergent neurons simply computed a linear sum of canal and otolith inputs during EHA rotation. In a previous study (McArthur and Dickman 2008), we demonstrated that linear summation of canal- and otolith-driven response components provided a good characterization of compensatory eye (VOR) but not head (VCR) response gain and phase during EHA rotation. In the current study, linear summation failed to provide a good fit to the available gain and phase data for convergent neurons, consistent with nonlinear integration of canal and otolith inputs. Two aspects of the stimulus protocol might introduce error into our characterization of the otolith input and might, therefore, account for some of the observed mismatches between actual and predicted gain and phase values during EHA rotation. First, we characterized the otolith input based on neural responses to horizontal linear acceleration only. Though EHA rotations primarily modulate the head-horizontal component of linear acceleration, there is an additional modulation in head-vertical linear acceleration (see Methods for details). However, since the head-vertical modulation was much smaller in amplitude and occurred at twice the frequency of the head-horizontal modulation, the response to the head-horizontal modulation was likely to dominate the otolith-driven response. Second, the translations used to characterize the otolith input generated a larger modulation of head-horizontal linear acceleration than the EHA rotations used to test the linear summation model (0.2g versus 0.1g, respectively). Though a subset of central vestibular neurons in monkeys vary their gain as a function of linear acceleration amplitude (Marlinski and McCrea 2009), there is no evidence that NEM neurons in pigeons display similar tendencies. Thus, despite these possible sources of error in our characterization of the otolith-driven input, we believe that the failure of the linear summation model to predict EHA response sensitivity and phase indicates that convergent neurons are carrying out real nonlinear integration of canal and otolith inputs.Spatiotemporal matching: different species, different stages? What kind of nonlinear processing might be carried out by convergent VNC neurons, and what purpose might this serve for the animal? We can only speculate regarding this issue, as there was insufficient data in the current study to rigorously fit alternative models of canal-otolith integration. However, others have provided insight from studies in non-human primates, where canal and otolith signals are combined to construct central representations of the animal’s movements in space. Canal afferents alone cannot reference the animal’s rotations to a space-fixed reference frame, since the semicircular canals are fixed in the head. Otolith afferents alone cannot disambiguate gravitational and translational linear accelerations, as the otolith organs detect net gravito-inertial linear acceleration. Populations of central neurons can perform these computations via nonlinear integration of canal and otolith afferent signals, whereby rotational signals are decomposed into EHA and EVA components and linear acceleration signals are decomposed into gravitational and translational components (Angelaki et al., 2004; Yakusheva et al., 2010). Modeling studies, grounded in behavioral and electrophysiological data, suggest that these computations require intermediate populations of convergent neurons, whose canal and otolith inputs are spatiotemporally matched (Green and Angelaki, 2004; 2007). This matching need not occur at the level of an individual neuron, however, as long as the distributions of spatial preference, sensitivity, and phase match on average (Green and Angelaki, 2004; 2007). Further, each type of matching need not occur at the same level, i.e. the same anatomical location in the brain. In primates, distinct populations of neurons in the brainstem, cerebellar cortex, and deep cerebellar nuclei exhibit different degrees of input matching and nonlinear processing. Convergent neurons in the primate VNC not only exhibit a wide distribution of gain and phase values, but also lack the degree of input spatial matching that we saw in the pigeon (Dickman and Angelaki 2002). While there was a trend across the primate population for convergent canal and otolith inputs to prefer the same axis of EHA rotation, this was not generally observed for individual cells. In the cerebellar cortex, however, convergent canal- and otolith-driven inputs were tightly matched for both sensitivity and phase (Angelaki et al. 2010). Perhaps the convergent neurons of both primates and pigeons perform similar functions, constructing meaningful representations from ambiguous afferent inputs. However, each species may display different levels of single-cell matching and may perform each type of matching at different places in the central vestibular system. In primates, convergent inputs to VNC neurons are not tightly matched for spatial preference, sensitivity, or phase, leaving this function for populations in the cerebellum to perform. In pigeons, convergent VNC neurons have relatively well-matched input spatial preferences, though the sensitivity and phase values are still mismatched. It may be necessary for pigeons to spatially match canal and otolith inputs in the brainstem in order to use the otolith-driven net linear acceleration signal to enhance the performance of the VOR and VCR along short-latency reflex pathways (McArthur and Dickman 2008). Future studies should characterize how the pattern of convergence in avian cerebellum compares to primates.HIGHLIGHTS. We characterize brainstem neurons receiving convergent canal and otolith input. Convergent inputs were spatially aligned when co-stimulated during tilt. Convergent inputs were temporally out of phase during tilt co-stimulation. Net responses to tilt were not predicted by a linear combination of convergent inputs. Acknowledgments The authors thank Dr. Dora E.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca2+ signaling through the L-type CaV1.2 Ca2+ channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Whether CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function CaV1.2 mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) using Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of CaV1.2TS mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the CaV1.2-dependent Ca2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis. Keywords: CaV1.2, Ca2+ signaling, osteoprotegerin, otosclerosis, osteoclast",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction The middle ear contains the three auditory ossicles—the malleus, incus, and stapes—which sequentially conduct sound by transmitting sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the fluid in the cochlea via the oval window of the otic capsule, the bony case enclosing the cochlea and vestibular system. In the otic capsule, the vibrations are converted into electrical signals and transduced to the brain via auditory nerves [1]. Abnormal morphological changes of the bone structures in the auditory ossicles or the otic capsule may disturb sound transmission and cause conductive hearing loss and/or vestibular dysfunction. The auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, unlike most bones in the skull that form through intramembranous ossification, develop like long bones through endochondral ossification. In this process an initial cartilage template is subsequently replaced by bone while the terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes and the calcified cartilage matrix are removed by osteoclasts (bone modeling phase) [2, 3]. Absence of osteoclastic bone resorption in mice with osteoclast defects results in osteopetrotic phenotype of these bones, significantly affecting their morphology and function [4]. However, unlike long bones, no significant bone remodeling (a coupled process of osteoclastic bone resorption with subsequent osteoblastic formation) occurs in the auditory ossicles or the otic capsule after development [5]. Turnover of the otic capsule in regions surrounding the perilymph spaces is about 0.13% per year compared to 10% for the long bones [6]. This low bone remodeling rate in the otic capsule is due to high levels of secreted osteoprotegerin (OPG) [7, 8], a major negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis and consequent bone resorption. By binding RANKL (receptor activator of NFκB ligand) [9], OPG acts as a decoy receptor and prevents RANKL-RANK interactions and the downstream RANK-mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation that is critical for initiation of osteoclast differentiation. In Opg−/− mice, massive erosion of auditory ossicles and the otic capsule by unchecked osteoclasts leads to compensatory abnormal osteogenesis, causing fixation of the stapes and consequent progressive hearing loss due [10, 11]. In humans, reduced OPG in the otic capsule is associated with otosclerosis [12, 13], a condition characterized by abnormal growth of bone at one or more foci within the middle ear or inner ear that often leads to hearing loss in patients. Otosclerosis develops initially through a first phase of bone resorption by activated osteoclasts and increased vascularization (the otospongiosis phase), followed by new bone deposition from osteoblasts and mineralization (the otosclerosis phase) [13]. The prevalence of otosclerosis is high in Caucasians compared to patients of African descent and higher in women than men [14]. The etiology of otosclerosis is not well understood, but both genetic and environmental factors, including measles virus infection, hormonal changes during pregnancy and middle ear inflammation, have been postulated to contribute. Family linkage analyses and candidate gene association studies have identified several loci associated with otosclerosis, yet none of the otosclerosis causing genes within these regions has been identified so far [15–17]. Nevertheless, mutations in SERPINF1 or MEPE have been recently associated with familial otosclerosis [18, 19]. Given that maintaining OPG level is fundamental to the prevention of bone turnover in the middle and inner ear and the consequent development of otosclerosis, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulates OPG expression will provide clues regarding the underlying biological basis of the disease. In this study, we demonstrate a role for the L-type CaV1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) in the regulation of OPG expression in the middle and inner ear. The CaV1.2 channel is widely distributed and mediates Ca2+ influx into the cell upon membrane depolarization. The entry of Ca2+ causes a transient increase of intracellular [Ca2+]i, which serves as a second messenger and mediates critical physiological roles in many organs, including cardiac muscle contraction, hormone secretion in endocrine tissues, postsynaptic responses in various 5 neurons, and activation of gene expression paradigms [20]. However, its role in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule was not previously reported. The CaV1.2 channel is composed of multiple subunits: α1C, β, and α2δ [21]. The α1C subunit is the ion-conducting pore while the β and α2δ are auxiliary subunits that modulate channel properties [22]. Most studies focused on CaV1.2 function in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons, where frequent and dynamic changes in membrane potential facilitate activation of the voltage-gated channel, with little attention to potential contributions of the channel in non-excitable cells. Studies of Timothy syndrome (TS), a multiorgan disorder caused by de novo gain-of-function missense mutations in the α1C-encoding CACNA1C gene [23, 24], revealed critical but previously unappreciated roles for CaV1.2 in many non-excitable cells. We and others demonstrated that CaV1.2 was expressed in osteoblast progenitors during long bone development and homeostasis [25–27]. Moreover, in an in vitro MC3T3-E1 cell and a primary calvaria organ culture system, Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2 regulated OPG expression [28]. Pharmacological blocking of CaV1.2 channel activity with nifedipine reduced the level of OPG expression and secretion [28]. Consistent with those findings, we exploited the TS-causing mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) to increase Ca2+ signaling specifically in osteoblasts or their progenitors and observed inhibited osteoclast activity in long bones through upregulated OPG expression and secretion [25]. Given its ability to modulate the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway, we hypothesized that CaV1.2 could also affect bone modeling in the ear. Here, we show that increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS expressed in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule affected bone modeling/remodeling as well as auditory and vestibular function. Defining the role of Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2 in the physiological regulation of osteoclast formation offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other bony disorders of the ear and provides clues for future explorations of therapeutic strategies or prevention of hearing loss caused by bony structural changes in the middle and inner ear.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental mouse models All animals were handled according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Duke University and at Weill Cornell Medical College. Rosa26-CaV1.2TS and Col2a1-Cre have been described previously [29–31]. Homozygous Rosa26-CaV1.2TS female mice were crossed with Col2a1-Cre males to generate Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant progeny and Cre-negative littermate controls [31] with both sexes used in all experiments. 2.2. X-gal staining X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) staining was performed on whole mount specimens. The auditory ossicles, the inner ear vestibular system and cochlea were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 1 hour, washed three times with 1 × PBS, and stained with X-gal solution (5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 1 mg/ml X-gal, 2 mM MgCI2, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% IGEPAL CA-630) in the dark for 12 hours at 37 °C. 2.3. μCT analysis of mice Specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, washed three times with 1 × PBS, and then embedded in 2% agarose gel in a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Images were obtained with a Scanco VivaCT 80 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland) set to 55 kVp and 145 μA, voxel size 10.4 μm. 2.4. Histology and TRAP staining Specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, washed three times with 1 × PBS, then decalcified in 14% EDTA at 4 °C for 2 weeks. Samples were processed for paraffin embedding and then sectioned at 10 μm thickness. Alcian Blue Hematoxylin /Orange G (ABH/OG) staining and TRAP staining were performed following standard protocols. 2.5. Real-time PCR The otic capsule surrounding the cochlear part of the control and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice at 8 weeks of age was carefully dissected, and grinded in a bath of liquid nitrogen using the disposable micro Tissue homogenizer (BioMasher, Japan). Ground samples were collected with 500 μl Trizol (Qiagen) and total RNA was purified using the ZR tissue & Insect RNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). qPCR was performed using SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The primers for Opg and Rankl and Gapdh have been described previously [25]. Gene expression was first normalized to Gapdh and then normalized to control samples. 2.6. Auditory Brainstem response (ABR) test The 6-week old mice were anesthetized with ketamine (125 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection prior to all procedures. Once a suitable plane of anesthesia was reached, the portion of the pinna which obscured the entrance to the tested ear canal was removed. The anesthetized animal was then placed in a sound-isolated, electrically-shielded box on top of a heating pad (40-90-2-05, FHC, Inc.). In conjunction with the heating pad, a rectal probe and DC temperature controller (41-90-8D, FHC, Inc.) were used to maintain the mouse’s temperature near 38 °C. Both eyes were moistened with ophthalmic ointment (Puralube®, Dechra Veterinary Products). Needle electrodes (GRD-SAF, The Electrode Store) were subdermally placed behind the pinna of the tested ear (reference electrode), in the scalp between the ears (active electrode), and in the back near the tail (ground electrode). ABRs were evoked by tone bursts of 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz produced by a closed-field magnetic speaker connected to a power amplifier (MF1 and SA1, Tucker-Davis Technologies). Each 5-ms burst was presented 33.3 times per second with alternating polarity. The onset and offset of each burst was tapered with a squared cosine function. For each frequency, the sound pressure level was lowered from 80 dB SPL in 5–10 dB steps until the threshold was reached. If 80 dB SPL was not enough to elicit a response, higher intensities were produced. The speaker’s output was transmitted into the ear through a custom acoustic coupler. The entire sound delivery system was calibrated with a ¼ inch condenser microphone (4939-A-011 and 2690-A-0S1, Brüel & Kjær). The electrical response evoked by the tone bursts and measured by the needle electrodes was amplified 10,000 times and bandpass filtered at 0.3–3 kHz (P55, Astro-Med Inc.). The amplified response was then digitally sampled at 10-μs intervals with a data acquisition device (PCI-6259, National Instruments) controlled by custom software (LabVIEW 2014, National Instruments). The electrical responses to 1,000 bursts were averaged at each intensity level to determine the threshold, which was defined as the lowest level at which any response peak was distinctly and reproducibly present. Visual inspection of the vertically stacked responses facilitated threshold determination. 2.7. Behavioral Testing Spontaneous activity in an open field arena was monitored with Fusion Open Field Legacy system (Omnitech Electronics Inc., Columbus, OH) over 15 minutes. Mice at 6 weeks of age were singly placed in a 20 × 20 × 40 cm Plexiglas open field arena where activity was monitored by two rows of infrared diodes interfaced to a computer running Fusion 5.3 software. The activity of the animals in the open field were also recorded to digital video from a camera mounted over each test arena using Noldus Media Player (Noldus Information Technologies). The total distance (cm) moved and the circling activity as scored with Fusion software is reported. Circling is defined as the combination of clockwise and counter-clockwise circles performed by the mouse in the open field. In a separate test, balance and coordination were examined using a steady state rotarod at 25 rpm (Medd-Associates, St. Albans, VT). The steady speed was selected on a basis of an accelerated speed (4-40 rpm) given 24 hours prior to the steady speed test. This study showed that the average speed at which the mice fell from an accelerating rotarod was approximately 25 rpm. For the steady speed rotarod test, mice were given four 5-minute trials separated by a 20 min inter-trial interval (ITI). In all cases, trials terminated when the mouse fell from the rod or at 300 seconds. This time (s) was recorded as the latency to fall from the rod. 2.8. Statistics All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests. Data were presented as mean ± SD or mean ±SEM from n > 3 experiments. Two-sided p values less than 0.05 were considered statically significant. qPCR analyses were performed with > 3 independent RNA isolates and triplicates for each RNA sample. Fold changes were calculated by dividing the value of the mutant mice by the value of the control mice. Increasing or decreasing percentage changes were calculated by dividing the value of difference between the treatment group and control group by the value of the control group and then multiplying 100.",

Middle and inner ear appearance in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice To examine whether CaV1.2 contributes to development of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, we tested whether increasing Ca2+ signaling specifically through Cav1.2 affected the structure of the ossicles and otic capsule. We employed a CaV1.2TS transgenic mouse model, in which CaV1.2TS expression was silenced by a floxed upstream stop codon. We activated CaV1.2TS mutant channel expression in the bones of ear with Col2a1-Cre, which targets the osteochondral progenitors [31]. Targeted Col2a1-Cre expression in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule was confirmed with Col2a1-Cre;Rosa26-lacZ reporter mice (Fig. 1). The Col2a1-Cre directed lacZ expression in the ossicles and otic capsule, detected by prominent β-galactosidase staining that was absent in Rosa26-lacZ reporter mice lacking the Col2a1-Cre. We then examined the morphology of the isolated auditory ossicles and the otic capsule from Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and their Cre-negative littermate controls at 6 weeks of age. We found that the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule of CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice were thicker and had more bone mass than those of the control mice, particularly at the malleus handle, the malleus bony membrane, the incus body, the footplate of stapes, the stapedial arch (especially the anterior and posterior crura), and the whole otic capsule (Fig. 2A–D). In Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice, narrowed spaces were observed between the stapedial crura (through which the stapedial artery passes), for the round window and the oval window of the otic capsule. μCT 3-D reconstruction images of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsules confirmed the thicken bones and massive increase of bone mass in the malleus, incus, stapes and the otic capsules of the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice as well as the narrowed cavities for the stapedial artery and the cochlea (Fig. 2E–H).

E-H, μCT 3-D reconstruction of the auditory ossicles, vestibular system and cochlea of Cre-negative littermate controls (E and F) and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (G and H) at 6 weeks of age.Histological examination and staining with Alcian Blue Hematoxylin/Orange G (ABH/OG) of the otic capsule showed that in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice the original bone marrow region was occupied with excessive bone, while the organ of corti was largely intact (Fig. 3A–F). We also observed extensive Alcian Blue-stained cartilage remnant in the bones of the mutant mice besides the Alcian Blue-stained cartilage remnant of the globuli interossei in the cochlea, suggesting osteoclast defects in the mutant mice. Moreover, the mutant otic capsules lacked sculpting, further indicative of defective osteoclast function. Fig. 3. Histological analysis of the inner ear of the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice. Open in a new tab A-F, Alcian Blue Hematoxylin/Orange G (ABH/OG) staining of sagittal sections from the inner ear of Cre-negative littermate controls (A, with higher magnification in B and C) and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (D, with higher magnification E and F) at 4 weeks of age, showing excessive bone mass in the vestibular system and cochlea but with little changes in the organ of corti of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice. G-J, ABH/OG staining of the stapedio-vestibular junction of Cre-negative controls (G, with higher magnification in H) and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (I, with higher magnification in J) at 4 weeks of age, showing the stapes footplate was not fixed but increased bone volume of stapes footplate and vestibule likely limited its movement in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice.We histologically examined the stapedio-vestibular joint space in the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant and control mice and found that it was not fixed in the CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice (Fig. 3G–J). However, the enlarged bone volume in the stapes footplate and the otic capsule likely limited the stapes movement. Because the histology indicated defective osteoclast function in the mutant mice, we analyzed the effect of increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS on osteoclasts. We performed tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining on histological sections of the otic capsules Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and littermate controls at 2 weeks of age. Compared to the controls, we observed significantly less TRAP-staining and fewer osteoclasts in the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice (Fig. 4A–F). We next quantitated the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts and osteoclast area, both of which were normalized to the bone area. The number of osteoclasts per bone area (Oc.N/B.Ar) was decreased by 91% and osteoclast area per bone area (Oc.Ar/B/Ar) decreased by 79% in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (Fig. 4G), suggesting that osteoblastic bone resorption of the otic capsule is greatly reduced in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice during postnatal development. As Col2a1-Cre expression is restricted to osteochondral lineage but not to osteoclast progenitors, increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS mutant channel could inhibit osteoclastogenesis via interfering with the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway in the otic capsule, similar to that we observed in the long bone [25]. We therefore examined Opg and Rankl mRNA expression in the otic capsule surrounding the cochlea of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and their littermate controls. Indeed, RT-qPCR analysis revealed upregulated (~4.4 fold) Opg mRNA expression in the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice compared with that in the control mice but no significant change in Rankl mRNA expression, thus resulting in an increase (~2.6 fold) in Opg/Rankl mRNA expression ratio in the otic capsule (Fig. 4H). We also detected upregulated mRNA expression of genes for osteoblast differentiation, such as Alpl, Runx2 and Sp7 in the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice (Fig. 4I), suggesting an anabolic effect of CaV1.2TS also contributed the increased bone mass in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice.

Col2a 1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice are hearing impaired To assess whether the morphological changes in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule in the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice impaired auditory function, we tested the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in both Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and their littermate controls at 6 weeks of age. Representative responses from control (Fig. 5A) and CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice (Fig. 5B) to decreasing stimulus intensities at 8 kHz showed differences in sensitivity and latency between the two genotypes. Compared to the control mice, the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice had no response to intensities below 85 dB SPL at 8 kHz and below 75 dB at 16 kHz (Fig. 5C and 5D). The mutant mice also showed delays for even stronger stimulus intensities (Fig. 5C and 5D). Furthermore, the hearing threshold of the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice was significantly higher (lower sensitivity) than that of the control mice in the 4 to 16 kHz region, while we found no significant difference in threshold between two genotypes at 32 kHz (Fig. 5E). That the hearing loss in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice is spared only in the high-frequency range is consistent with a conductive hearing loss mechanism, in which sounds fail to be transferred via the ossicular chain in the middle ear to the cochlea. Fig. 5. Auditory Brainstem Response testing shows hearing loss in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice. Open in a new tab A and B, Representative latency responses to different stimuli were compared between Cre-negative littermate controls (A) and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (B) at 8 kHz.

E, The threshold curves were significantly different between the littermate controls and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice at 4, 8 and 16 kHz frequencies (red arrow: no hearing response in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice was detected at 98 dB at 4 kHz). n = 4 for controls; n = 5 for Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice; Data are shown as mean ± SEM, ** p < 0.01 by 2-tailed unpaired t test. 3.3. Col2a1Cre;CaV1.2TS mice show impaired vestibular function Otosclerosis patients sometimes experience vestibular symptoms in addition to hearing loss. Because of the observed morphological changes in the vestibular system in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice, we also examined their motor activities in an open field arena. The CaV1.2TS-expressing mutants were significantly more active compared to the control animals (mean distance moved ± SEM: Control = 1160 cm ± 125; Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS = 4,362 cm ± 529; p < 0.01). Additionally, we found that the CaV1.2TS-expressing mice exhibited frequent and random circling behavior in both the clockwise and counter clockwise directions (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Video), which lasted up to 8 seconds, indicating defects in vestibular function. We also evaluated body balance and coordination with the rotarod test. When accelerating the rotarod from 4 to 40 rpm, the Col2aCre-CaV1.2TS mutant mice fell off earlier, at an average speed of 25 rpm (Fig. 6B), and showed a significant decrease in the latency to fall (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, on the steady state rotarod at 25 rpm, the latency to fall was decreased across all four trials for Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice compared to that for the controls (Fig. 6D). Taken together, the behavior studies showed that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice have a defect in vestibular function, affecting balance and coordination. Fig. 6.

    "discussion": "Discussion Our data demonstrate that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2 regulates development of the auditory ossicles and otic capsule. Moreover, excessive Ca2+ influx through TS-causing mutant CaV1.2 channel causes deficits in both hearing and body balance. The abnormal bone growth of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice is likely due to both increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption, similar to the dual effect of the CaV1.2TS mutant channel on long bones that we previously demonstrated [25]. Although osteoclastogenesis is normally suppressed in the ossicles and the auditory otic capsule because of a locally high level of OPG, osteoclast function is still required to sculpt these bones during development. Absence of osteoclastic bone resorption in Rankl−/−, Fos−/− and Csf1op/op mice significantly affected these bones morphologically and functionally [4]. Expression of the gain-of-function CaV1.2TS mutant channel in our Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice affected the overall morphology of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, which display reduced sculpting (see the stapedial crura) and an osteopetrotic phenotype that are strikingly similar to those seen in Rankl−/−, Fos−/− and Csf1op/op osteoclastic defect mice [4], suggesting that the anticatabolic effect of increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS contributed to the morphological changes in theses bones. While this is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, showing that modulating Ca2+ signal via CaV1.2 in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule regulates osteoclastogenesis and bone modeling/remodeling in the middle and inner ear, our data are consistent with previous observations from others and us that CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression and secretion from osteoblasts [25, 28]. That expression of the CaV1.2TS mutant channel in our model was driven by Col2a1-Cre, which restricts expression to chondrocytes and osteoblast precursors but not in osteoclasts or their progenitors [31], adds further support to our hypothesis that the anticatabolic responses by altered CaV1.2 activity is mediated by upregulated OPG expression and secretion in bones of the ear. Our data showing increased Opg mRNA expression in the otic capsule surrounding the cochlea in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice further supports this hypothesis. Moreover, since the CaV1.2TS transgene expression is driven by Col2a1-Cre, the hearing and vestibular defects we observed can be attributed to the abnormal bone, and not to mutant channel expression in the hair cells of the cochlea and vestibular system or downstream nerves, in which Col2a1-Cre is not active. Consistent with that hypothesis, the organ of Corti is grossly intact in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (Fig. 4). However, as aberrant bone remodeling progresses in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice, it is also possible that the increased bone formation of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule and narrowed cavities in the bony labyrinth of the otic capsule could impair neuronal function and contribute to the circling behavior and hearing impairment. Thus, eventually both bone structure and neuronal dysfunction may contribute to the observed defects in hearing and vestibular function. Our results may also provide insight into the utility of sodium fluoride (NaF) as a treatment option to prevent hearing deterioration in patients with otosclerosis [32] and the reported association between clinical otosclerosis and low fluoride content in the drinking water [33–35]. Although this correlation has not been consistently observed, and the underlying mechanism of effect of fluoride on otosclerosis has not been sufficiently established, it is intriguing that fluoride, which plays an important role in both bone formation and homeostasis of bone mineral metabolism [36], has been shown to affect Ca2+ homeostasis in many types of cells such as in proximal tubules [37, 38], fibroblasts [39], cardiomyocytes [40], as well as osteoblasts [41]. Further, expression of CaV1.2 was stimulated by low-dose fluoride, inhibited by high-dose fluoride [42], and fluoride can stimulate cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel activity by increasing channel open probability or the duration of channel opening in a dose-dependent manner [40]. Our finding of upregulated OPG mRNA expression and OPG mediated-osteoclastogenesis inhibition in the otic capsule upon increased Ca2+ signaling via CaV1.2 may add a new dimension to the effectiveness of sodium fluoride treating patients with osteosclerosis.",

Copyright notice ID: 6615562 MSID: MS1531213 PMID: 31121355 The publisher's version of this article is available at Bone Abstract Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca2+ signaling through the L-type CaV1.2 Ca2+ channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Whether CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function CaV1.2 mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) using Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of CaV1.2TS mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the CaV1.2-dependent Ca2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis. Keywords: CaV1.2, Ca2+ signaling, osteoprotegerin, otosclerosis, osteoclast1. Introduction The middle ear contains the three auditory ossicles—the malleus, incus, and stapes—which sequentially conduct sound by transmitting sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the fluid in the cochlea via the oval window of the otic capsule, the bony case enclosing the cochlea and vestibular system. In the otic capsule, the vibrations are converted into electrical signals and transduced to the brain via auditory nerves [1]. Abnormal morphological changes of the bone structures in the auditory ossicles or the otic capsule may disturb sound transmission and cause conductive hearing loss and/or vestibular dysfunction. The auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, unlike most bones in the skull that form through intramembranous ossification, develop like long bones through endochondral ossification. In this process an initial cartilage template is subsequently replaced by bone while the terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes and the calcified cartilage matrix are removed by osteoclasts (bone modeling phase) [2, 3]. Absence of osteoclastic bone resorption in mice with osteoclast defects results in osteopetrotic phenotype of these bones, significantly affecting their morphology and function [4]. However, unlike long bones, no significant bone remodeling (a coupled process of osteoclastic bone resorption with subsequent osteoblastic formation) occurs in the auditory ossicles or the otic capsule after development [5]. Turnover of the otic capsule in regions surrounding the perilymph spaces is about 0.13% per year compared to 10% for the long bones [6]. This low bone remodeling rate in the otic capsule is due to high levels of secreted osteoprotegerin (OPG) [7, 8], a major negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis and consequent bone resorption. By binding RANKL (receptor activator of NFκB ligand) [9], OPG acts as a decoy receptor and prevents RANKL-RANK interactions and the downstream RANK-mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation that is critical for initiation of osteoclast differentiation. In Opg−/− mice, massive erosion of auditory ossicles and the otic capsule by unchecked osteoclasts leads to compensatory abnormal osteogenesis, causing fixation of the stapes and consequent progressive hearing loss due [10, 11]. In humans, reduced OPG in the otic capsule is associated with otosclerosis [12, 13], a condition characterized by abnormal growth of bone at one or more foci within the middle ear or inner ear that often leads to hearing loss in patients. Otosclerosis develops initially through a first phase of bone resorption by activated osteoclasts and increased vascularization (the otospongiosis phase), followed by new bone deposition from osteoblasts and mineralization (the otosclerosis phase) [13]. The prevalence of otosclerosis is high in Caucasians compared to patients of African descent and higher in women than men [14]. The etiology of otosclerosis is not well understood, but both genetic and environmental factors, including measles virus infection, hormonal changes during pregnancy and middle ear inflammation, have been postulated to contribute. Family linkage analyses and candidate gene association studies have identified several loci associated with otosclerosis, yet none of the otosclerosis causing genes within these regions has been identified so far [15–17]. Nevertheless, mutations in SERPINF1 or MEPE have been recently associated with familial otosclerosis [18, 19]. Given that maintaining OPG level is fundamental to the prevention of bone turnover in the middle and inner ear and the consequent development of otosclerosis, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulates OPG expression will provide clues regarding the underlying biological basis of the disease. In this study, we demonstrate a role for the L-type CaV1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) in the regulation of OPG expression in the middle and inner ear. The CaV1.2 channel is widely distributed and mediates Ca2+ influx into the cell upon membrane depolarization. The entry of Ca2+ causes a transient increase of intracellular [Ca2+]i, which serves as a second messenger and mediates critical physiological roles in many organs, including cardiac muscle contraction, hormone secretion in endocrine tissues, postsynaptic responses in various 5 neurons, and activation of gene expression paradigms [20]. However, its role in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule was not previously reported. The CaV1.2 channel is composed of multiple subunits: α1C, β, and α2δ [21]. The α1C subunit is the ion-conducting pore while the β and α2δ are auxiliary subunits that modulate channel properties [22]. Most studies focused on CaV1.2 function in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons, where frequent and dynamic changes in membrane potential facilitate activation of the voltage-gated channel, with little attention to potential contributions of the channel in non-excitable cells. Studies of Timothy syndrome (TS), a multiorgan disorder caused by de novo gain-of-function missense mutations in the α1C-encoding CACNA1C gene [23, 24], revealed critical but previously unappreciated roles for CaV1.2 in many non-excitable cells. We and others demonstrated that CaV1.2 was expressed in osteoblast progenitors during long bone development and homeostasis [25–27]. Moreover, in an in vitro MC3T3-E1 cell and a primary calvaria organ culture system, Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2 regulated OPG expression [28]. Pharmacological blocking of CaV1.2 channel activity with nifedipine reduced the level of OPG expression and secretion [28]. Consistent with those findings, we exploited the TS-causing mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) to increase Ca2+ signaling specifically in osteoblasts or their progenitors and observed inhibited osteoclast activity in long bones through upregulated OPG expression and secretion [25]. Given its ability to modulate the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway, we hypothesized that CaV1.2 could also affect bone modeling in the ear. Here, we show that increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS expressed in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule affected bone modeling/remodeling as well as auditory and vestibular function. Defining the role of Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2 in the physiological regulation of osteoclast formation offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other bony disorders of the ear and provides clues for future explorations of therapeutic strategies or prevention of hearing loss caused by bony structural changes in the middle and inner ear.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental mouse models All animals were handled according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Duke University and at Weill Cornell Medical College. Rosa26-CaV1.2TS and Col2a1-Cre have been described previously [29–31]. Homozygous Rosa26-CaV1.2TS female mice were crossed with Col2a1-Cre males to generate Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant progeny and Cre-negative littermate controls [31] with both sexes used in all experiments.2.2. X-gal staining X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) staining was performed on whole mount specimens. The auditory ossicles, the inner ear vestibular system and cochlea were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 1 hour, washed three times with 1 × PBS, and stained with X-gal solution (5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 1 mg/ml X-gal, 2 mM MgCI2, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% IGEPAL CA-630) in the dark for 12 hours at 37 °C.2.3. μCT analysis of mice Specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, washed three times with 1 × PBS, and then embedded in 2% agarose gel in a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Images were obtained with a Scanco VivaCT 80 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland) set to 55 kVp and 145 μA, voxel size 10.4 μm.2.4. Histology and TRAP staining Specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, washed three times with 1 × PBS, then decalcified in 14% EDTA at 4 °C for 2 weeks. Samples were processed for paraffin embedding and then sectioned at 10 μm thickness. Alcian Blue Hematoxylin /Orange G (ABH/OG) staining and TRAP staining were performed following standard protocols.2.5. Real-time PCR The otic capsule surrounding the cochlear part of the control and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice at 8 weeks of age was carefully dissected, and grinded in a bath of liquid nitrogen using the disposable micro Tissue homogenizer (BioMasher, Japan). Ground samples were collected with 500 μl Trizol (Qiagen) and total RNA was purified using the ZR tissue & Insect RNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). qPCR was performed using SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The primers for Opg and Rankl and Gapdh have been described previously [25]. Gene expression was first normalized to Gapdh and then normalized to control samples.2.6. Auditory Brainstem response (ABR) test The 6-week old mice were anesthetized with ketamine (125 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection prior to all procedures. Once a suitable plane of anesthesia was reached, the portion of the pinna which obscured the entrance to the tested ear canal was removed. The anesthetized animal was then placed in a sound-isolated, electrically-shielded box on top of a heating pad (40-90-2-05, FHC, Inc.). In conjunction with the heating pad, a rectal probe and DC temperature controller (41-90-8D, FHC, Inc.) were used to maintain the mouse’s temperature near 38 °C. Both eyes were moistened with ophthalmic ointment (Puralube®, Dechra Veterinary Products). Needle electrodes (GRD-SAF, The Electrode Store) were subdermally placed behind the pinna of the tested ear (reference electrode), in the scalp between the ears (active electrode), and in the back near the tail (ground electrode). ABRs were evoked by tone bursts of 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz produced by a closed-field magnetic speaker connected to a power amplifier (MF1 and SA1, Tucker-Davis Technologies). Each 5-ms burst was presented 33.3 times per second with alternating polarity. The onset and offset of each burst was tapered with a squared cosine function. For each frequency, the sound pressure level was lowered from 80 dB SPL in 5–10 dB steps until the threshold was reached. If 80 dB SPL was not enough to elicit a response, higher intensities were produced. The speaker’s output was transmitted into the ear through a custom acoustic coupler. The entire sound delivery system was calibrated with a ¼ inch condenser microphone (4939-A-011 and 2690-A-0S1, Brüel & Kjær). The electrical response evoked by the tone bursts and measured by the needle electrodes was amplified 10,000 times and bandpass filtered at 0.3–3 kHz (P55, Astro-Med Inc.). The amplified response was then digitally sampled at 10-μs intervals with a data acquisition device (PCI-6259, National Instruments) controlled by custom software (LabVIEW 2014, National Instruments). The electrical responses to 1,000 bursts were averaged at each intensity level to determine the threshold, which was defined as the lowest level at which any response peak was distinctly and reproducibly present. Visual inspection of the vertically stacked responses facilitated threshold determination.2.7. Behavioral Testing Spontaneous activity in an open field arena was monitored with Fusion Open Field Legacy system (Omnitech Electronics Inc., Columbus, OH) over 15 minutes. Mice at 6 weeks of age were singly placed in a 20 × 20 × 40 cm Plexiglas open field arena where activity was monitored by two rows of infrared diodes interfaced to a computer running Fusion 5.3 software. The activity of the animals in the open field were also recorded to digital video from a camera mounted over each test arena using Noldus Media Player (Noldus Information Technologies). The total distance (cm) moved and the circling activity as scored with Fusion software is reported. Circling is defined as the combination of clockwise and counter-clockwise circles performed by the mouse in the open field. In a separate test, balance and coordination were examined using a steady state rotarod at 25 rpm (Medd-Associates, St. Albans, VT). The steady speed was selected on a basis of an accelerated speed (4-40 rpm) given 24 hours prior to the steady speed test. This study showed that the average speed at which the mice fell from an accelerating rotarod was approximately 25 rpm. For the steady speed rotarod test, mice were given four 5-minute trials separated by a 20 min inter-trial interval (ITI). In all cases, trials terminated when the mouse fell from the rod or at 300 seconds. This time (s) was recorded as the latency to fall from the rod.2.8. Statistics All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests. Data were presented as mean ± SD or mean ±SEM from n > 3 experiments. Two-sided p values less than 0.05 were considered statically significant. qPCR analyses were performed with > 3 independent RNA isolates and triplicates for each RNA sample. Fold changes were calculated by dividing the value of the mutant mice by the value of the control mice. Increasing or decreasing percentage changes were calculated by dividing the value of difference between the treatment group and control group by the value of the control group and then multiplying 100.3. Results 3.1. Middle and inner ear appearance in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice To examine whether CaV1.2 contributes to development of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, we tested whether increasing Ca2+ signaling specifically through Cav1.2 affected the structure of the ossicles and otic capsule. We employed a CaV1.2TS transgenic mouse model, in which CaV1.2TS expression was silenced by a floxed upstream stop codon. We activated CaV1.2TS mutant channel expression in the bones of ear with Col2a1-Cre, which targets the osteochondral progenitors [31]. Targeted Col2a1-Cre expression in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule was confirmed with Col2a1-Cre;Rosa26-lacZ reporter mice (Fig. 1). The Col2a1-Cre directed lacZ expression in the ossicles and otic capsule, detected by prominent β-galactosidase staining that was absent in Rosa26-lacZ reporter mice lacking the Col2a1-Cre. We then examined the morphology of the isolated auditory ossicles and the otic capsule from Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and their Cre-negative littermate controls at 6 weeks of age. We found that the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule of CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice were thicker and had more bone mass than those of the control mice, particularly at the malleus handle, the malleus bony membrane, the incus body, the footplate of stapes, the stapedial arch (especially the anterior and posterior crura), and the whole otic capsule (Fig. 2A–D). In Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice, narrowed spaces were observed between the stapedial crura (through which the stapedial artery passes), for the round window and the oval window of the otic capsule. μCT 3-D reconstruction images of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsules confirmed the thicken bones and massive increase of bone mass in the malleus, incus, stapes and the otic capsules of the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice as well as the narrowed cavities for the stapedial artery and the cochlea (Fig. 2E–H).

We also observed extensive Alcian Blue-stained cartilage remnant in the bones of the mutant mice besides the Alcian Blue-stained cartilage remnant of the globuli interossei in the cochlea, suggesting osteoclast defects in the mutant mice. Moreover, the mutant otic capsules lacked sculpting, further indicative of defective osteoclast function. Fig. 3. Histological analysis of the inner ear of the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice. Open in a new tab A-F, Alcian Blue Hematoxylin/Orange G (ABH/OG) staining of sagittal sections from the inner ear of Cre-negative littermate controls (A, with higher magnification in B and C) and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (D, with higher magnification E and F) at 4 weeks of age, showing excessive bone mass in the vestibular system and cochlea but with little changes in the organ of corti of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice. G-J, ABH/OG staining of the stapedio-vestibular junction of Cre-negative controls (G, with higher magnification in H) and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (I, with higher magnification in J) at 4 weeks of age, showing the stapes footplate was not fixed but increased bone volume of stapes footplate and vestibule likely limited its movement in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice.We histologically examined the stapedio-vestibular joint space in the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant and control mice and found that it was not fixed in the CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice (Fig. 3G–J). However, the enlarged bone volume in the stapes footplate and the otic capsule likely limited the stapes movement. Because the histology indicated defective osteoclast function in the mutant mice, we analyzed the effect of increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS on osteoclasts. We performed tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining on histological sections of the otic capsules Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and littermate controls at 2 weeks of age. Compared to the controls, we observed significantly less TRAP-staining and fewer osteoclasts in the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice (Fig. 4A–F). We next quantitated the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts and osteoclast area, both of which were normalized to the bone area. The number of osteoclasts per bone area (Oc.N/B.Ar) was decreased by 91% and osteoclast area per bone area (Oc.Ar/B/Ar) decreased by 79% in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (Fig. 4G), suggesting that osteoblastic bone resorption of the otic capsule is greatly reduced in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice during postnatal development. As Col2a1-Cre expression is restricted to osteochondral lineage but not to osteoclast progenitors, increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS mutant channel could inhibit osteoclastogenesis via interfering with the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway in the otic capsule, similar to that we observed in the long bone [25]. We therefore examined Opg and Rankl mRNA expression in the otic capsule surrounding the cochlea of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and their littermate controls. Indeed, RT-qPCR analysis revealed upregulated (~4.4 fold) Opg mRNA expression in the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice compared with that in the control mice but no significant change in Rankl mRNA expression, thus resulting in an increase (~2.6 fold) in Opg/Rankl mRNA expression ratio in the otic capsule (Fig. 4H). We also detected upregulated mRNA expression of genes for osteoblast differentiation, such as Alpl, Runx2 and Sp7 in the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice (Fig. 4I), suggesting an anabolic effect of CaV1.2TS also contributed the increased bone mass in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice.

Col2a 1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice are hearing impaired To assess whether the morphological changes in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule in the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice impaired auditory function, we tested the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in both Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and their littermate controls at 6 weeks of age. Representative responses from control (Fig. 5A) and CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice (Fig. 5B) to decreasing stimulus intensities at 8 kHz showed differences in sensitivity and latency between the two genotypes. Compared to the control mice, the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice had no response to intensities below 85 dB SPL at 8 kHz and below 75 dB at 16 kHz (Fig. 5C and 5D). The mutant mice also showed delays for even stronger stimulus intensities (Fig. 5C and 5D). Furthermore, the hearing threshold of the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice was significantly higher (lower sensitivity) than that of the control mice in the 4 to 16 kHz region, while we found no significant difference in threshold between two genotypes at 32 kHz (Fig. 5E). That the hearing loss in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice is spared only in the high-frequency range is consistent with a conductive hearing loss mechanism, in which sounds fail to be transferred via the ossicular chain in the middle ear to the cochlea. Fig. 5. Auditory Brainstem Response testing shows hearing loss in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice. Open in a new tab A and B, Representative latency responses to different stimuli were compared between Cre-negative littermate controls (A) and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (B) at 8 kHz. C and D, The latency-intensity function curves were recorded at 8 kHz (C) and 16 kHz (D) with the littermate controls at the left part of the curve (black) and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice at the right part of the curve (red). E, The threshold curves were significantly different between the littermate controls and Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice at 4, 8 and 16 kHz frequencies (red arrow: no hearing response in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice was detected at 98 dB at 4 kHz). n = 4 for controls; n = 5 for Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice; Data are shown as mean ± SEM, ** p < 0.01 by 2-tailed unpaired t test.3.3. Col2a1Cre;CaV1.2TS mice show impaired vestibular function Otosclerosis patients sometimes experience vestibular symptoms in addition to hearing loss. Because of the observed morphological changes in the vestibular system in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice, we also examined their motor activities in an open field arena. The CaV1.2TS-expressing mutants were significantly more active compared to the control animals (mean distance moved ± SEM: Control = 1160 cm ± 125; Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS = 4,362 cm ± 529; p < 0.01). Additionally, we found that the CaV1.2TS-expressing mice exhibited frequent and random circling behavior in both the clockwise and counter clockwise directions (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Video), which lasted up to 8 seconds, indicating defects in vestibular function. We also evaluated body balance and coordination with the rotarod test. When accelerating the rotarod from 4 to 40 rpm, the Col2aCre-CaV1.2TS mutant mice fell off earlier, at an average speed of 25 rpm (Fig. 6B), and showed a significant decrease in the latency to fall (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, on the steady state rotarod at 25 rpm, the latency to fall was decreased across all four trials for Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice compared to that for the controls (Fig. 6D). Taken together, the behavior studies showed that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice have a defect in vestibular function, affecting balance and coordination. Fig. 6. Deficits of body balance in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice. Open in a new tab A, Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice displayed circling behavior in the open field test without preference for a particular direction, while Cre-negative littermate controls remained quiet most of the time.

Statistical analysis was performed by 2-tailed unpaired t test.Discussion Our data demonstrate that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2 regulates development of the auditory ossicles and otic capsule. Moreover, excessive Ca2+ influx through TS-causing mutant CaV1.2 channel causes deficits in both hearing and body balance. The abnormal bone growth of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice is likely due to both increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption, similar to the dual effect of the CaV1.2TS mutant channel on long bones that we previously demonstrated [25]. Although osteoclastogenesis is normally suppressed in the ossicles and the auditory otic capsule because of a locally high level of OPG, osteoclast function is still required to sculpt these bones during development. Absence of osteoclastic bone resorption in Rankl−/−, Fos−/− and Csf1op/op mice significantly affected these bones morphologically and functionally [4]. Expression of the gain-of-function CaV1.2TS mutant channel in our Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice affected the overall morphology of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, which display reduced sculpting (see the stapedial crura) and an osteopetrotic phenotype that are strikingly similar to those seen in Rankl−/−, Fos−/− and Csf1op/op osteoclastic defect mice [4], suggesting that the anticatabolic effect of increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS contributed to the morphological changes in theses bones. While this is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, showing that modulating Ca2+ signal via CaV1.2 in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule regulates osteoclastogenesis and bone modeling/remodeling in the middle and inner ear, our data are consistent with previous observations from others and us that CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression and secretion from osteoblasts [25, 28]. That expression of the CaV1.2TS mutant channel in our model was driven by Col2a1-Cre, which restricts expression to chondrocytes and osteoblast precursors but not in osteoclasts or their progenitors [31], adds further support to our hypothesis that the anticatabolic responses by altered CaV1.2 activity is mediated by upregulated OPG expression and secretion in bones of the ear. Our data showing increased Opg mRNA expression in the otic capsule surrounding the cochlea in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice further supports this hypothesis. Moreover, since the CaV1.2TS transgene expression is driven by Col2a1-Cre, the hearing and vestibular defects we observed can be attributed to the abnormal bone, and not to mutant channel expression in the hair cells of the cochlea and vestibular system or downstream nerves, in which Col2a1-Cre is not active. Consistent with that hypothesis, the organ of Corti is grossly intact in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (Fig. 4). However, as aberrant bone remodeling progresses in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice, it is also possible that the increased bone formation of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule and narrowed cavities in the bony labyrinth of the otic capsule could impair neuronal function and contribute to the circling behavior and hearing impairment. Thus, eventually both bone structure and neuronal dysfunction may contribute to the observed defects in hearing and vestibular function. Our results may also provide insight into the utility of sodium fluoride (NaF) as a treatment option to prevent hearing deterioration in patients with otosclerosis [32] and the reported association between clinical otosclerosis and low fluoride content in the drinking water [33–35]. Although this correlation has not been consistently observed, and the underlying mechanism of effect of fluoride on otosclerosis has not been sufficiently established, it is intriguing that fluoride, which plays an important role in both bone formation and homeostasis of bone mineral metabolism [36], has been shown to affect Ca2+ homeostasis in many types of cells such as in proximal tubules [37, 38], fibroblasts [39], cardiomyocytes [40], as well as osteoblasts [41]. Further, expression of CaV1.2 was stimulated by low-dose fluoride, inhibited by high-dose fluoride [42], and fluoride can stimulate cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel activity by increasing channel open probability or the duration of channel opening in a dose-dependent manner [40]. Our finding of upregulated OPG mRNA expression and OPG mediated-osteoclastogenesis inhibition in the otic capsule upon increased Ca2+ signaling via CaV1.2 may add a new dimension to the effectiveness of sodium fluoride treating patients with osteosclerosis.Supplementary Material 1 Download video file (2.7MB, mp4) Highlights.

Keywords: Oligodendrocytes, myelination, simulated microgravity, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, mitochondrial functionCaption for Graphical Abstract This chart represents what is known about oligodendrocyte (OL) development in culture. Most studies have dealt with the synthesis of structural proteins and enzymes proper of the lineage as well as specific to developmental stages. Here we report a novel finding where membrane forming lipids were secreted by OL progenitors (OLP) exposed to weightlessness during 3 days, but not when OLPs were maintained in 1G. Examples of two lipids enriched in the secretome of these cells are shown.INTRODUCTION The central nervous system of all animal species has evolved in a one-G or terrestrial gravity (1G) environment and is functionally influenced by its presence. The absence of gravity presents a unique opportunity to gain new insights into basic neural development and function. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that synthesize and maintain myelin (rev. Baumann and Pham Ding 2000). OLs form compact segments of myelin membrane that coils around the axon and allows for the saltatory conduction of electric impulses, also known as a “neural transmission”. During the active phase of myelination, OLs require a constant source of energy to generate an enormous amount of lipids in a short time. OL can myelinate up to 50 different axons at a time and thus, the lack of mature OLs or myelin can lead to severe life-long disabilities like cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis (MS) and other conditions. Once myelination is completed, OLs have synthesized ~40% of the total lipids in the human brain (Norton W., 1981). The abundance of myelin; accounts for ~30% of the dry weight of the human brain. Studies have shown that the overall ratio of proteins to lipids is approximately, 1 to 186 in myelin (O’Brien and Sampson 1965). The enrichment of lipids in myelin is basically due to myelin basic protein (MBP) which extrudes most proteins from the compacted myelin sheath (Aggarwal et al., 2011). Cholesterol, galactosylceramide and ethanolamine plasmalogen are the most significant lipids in myelin accounting for 65% of the total lipid dry weight. The effects of reduced gravity on physiological and pathological processes are poorly understood. However, recent studies performed in astronauts having been in orbital flight had depicted some pathophysiological effects. Among such effects are muscular atrophy, osteopenia, hematological alterations of red cell morphology and weakened immune response. (Graebe et al., 2004; Damm et al., 2013; Nabavi et al., 2011; Plett et al., 2004). A subset of astronauts on International Space Station missions have shown visual deterioration that is considered one of the greatest human health risks of spaceflight. Studies with cells cultured in microgravity have shown that microgravity induces apoptosis, alters the cytoskeleton and affects signal transduction, cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and adhesion differently depending on the cell type (rev. Studer et al., 2011). We have pioneered the study of simulated microgravity on neural cells, in particular OLs. The first steps included adapting common cell culture hardware in order to be used in conjunction with the simulated microgravity (sim-μG) producing robot, “the 3D-clinostat” (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries). Once suitable conditions were established, we used this innovative culture system to study the impact of sim-μG on OLs. We first examined the impact of sim-μG on oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) development. We subjected rodent and human OLPs to short exposures (24 – 72 hours) to sim-μG and revealed that OLPs displayed an enhanced and sustained proliferation with a concomitant shortening of the cell cycle in sim-μG by utilizing BrdU and time-lapse microscopy. Exposure to sim-μG also increased the migratory properties of the OLPs (Espinosa et al., 2013). Cellular metabolism is essential for providing the necessary energy for synthesis of components required for cell structure and function. Normal cells use oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oxygen to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a cellular fuel. Fatty acids (FAs) are a critical source of energy for mitochondrial oxidation and cellular ATP generation. OLs possess a broad plasticity that can be extensively modulated by external stimuli. Here we sought to determine the impact of sim-μG on A) energy metabolism of post-mitotic human (Hu) HuOLs after exposure to weightlessness; B) to assess lipidomic changes in the secretome of OLs produced while exposed to weightlessness. Our results indicate that mitochondrial function is enhanced in OLs by sim-μG vs. OLs maintained in 1G. Moreover, elevated energy demand in OLs while in sim-μG led to an increased use of glycolysis to support energetics. This enhanced requirement for energy appears to be accounted for, at least in part, by increased lipids secreted by OLs. Notably cholesterol, laurate, 5-dodecenoate, palmitoleate, and eicosenoate. These surprising findings indicate that sim-μG preserves, and potentially enhances, metabolic reactions that are required for membrane synthesis and myelinogenesis.MATERIALS AND METHODS Human cells Human tissue experiments were approved by the Office of the Human Subject Committee. Cultures were prepared with fetal human tissue specimens donated by the Department of Pathology and Laboratory of Medicine at UCLA. Samples were de-identified in accordance with  guidelines. Anonymous, preserved specimens are donated for medical research purposes and are IRB exempt. (www.pathology.ucla.edu/TPCL.html).Human embryonic brain derived NSCs and OLPs preparation for sim-μG studies De-identified donated human pre-shelved specimens were obtained from Pathology. Human fetal cortical tissue samples (17 weeks of gestation) were used as the source of neural progenitors. We previously reported the human cell culture preparation (Espinosa et al., 2013) which is described in Figure 1. We have previously designed a series of developmental stage-specific chemically defined “stem” cell culture media for neural stem cells (NSCs) propagation and maintenance of their pluripotent stage. (Espinosa et al., 2002; Espinosa et al., 2009). For the purpose of fate restriction and OL phenotype induction we used the oligodendrocyte specification medium (OSM). The formulation of OSM includes the minimum and sufficient nutrients to support OLPs developmental stage and their proliferation. For OL specification NSCs can be transferred to oligodendrocyte specification medium (OSM) that induces neural stem cell commitment to the OL lineage (Espinosa et al., 2002). These proliferative OLPs can be maintained in this medium as needed to increase cell numbers. Fig. 1. Preparation of NSCs from 17 weeks’ human embryonic brain and OL specification. Open in a new tab In sterile conditions and using the Biohazard safety cabinet, we started by dissecting the brain, harvested the cortices and remove the meninges. Following dissection and using STM the cell suspension was mechanically dissociated and pelleted. Cells were suspended in STMc medium (Espinosa et al., 2009; 2016). The cell suspension was sieved through a 70μm mesh and plated on anti-PSA-NCAM antibody–coated dishes. Cells were allowed to adhere for 5 min prior to removing them from the safety cabinet. NSCs were propagated directly on this matrix of PSA-NCAM antibody. To preserve self-renewal and stemness 50% of the medium was removed and replenished with the same volume of STMc every other day until confluent. When confluent, NSCs were harvested by shaking the flask, pelleted and seeded on PdL coated flasks with OSM. This medium instructs them towards the OL fate choice, while allowing them to proliferate. For both 1G and 0G cultures the incubator was set at 36.8°C and 4.5% CO2 as usual. For 1G and 0G cultures the full volume of culture medium was pre-equilibrated overnight in the CO2 incubator. To use the 3D-clinostat, the flasks or cell containers need to be full and without even a small bubble, in order to prevent demise of the cells. While this study was performed using 2D culture oligo spheres (3D cultures) would also work. After OSM has been equilibrated flasks were filled, the bubble removed and the cultures placed in the 3D-clinostat. The cells that would remain in 1G were placed in the bottom of the same incubator and using the same flasks, coating and containing the same volume of medium. Cultures were recovered after 72h for analysis.After reaching confluency, cells were mechanically detached from flasks and re-plated in OSM either in 12.5 mm flasks or glass Nunc Lab-tek flasket’s. After 72 h, half of the cultures were placed in the 3D-Clinostat and half cultures were kept in the same incubator in 1G. We previously documented protocols for the production, isolation, and maintenance of the oligodendrocytes derived from rodent and human neural stem cells using our chemically defined media (Espinosa et al., 2002; Espinosa et al., 2009; Espinosa et al., 2016). OLs were maintained in OSM and fed by adding fresh OSM every other day. The OSM to be used for cells in 1G and 0G experiments is equilibrated in the incubator overnight in order to have the same concentration of CO2 in both sets of cultures. When semi-confluent, all flasks were filled with OSM, one set of cultures was set in 1G and the second set of sister culture flasks were filled over the top to prevent any bubble formation, which can result in cell death due to erosion from the flask surface. After elimination of the bubble, cultures were placed in the 3D-clinostat that produces the sim-μG environment as shown in Fig. 1.Simulated microgravity was produced by the 3D-clinostat The 3D-clinostat (Fig.1), a multidirectional G force generator, was produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (Kobe, Japan). By controlled simultaneous rotation of 2 axes, the 3D clinostat cancels the cumulative gravity vector at the center and around the device, producing a microgravity environment. This is accomplished by rotation of a chamber at the center of the device to disperse the gravity vector uniformly within a spherical volume, at a constant angular velocity.Cell Imaging and Analysis Cells were monitored every other day and microscope images of live cells were taken every 1–5 days to document their progression. The following qualitative observations were documented: density of cell growth, cell diameter, cell morphology, presence/absence of processes, and the overall appearance of the cells. The Axio-vert and Axio-Cam MRm from Carl Zeiss and the AxioVision 40V program version: 4.8.2 SP3 were used to manually count the number of cells and measure the diameter of the cell bodies represented in the visual field of the images (AxioVision, RRID:SCR_002677). Data was then compiled and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad (GraphPad, RRID:SCR_000306). We used unpaired t-test for the statistical analysis with the 0G, 1G, and control groups (n=5).PCR analysis of OLP Human neural stem cell hESC-derived OL HBF-2050 were analyzed for gene expression after having been grown in their original medium or placed in OSM. After 5 days in culture, the medium was removed and cells were rinsed with chilled DEPC-treated PBS and RNA was extracted using RNA Extraction mini kit purchased from QIAGEN RRID:SCR_008539). RNA from individual samples were reverse transcribed and PCR amplified using Retroscript kit from Ambion, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Fifty ng cDNA of each sample in duplicate was amplified in BioRad iCycler using human gene specific primers (Table 2). The amplified DNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. The gel was imaged and the DNA bands were cut out to extract DNA for each gene, and DNA was sequenced to validate the product specificity. In addition, the ethidium bromide stained DNA band intensity was determined by UVP Bioimaging Autochemi Gel Documenting System and presented in a bar graph as the level of gene expression relative to the house keeping gene, GAPDH. Human gene specific PCR primers were generated from the coding sequence obtained from . The regions of genes were selected without 3-D structure using mfold software and primers were designed using Primer3 software for 60-dgrees. The selected forward and reverse primer sequence were sent to Sigma for primer synthesis. The primers were validated before study. Table 2.

The selected forward and reverse primer sequence were sent to Sigma for primer synthesis. The primers were validated before study.Cellular Bioenergetics Post-mitotic OL were seeded onto an XF24 Cell Culture Microplate (Seahorse Bioscience) at 5 × 104 cells/well in glial defined medium (GDM) supplemented with transferrin and IGF-1 namely “BS1” in order to obtain post-mitotic OLs. Cells were kept 24h in standard culture conditions (37°C, 4.5% CO2). The following day, wells were filled with fresh OSM at 30°C. The plates to be kept in 1G were covered and placed in the incubator. The plates to be placed in sim-μG in the 3D-clinostat were covered with Milli-wrap (Millipore Corp. Bradford, MA. USA) and incubated 24h in the clinostat at 37°C, 4.5% CO2 overnight. The following day, some of the supernatant was removed from the well plates. We used an XF24 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (Seahorse Wave, RRID:SCR_014526). OCR and ECAR reflect rates of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, respectively. Measurements were performed with the cells in unbuffered DMEM assay medium supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine and 25 mM glucose. Measures were recorded before (basal reading) and after the sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone/myxothiazol. Maximal OCR was the response to FCCP, whereas maximal ECAR was the response to oligomycin. OCR was normalized to cellular protein concentration determined with the Protein Assay reagent (Bio-Rad) in all experiments.Secretome Study Metabolic profiles were obtained for each individual group using the Metabolon Platform (Metabolon). Briefly, each sample or “group” consisted of 5 biological replicate specimens. Three groups of samples were compared: Blank (n=5) which consisted of the culture medium alone incubated in the same incubator used for our cell cultures. OLPs (n=5) in 1G and OLPs incubated in sim-μG = 0G, (n=5). Post-harvest the conditioned medium was used to analyze molecules secreted by OLPs. This medium was subjected to methanol extraction then split into aliquots for analysis by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) in the positive (two methods), negative or polar ion mode. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of ion features to a reference library of chemical standards followed by visual inspection for quality control as previously described (DeHaven et al., 2016).Statistical Analysis for the secretome study To determine statistical significance, Welsh’s two-sample t-tests were performed on the 0G, 1G and control groups of n=5 in ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) or “R” to compare data between them; P < 0.05 was considered significant (Array Studio, RRID:SCR_010970). False discovery rate (Q-value) was calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies, with Q<0.05 used as an indication of high confidence in a result. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) were performed in ArrayStudio. Random Forest analysis was performed as described (Evans et al., 2009; DeHaven et al., 2010). For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” represents population mean, (Weissgerber et al., 2015).RESULTS HuE-OLs were healthy in sim-μG and displayed a smaller cell diameter than cells maintained in 1G Human OLs were grown in OSM for four days in 1G or sim-μG. Cells appeared as healthy OLs with cell processes when viewed under phase contrast. The only visible difference between conditions was the greater cell number in cultures exposed to sim-μG as shown (Fig. 2), as expected based on our previous study (Espinosa et al., 2013). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Phase contrast representative views of OLs derived from Hu Embryonic brain 17 week gestation at passage number 2 (P2). NSC were re-plated on poly-D-lysine coated flasks and maintained in STM medium to allow them to proliferate for six days in 1G. Then switched to OSM and kept in 1G (left panel) or in sim-μG (right panel) for 4 days. After 72h cultures exposed to sim-μG bared many more cells than those maintained in 1G as previously reported (Espinosa et al., 2013).NSC were re-plated on poly-dlysine coated flasks and maintained in STM medium to allow them to proliferate for six days in 1G; then switched to OSM and kept in 1G or in sim-μG for 4 days. Cells were then fixed and examined. Measurements of cell diameter revealed a difference in the size of OLs cultured in 1G vs. those cultured in sim-μG. Twelve visual fields from three different flasks from each group were measured, from three separate experiments. Our data revealed a difference in the size of cells cultured under 1G conditions, compared to those cultured under 0G conditions. We found that cells under sim-μG were smaller in size, based on cell body diameter (Fig. 3). The average cell diameter of OLPs exposed to sim-μG was 12.37μm (n=789, SD = 3.67), while the mean diameter of cells maintained in 1G was 14.51μm (n=529, SD = 4.611). The unpaired t-test revealed a P value of less than 0.0001. We have observed similar changes in neural stem cells (grown in their respective medium) after their exposure to sim-μG (Espinosa et al., 2016). Fig. 3. The cell diameter of OLs derived from Hu embryonic brain is reduced after exposure to sim-μG. Open in a new tab Cells cultured in OSM for 4 days revealed significantly smaller cell body diameter when cultured under sim-μG conditions as compared to cells cultured under 1G conditions. This phenomenon might be attributed to cytoskeleton and cell adhesion changes. Values are expressed as mean + SEM of two independent experiments. Data were analyzed using unpaired t-test **: p<0.01 ***: p<0.001 vs. respective control.Qualitative assessment on the expression of relevant genes for neural progenitors and early OLPs Human progenitors were either in their original plating medium for 1d or in our proprietary OSM culture medium and cultured in sim-μG (0G) or in 1G for 5 days. Then OLPs were harvested and processed to ascertain the expression of molecular biomarkers for genes proper to the OL lineage and some for NSCs. The main goal was to characterize how the markers would be expressed in terms of lineage specificity relevant to the difference in gravity. The biomarkers of interest included those belonging from early to mid-stage undifferentiated neuronal-glial cells that are known to localize within cortical-striatal regions such as nestin and Pax-6. The expression of markers for early OLPs that would indicate commitment such as Sox2, Olig2, PDGFRa and transferrin (Tf) were also examined. The primers used are shown in table 1. We found the presence of all the markers examined in all cultures at day 1 or day 5 suggesting that some cells remain uncommitted still 5 days after being in OSM. Nonetheless, there are numerous early OL markers also present. We found that absolutely all progenitor markers have a higher level of expression when cells have been in 0G and this increase is time dependent. In contrast, in cells maintained in 1G full time most of these markers tended to decrease (Fig. 4). Simulated microgravity did not alter the expression of the markers studied. Nonetheless, human OLP specification is a long process when compared to rodent OLP. Thus, some progenitors still expressed Pax-6, Sox-2 and nestin (stem cell markers) while co-expressing OLP specific markers Olig2, PDGFRα and transferrin (TF) regardless of whether they were in 1G or 0G (Fig. 4).

Human OLPs cultures whether in 0G or 1G expressed the same developmental markers. Open in a new tab After 5 days in culture human neural stem cell hESC-derived OL, grown in their original medium or in OSM, were examined for a qualitative gene expression relevant to OL markers from a single dish a total of two samples. The medium was removed, cells were rinsed with chilled DEPC-treated PBS and RNA was extracted using QIAGEN RNA-mini kit. RNA from individual samples was reverse transcribed and PCR amplified in duplicates using human gene specific primers (Table 1). The amplified DNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. The gel was imaged and the DNA was sequenced to establish the product specificity. In addition, the DNA ethidium bromide band intensity was determined by UVP gel doc system and presented in a bar graph as the level of gene expression relative to the house keeping gene, GAPDH. The result verifies expression of relevant genes in these cells based on DNA sequencing and their levels relative to the house-keeping gene within in the same sample. Bars represent results from duplicate samples from the same cultures.Sim-μG elicits higher respiration rates in HuOLs To ascertain the effects of sim-μG on energy metabolism, by comparing OLs under conditions of 1G and sim-μG. We quantified oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate as measures of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, respectively. We found that OLs maintained 24 hours in sim-μG presented higher basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration compared with OLs maintained in 1G (Fig. 5). Maximal, but not basal, glycolysis was also significantly higher in sim-μG compared to 1G. Since these cells were post-mitotic and the data normalized to protein, this increase appears to be due to a higher metabolic rate, rather than to cell proliferation. Fig. 5. A higher bioenergetic state was elicited in OLs kept in sim-μG. Open in a new tab Human OLs were cultured in Seahorse Bioscience V7 plate for 48h. Then 1 plate was placed in the 3D-Clinostat and the second one was kept in the same incubator in 1G during 24 hours. Higher basal OCR and higher maximal OCR and ECAR in sim-μG indicate that the cells are in a higher bioenergetics state. the number of samples was 12 per experiment(n = 12), and the experiment was performed twice independently. Values are expressed as mean + SEM of two independent experiments. Student’s t test revealed that these differences were **: p<0.01 ***: p<0.001 vs respective control.Effects of sim-μG on Metabolomic Profile Mitochondrial function, TCA cycle and glycolysis Our results show that in sim-μG OLs, there were substantially reduced pyruvate levels and increased lactate levels (2.5-fold) (Fig. 6), in agreement with demonstrated increases in glycolysis as described above. Additionally, there were increased levels of citrate (3.3-fold higher in sim-μG compared to 1G. Lipids can also be synthesized from citrate, so, some of the glucose input into the TCA cycle could be drawn into fatty acid production. In addition, malonate which is produced from hydrolysis of malonyl-CoA was also elevated in 0G vs. 1G OLs. Aconitate (4.4-fold), fumarate (3.7-fold) and malate (2.3-fold) were also increased. Succinate, however, was not significantly changed, which could reflect limiting alpha-ketoglutarate or pools in steady-state (potentially as a result of high demand for use to support oxidative metabolism). Together, these findings suggest a potential increase in TCA cycle flux in sim-μG (Fig. 6). Fig. 6. OLs in sim-μG require more energy than in 1G. Open in a new tab The main sources of energy for respiration and energy production glucose and pyruvate were decreased in 3 days when cells were in microgravity, while lactate levels increased considerably indicating that OLs switched to anaerobic glycolysis in order to meet the energy demand elicited by microgravity. Carbon flows into the TCA cycle from carbohydrates and lipids. Glutamine enters the cycle as alpha-ketoglutarate, and branched-chain amino acids entering as citrate and succinyl CoA. Decreased levels of alpha-ketoglutarate are most likely the result of glutamine reduction in the culture medium. As for the increase of fumarate and malate, it might reflect switching catabolic use of branched-chain amino acid metabolism (BCAAs) in order to support the energy demand, n = 5. Welch’s 2-factor t-test was used to identify significant changes in the metabolomic dataset, with a p<0.05 as a threshold for significance (and a trend value of 0.05<p<0.1). For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” represents population mean, for details see: (Weissgerber et al., 2015).Lipid Synthesis is Enhanced by Simulated Microgravity Because one of the roles of OLs is the biosynthesis of lipids to form myelin, we next examined the lipid content in the secretome of huOLs while in sim-μG compared to 1G. After three days, the conditioned medium of OLs maintained in sim-μG showed an increase in some fatty acid levels compared to 1G (Fig. 7). Fig. 7. Lipid metabolism is important for membrane structure and as a critical source of mitochondrial oxidation. Open in a new tab Caprate and laurate 9medium chain FAs) increased in microgravity exposed OLs with respect to OLs maintained in 1G. palmitoleate and eicosenoate longer chain FAs also tended to increase in 0G. The increased complex lipids and lysolipids may indicate the remodeling of phospholipids to produce more FAs. Alternatively, they may be forming the lipids that constitute myelin n = 5. Welch’s 2-factor t-test was used to identify significant changes in the metabolomic dataset, with a p<0.05 as a threshold for significance (and a trend value of 0.05<p<0.1). For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” represents population mean, for details see: (Weissgerber et al., 2015).Myelin structural lipids are formed with the help of steroid-modifying enzymes and cholesterol-esterifying enzymes such as UDP-galactose:ceramidegalactosyl-transferase as well as enzymes of glycerophospholipid metabolism, including enzymes involved in the synthesis of phosphatidyl ethanolamine. Interestingly, we found that just after three days in microgravity, OLs secreted phosphatidyl ethanolamine. Complex lipids like 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (5.67) lysolipids like 1-oleoyl-GPE (4.48) were also increased by microgravity, indicating in an indirect manner their presence in OLs. It is interesting to note that N-palmitoyl-sphingosine showed a drastic increase of (66.14). In 1G OLs, this biochemical was above the threshold of detection in 20% of samples. In contrast in OLs exposed to 0G it was detected in 100%, which could suggest biosynthetic shifts toward increased sphingolipid production. Similarly, stearoyl sphingomyelin and the phosphatidylserine-containing phospholipid 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-GPS were not detected in 1G OLs, but were present in 0G OLs (Fig. 8). Long chain FAs were also elevated as a class, which could be consistent with increased fatty acid production. Fig. 8. Open in a new tab This basic overview of sphingolipid metabolism highlights the increase in palmitoyl and stearoyl sphingomyelins in the dataset, even if they are a lower-fold increase compared to N-palmitoyl-sphingosine, it complements the increases of lipids shown in Fig. 7 n = 5. Welch’s 2-factor t-test was used to identify significant changes in the metabolomic dataset, with a p<0.05 as a threshold for significance (and a trend value of 0.05<p<0.1). For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” represents population mean, for details see: (Weissgerber et al., 2015). RFA (Random forest assessing) Blank, 1G and 0G OLs was very effective, with a predictive accuracy of 100% (random chance would be expected to yield a predictive accuracy of 33%). The Biochemical Importance plot highlighted biochemicals related to neurotransmitter biosynthesis (aspartate, N-acetylaspartate), energetics (lactate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, pyruvate, citrate, and aconitate) as well as a number of amino acids (Gly, Ser, Pro, Leu, Asn) and their catabolites. N-acetylaspartate (and aspartate) is a precursor to the neuropeptide NAAG, as well as being important for transfer of 2-carbon units for myelin biosynthesis (Fig. 9). Fig. 9. Random forest RFA. Open in a new tab assessing Blank, 1G and 0G OLs was very effective, the Biochemical Importance plot highlighted biochemicals related to neurotransmitter biosynthesis (aspartate, N-acetylaspartate), energetics (lactate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, pyruvate, citrate, and aconitate) as well as a number of amino acids (Gly, Ser, Pro, Leu, Asn) and their catabolites. N-acetylaspartate (and aspartate) is a precursor to the neuropeptide NAAG, as well as being important for transfer of 2-carbon units for myelin biosynthesis. It may be of interest to assess myelination in co-culture (or in animals exposed to 0G). Random Forest classification using named metabolites in media of Blank compared to 1G and 0G OLPs gave a predictive accuracy of 100%. Random chance would be expected to yield a predictive accuracy of 33% n = 5. RFA was performed as previously described (Mitchell MW, Open Journal of Statistics, 2011). HCA (Hierarchical Clustering Analysis) To gain a better insight of biomarkers distinguishing the 0G from the 1G population, we used Random Forest Analysis, which uses a forest of decision trees to identify important biochemicals to predicting groups (Fig.10). Interestingly, in addition to several amino acids (and related metabolites), pyruvate and lactate were highlighted, as were the TCA cycle metabolites citrate, aconitate, and alpha-ketoglutarate, consistent with metabolic shifts discussed above. The regions of interest 1 and 2 are shown in Figures (11 and 12). Figure 10. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). Open in a new tab evaluates the variable clustering patterns of the 252 metabolites for production and consumption in OLPs exposed to 0G or 1G. The data is shown in a table format, where the rows represent individual metabolites and the columns represent the serum sample it is derived. The color in each cell reflects the concentration level of each metabolite to its corresponding sample, relative to its mean concentration level across the entire set of tissue samples. Respectively, the colors red, blue, and white within the table indicate an increase, decrease, or no significant change of metabolites. The pathways the metabolites belong to are indicated to the right of the HCA. The HCA compares the metabolite change between the 0G, 1G, and control groups. n = 5 samples per group. HCA data analysis were generated using ArrayStudio.Fig. 11. Hierarchical clustering analysis: Region of Interest 1 (ROI-1). Open in a new tab We selected two regions of interest. Region 1 reflects an increased production amino acids (the vast majority) and lipids as shown in the pathway right column.

HCA data analysis were generated using ArrayStudio. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) To gain a better understanding of changes in OLs cellular metabolism associated with sim-uG, we assessed the metabolome. Data structure was assessed using principle components analysis (PCA): 1G and 0G samples showed good separation, suggesting distinct metabolomic trends associated with sim-μG (Fig. 13). Fig. 13. Overview of data set. Open in a new tab In the PCA, samples showed good separation by treatment, with Component 1 separating between samples by gravitational status (Component 2 separated between blank and conditioned media). 0G samples tended to show higher intra-group variation compared to other treatments, which could reflect regional differences in simulated gravity.. n = 5 samples per group. PCA data analysis were generated using ArrayStudio.DISCUSSION Microgravity has been shown to cause cell damage and impair the cell cycle in a variety of biological systems including transiently in neural stem cells (Silvano et al., 2015). We have started to unravel how biological processes in the CNS occur in weightlessness. We have previously showed that the cell cycle is shortened and more oligodendrocyte progenitors are produced in microgravity (Espinosa et al., 2013). Here we sought to determine the metabolic status of OLPs when exposed to sim-μG for 72h. Energetics Using metabolic profiling of oligodendroglial cells in sim-μG, we have uncovered significant changes in OLs energetics and lipid metabolism. We revealed the enhancement of two metabolic patterns, energetics and lipid metabolism. After 24h sim-μG, OLs exhibited higher respiratory activity as well as greater respiratory and glycolytic reserve capacity compared with OLs maintained in 1G, suggesting a high energy demand by these cells. From the study of secreted metabolites study (72h in sim-μG), the high levels of glucose and pyruvate utilization, as they entered the Krebs cycle, corroborated the high energy demand elicited by sim-μG in these cells. Altogether, these results indicate that cells maintained in microgravity exhibit enhanced energy production. Lipids can also be synthesized from citrate; so, some of the glucose input into the TCA could be drawn into fatty acid production. In addition, malonate which is produced from hydrolysis of malonyl-CoA was also elevated in 0G vs. 1G OLs. Alpha-ketoglutarate increases could reflect increased glutamine use to support energetics, which could be needed if some citrate was being siphoned into fatty acid biosynthesis.Lipid metabolism As mentioned before, fatty acids are a critical source of ATP/energy generation, as well as a support to macromolecule biosynthesis. In our study, increased FAs in OLPs under sim-μG vs. 1G could have increased energy production. Nonetheless, given that OLs are also the cells that synthesize myelin, changes on some of their lipids may also reflect the developmental status of OLs while exposed to microgravity. Cholesterol is an essential structural lipid for all membranes. In the CNS, almost the entire pool of cholesterol is produced in situ from de novo synthesis (Dietschy and Turley, 2004). Most cell types use glucose, but OLs use ketone bodies as precursors for cholesterol synthesis (Koper et al.,1981). Moreover, enzymes that convert acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate into acetoacetyl-CoA are highly enriched in OLs (Pleasure et al., 1979; Poduslo S., 1989). Because an enormous amount of lipids needs to be synthesized and transferred to the myelin membrane, cholesterol may use more than one route of delivery. A direct transfer of cholesterol from the ER to the plasma membrane exists and may serve as a short cut for the transfer of lipids from their site of synthesis to the cell surface of OLs. Once cholesterol is in the myelin sheath, its turnover slows down resulting in a half-live of months. Cholesterol provides stability to myelin by regulating its fluidity and permeability (rev. Schmitt et al., 2015). The increase in cholesterol found in the secretome of OLs after 3 days in sim-0G indicates that they were producing the lipids necessary for membranes and perhaps some in preparation for the myelinogenic process, just like they do in vivo. Conjugation with carnitine is a prerequisite for long-chain FAs in order to be transferred across the mitochondrial membrane; we found that with exception of acetylcarnitine, all the other acylcarnitines were below the threshold of detection suggesting a high activity of FAs transport into mitochondria for oxidation and energy production. The increased ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and carnitine in the secretome could be due to changes in fatty acid oxidation, to support increased energetics. The main question is: why is there a huge energy demand in respect to cells maintained in 1G? “Would the reason be that OLs are progressing on preparation for the establishment of the premyelinating stage? (Fig. 14). Interestingly, OLs in 1G did not secrete most of these lipids. Fig. 14. Open in a new tab This diagram of OLs development indicates the stage where our cells (in pink) were when they were submitted to sim-μG. In 1G these cells take around one week to move forward to the next step on the lineage. Here we showed that 3 days in sim-μG cells started and increased the secretion of lipids that weren’t yet myelin lipids but just membrane lipids. We postulate that this increased lipid production was because OLs were moving forwards to next stage in the lineage characterized by the formation of numerous hairy-like cell processes while in microgravity. OLPs kept in 1G did not display this phenomenon.Besides its role in general synthesis of cell and organelle membranes, cholesterol plays several key roles during myelinogenesis, it is a structural lipid but it is not inert. It has dynamic functions such as modulation of translation. It has been shown that during myelinogenesis, the rate of cholesterol synthesis depends on the speed of myelin synthesis. Knock out mouse models, such as Niemann–Pick disease type C protein (NPC1), have shown that cholesterol levels in OLs and neurons are important for proper myelination (Schmitt et al., 2015). Oligodendrocyte-specific squalene synthase mutant mice resulted in the absence of cholesterol, leading to a downregulation of mRNAs for major myelin proteins (Saher et al., 2005; 2010). Thus, cholesterol synthesis and presence appears to be coupled to the metabolism of other myelin components, perhaps determining the maturity of the cell. In addition, it is believed that cholesterol levels determine myelin assembly by regulating energy production and supporting protein translation via mTOR signaling. Recent experiments performed in Zebrafish have shown that high cholesterol levels are required for myelin growth and compaction (Mathews et al., 2014). Some direct interactions between certain myelin proteins containing cholesterol recognition amino-acid consensus (CRAC) motifs and cholesterol have been documented (Saher and Simons, 2010). It has been reported that as myelin is being formed from 20 to 40 days in the rat brain, FAs and aldehyde patterns change. In a function of time palmitoleic acid, unsaturated C18 aldehydes, oleic acid and monosaturated FAs (C20) display higher values relative to such saturated moieties as palmitic acid, saturated C18 aldehyde, stearic acid and C22 saturated FAs. With age the percentage of long-chain FAs longer than C18 saturated or unsaturated increases in the normal rat brain (Schjeide et al., 1968). The present study for purpose of the secretome analysis was performed after three days in microgravity. A future time course study would allow us to respond if microgravity would elicit the same pattern observed during normal in vivo myelin formation as previously reported (Schjeide et al., 1968). Nonetheless, it is clear that microgravity positively impacted lipid synthesis by OLs by triggering their production faster than in 1G OLs as shown in 1G cultures. This phenomenon although in an indirect manner attests for the presence of the lipid-related enzymes that should have been present in OLs in order to form these lipids. Recently, live-imaging analysis of myelination in zebrafish has shown that OLs (at least in the zebrafish), make new myelin within a period of just five hours (Czopka et al., 2013). We do not know how long a human OL would take to make myelin in sim-0G but, what is clear is that the early abundant production of lipids including some myelin lipids, appears to be more efficient in simulated microgravity than in 1G. We have previously reported that during and after exposure to sim-μG, OLPs proliferated more than control cells kept in 1G. We also showed that these cells expressed early markers, while a decreased number of cells expressed mature OL markers, such as MBP or CC1. Thus, maturation of these cells appeared to be delayed in a transient manner but, not impaired by exposure to 0G (Espinosa et al., 2013; Oregel et al., 2010). Our current data shows that these apparently immature OLs kept busy producing an enormous amount of lipids in a more efficient manner. Taken together our previous report on a delayed expression of mature myelin markers and the current data, it is clear that OLs addressed the synthesis of enzymes timely and efficiently to be able to produce certain lipidic components of myelin. This phenomenon might consequently delay the expression of mature protein markers such as MBP which is needed later, when the myelin sheath would be formed. It is conceivable that Human OLs secreted newly formed lipids into the culture medium as a survival mechanism and perhaps due to their smaller cell body size and, because of the absence of axons to progress towards a myelinating stage. Moreover, it is also possible that OLs in sim-μG require of more time to produce longer chain myelin-related lipids, after all, 1G OLs did not produce any of the sphingo-lipids in the same period of time. Additionally, in our hands for an optimal OL development, OLs in culture when in 1G, require of GDM (glial chemically defined medium; Espinosa et al., 2009 and 2016) to support the optimal development of immature OL and to reach the mature myelinating stage they require OLDEM (OL defined medium) the OL medium formulation designed to support the production of myelin enzymes and myelin membrane by cultured OLs (Yuan et al., 1992). We have previously shown that rat OLs maintained in sim-μG re-capitulate the developmental stages for OL (Oregel et al., 2010). More experiments are needed to elucidate this and many other questions that come to mind. Finally, the Seahorse experiments and metabolomics revealed significantly higher mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in immature OLs indicating a switch of source of energy.Conclusion Benefits expected for an-kind living and working in microgravity. We have started to uncover the effects of a short-term exposure to sim-μG on OLs. These are very significant changes in the two main pathways of OL metabolism: Energetics and lipid metabolism. These changes don’t seem to be deleterious to OLs; but rather they appear to be enhanced by microgravity. It appears that their functional potential is preserved and enhanced by microgravity. The increase in lipids suggests membrane synthesis that allows more cell processes necessary for the progression to the pre-myelinating stage. The present is the first study totally innovative to address the effects of microgravity on OL metabolomics. This is a nascent field of research. We have started to unravel the molecular and biochemical changes elicited by microgravity. Numerous studies remain to be performed in order to understand how this new knowledge is applicable to astronauts experiencing long-term space travel and intracranial hypertension which occurs in microgravity and continues to affect them when back to earth.Benefits expected for humanity on earth. Originally our long-term goal was, and still is, to be able to produce healthy, transplantable and functional human OLs in adequate numbers to be used for cell replacement therapies to treat myelin deficiencies on earth. This approach will be applicable to either in the premature neonate or patients with other leukodystrophies and neurodegenerative disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS) for which currently there are no cures. Our current data augur well for the use of sim-μG to produce OLs faster and in adequate numbers that exhibit the initial typical features of their myelinating potential while OLs that remained in 1G didn’t.SIGNIFICANCE. Myelin is essential for our daily activities. Abnormality in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells, produces severe central nervous system pathologies during development and in neurodegenerative disorders. In most myelin disorders OL progenitors (OLPs) are present but fail to mature. OLPs exposure to simulated microgravity (0G) results in a large need for energy which appears to be required for extensive lipid secretion. While further studies are needed, enhanced production of membrane lipids suggests that OLPs may progress towards next developmental stages where more extensive cell processes are formed. Moreover, OLPs in 1G did not secrete most of these lipids. Could priming OLPs in 0G enhance membrane formation after grafting?Acknowledgements We thank the Cell Culture Core supported by: Grant #PP1498: Neural Cell Culture Core and  HD004612 Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities.

NSCs displayed both higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis than ground controls. These cells also kept their ability to become young neurons.

Current injections elicited only an incipient action potential. No spontaneous synaptic events could be detected, suggesting their immature status even though most recorded cells displayed complex morphology and numerous cell processes.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction The long-term effects of the space environment on the central nervous system (CNS) still remain largely unknown. Human space travelers experience a unique environment that affects homeostasis and physiological adaptation. In particular, neuro-psycho-physiological health deserves special attention to ensure successful long-term space missions. In recent years, studies have started to address neural function and behavior in space. It has been reported that cerebellar, sensorimotor, and vestibular brain areas seem to be the most affected [1]. Microgravity reduces central venous and intracranial pressure; nonetheless, intracranial pressure is not reduced to the levels observed in the 90° degrees seated upright posture on Earth. Instead, the basal levels over 24 h in microgravity pressure in the brain are slightly higher than those on Earth, which may cause the remodeling of the eye in astronauts [2]. Moreover, a space flight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) has been recently described [3]. At the cellular level, it has been shown that microgravity induces apoptosis, alters the cytoskeleton, and affects the differentiation, proliferation, and metabolic status in different cells [4]. Nonetheless, only a few aspects regarding the sensitivity of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in microgravity have been reported. An interesting article from Silvano and collaborators [5] showed that murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) respond to simulated microgravity by the arrest of their cell cycle in S-phase and enhanced apoptosis. They also found that these changes were transient and upon return to normal gravity (1 G) these cells recovered their stemness and a normal cell cycle. The objective of the present study was to determine how the space environment influences human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NSCs, their biology, and their fate choice capability toward the neuronal phenotype.",

NSCs in Space Environment (SPC) Preserve Their “Stemness” and Proliferate This experiment was designed to ascertain the proliferation of NSCs solely while in microgravity. In order to elucidate if NSCs in “space microgravity” proliferate, we used the Type IV automated experiment insert from Kiwi (Airbus, Friedrichshafen, DE), allowing for a fresh medium change twice during space travel. The medium within which the cells traveled was replaced with fresh medium containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) two days after the cargo berth to the ISS. Therefore, BrdU incorporation took place during three days. NSC cultures were then arrested with the second stem cell medium and placed at 4 °C for further examination upon return to the laboratory (Scheme 1). Scheme 1. Open in a new tab Timeline 1: This diagram illustrates the times at which culture media changes took place while neural stem cells (NSCs) traveled and were in space in the automated hardware at 37 °C. Culture medium from Tank 1 containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was released into the cell chamber 2 days after docking. Three days later (at 5 days of having been in space), the second medium without BrdU was released and the units were stored at 4 °C. Proliferation while in space was ascertained during only 3 days.NSCs were seeded onto a mesh-cell carrier because cells adhere firmly to it and have a better resistance to vibrations and g-forces during take-off and re-entry to the atmosphere. This protocol was tested and verified during the science definition phase of the investigation following NASA’s requirements (Figure 1A). Figure 1. Open in a new tab (A) View of an automated Type IV Unit Kiwi (Airbus). (B) Tank 1 (green) contained NSCs, medium, and BrdU. At time (T) + 2 this medium was delivered to NSCs, at T + 5 medium from the second tank (blue) was delivered to arrest the cells and the units were placed at 4 °C. Two units containing 12 pieces of mesh carrier with cells were used for the “in space” proliferation study (C) Representative view of the mesh carrier on which tire NSCs were seeded. (D) Mesh with NSCs recovered from the devices post-flight. (E,F) Views of StaARS-1, which offers real-time command capability without the need for astronaut time.Upon return, the NSCs were recovered and post-fixed to perform triple immunofluorescence against two NSC markers as previously described [6]—polysialic acid (PSA) cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), known as PSA-NCAM, and the intermediate filament protein nestin, also known as a neural stem/progenitor cell marker—as well as BrdU for the detection of new DNA as a marker for cell proliferation (Figure 2). Figure 2. Human NSCs proliferate in space. Open in a new tab Triple immunofluorescence performed on cells adhered to the mesh-cell carrier. A to D show NSCs that proliferated while in space.

(C) Different intensities of BrdU-labeled cells, some organized in rows (arrowheads) or as dividing cells (arrows) as shown in the insets. (D) Most cells expressed BrdU and nestin and a subpopulation colocalized with PSA-NCAM. (E) PSA-NCAM was not expressed by the NSCr grown in 1 G (ground control). (F) Some cells expressed nestin at different intensities and others were negative. (G) Only some cells intensely expressed BrdU (arrowheads), while most had a faint expression (open arrowheads) or were negative. (H) The merged image shows that there were less cells in 1 G (ground controls) with respect to the cells sent to space. The BrdU incubation was for 72 h for all cells in automated units. (Bar = 50 μm). 3.2. Passive Experiments In order to ascertain the health status of the NSCs, we performed experiments using 8-well Petri dishes from Kiwi (Airbus). We have called these passive experiments, because tire cells remained within the same culture medium for 45 days (counting from handover to handover), having spent a total of 39.3 days in space from launch to splashdown of the dragon vehicle and the rest of the time in transit. Upon return, the cells were harvested from the hardware and seeded on poly-d-lysine. After the recovery period, the NSCs were seeded in Seahorse Bioscience XFplates (Agilent) to assess their cellular bioenergetic status. Tire oxygen consumption rare (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, a measure of glycolysis) were both higher in the NSCs exposed to the space environment as compared to the ground control cells, indicating a higher metabolic state (Figure 3). These measurements were performed one week after the NSCs returned to Earth. Therefore, one can infer that NSCs “remember” having been in microgravity. Alternatively, re-adaptation to 1 G may have prompted higher energetic needs. Figure 3. Open in a new tab SPC-NSCs and ground control NSCs were recovered from the passive hardware (A) and treated in the same manner. (B) Representative example of past-flight NSCs that continued to actively proliferate, as shown by the arrows. (C) After 39.3 days in space, NSCs display enhanced energy consumption.

The values are expressed as mean + SD. * The Student’s t test revealed that these differences were significant (p < 0.05). 3.3. Fate Choice After the recovery period, the NSCs were fed with neuronal specification medium (NSM) [6] in order to obtain neurons. Exposure to a space environment did not alter the NSCs potential to choose the neuronal fate. Interestingly, neuroblasts proliferated for more than 1 week after being in NSM before moving toward maturation. The timeline for neuronal specification is shown in Scheme 2. Scheme 2. Open in a new tab Timeline 2.Neuronal Specification. Upon their return to Earth, the cells were allowed to recover in NSC medium and standard conditions for 9 days. NSCs were introduced to neuronal specification medium (NSM) on Day 10. After 10 or 14 days of having been in NSM, we examined the electrophysiological properties of these cells. Electrophysiological recordings of SPC-NSC-derived neurons were obtained 10 days or 14 days after being in NSM using standard procedures, as detailed in our previous publication [8] Figure 4. Figure 4. SPC-NSCs gave rise to neurons after space flight.

The top right panel shows an NSC with bipolar morphology. The bottom left panel shows the same cell after patch and electrophysiological recordings (illustrated in A and B) were obtained. The bottom right panel shows another NSC after patching.A total of seven plates containing SPC-NSCs were used, and 16 cells were recorded in voltage and current clamp modes using a K-gluconate-based internal solution. First, passive membrane properties were determined in the voltage clamp mode. The cell membrane capacitance was relatively small (27.3 ± 1.9 pF, mean ± SEM), while the input resistance was high (553.4 ± 84.7 MΩ). The decay time constant was very fast (0.4 ± 0.05 ms). These properties are similar to those obtained from implanted NSCs [8]. After measuring passive membrane properties, the recording was switched to the current clamp mode. The mean resting membrane potential was relatively depolarized (−38.1 ± 1.8 mV), and upon injection of depolarizing current steps, most cells displayed a small-amplitude action potential, suggesting that these SPC-NSCs were in an immature state. In the gap free mode, we determined that spontaneous synaptic activity was not yet apparent.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion Here we have demonstrated that human NSCs proliferate while in space and that they remain as NSCs after 39.3 days unattended, in the same culture medium, and in space microgravity. Moreover, these cells also keep their ability to become young neurons in the appropriate conditions. Silvano’s team reported data supporting that simulated microgravity arrests cell proliferation, albeit in a transient manner, and they also found that these changes were not permanent as NSCs recovered their proliferative capacity when they were returned to normal gravity. The apparent contradiction between Silvano’s group reporting the arrest of proliferation date and this study may reside in the fact that the cells they used were from a different species (i.e., mouse vs. human). Additionally, their cells were kept in simulated microgravity far 3 to 5 days, as opposed to our NSCs, which were exposed to SPC microgravity tor 5 days at 37 °C and in BrdU for 3 days. Therefore, the reasons for the apparent contradiction may be due to the following: (1) the extent of the exposure to microgravity, which might be a determinant for the arrest of cell proliferation in Silvano’s study or (2) perhaps simulated microgravity differs from space microgravity with respect to the regulation of neural cells and their biological processes. Why a higher bioenergetic state is elicited by microgravity is not clear at the present time. The fact that we demonstrated that NSCs proliferate in space needs to be studied in more detail, as it might be that this phenomenon contributes to the visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP) exhibited by astronauts in space and upon their return to Earth [9]. Elucidating the origin of the increased energy needs by brain cells is crucial in order to design effective countermeasures for astronauts working onboard the International Space Station and for long-term space travel. Moreover, here we found that NSCs displayed an elevated energy metabolism; both oxygen consumption and glycolysis were higher than in the ground control counterparts, confirming our previous findings from work using “simulated microgravity”[10]. We have previously reported that simulated microgravity enhances mitochondrial function in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the CNS [11]. Two of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production, glucose and pyruvate, were decreased after just 3 days in microgravity, while lactate levels increased considerably indicating that OLs switched to anaerobic glycolysis in order to meet the energy demands elicited by microgravity [11]. It is possible that NSCs in space require more energy for proliferation as well as for maintaining homeostasis in an environment where, besides microgravity, there are other factors involved, such as radiation, moving while being packed and unpacked, and variation of g-forces occurring during launching and splashdown. Nonetheless, the cells appeared to be able to recover from such a journey and display their stemness when returned to Earth. Furthermore, as mentioned above, their membrane properties were similar to the NSCs grown in normal gravity.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions Neurobiology and the environment determine psychological and physiological fitness and behavior; hence, the maintenance of energy metabolism homeostasis is of paramount importance. The formulation of energy rich diets for astronauts, as well as providing an enriched environment, may contribute to reaching and maintaining the balance we all strive for—mens sana in corpore sano (a healthy mind in a healthy body). The results presented in this communication are also promising for humankind on Earth; neurodegenerative diseases frequently result from the loss of a specific cell population, and it was demonstrated that microgravity is an excellent strategy to increase neural cell numbers without the need of performing genetic manipulations or long-term treatments with mitogens.

Copyright notice ID: 8412175 MSID: MS1066938 PMID: 34484810 The publisher's version of this article is available at Appl Sci (Basel) Abstract Here we demonstrate that human neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate while in space and they express specific NSC markers after being in space. NSCs displayed both higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis than ground controls. These cells also kept their ability to become young neurons. Electrophysiological recordings of space NSC-derived neurons showed immature cell membrane properties characterized by small capacitance and very high input resistance. Current injections elicited only an incipient action potential. No spontaneous synaptic events could be detected, suggesting their immature status even though most recorded cells displayed complex morphology and numerous cell processes. Ascertaining the origin of the NSCs′ increased energy requirement is of the essence in order to design effective measures to minimize health risks associated with long-duration human spaceflight missions. Keywords: neural stem cells, pluripotency, space flight, microgravity, proliferation, neuronal specification, neurons, energetics, glycolysis1. Introduction The long-term effects of the space environment on the central nervous system (CNS) still remain largely unknown. Human space travelers experience a unique environment that affects homeostasis and physiological adaptation. In particular, neuro-psycho-physiological health deserves special attention to ensure successful long-term space missions. In recent years, studies have started to address neural function and behavior in space. It has been reported that cerebellar, sensorimotor, and vestibular brain areas seem to be the most affected [1]. Microgravity reduces central venous and intracranial pressure; nonetheless, intracranial pressure is not reduced to the levels observed in the 90° degrees seated upright posture on Earth. Instead, the basal levels over 24 h in microgravity pressure in the brain are slightly higher than those on Earth, which may cause the remodeling of the eye in astronauts [2]. Moreover, a space flight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) has been recently described [3]. At the cellular level, it has been shown that microgravity induces apoptosis, alters the cytoskeleton, and affects the differentiation, proliferation, and metabolic status in different cells [4]. Nonetheless, only a few aspects regarding the sensitivity of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in microgravity have been reported. An interesting article from Silvano and collaborators [5] showed that murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) respond to simulated microgravity by the arrest of their cell cycle in S-phase and enhanced apoptosis. They also found that these changes were transient and upon return to normal gravity (1 G) these cells recovered their stemness and a normal cell cycle. The objective of the present study was to determine how the space environment influences human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NSCs, their biology, and their fate choice capability toward the neuronal phenotype.2. Methodological Approach NSCs were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. The original cells, known as “CS83iCTR-33nxx” (such as skin cells or lymphoblasts), were “reprogrammed” and provided to us by the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center via a material transfer agreement. NSCs were seeded onto an 8-well Petri dish from Airbus-Kiwi (Friedrichshafen, DE), flown to the International Space Station (ISS), and installed in the Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 at 37 °C. The cells remained onboard the ISS for 39.3 days and then returned to Earth. After splashdown, transport to Long Beach airport, and delivery to UCLA, the NSCs were retrieved from the hardware, plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated flasks in our proprietary stem cell chemically defined medium (STM) [6,7], and allowed to recover from space flight. Subsequently, some of these NSCs were plated in neuronal specification medium (NSM).3. Results 3.1. NSCs in Space Environment (SPC) Preserve Their “Stemness” and Proliferate This experiment was designed to ascertain the proliferation of NSCs solely while in microgravity. In order to elucidate if NSCs in “space microgravity” proliferate, we used the Type IV automated experiment insert from Kiwi (Airbus, Friedrichshafen, DE), allowing for a fresh medium change twice during space travel. The medium within which the cells traveled was replaced with fresh medium containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) two days after the cargo berth to the ISS. Therefore, BrdU incorporation took place during three days. NSC cultures were then arrested with the second stem cell medium and placed at 4 °C for further examination upon return to the laboratory (Scheme 1). Scheme 1. Open in a new tab Timeline 1: This diagram illustrates the times at which culture media changes took place while neural stem cells (NSCs) traveled and were in space in the automated hardware at 37 °C. Culture medium from Tank 1 containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was released into the cell chamber 2 days after docking. Three days later (at 5 days of having been in space), the second medium without BrdU was released and the units were stored at 4 °C. Proliferation while in space was ascertained during only 3 days.NSCs were seeded onto a mesh-cell carrier because cells adhere firmly to it and have a better resistance to vibrations and g-forces during take-off and re-entry to the atmosphere. This protocol was tested and verified during the science definition phase of the investigation following NASA’s requirements (Figure 1A). Figure 1. Open in a new tab (A) View of an automated Type IV Unit Kiwi (Airbus). (B) Tank 1 (green) contained NSCs, medium, and BrdU. At time (T) + 2 this medium was delivered to NSCs, at T + 5 medium from the second tank (blue) was delivered to arrest the cells and the units were placed at 4 °C. Two units containing 12 pieces of mesh carrier with cells were used for the “in space” proliferation study (C) Representative view of the mesh carrier on which tire NSCs were seeded. (D) Mesh with NSCs recovered from the devices post-flight. (E,F) Views of StaARS-1, which offers real-time command capability without the need for astronaut time.Upon return, the NSCs were recovered and post-fixed to perform triple immunofluorescence against two NSC markers as previously described [6]—polysialic acid (PSA) cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), known as PSA-NCAM, and the intermediate filament protein nestin, also known as a neural stem/progenitor cell marker—as well as BrdU for the detection of new DNA as a marker for cell proliferation (Figure 2). Figure 2. Human NSCs proliferate in space. Open in a new tab Triple immunofluorescence performed on cells adhered to the mesh-cell carrier. A to D show NSCs that proliferated while in space. E to H show views of ground control NSCs. (A) The PSA-NCAM antibody labeled most but not all cells. (B) Cells expressing nestin as seen by the intensity of the marker in all NSCs. (C) Different intensities of BrdU-labeled cells, some organized in rows (arrowheads) or as dividing cells (arrows) as shown in the insets. (D) Most cells expressed BrdU and nestin and a subpopulation colocalized with PSA-NCAM. (E) PSA-NCAM was not expressed by the NSCr grown in 1 G (ground control). (F) Some cells expressed nestin at different intensities and others were negative. (G) Only some cells intensely expressed BrdU (arrowheads), while most had a faint expression (open arrowheads) or were negative. (H) The merged image shows that there were less cells in 1 G (ground controls) with respect to the cells sent to space. The BrdU incubation was for 72 h for all cells in automated units. (Bar = 50 μm).3.2. Passive Experiments In order to ascertain the health status of the NSCs, we performed experiments using 8-well Petri dishes from Kiwi (Airbus). We have called these passive experiments, because tire cells remained within the same culture medium for 45 days (counting from handover to handover), having spent a total of 39.3 days in space from launch to splashdown of the dragon vehicle and the rest of the time in transit. Upon return, the cells were harvested from the hardware and seeded on poly-d-lysine. After the recovery period, the NSCs were seeded in Seahorse Bioscience XFplates (Agilent) to assess their cellular bioenergetic status. Tire oxygen consumption rare (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, a measure of glycolysis) were both higher in the NSCs exposed to the space environment as compared to the ground control cells, indicating a higher metabolic state (Figure 3). These measurements were performed one week after the NSCs returned to Earth. Therefore, one can infer that NSCs “remember” having been in microgravity. Alternatively, re-adaptation to 1 G may have prompted higher energetic needs. Figure 3. Open in a new tab SPC-NSCs and ground control NSCs were recovered from the passive hardware (A) and treated in the same manner. (B) Representative example of past-flight NSCs that continued to actively proliferate, as shown by the arrows. (C) After 39.3 days in space, NSCs display enhanced energy consumption. OCR—oxygen consumption rate; ECAR—extracellular acidification rete; SPC-NSCs in the space environment. Each experiment consisted of n = 12. The values are expressed as mean + SD. * The Student’s t test revealed that these differences were significant (p < 0.05).3.3. Fate Choice After the recovery period, the NSCs were fed with neuronal specification medium (NSM) [6] in order to obtain neurons. Exposure to a space environment did not alter the NSCs potential to choose the neuronal fate. Interestingly, neuroblasts proliferated for more than 1 week after being in NSM before moving toward maturation. The timeline for neuronal specification is shown in Scheme 2. Scheme 2. Open in a new tab Timeline 2.Neuronal Specification. Upon their return to Earth, the cells were allowed to recover in NSC medium and standard conditions for 9 days. NSCs were introduced to neuronal specification medium (NSM) on Day 10. After 10 or 14 days of having been in NSM, we examined the electrophysiological properties of these cells. Electrophysiological recordings of SPC-NSC-derived neurons were obtained 10 days or 14 days after being in NSM using standard procedures, as detailed in our previous publication [8] Figure 4. Figure 4. SPC-NSCs gave rise to neurons after space flight. Open in a new tab (A)—(left panels) Whole-cell voltage clamp recording; using; K-gluconate in the internal solution: (top) step voltage commands from −80 to +10 mV elicited only minimal inward currents, whereas outward currents were predominant, and (bottom) graph represents an IV relationship, illustrating the presence of large outward currents starting at −30 mV. (B) When the recording was switched to current clamp mode, small step current pulses evoked large negative voltage deflections and only an incipient action potential with depolarizing current injections, demonstrating a neuronal phenotype, yet still very immature. (C) Infrared video-microscopy images of human neurons derived from NSCs flown into space. The top left panel shows a cluster of cells with multiple processes emanating from different cells. The top right panel shows an NSC with bipolar morphology. The bottom left panel shows the same cell after patch and electrophysiological recordings (illustrated in A and B) were obtained. The bottom right panel shows another NSC after patching.A total of seven plates containing SPC-NSCs were used, and 16 cells were recorded in voltage and current clamp modes using a K-gluconate-based internal solution. First, passive membrane properties were determined in the voltage clamp mode. The cell membrane capacitance was relatively small (27.3 ± 1.9 pF, mean ± SEM), while the input resistance was high (553.4 ± 84.7 MΩ). The decay time constant was very fast (0.4 ± 0.05 ms). These properties are similar to those obtained from implanted NSCs [8]. After measuring passive membrane properties, the recording was switched to the current clamp mode. The mean resting membrane potential was relatively depolarized (−38.1 ± 1.8 mV), and upon injection of depolarizing current steps, most cells displayed a small-amplitude action potential, suggesting that these SPC-NSCs were in an immature state. In the gap free mode, we determined that spontaneous synaptic activity was not yet apparent.4. Discussion Here we have demonstrated that human NSCs proliferate while in space and that they remain as NSCs after 39.3 days unattended, in the same culture medium, and in space microgravity. Moreover, these cells also keep their ability to become young neurons in the appropriate conditions. Silvano’s team reported data supporting that simulated microgravity arrests cell proliferation, albeit in a transient manner, and they also found that these changes were not permanent as NSCs recovered their proliferative capacity when they were returned to normal gravity. The apparent contradiction between Silvano’s group reporting the arrest of proliferation date and this study may reside in the fact that the cells they used were from a different species (i.e., mouse vs. human). Additionally, their cells were kept in simulated microgravity far 3 to 5 days, as opposed to our NSCs, which were exposed to SPC microgravity tor 5 days at 37 °C and in BrdU for 3 days. Therefore, the reasons for the apparent contradiction may be due to the following: (1) the extent of the exposure to microgravity, which might be a determinant for the arrest of cell proliferation in Silvano’s study or (2) perhaps simulated microgravity differs from space microgravity with respect to the regulation of neural cells and their biological processes. Why a higher bioenergetic state is elicited by microgravity is not clear at the present time. The fact that we demonstrated that NSCs proliferate in space needs to be studied in more detail, as it might be that this phenomenon contributes to the visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP) exhibited by astronauts in space and upon their return to Earth [9]. Elucidating the origin of the increased energy needs by brain cells is crucial in order to design effective countermeasures for astronauts working onboard the International Space Station and for long-term space travel. Moreover, here we found that NSCs displayed an elevated energy metabolism; both oxygen consumption and glycolysis were higher than in the ground control counterparts, confirming our previous findings from work using “simulated microgravity”[10]. We have previously reported that simulated microgravity enhances mitochondrial function in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the CNS [11]. Two of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production, glucose and pyruvate, were decreased after just 3 days in microgravity, while lactate levels increased considerably indicating that OLs switched to anaerobic glycolysis in order to meet the energy demands elicited by microgravity [11]. It is possible that NSCs in space require more energy for proliferation as well as for maintaining homeostasis in an environment where, besides microgravity, there are other factors involved, such as radiation, moving while being packed and unpacked, and variation of g-forces occurring during launching and splashdown. Nonetheless, the cells appeared to be able to recover from such a journey and display their stemness when returned to Earth. Furthermore, as mentioned above, their membrane properties were similar to the NSCs grown in normal gravity.5. Conclusions Neurobiology and the environment determine psychological and physiological fitness and behavior; hence, the maintenance of energy metabolism homeostasis is of paramount importance. The formulation of energy rich diets for astronauts, as well as providing an enriched environment, may contribute to reaching and maintaining the balance we all strive for—mens sana in corpore sano (a healthy mind in a healthy body). The results presented in this communication are also promising for humankind on Earth; neurodegenerative diseases frequently result from the loss of a specific cell population, and it was demonstrated that microgravity is an excellent strategy to increase neural cell numbers without the need of performing genetic manipulations or long-term treatments with mitogens. It is believed that incorporating microgravity into projects of a translational nature will lead the scientific community one step closer toward translational research to address neurodegeneration and the recovery of CNS function.Featured Application: Understanding how neural stem cells behave in the microgravity environment in space will help us develop suitable countermeasures to protect astronauts from problems with intracranial hypertension during and after long-term space travel. Studying the effects of microgravity on the regulation of neural cell proliferation and their commitment to a specific lineage (i.e., neurons) will offer benefits to patients on Earth for cell replacement therapies using self-donor cells to address neurodegenerative and developmental disorders and diseases, such as cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis.Acknowledgments: We are grateful to Mark Mobilia and the entire Zeiss team, Amy Rowat for support with the microscope system.

Error in Figure The authors wish to make the following corrections to Figure 10 of this paper [1]: In the original publication, there is a mistake in the bar graph of Figure 10 as published. At the moment of uploading the manuscript, we chose the wrong legend version. It should say Tf for transferrin (instead of Fer for ferritin, as published). The figure as is makes no sense because this section is about the two specific markers Tf and GPDH. Swapping the figure will correct the information without altering the data, contents or caption. The text and caption for the entire figure discuss transferrin (Tf) and the correct graph is pasted below. Figure 10. Open in a new tab Views of GC-OLPs (A–C) or SPC-OLPs (D–F) two weeks after being seeded. (A) Most GC-OLPs expressed Tf in their cytoplasm (inset and arrow). (B) They also co-expressed GPDH. (C) Merged view of both markers that colocalized. (D) Tf was expressed by all cells in their nuclei rather than the cytoplasm. (E) Most of these cells were weakly labeled for GPDH, and only those that had undergone karyokinesis or in the process of cytokinesis displayed nuclear GPDH expression. (F) Merged view of both markers. (G) This bar graph shows the percentage of the markers expressed alone or co-expressed by OLPs. In the GC group, 34% co-expressed both OL markers. Only 51% expressed transferrin alone, and 41% expressed GPDH only. In the case of SPC-OLPs, only 58% co-expressed Tf in the nucleus and cytoplasmic GPDH, although the GPDH expression was faint and it colocalized in the nucleus only in cells that had undergone karyokinesis and those that appeared to be undergoing cytokinesis. Only 2.2% of these OLPs expressed GPDH alone, indicative of their immature stage with respect to GC cells. The data are shown both in cell numbers and percentages. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA, in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (p < 0.01). An orthogonal image of the localization of Tf is shown in Supplemental Figure S4.The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-µG resulted in enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-µG as well as secretome exposure compared to ground control (1G) NSCs. These findings provide new insights into the potential health implications of space travel and have far-reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms leading to the deleterious effects of long-term space travel as well as potential carcinogenic susceptibility. Knowledge of these mechanisms could help to develop preventive or corrective measures for successful long-term SPC-µG exposure.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction To determine the health risks associated with long-term space travel, it is essential to consider the effects of space microgravity (SPC-µG) on the brain. It is well-established that astronauts oftentimes experience adverse effects following a visit to outer space including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-recognized spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1]. Potential risk factors as well as limitations to lengthy space missions and stays at the International Space Station (ISS) are posed by SANS, among other difficulties that astronauts face due to the gravitational differences in space. This is particularly important because issues such as SANS can be experienced after as little as 34 days, and unusual pathologic neuro-ophthalmic findings have been shown after both short- and long-term space travel [2]. Many studies on the use of microgravity have been performed using an array of cells both committed to a specific phenotype depending on the organ of study as well as uncommitted cells known as stem cells. The origin of stem cells includes murine and human origin. Among these are adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), and organ-specific stem cells [3]. Recent publications have described changes in stem cells when exposed to simulated or space microgravity. Nonetheless, there is limited information in what concerns neural stem cells. Prior research looking at the effects of microgravity on neural stem cells has primarily been conducted with the use of simulated microgravity (sim-µG). Sim-µG studies use machines that are able to simulate low gravity conditions such as the Mitsubishi 3D-Clinostat [4]. The use of different microgravity platforms with application on stem cells and differentiated cells has recently been reviewed [3]. Only a few studies have shown the effect of sim-µG or SPC-µG specifically on neural stem cells. In this regard, Silvano and collaborators have shown that murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) respond to sim-µG by the arrest of their cell cycle in the S-phase with a concomitant increase in apoptosis. These changes occurred in a transient manner because upon return to 1G (Earth’s gravity), the authors described that the cells recovered their stemness and a normal cell cycle [5]. We have previously reported a result that appears to contradict Silvano et al.’s findings, where we found that NSCs in sim-µG proliferated more and displayed a smaller diameter than 1G grown NSCs [6]. A recent discovery that spaceflight upregulated proliferation and survival genes in neural crest derived stem cells while the random positioning machine upregulated differentiation and inflammation genes emphasized the uniqueness of space flight conditions when compared to Earth controls [7]. Our current research avoids the use of sim-µG and moves directly to the source of microgravity -- outer space. SPC-µG has demonstrated more pronounced effects of certain phenomena when compared to sim-µG [8]. Although radiation and other environmental differences cannot be excluded as contributing factors, the findings are similar between sim-µG and SPC-µG, save for the difference in degree [8]. The results of the current study provide outcomes not previously reported in sim-µG studies, with the additional benefit of added relevance to the astronauts’ health. Here, four conditions of NSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) are considered. In the ground control condition (1G), NSCs did not experience any SPC-µG, although other cellular conditions were the same as the experimental groups (more details on the procedure are available in Section 2). The second group consisted of 1G naïve sister cells of the space-flown NSCs that were treated with the secretome, which is our term for the secreted medium from space-flown cells. Finally, we also looked at two groups of NSCs following space flight, with the first group captured one week post-flight, and the final group captured at two weeks post-flight. Due to the nature of the study looking at abnormalities in cell division, it is important to understand the intricacies of the cell cycle and the potential stage(s) for error. In the case of one of the abnormalities, we deemed incomplete cell division (ICD) as failed cytokinesis. Cytokinesis is a highly complex, regulated process that requires an extensive number of cellular processes, proteins, and signaling factors to function properly. Cytokinetic failure can occur due to defects in any of its four stages, which include positioning of the division plane, ingression of the cleavage furrow, formation of the midbody, and abscission [9]. Cytokinetic failure following the division of the cell nucleus, or karyokinesis, can result in a tetraploid cell with double nuclei and four copies of each chromosome rather than the expected two. For some cells of the human body such as in the heart or liver, tetraploidy is a normal process [9]. However, in many cases, tetraploidy can be a sign of a deleterious abnormality such as a tumor precursor [10]. Previous work in the literature has confirmed that embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells behave similarly in terms of cell cycle components. Embryonic stem cell pluripotency is maintained through unique and highly specific signaling. These cells enter the S phase more rapidly with a shortened G1 due to impaired or atypical checkpoint control in embryonic stem cells and unusual activation patterns [11]. Our previous findings showed that NSCs proliferate at a higher rate while in space as well as up to 72 h following space flight, irrespective of flight duration [2,4]. We also showed that changes in the cell diameter occurred post-flight, with 81% of NSCs exhibiting a diameter of 10 µm or higher following space flight compared to 49.2% of the control NSCs [4]. While the undifferentiated NSCs in adult human brain areas such as the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus remain quiescent under normal circumstances, the environment of SPC-µG exposure is likely to alter the expected behavior of these cells [12]. The changes described above including increased proliferation and enlarged cell diameter [13] could contribute to symptoms of SANS that astronauts experience post-flight such as intracranial hypertension. Here, in addition to the aforementioned differences, we noticed that some SPC-µG NSCs appeared to have difficulties with the completion of cytokinesis with enough frequency to be of interest for further investigation. The current study takes a closer look at proliferation abnormalities in single cell division. Throughout this paper, the term ICD refers to an ultimate failure of cytokinesis, regardless of whether karyokinesis has occurred, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) refers to the appearance of more than two daughter cells as would be typical for a single cell division following cytokinesis. The term abnormal cell division (ACD) refers to either phenomena, ICD and/or MDCD. We investigated the hypothesis that, compared to 1G NSCs, there are significantly increased instances of ICD, MDCD, and ACD following exposure to SPC-µG. We also hypothesized that the space-produced secretome would have a similar effect on naïve NSCs.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Space Flight Induced pluripotent human neural stem cells known as cell line “CS83iCTR-33n21” derived from skin fibroblasts were used for the space flight. The cells were reprogrammed by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center through a material transfer agreement and subsequently induced using the STM medium. For further details regarding the steps of the space flight protocol, see our previous publications as well as Figure 8 below [3]. Both space-flown and ground control cells underwent the same flight preparation procedures, and all cells were grown in hardware and pre-seeded onto mesh carriers in passive units. For this study, both gravity conditions used hardware from Yuri through the payload developer Space Technology and Advanced Research System (STaARS). We used the facility known as the STaARS-EF-1 platform on board the ISS, with flight-tested growth and observation chambers shown in Figure 8. The hardware-units containing the experiment electrically and mechanically interfaced through a clip-in-place mechanism onto the STaARS EF-1. Figure 8. Open in a new tab NSCs were seeded on floating mesh carriers that promote strong cell adhesion. Four cell carriers of 2 × 2 mm were placed in each well pre-launch. Cells flew onboard Space X-16, spent a total of 39.6 days in space at the ISS, 248 m (400 km) above the Earth’s surface. Cells were transferred to Long Beach (CA, USA) Airport after splashdown and brought to the UCLA laboratory at 37 °C. Upon arrival, cells were seeded into flasks or flaskettes and allowed to recover for six hours in the incubator and subsequently placed in the imaging system (Adapted from Shaka et al., 2021 [13]).SPC-µG exposure: NSCs were flown aboard SpaceX-16 to the ISS and remained onboard the ISS for 39.6 days before returning to Earth, as shown in Figure 8. The cell chambers contained 2 × 2 mm mesh carriers and the culture medium was equilibrated overnight at 5% CO2 in the incubator where cells were maintained before the flight. Upon arrival, cells were seeded into flasks or flaskettes and allowed to recover for six hours in the incubator and subsequently placed in the imaging system. (Figure modified from Shaka et al., 2021 [13]). A chart defining the abnormal cell division terminology is also shown (Figure 9). Figure 9. Open in a new tab An elaboration upon the specific types of abnormal cell division we defined for the scope of this project. The numbers of abnormally dividing cells were counted by hand through the use of Zeiss ZEN Blue Microscopy software 2020. 4.2. Secretome Collection and Naïve NSC Cell Treatment The conditioned medium secreted by space-flown cells, otherwise known as secretome, was collected from the cell chambers separately from the cells. The samples were placed in numbered tubes and subsequently frozen at −80 °C. Environmental parameters and the experimental timeline for the 1G NSCs were based on that of the ISS in order to simulate the conditions of the space flight. Upon its recovery, we mixed two parts of culture medium per one part of straight secretome to treat naïve NSCs grown in 1G cells. The secretome was used straight (as it was obtained from the devices); no concentration was necessary to see the effects shown in this paper. The 1G naïve sister cells of the space-flown cells were first imaged with basal stem cell medium. The medium was switched to fresh medium containing secretome at 44.5 h into the time-lapse video. 4.3. Time-Lapse Microscopy Analysis Asynchronous experiments were performed following spaceflight on Earth for the study of cell proliferation. The time-lapse microscopy imaging was conducted using the ZEISS Axio Observer 7 fully motorized inverted research microscope equipped with Definite Focus 2, ZEISS Axiocam 506 monochrome camera with ZEISS ZEN software, and ZEISS Full Incubation XL chamber (Oberkochen, Germany) for temperature and CO2 control with a motorized scanning stage. The microscope collected images every 15 min in seven different XYZ positions for a duration of about 72 h for each cell condition. The time-lapse data were analyzed frame-by-frame by hand to scan for instances of ACD including ICD and MDCD with the ZEN Blue 3.5 program. All data were charted in Microsoft Excel for statistical analysis. 4.4. Immunofluorescence and Nuclear Staining Double immunofluorescence using established markers for NSCs was performed with the following antibodies used at a 1:100 dilution of nestin (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and tubulin. NucBlue™, (Gibco|Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was also used for staining the nuclei of the NSCs (Figure 10). Immunofluorescence procedures included plating cells onto either coated plastic 8-well chambers (Nunc 177445), or poly-d-lysine coated glass coverslips. To visualize the markers, the secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit IgG Texas Red (JIR) and goat anti-mouse IgG FITC (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan). Figure 10.

    "results": "2. Results 2.1. Time-Lapse Microscopy Analysis 2.1.1. A Subpopulation of NSCs Back from Space Displayed Incomplete Divisions Observations of SPC-exposed NSCs revealed that although these cells proliferated more than their ground control counterparts, a sub-population of them attempted to divide unsuccessfully. These abnormally dividing cells displayed two cell bodies, yet ultimately did not achieve complete cell division into two daughter cells, instead remaining as a larger cell and preserving that state for the rest of the time-lapse imaging, as shown in Figure 1. In terms of the differences between the 1G and SPC-µG exposed NSCs, Figure 1A–I illustrates an example of incomplete cytokinesis. The average numbers (bar graph) and percentages (pie graphs) show the raw numbers and proportion of cells involved in ICDs throughout the time-lapse videos. There was an upward trend observed among the groups, with the NSCs two weeks after SPC-µG exposure showing the highest number of instances of ICD. For the control group, the average total number of cells was 1606 with an average ratio of 5.67 ICDs per 1606 cells. For the SPC–µG exposed NSCs, there were on average 8.5 ICDs per 1370 NSCs one week after spaceflight, and 11 ICDs per 903 cells across the different scenes analyzed two weeks post-flight. Figure 1. Open in a new tab An example from time-lapse microscopy of SPC-NSCs 1 week (A–F) and 2 weeks after space flight. One week after returning to Earth, the cells had completely recovered from their round trip to space. They were healthy, displaying cell processes, and were proliferative. (A) Nonetheless, a subpopulation appeared to have acquired a larger size (arrow) when observed under phase-contrast microscopy. (B) When time-lapse images were examined, we found that some cells had started the proliferation process (i.e., the cells appeared to be dividing (arrows)). (C,D) The cell appeared to have reached the full division process. (E) Instead of two daughter cells, they had fused together, (F) remaining that way for the rest of the time the cells were imaged. This event lasted 2.5 h (arrowheads show the cells of interest). (G,H), another example of NSCs two weeks post-flight exhibiting ICD occurring at 102.25 h into time-lapse (shown in part H) and no visible cytokinesis, with the NSC returning to one cell by 105.25 h (shown in part I). Cell(s) of interest are indicated by the yellow arrow(s). The cells finally merged and remained that way until the end of the experiment. Scale bar = 50 µm. (J) Quantitative data showing that more instances of ICDs were seen in the SPC-exposed NSCs. The average number of cells that exhibited ICD during the 50 h that NSCs were under observation via time-lapse microscopy. The purple bar denotes ground control (1G) NSCs. The green bar represents SPC-NSCs one week after returning from the ISS. The orange bar denotes NSCs two weeks after space flight. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant; and the Chi-square test (for percentages) demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = 0.045). Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for all three conditions of NSCs shown. (K) This chart represents the average percentage of incomplete division across groups where normal NSCs that remained on Earth and NSCs one week after returning from space did show very similar cell numbers and the same percentage, while two weeks after space flight, the number of ICD cases accounted for 58%.However, because the total number of cells differed among the three conditions, we also estimated the relative proportions of ICDs. This was calculated by dividing the number of ICDs by the total number of cells present at the exact middle of each time-lapse video. The middle frame represented an approximate mean between the number of cells present at the start of the time-lapse compared with the number of cells present at the end of the video after proliferation had occurred. When comparing the different proportions, the Chi-square test demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = 0.045) (Figure 1K).2.1.2. A Subpopulation of SPC-NSCs Displayed Multi-Daughter Cell Divisions In addition to ICD, we found multi-daughter cell division, which was also examined. An example of multi-daughter cell division where one cell gave rise to three cells at the end of cytokinesis is shown in Figure 2A–C. The average number of cells exhibiting MDCD one week and two weeks after space flight and the percentage of MDCD instances are shown (Figure 2D,E). Figure 2. Open in a new tab An example from time-lapse microscopy of SPC-µG exposed NSCs exhibiting MDCD 2 weeks post-flight. (A) Cells prior to dividing. (B) Three hours later, at 31.33 h, there were three cells visible. (C) These three daughter cells survived for the duration of the experiment and within 50 min, they had developed cell processes. The yellow arrow in all three images points to the mother cell. Quantitative data where NSCs flown to space displayed more instances of MDCDs were seen one week post-space flight, and even more NSCs presented this behavior. (D) The bar graph on the left, shows the average number of cells that exhibited MDCD during the 50 h that the NSCs were under observation via time-lapse microscopy. The green bar denotes ground control (1G) NSCs. The blue bar represents SPC-NSCs one week after returning from the ISS. The yellow bar denotes NSCs two weeks after space flight. (E) Results shown as percentage. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001 and the Chi-square test (for percentages) demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = 0.045). Please also see MP41 in the Supplementary Materials.As both ICD and MDCD (triple divisions) can be considered within the realm of ACDs, we also compared the total number of ACDs among the three conditions. Although the averages differed between the groups in terms of MDCDs, the sum of ICDs and MDCDs proved statistically significant. (Figure 3). Figure 3. Open in a new tab The bar graph on the left depicts the total number of cells abnormally divided (exhibiting either ICD or MDCD) across four scenes of time-lapse microscopy for each of the three groups. The experimental group of SPC-µG exposed NSCs 2 weeks post-flight displayed a statistically significantly greater amount of ACD compared to the control group and the one week post-flight SPC-flown NSCs (p = 0.0048 for 1G vs. SPC 2 weeks PF; p = 0.0052 for SPC 1 week PF vs. SPC 2 weeks PF). The pie graph shows the difference in the proportion of ICD between the 1G control NSCs (orange), SPC-µG exposed NSCs one week post-flight (brown), and SPC-µG exposed NSCs two weeks post-flight (salmon). NSCs two weeks following space flight displayed a significantly increased frequency of ICD. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant; and the Chi-square test (for percentages) results were significant with p = 0.0135. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition. 2.2. Effects of the Secretome on Naïve NSCs Cell Divisions To ascertain if these changes had been exerted directly on the cells during space flight, we examined if there were molecules that would have been secreted by NSCs under the influence of microgravity. For this experiment we seeded the cells and followed them for 72 h, time at which we added the secretome to the cells in a 2:1 ratio V/V. We found that the secretome produced similar results in terms of incomplete cytokinesis suggesting that secreted molecules rather than mechanical forces are responsible for these effects (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Average number of cells that exhibited ICD during the 70 to 130 h that NSCs were under observation via time-lapse microscopy. The pink bar denotes naïve NSCs with no exposure to SPC-µG or secretome. The turquoise blue bar denotes naïve 1G NSCs following the addition of secretome (p = 0.037). The pie chart shows the ratio of incomplete division events compared to the total number of cells in the time-lapse for each condition. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition. Chi-square test (for percentages) results were significant with p = 0.001. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition. See also MP42 in the Supplementary Materials.We examined the question of whether or not the secretome would also produce similar effects on naïve NSCs that had never flown to space in terms of MDCD. An example of MDCD in the naïve NSCs treated with secretome is shown (Figure 5A–C), where one cell divides into three daughter cells and the three cells continue to survive and move around for the duration of the time-lapse. Figure 5. Open in a new tab This example from the time-lapse microscopy of naïve 1G NSCs following treatment with SPC-µG NSCs secretome shows: (A) A NSC MDCD; (B) The cell gives rise to two daughter cells: (C) The cells had successfully completed cytokinesis with three cells visible beginning at 60 h and remaining as three cells for the duration of the video. The arrow points to the mother cell and the arrowheads designate the daughter cells. (D) The bar graph on the left depicts the total number of cells displaying MDCD across four scenes of time-lapse microscopy for each of the three groups. The secretome produced by NSCs while in space increased the number of triple cell divisions although these differences were not significant. (E) The pie graph shows the difference in the proportion of MDCD between the 1G control NSCs. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons and the Chi-square test (for percentages) results were not significant. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition.While looking at the raw numbers can provide useful information, it is important to consider that the total number of visible cells as filmed through time-lapse microscopy differs for each scene. Therefore, the pie charts in Figure 1 and Figure 3 take this into account in order to display the fraction of total cells that exhibited ICD or ACD. There was a significantly greater proportion of ICDs found in the experimental group of NSCs two weeks post-flight (1.22%) compared to the other groups, with the 1G naïve NSCs at 0.35% and the NSCs one week post-flight exhibiting 0.62% ICD. Concerning the sum of ICD and MDCD, there was also a significantly greater proportion of ACDs found in the SPC-µG exposed NSCs two weeks post-flight (1.68%). The 1G naïve NSCs exhibited ACD at a frequency of 0.58%, the same cells after the addition of secretome exhibited ACD 0.98% of the time, and the SPC-µG exposed NSCs one week post-flight had a percentage of 0.56% the influence of microgravity. In addition to ICD, the raw numbers of cells involved in either ICD or MDCD, deemed ACDs, were also graphed (Figure 6). For the control group, the average total number of cells was 1606 with an average ratio of 9.33 ACDs per 1606 cells. After the medium was switched to incorporate secretome, this value changed drastically, with an average of 15.67 ACDs per 1606 cells. For the SPC–µG exposed NSCs, there were on average 7.63 ACDs per 1370 NSCs one week after spaceflight, while there were on average 15.17 ICDs per 903 cells across the different scenes analyzed two weeks post-flight (Figure 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab The bars on the graph represent the total number of NSCs abnormally divided (exhibiting either ICD or MDCD) for naïve NSCs, SPC-NSCs, and naïve NSCs treated with SPC-NSC secretome. Data were obtained from four scenes of time-lapse microscopy for each of the four groups. The experimental group of SPC-µG exposed NSCs 2 weeks post-flight (PF) displayed a statistically significantly greater amount of ACD compared to the control group and the one week post-flight SPC-flown NSCs (p = 0.0048 for 1G vs. SPC 2 weeks PF; p = 0.0052 for SPC 1 week PF vs. SPC 2 weeks PF). Naïve-NSCs results were also significantly different with respect to the naïve (non-treated) NSCs. The pie chart shows the ratio of abnormally divided cells compared to the total number of cells in the time-lapse for each condition. NSCs two weeks following space flight displayed a significantly increased frequency of ACD. Moreover, a significant difference was also found in naïve-NSCs exposed to SPC-secretome. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 was defined as statistically significant; the Chi-square test (for percentages) demonstrated that the results were significant with p = 0.001. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition.From these data, it is clear that there were statistically significant differences in the amount of ACD as well as ICD alone following cellular exposure to SPC-µG, particularly when looking at NSCs two weeks following SPC-µG exposure. While not always statistically significant, there are also more instances of both ICD and ACD following the addition of secretome to the NSCs. 2.3. Immunofluorescence Immunocytochemistry was performed on both the control and experimental groups of NSCs. These cells were examined for the expression of NSC markers in order to confirm lineage. The normal morphology and physiology of NSCs are partially dependent on the cytoskeleton, which is composed of intermediate filaments, actin, and microtubules. One of the proteins detected by immuno-fluorescence was neuroepithelial stem cell protein (nestin). Nestin expression was of interest because as a type VI intermediate filament (IF) protein, nestin is primarily expressed in dividing NSCs. Potential differences in nestin expression between the control and experimental NSCs allows for a deeper examination of morphological differences that may be present after exposure to SPC-µG or secretome. In addition to nestin, tubulin expression was also examined. As a major component protein essential for microtubule formation, tubulin expression is also bound to reveal information regarding the cell cytoskeleton. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that tubulin is expressed in nestin-positive cells, which aids in testing the validity of our work. The results of the immunofluorescence are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Representative views displaying the immunocytochemical distribution of nestin (red) and tubulin beta II (green). (A) Nestin expression in the 1G control NSCs is positive, with nuclei clearly visible. (B) Tubulin expression in 1G NSCs is also positive. (C) SPC–µG exposed NSCs intensely expressed nestin in most cells. (D) Tubulin was faintly expressed in some SPC–µG exposed NSCs but most cells were negative.",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion It is well-accepted that normal mammalian cell division occurs by the mother cell giving rise to two daughter cells. This is the result of enhanced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CDK–cyclin complexes to ensure well-defined transitions through cell cycle stages [13]. Control checkpoints of the cell cycle act as regulators that activate when they detect a “danger” or abnormal situations such as defects in DNA replication or chromosome segregation. Therefore, loss of cell cycle regulation can lead to cancer [14]. We have previously reported a robust enhancement of NSC proliferative potential as well as an increased number of NSCs of larger size [8], a phenomenon also known as hypertrophy, which may occur in response to injury. For example, hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes implicates changes in the gene expression profile where “embryonic genes” reactivate, modifying the contractile protein structure and density of hormone receptors [14]. “Physiologic hypertrophy” is considered adaptive with the goal to improve cell and organ function. Pathologic hypertrophy may be an adaptive response at the beginning, but often results in changes in gene expression that can exacerbate dysfunction and may lead to cancer. Here, we demonstrated that features associated with cancer of the CNS appear to have been accentuated on NSCs by space flight. Through this study, we discovered that a subset of NSCs flown to space displayed hyperplasia, which is characterized by an increased number of daughter cells. Although the percentage of cells showing three or more daughter cells was small, it was statistically significant. It has previously been shown that when simulating the three-dimensional mechanical confinement found in the in vivo milieu, cancer HeLa cells often divided into three or even five daughter cells [15]. Moreover, higher confinement and stiffness gave rise to increased asymmetry and multi-daughter division [15]. In our case, we did not use confinement nor cancerous cells. However, we found an increased number of instances of abnormal division between one and two weeks post-space flight. We believe that the mechanical forces exerted on NSCs after space flight were those from terrestrial gravity (1G), which makes cells adhere stronger to the plastic substratum that is more rigid than the mesh carrier on which cells grew and flew back and forth to space/Earth. Nonetheless, the results from the naïve NSCs treated with secretome demonstrate that the space environment induces the production and secretion of soluble factors that exert the same behavior on normal self-renewing cells (i.e., naïve NSCs), resulting in ACD without changing the mechanical forces. In terms of MDCD, it is possible that it had resulted as a compensatory mechanism from a stem cell having two or three nuclei trying to remedy multi-nucleated cells by giving three daughter cells in the following generation. Based on our results, SPC-µG has cellular effects that increase instances of abnormalities in single cell division, particularly when considering ICD and MDCD. The same trend was observed following the addition of the secretome from SPC-NSCs to naïve-NSCs. Thus, elucidation of the molecules that may be responsible for the observed effects is of the essence. Therefore, we analyzed the secretome profile of NSCs flown to space and found that the most enriched molecule was the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), produced by these NSCs while in space [16]. Being a matricellular protein, SPARC’s main function is to modulate cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions and it is mainly expressed in the bone and endothelial cells [17,18]. Nonetheless, it is also highly expressed during embryonic life in notochord, chondrocytes, and other tissues of the embryonic skeleton functioning as a remodeling protein [19], and it is also expressed in macrophages at injury sites [20,21,22]. It has been postulated that SPARC may also play a role in different types of cancer, and in some cases, it has promoted the inhibition of breast cancer [23]; SPARC is expressed in grade 3 tumors, but other studies have shown that higher expression of SPARC correlated with decreased metastasis [24]. There is a compilation of studies on the effects of different levels of SPARC expression in tumors and neighboring cells where in some cases SPARC is deleterious and in other types of cancer, it inhibits proliferation and metastasis [19]. For example, a high expression of SPARC has been reported in advanced, metastatic melanoma [25]. In brain gliomas, SPARC is detrimental in that it promotes the survival and invasion of glioma cells [19]. High levels of purified SPARC act as an inhibitor of both neuroblastoma growth and angiogenesis [26,27]. SPARC is considered by some as a cancer therapeutic agent due to its ability to inhibit proliferation and enhance apoptosis in the ovary, colorectum, pancreas, neuroblastoma, and leukemia [19]. However, in the case of neural cells, it is deleterious. Although our NSCs were not tumor derived, it is possible that NSCs in space display this novel vulnerability that might be triggered and/or enhanced to increase the frequency of abnormal cell division as a function of time. This phenomenon is similar to the progression of a benign tumor into a malignant tumor, and it could be lethal, endangering the space mission. Since our study was performed on Earth’s gravity, where naïve NSCs were not exposed to the mechanical changes between microgravity and 1G, we believe that the secretome produced by SPC-NSCs holds the key for the modulation or downregulation of the abnormal cellular behaviors ICD and MDCD observed. Having previously seen enhanced proliferation and hypertrophy [8], and in the current study hyperplasia, in our NSCs post-flight, it is easy to speculate that SPARC under different gravity conditions such as on Mars or our Moon will be differentially regulated according to the G-force the cells are subjected to. Therefore, modulation of SPARC’s gene expression may lead us to harness the countermeasures necessary to protect the CNS of the astronauts from neurodegeneration and cancer during and after space flight. These attributes, together with the increase in abnormal cell division, most likely contribute to SANS and other health complications during or following space flight. Stem cells are unique in that they are the only human cell type with the ability to self-renew and produce an unlimited quantity of daughter cells [19]. Therefore, any errors during cell division can lead to the promotion of cancer. Endogenous damage to DNA as well as pathological and environmental factors can lead to such cancer-promoting errors. Chemical and physical signals acting upon stem cells can impact the life and death of the cell as well as their differentiation process. Therefore, the risk of cancer is heavily influenced by extrinsic factors known as the ‘stem cell environment’ or niche [19,20]. As opposed to directly altering DNA, non-genotoxic agents are able to increase the risk of cancer through increasing cell proliferation [21]. The changes observed during cell division noted in this paper have features of malignant stem cells, mimicking the carcinogenic changes hypothesized to lead to cancers [22]. It is known that non-conventional mitosis events lead to tumor progression. Mechanosensing is important for proper cell physiology and tissue homeostasis. Here, we propose that SPARC is a gravity-sensor or gravitometer protein secreted by NSCs in response to an environmental change that is gravity (G). Thus, SPARC’s upregulation by microgravity serves as a marker for us to start designing strategies to regulate this gene, hence regulate proliferation and other cues altered by µG. A factor not studied in our cells was space radiation, which may also play a role in these changes and more work is needed to ascertain its net contribution to potential brain cancer produced by space missions. We have to acknowledge an important limitation of our current study on abnormalities in stem cell division after exposure to microgravity. A detailed cell cycle analysis with correlation to cytokinesis should be conducted before drawing any conclusions about when during the cell cycle abnormalities are likely to occur. As all the cells returning from space were used for the current experiments, and also due to funding constraints, those studies will be considered as a top priority in the future. Another future direction that this research could explore is a more detailed and high-definition exploration into the daughter cells resulting from MDCD as well as the cells following ICD. Neither the proposal nor funding for this project included the study of the mechanical effects of microgravity on our cells. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies on the mechanical properties of non-cancerous NSCs in microgravity and after microgravity exposure. It is known that the cell cytoskeleton has a significant role in adapting cells to mechanical influences such as those caused by gravity changes. In fact, it has been shown that several hours or days of µg exposure leads to significant cytoskeletal changes in the form of microfilament thinning and redistribution [28]. Aneuploidy, which is defined as the loss or gain of one or more chromosomes from a diploid gene, is a sign of genomic instability in human cancer cells. Aneuploidy likely represents an early significant event in tumorigenesis [29]. With the current resources, we could not tell if the result of the ACDs could be affecting the cells at a chromosomal level. Therefore, future research could aid the analysis of these cells and the potential detriments of abnormalities in cell division. In addition, prior research has found that neuroblastoma cancer cells exhibit increased instances of asymmetrical cell division, where one stem cell progenitor and one differentiated cell are the daughter cells produced in a single cell division. This asymmetric division results from a decreased expression of the MYCN proto-oncogene [30]. A future genomics profiling study, looking into the expression of the MYCN gene as well as other proto-oncogenes associated with defects in cell division and proliferation could further research into the potential connection between the abnormalities seen following SPC-µG exposure and cancer cells. A recent study has shown that in the mouse brain, there are polyploid neurons throughout the development of the neocortex [31]. Nonetheless, it is not clear that the study followed the mice through adulthood. Exit from the cell cycle during development coincides with the differentiation of neurons that is critical for neuronal function. Maintaining a non-dividing state in neurons is critical for brain function [32,33]. When cells exit the cell cycle, they have diploid (2C) DNA content. There is evidence indicating that polyploid cells in the CNS are more prevalent than previously thought and they may be involved in the physiology and pathology of the brain, where cell cycle re-entry is widely deleterious to neurons. To date, the function of mononucleated neurons in the brain or that of binucleated neurons in the autonomic nervous system is not known [34]. It has been hypothesized that these neurons are involved in cell cycle re-entry and neurodegeneration, and neurons entering the cell cycle as well as bi-nucleated neurons have also been reported in Alzheimer’s disease [35,36,37]. Therefore, space-based studies will help humans on Earth and astronauts during and after space missions, as summarized in a recent review [38]. Finally, the literature shows that analysis of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secretome promotes both NSCs commitment to the oligodendroglial lineage, differentiation, and myelin formation and differentiation of neural stem cells in vivo. The secreted protein tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type 1 (TIMP-1) was revealed to be an active component of the MSC-conditioned medium. Nonetheless, this work was performed in 1G, not in microgravity. Moreover, it induced cell commitment and lineage progression, which has nothing to do with abnormal cell division. It is likely that a vast array of small molecules and proteins including cytokines and other factors are secreted by NSCs on Earth. However, characterization of those factors produced and secreted by NSCs is still in its infancy. Thus far, only three factors (PGE2, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2) have been unequivocally identified. Others are still awaiting identification [39]. For this reason, we did not want to speculate further on the nature of possible molecules that might be responsible for the abnormal cell division we report in this manuscript. To our knowledge, we are the first group studying the effects of the secretome produced in space by hiPS derived NSCs. Analysis of the NSCs-produced secretome is currently being performed and we hope to report the data in the near future.",

Copyright notice ID: 9699585 PMID: 36430810 Abstract Considering the imminence of long-term space travel, it is necessary to investigate the impact of space microgravity (SPC-µG) in order to determine if this environment has consequences on the astronauts’ health, in particular, neural and cognitive functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-µG resulted in enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-µG as well as secretome exposure compared to ground control (1G) NSCs. These findings provide new insights into the potential health implications of space travel and have far-reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms leading to the deleterious effects of long-term space travel as well as potential carcinogenic susceptibility. Knowledge of these mechanisms could help to develop preventive or corrective measures for successful long-term SPC-µG exposure. Keywords: human neural stem cells, abnormal cell division, cytokinesis, gravitational research, brain, microgravity, space flight1. Introduction To determine the health risks associated with long-term space travel, it is essential to consider the effects of space microgravity (SPC-µG) on the brain. It is well-established that astronauts oftentimes experience adverse effects following a visit to outer space including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-recognized spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1]. Potential risk factors as well as limitations to lengthy space missions and stays at the International Space Station (ISS) are posed by SANS, among other difficulties that astronauts face due to the gravitational differences in space. This is particularly important because issues such as SANS can be experienced after as little as 34 days, and unusual pathologic neuro-ophthalmic findings have been shown after both short- and long-term space travel [2]. Many studies on the use of microgravity have been performed using an array of cells both committed to a specific phenotype depending on the organ of study as well as uncommitted cells known as stem cells. The origin of stem cells includes murine and human origin. Among these are adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), and organ-specific stem cells [3]. Recent publications have described changes in stem cells when exposed to simulated or space microgravity. Nonetheless, there is limited information in what concerns neural stem cells. Prior research looking at the effects of microgravity on neural stem cells has primarily been conducted with the use of simulated microgravity (sim-µG). Sim-µG studies use machines that are able to simulate low gravity conditions such as the Mitsubishi 3D-Clinostat [4]. The use of different microgravity platforms with application on stem cells and differentiated cells has recently been reviewed [3]. Only a few studies have shown the effect of sim-µG or SPC-µG specifically on neural stem cells. In this regard, Silvano and collaborators have shown that murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) respond to sim-µG by the arrest of their cell cycle in the S-phase with a concomitant increase in apoptosis. These changes occurred in a transient manner because upon return to 1G (Earth’s gravity), the authors described that the cells recovered their stemness and a normal cell cycle [5]. We have previously reported a result that appears to contradict Silvano et al.’s findings, where we found that NSCs in sim-µG proliferated more and displayed a smaller diameter than 1G grown NSCs [6]. A recent discovery that spaceflight upregulated proliferation and survival genes in neural crest derived stem cells while the random positioning machine upregulated differentiation and inflammation genes emphasized the uniqueness of space flight conditions when compared to Earth controls [7]. Our current research avoids the use of sim-µG and moves directly to the source of microgravity -- outer space. SPC-µG has demonstrated more pronounced effects of certain phenomena when compared to sim-µG [8]. Although radiation and other environmental differences cannot be excluded as contributing factors, the findings are similar between sim-µG and SPC-µG, save for the difference in degree [8]. The results of the current study provide outcomes not previously reported in sim-µG studies, with the additional benefit of added relevance to the astronauts’ health. Here, four conditions of NSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) are considered. In the ground control condition (1G), NSCs did not experience any SPC-µG, although other cellular conditions were the same as the experimental groups (more details on the procedure are available in Section 2). The second group consisted of 1G naïve sister cells of the space-flown NSCs that were treated with the secretome, which is our term for the secreted medium from space-flown cells. Finally, we also looked at two groups of NSCs following space flight, with the first group captured one week post-flight, and the final group captured at two weeks post-flight. Due to the nature of the study looking at abnormalities in cell division, it is important to understand the intricacies of the cell cycle and the potential stage(s) for error. In the case of one of the abnormalities, we deemed incomplete cell division (ICD) as failed cytokinesis. Cytokinesis is a highly complex, regulated process that requires an extensive number of cellular processes, proteins, and signaling factors to function properly. Cytokinetic failure can occur due to defects in any of its four stages, which include positioning of the division plane, ingression of the cleavage furrow, formation of the midbody, and abscission [9]. Cytokinetic failure following the division of the cell nucleus, or karyokinesis, can result in a tetraploid cell with double nuclei and four copies of each chromosome rather than the expected two. For some cells of the human body such as in the heart or liver, tetraploidy is a normal process [9]. However, in many cases, tetraploidy can be a sign of a deleterious abnormality such as a tumor precursor [10]. Previous work in the literature has confirmed that embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells behave similarly in terms of cell cycle components. Embryonic stem cell pluripotency is maintained through unique and highly specific signaling. These cells enter the S phase more rapidly with a shortened G1 due to impaired or atypical checkpoint control in embryonic stem cells and unusual activation patterns [11]. Our previous findings showed that NSCs proliferate at a higher rate while in space as well as up to 72 h following space flight, irrespective of flight duration [2,4]. We also showed that changes in the cell diameter occurred post-flight, with 81% of NSCs exhibiting a diameter of 10 µm or higher following space flight compared to 49.2% of the control NSCs [4]. While the undifferentiated NSCs in adult human brain areas such as the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus remain quiescent under normal circumstances, the environment of SPC-µG exposure is likely to alter the expected behavior of these cells [12]. The changes described above including increased proliferation and enlarged cell diameter [13] could contribute to symptoms of SANS that astronauts experience post-flight such as intracranial hypertension. Here, in addition to the aforementioned differences, we noticed that some SPC-µG NSCs appeared to have difficulties with the completion of cytokinesis with enough frequency to be of interest for further investigation. The current study takes a closer look at proliferation abnormalities in single cell division. Throughout this paper, the term ICD refers to an ultimate failure of cytokinesis, regardless of whether karyokinesis has occurred, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) refers to the appearance of more than two daughter cells as would be typical for a single cell division following cytokinesis. The term abnormal cell division (ACD) refers to either phenomena, ICD and/or MDCD. We investigated the hypothesis that, compared to 1G NSCs, there are significantly increased instances of ICD, MDCD, and ACD following exposure to SPC-µG. We also hypothesized that the space-produced secretome would have a similar effect on naïve NSCs.2. Results 2.1. Time-Lapse Microscopy Analysis 2.1.1. A Subpopulation of NSCs Back from Space Displayed Incomplete Divisions Observations of SPC-exposed NSCs revealed that although these cells proliferated more than their ground control counterparts, a sub-population of them attempted to divide unsuccessfully. These abnormally dividing cells displayed two cell bodies, yet ultimately did not achieve complete cell division into two daughter cells, instead remaining as a larger cell and preserving that state for the rest of the time-lapse imaging, as shown in Figure 1. In terms of the differences between the 1G and SPC-µG exposed NSCs, Figure 1A–I illustrates an example of incomplete cytokinesis. The average numbers (bar graph) and percentages (pie graphs) show the raw numbers and proportion of cells involved in ICDs throughout the time-lapse videos. There was an upward trend observed among the groups, with the NSCs two weeks after SPC-µG exposure showing the highest number of instances of ICD. For the control group, the average total number of cells was 1606 with an average ratio of 5.67 ICDs per 1606 cells. For the SPC–µG exposed NSCs, there were on average 8.5 ICDs per 1370 NSCs one week after spaceflight, and 11 ICDs per 903 cells across the different scenes analyzed two weeks post-flight. Figure 1. Open in a new tab An example from time-lapse microscopy of SPC-NSCs 1 week (A–F) and 2 weeks after space flight. One week after returning to Earth, the cells had completely recovered from their round trip to space. They were healthy, displaying cell processes, and were proliferative. (A) Nonetheless, a subpopulation appeared to have acquired a larger size (arrow) when observed under phase-contrast microscopy. (B) When time-lapse images were examined, we found that some cells had started the proliferation process (i.e., the cells appeared to be dividing (arrows)). (C,D) The cell appeared to have reached the full division process. (E) Instead of two daughter cells, they had fused together, (F) remaining that way for the rest of the time the cells were imaged. This event lasted 2.5 h (arrowheads show the cells of interest). (G,H), another example of NSCs two weeks post-flight exhibiting ICD occurring at 102.25 h into time-lapse (shown in part H) and no visible cytokinesis, with the NSC returning to one cell by 105.25 h (shown in part I). Cell(s) of interest are indicated by the yellow arrow(s). The cells finally merged and remained that way until the end of the experiment. Scale bar = 50 µm. (J) Quantitative data showing that more instances of ICDs were seen in the SPC-exposed NSCs. The average number of cells that exhibited ICD during the 50 h that NSCs were under observation via time-lapse microscopy. The purple bar denotes ground control (1G) NSCs. The green bar represents SPC-NSCs one week after returning from the ISS. The orange bar denotes NSCs two weeks after space flight. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant; and the Chi-square test (for percentages) demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = 0.045). Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for all three conditions of NSCs shown. (K) This chart represents the average percentage of incomplete division across groups where normal NSCs that remained on Earth and NSCs one week after returning from space did show very similar cell numbers and the same percentage, while two weeks after space flight, the number of ICD cases accounted for 58%.However, because the total number of cells differed among the three conditions, we also estimated the relative proportions of ICDs. This was calculated by dividing the number of ICDs by the total number of cells present at the exact middle of each time-lapse video. The middle frame represented an approximate mean between the number of cells present at the start of the time-lapse compared with the number of cells present at the end of the video after proliferation had occurred. When comparing the different proportions, the Chi-square test demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = 0.045) (Figure 1K).2.1.2. A Subpopulation of SPC-NSCs Displayed Multi-Daughter Cell Divisions In addition to ICD, we found multi-daughter cell division, which was also examined. An example of multi-daughter cell division where one cell gave rise to three cells at the end of cytokinesis is shown in Figure 2A–C. The average number of cells exhibiting MDCD one week and two weeks after space flight and the percentage of MDCD instances are shown (Figure 2D,E). Figure 2. Open in a new tab An example from time-lapse microscopy of SPC-µG exposed NSCs exhibiting MDCD 2 weeks post-flight. (A) Cells prior to dividing. (B) Three hours later, at 31.33 h, there were three cells visible. (C) These three daughter cells survived for the duration of the experiment and within 50 min, they had developed cell processes. The yellow arrow in all three images points to the mother cell. Quantitative data where NSCs flown to space displayed more instances of MDCDs were seen one week post-space flight, and even more NSCs presented this behavior. (D) The bar graph on the left, shows the average number of cells that exhibited MDCD during the 50 h that the NSCs were under observation via time-lapse microscopy. The green bar denotes ground control (1G) NSCs. The blue bar represents SPC-NSCs one week after returning from the ISS. The yellow bar denotes NSCs two weeks after space flight. (E) Results shown as percentage. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.001 and the Chi-square test (for percentages) demonstrated statistically significant differences (p = 0.045). Please also see MP41 in the Supplementary Materials.As both ICD and MDCD (triple divisions) can be considered within the realm of ACDs, we also compared the total number of ACDs among the three conditions. Although the averages differed between the groups in terms of MDCDs, the sum of ICDs and MDCDs proved statistically significant. (Figure 3). Figure 3. Open in a new tab The bar graph on the left depicts the total number of cells abnormally divided (exhibiting either ICD or MDCD) across four scenes of time-lapse microscopy for each of the three groups. The experimental group of SPC-µG exposed NSCs 2 weeks post-flight displayed a statistically significantly greater amount of ACD compared to the control group and the one week post-flight SPC-flown NSCs (p = 0.0048 for 1G vs. SPC 2 weeks PF; p = 0.0052 for SPC 1 week PF vs. SPC 2 weeks PF). The pie graph shows the difference in the proportion of ICD between the 1G control NSCs (orange), SPC-µG exposed NSCs one week post-flight (brown), and SPC-µG exposed NSCs two weeks post-flight (salmon). NSCs two weeks following space flight displayed a significantly increased frequency of ICD. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant; and the Chi-square test (for percentages) results were significant with p = 0.0135. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition.2.2. Effects of the Secretome on Naïve NSCs Cell Divisions To ascertain if these changes had been exerted directly on the cells during space flight, we examined if there were molecules that would have been secreted by NSCs under the influence of microgravity. For this experiment we seeded the cells and followed them for 72 h, time at which we added the secretome to the cells in a 2:1 ratio V/V. We found that the secretome produced similar results in terms of incomplete cytokinesis suggesting that secreted molecules rather than mechanical forces are responsible for these effects (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Average number of cells that exhibited ICD during the 70 to 130 h that NSCs were under observation via time-lapse microscopy. The pink bar denotes naïve NSCs with no exposure to SPC-µG or secretome. The turquoise blue bar denotes naïve 1G NSCs following the addition of secretome (p = 0.037). The pie chart shows the ratio of incomplete division events compared to the total number of cells in the time-lapse for each condition. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition. Chi-square test (for percentages) results were significant with p = 0.001. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition. See also MP42 in the Supplementary Materials.We examined the question of whether or not the secretome would also produce similar effects on naïve NSCs that had never flown to space in terms of MDCD. An example of MDCD in the naïve NSCs treated with secretome is shown (Figure 5A–C), where one cell divides into three daughter cells and the three cells continue to survive and move around for the duration of the time-lapse. Figure 5. Open in a new tab This example from the time-lapse microscopy of naïve 1G NSCs following treatment with SPC-µG NSCs secretome shows: (A) A NSC MDCD; (B) The cell gives rise to two daughter cells: (C) The cells had successfully completed cytokinesis with three cells visible beginning at 60 h and remaining as three cells for the duration of the video. The arrow points to the mother cell and the arrowheads designate the daughter cells. (D) The bar graph on the left depicts the total number of cells displaying MDCD across four scenes of time-lapse microscopy for each of the three groups. The secretome produced by NSCs while in space increased the number of triple cell divisions although these differences were not significant. (E) The pie graph shows the difference in the proportion of MDCD between the 1G control NSCs. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons and the Chi-square test (for percentages) results were not significant. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition.While looking at the raw numbers can provide useful information, it is important to consider that the total number of visible cells as filmed through time-lapse microscopy differs for each scene. Therefore, the pie charts in Figure 1 and Figure 3 take this into account in order to display the fraction of total cells that exhibited ICD or ACD. There was a significantly greater proportion of ICDs found in the experimental group of NSCs two weeks post-flight (1.22%) compared to the other groups, with the 1G naïve NSCs at 0.35% and the NSCs one week post-flight exhibiting 0.62% ICD. Concerning the sum of ICD and MDCD, there was also a significantly greater proportion of ACDs found in the SPC-µG exposed NSCs two weeks post-flight (1.68%). The 1G naïve NSCs exhibited ACD at a frequency of 0.58%, the same cells after the addition of secretome exhibited ACD 0.98% of the time, and the SPC-µG exposed NSCs one week post-flight had a percentage of 0.56% the influence of microgravity. In addition to ICD, the raw numbers of cells involved in either ICD or MDCD, deemed ACDs, were also graphed (Figure 6). For the control group, the average total number of cells was 1606 with an average ratio of 9.33 ACDs per 1606 cells. After the medium was switched to incorporate secretome, this value changed drastically, with an average of 15.67 ACDs per 1606 cells. For the SPC–µG exposed NSCs, there were on average 7.63 ACDs per 1370 NSCs one week after spaceflight, while there were on average 15.17 ICDs per 903 cells across the different scenes analyzed two weeks post-flight (Figure 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab The bars on the graph represent the total number of NSCs abnormally divided (exhibiting either ICD or MDCD) for naïve NSCs, SPC-NSCs, and naïve NSCs treated with SPC-NSC secretome. Data were obtained from four scenes of time-lapse microscopy for each of the four groups. The experimental group of SPC-µG exposed NSCs 2 weeks post-flight (PF) displayed a statistically significantly greater amount of ACD compared to the control group and the one week post-flight SPC-flown NSCs (p = 0.0048 for 1G vs. SPC 2 weeks PF; p = 0.0052 for SPC 1 week PF vs. SPC 2 weeks PF). Naïve-NSCs results were also significantly different with respect to the naïve (non-treated) NSCs. The pie chart shows the ratio of abnormally divided cells compared to the total number of cells in the time-lapse for each condition. NSCs two weeks following space flight displayed a significantly increased frequency of ACD. Moreover, a significant difference was also found in naïve-NSCs exposed to SPC-secretome. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons test in which * p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 was defined as statistically significant; the Chi-square test (for percentages) demonstrated that the results were significant with p = 0.001. Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for each color-coded condition.From these data, it is clear that there were statistically significant differences in the amount of ACD as well as ICD alone following cellular exposure to SPC-µG, particularly when looking at NSCs two weeks following SPC-µG exposure. While not always statistically significant, there are also more instances of both ICD and ACD following the addition of secretome to the NSCs.2.3. Immunofluorescence Immunocytochemistry was performed on both the control and experimental groups of NSCs. These cells were examined for the expression of NSC markers in order to confirm lineage. The normal morphology and physiology of NSCs are partially dependent on the cytoskeleton, which is composed of intermediate filaments, actin, and microtubules. One of the proteins detected by immuno-fluorescence was neuroepithelial stem cell protein (nestin). Nestin expression was of interest because as a type VI intermediate filament (IF) protein, nestin is primarily expressed in dividing NSCs. Potential differences in nestin expression between the control and experimental NSCs allows for a deeper examination of morphological differences that may be present after exposure to SPC-µG or secretome. In addition to nestin, tubulin expression was also examined. As a major component protein essential for microtubule formation, tubulin expression is also bound to reveal information regarding the cell cytoskeleton. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that tubulin is expressed in nestin-positive cells, which aids in testing the validity of our work. The results of the immunofluorescence are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Representative views displaying the immunocytochemical distribution of nestin (red) and tubulin beta II (green). (A) Nestin expression in the 1G control NSCs is positive, with nuclei clearly visible. (B) Tubulin expression in 1G NSCs is also positive. (C) SPC–µG exposed NSCs intensely expressed nestin in most cells. (D) Tubulin was faintly expressed in some SPC–µG exposed NSCs but most cells were negative.3. Discussion It is well-accepted that normal mammalian cell division occurs by the mother cell giving rise to two daughter cells. This is the result of enhanced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CDK–cyclin complexes to ensure well-defined transitions through cell cycle stages [13]. Control checkpoints of the cell cycle act as regulators that activate when they detect a “danger” or abnormal situations such as defects in DNA replication or chromosome segregation. Therefore, loss of cell cycle regulation can lead to cancer [14]. We have previously reported a robust enhancement of NSC proliferative potential as well as an increased number of NSCs of larger size [8], a phenomenon also known as hypertrophy, which may occur in response to injury. For example, hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes implicates changes in the gene expression profile where “embryonic genes” reactivate, modifying the contractile protein structure and density of hormone receptors [14]. “Physiologic hypertrophy” is considered adaptive with the goal to improve cell and organ function. Pathologic hypertrophy may be an adaptive response at the beginning, but often results in changes in gene expression that can exacerbate dysfunction and may lead to cancer. Here, we demonstrated that features associated with cancer of the CNS appear to have been accentuated on NSCs by space flight. Through this study, we discovered that a subset of NSCs flown to space displayed hyperplasia, which is characterized by an increased number of daughter cells. Although the percentage of cells showing three or more daughter cells was small, it was statistically significant. It has previously been shown that when simulating the three-dimensional mechanical confinement found in the in vivo milieu, cancer HeLa cells often divided into three or even five daughter cells [15]. Moreover, higher confinement and stiffness gave rise to increased asymmetry and multi-daughter division [15]. In our case, we did not use confinement nor cancerous cells. However, we found an increased number of instances of abnormal division between one and two weeks post-space flight. We believe that the mechanical forces exerted on NSCs after space flight were those from terrestrial gravity (1G), which makes cells adhere stronger to the plastic substratum that is more rigid than the mesh carrier on which cells grew and flew back and forth to space/Earth. Nonetheless, the results from the naïve NSCs treated with secretome demonstrate that the space environment induces the production and secretion of soluble factors that exert the same behavior on normal self-renewing cells (i.e., naïve NSCs), resulting in ACD without changing the mechanical forces. In terms of MDCD, it is possible that it had resulted as a compensatory mechanism from a stem cell having two or three nuclei trying to remedy multi-nucleated cells by giving three daughter cells in the following generation. Based on our results, SPC-µG has cellular effects that increase instances of abnormalities in single cell division, particularly when considering ICD and MDCD. The same trend was observed following the addition of the secretome from SPC-NSCs to naïve-NSCs. Thus, elucidation of the molecules that may be responsible for the observed effects is of the essence. Therefore, we analyzed the secretome profile of NSCs flown to space and found that the most enriched molecule was the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), produced by these NSCs while in space [16]. Being a matricellular protein, SPARC’s main function is to modulate cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions and it is mainly expressed in the bone and endothelial cells [17,18]. Nonetheless, it is also highly expressed during embryonic life in notochord, chondrocytes, and other tissues of the embryonic skeleton functioning as a remodeling protein [19], and it is also expressed in macrophages at injury sites [20,21,22]. It has been postulated that SPARC may also play a role in different types of cancer, and in some cases, it has promoted the inhibition of breast cancer [23]; SPARC is expressed in grade 3 tumors, but other studies have shown that higher expression of SPARC correlated with decreased metastasis [24]. There is a compilation of studies on the effects of different levels of SPARC expression in tumors and neighboring cells where in some cases SPARC is deleterious and in other types of cancer, it inhibits proliferation and metastasis [19]. For example, a high expression of SPARC has been reported in advanced, metastatic melanoma [25]. In brain gliomas, SPARC is detrimental in that it promotes the survival and invasion of glioma cells [19]. High levels of purified SPARC act as an inhibitor of both neuroblastoma growth and angiogenesis [26,27]. SPARC is considered by some as a cancer therapeutic agent due to its ability to inhibit proliferation and enhance apoptosis in the ovary, colorectum, pancreas, neuroblastoma, and leukemia [19]. However, in the case of neural cells, it is deleterious. Although our NSCs were not tumor derived, it is possible that NSCs in space display this novel vulnerability that might be triggered and/or enhanced to increase the frequency of abnormal cell division as a function of time. This phenomenon is similar to the progression of a benign tumor into a malignant tumor, and it could be lethal, endangering the space mission. Since our study was performed on Earth’s gravity, where naïve NSCs were not exposed to the mechanical changes between microgravity and 1G, we believe that the secretome produced by SPC-NSCs holds the key for the modulation or downregulation of the abnormal cellular behaviors ICD and MDCD observed. Having previously seen enhanced proliferation and hypertrophy [8], and in the current study hyperplasia, in our NSCs post-flight, it is easy to speculate that SPARC under different gravity conditions such as on Mars or our Moon will be differentially regulated according to the G-force the cells are subjected to. Therefore, modulation of SPARC’s gene expression may lead us to harness the countermeasures necessary to protect the CNS of the astronauts from neurodegeneration and cancer during and after space flight. These attributes, together with the increase in abnormal cell division, most likely contribute to SANS and other health complications during or following space flight. Stem cells are unique in that they are the only human cell type with the ability to self-renew and produce an unlimited quantity of daughter cells [19]. Therefore, any errors during cell division can lead to the promotion of cancer. Endogenous damage to DNA as well as pathological and environmental factors can lead to such cancer-promoting errors. Chemical and physical signals acting upon stem cells can impact the life and death of the cell as well as their differentiation process. Therefore, the risk of cancer is heavily influenced by extrinsic factors known as the ‘stem cell environment’ or niche [19,20]. As opposed to directly altering DNA, non-genotoxic agents are able to increase the risk of cancer through increasing cell proliferation [21]. The changes observed during cell division noted in this paper have features of malignant stem cells, mimicking the carcinogenic changes hypothesized to lead to cancers [22]. It is known that non-conventional mitosis events lead to tumor progression. Mechanosensing is important for proper cell physiology and tissue homeostasis. Here, we propose that SPARC is a gravity-sensor or gravitometer protein secreted by NSCs in response to an environmental change that is gravity (G). Thus, SPARC’s upregulation by microgravity serves as a marker for us to start designing strategies to regulate this gene, hence regulate proliferation and other cues altered by µG. A factor not studied in our cells was space radiation, which may also play a role in these changes and more work is needed to ascertain its net contribution to potential brain cancer produced by space missions. We have to acknowledge an important limitation of our current study on abnormalities in stem cell division after exposure to microgravity. A detailed cell cycle analysis with correlation to cytokinesis should be conducted before drawing any conclusions about when during the cell cycle abnormalities are likely to occur. As all the cells returning from space were used for the current experiments, and also due to funding constraints, those studies will be considered as a top priority in the future. Another future direction that this research could explore is a more detailed and high-definition exploration into the daughter cells resulting from MDCD as well as the cells following ICD. Neither the proposal nor funding for this project included the study of the mechanical effects of microgravity on our cells. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies on the mechanical properties of non-cancerous NSCs in microgravity and after microgravity exposure. It is known that the cell cytoskeleton has a significant role in adapting cells to mechanical influences such as those caused by gravity changes. In fact, it has been shown that several hours or days of µg exposure leads to significant cytoskeletal changes in the form of microfilament thinning and redistribution [28]. Aneuploidy, which is defined as the loss or gain of one or more chromosomes from a diploid gene, is a sign of genomic instability in human cancer cells. Aneuploidy likely represents an early significant event in tumorigenesis [29]. With the current resources, we could not tell if the result of the ACDs could be affecting the cells at a chromosomal level. Therefore, future research could aid the analysis of these cells and the potential detriments of abnormalities in cell division. In addition, prior research has found that neuroblastoma cancer cells exhibit increased instances of asymmetrical cell division, where one stem cell progenitor and one differentiated cell are the daughter cells produced in a single cell division. This asymmetric division results from a decreased expression of the MYCN proto-oncogene [30]. A future genomics profiling study, looking into the expression of the MYCN gene as well as other proto-oncogenes associated with defects in cell division and proliferation could further research into the potential connection between the abnormalities seen following SPC-µG exposure and cancer cells. A recent study has shown that in the mouse brain, there are polyploid neurons throughout the development of the neocortex [31]. Nonetheless, it is not clear that the study followed the mice through adulthood. Exit from the cell cycle during development coincides with the differentiation of neurons that is critical for neuronal function. Maintaining a non-dividing state in neurons is critical for brain function [32,33]. When cells exit the cell cycle, they have diploid (2C) DNA content. There is evidence indicating that polyploid cells in the CNS are more prevalent than previously thought and they may be involved in the physiology and pathology of the brain, where cell cycle re-entry is widely deleterious to neurons. To date, the function of mononucleated neurons in the brain or that of binucleated neurons in the autonomic nervous system is not known [34]. It has been hypothesized that these neurons are involved in cell cycle re-entry and neurodegeneration, and neurons entering the cell cycle as well as bi-nucleated neurons have also been reported in Alzheimer’s disease [35,36,37]. Therefore, space-based studies will help humans on Earth and astronauts during and after space missions, as summarized in a recent review [38]. Finally, the literature shows that analysis of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secretome promotes both NSCs commitment to the oligodendroglial lineage, differentiation, and myelin formation and differentiation of neural stem cells in vivo. The secreted protein tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type 1 (TIMP-1) was revealed to be an active component of the MSC-conditioned medium. Nonetheless, this work was performed in 1G, not in microgravity. Moreover, it induced cell commitment and lineage progression, which has nothing to do with abnormal cell division. It is likely that a vast array of small molecules and proteins including cytokines and other factors are secreted by NSCs on Earth. However, characterization of those factors produced and secreted by NSCs is still in its infancy. Thus far, only three factors (PGE2, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2) have been unequivocally identified. Others are still awaiting identification [39]. For this reason, we did not want to speculate further on the nature of possible molecules that might be responsible for the abnormal cell division we report in this manuscript. To our knowledge, we are the first group studying the effects of the secretome produced in space by hiPS derived NSCs. Analysis of the NSCs-produced secretome is currently being performed and we hope to report the data in the near future.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Space Flight Induced pluripotent human neural stem cells known as cell line “CS83iCTR-33n21” derived from skin fibroblasts were used for the space flight. The cells were reprogrammed by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center through a material transfer agreement and subsequently induced using the STM medium. For further details regarding the steps of the space flight protocol, see our previous publications as well as Figure 8 below [3]. Both space-flown and ground control cells underwent the same flight preparation procedures, and all cells were grown in hardware and pre-seeded onto mesh carriers in passive units. For this study, both gravity conditions used hardware from Yuri through the payload developer Space Technology and Advanced Research System (STaARS). We used the facility known as the STaARS-EF-1 platform on board the ISS, with flight-tested growth and observation chambers shown in Figure 8. The hardware-units containing the experiment electrically and mechanically interfaced through a clip-in-place mechanism onto the STaARS EF-1. Figure 8. Open in a new tab NSCs were seeded on floating mesh carriers that promote strong cell adhesion. Four cell carriers of 2 × 2 mm were placed in each well pre-launch. Cells flew onboard Space X-16, spent a total of 39.6 days in space at the ISS, 248 m (400 km) above the Earth’s surface. Cells were transferred to Long Beach (CA, USA) Airport after splashdown and brought to the UCLA laboratory at 37 °C. Upon arrival, cells were seeded into flasks or flaskettes and allowed to recover for six hours in the incubator and subsequently placed in the imaging system (Adapted from Shaka et al., 2021 [13]).SPC-µG exposure: NSCs were flown aboard SpaceX-16 to the ISS and remained onboard the ISS for 39.6 days before returning to Earth, as shown in Figure 8. The cell chambers contained 2 × 2 mm mesh carriers and the culture medium was equilibrated overnight at 5% CO2 in the incubator where cells were maintained before the flight. Upon arrival, cells were seeded into flasks or flaskettes and allowed to recover for six hours in the incubator and subsequently placed in the imaging system. (Figure modified from Shaka et al., 2021 [13]). A chart defining the abnormal cell division terminology is also shown (Figure 9). Figure 9. Open in a new tab An elaboration upon the specific types of abnormal cell division we defined for the scope of this project. The numbers of abnormally dividing cells were counted by hand through the use of Zeiss ZEN Blue Microscopy software 2020.4.2. Secretome Collection and Naïve NSC Cell Treatment The conditioned medium secreted by space-flown cells, otherwise known as secretome, was collected from the cell chambers separately from the cells. The samples were placed in numbered tubes and subsequently frozen at −80 °C. Environmental parameters and the experimental timeline for the 1G NSCs were based on that of the ISS in order to simulate the conditions of the space flight. Upon its recovery, we mixed two parts of culture medium per one part of straight secretome to treat naïve NSCs grown in 1G cells. The secretome was used straight (as it was obtained from the devices); no concentration was necessary to see the effects shown in this paper. The 1G naïve sister cells of the space-flown cells were first imaged with basal stem cell medium. The medium was switched to fresh medium containing secretome at 44.5 h into the time-lapse video.4.3. Time-Lapse Microscopy Analysis Asynchronous experiments were performed following spaceflight on Earth for the study of cell proliferation. The time-lapse microscopy imaging was conducted using the ZEISS Axio Observer 7 fully motorized inverted research microscope equipped with Definite Focus 2, ZEISS Axiocam 506 monochrome camera with ZEISS ZEN software, and ZEISS Full Incubation XL chamber (Oberkochen, Germany) for temperature and CO2 control with a motorized scanning stage. The microscope collected images every 15 min in seven different XYZ positions for a duration of about 72 h for each cell condition. The time-lapse data were analyzed frame-by-frame by hand to scan for instances of ACD including ICD and MDCD with the ZEN Blue 3.5 program. All data were charted in Microsoft Excel for statistical analysis.4.4. Immunofluorescence and Nuclear Staining Double immunofluorescence using established markers for NSCs was performed with the following antibodies used at a 1:100 dilution of nestin (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and tubulin. NucBlue™, (Gibco|Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was also used for staining the nuclei of the NSCs (Figure 10). Immunofluorescence procedures included plating cells onto either coated plastic 8-well chambers (Nunc 177445), or poly-d-lysine coated glass coverslips. To visualize the markers, the secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit IgG Texas Red (JIR) and goat anti-mouse IgG FITC (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan). Figure 10.

    "abstract": "Abstract Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the consequences of long-term space missions. Here we examined the behavior of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) after space flight using time-lapse microscopy. We show that most OLPs divided more than ground control (GC) counterparts did. Nonetheless, a subpopulation of OLPs flown to space presented a significant increase in autophagic cell death. Examination of the proteomic profile of the secretome of space flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) revealed that the stress protein heat shock protein-90 beta “HSP-90β” was the 5th most enriched (6.8 times) and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine “SPARC” was the 7th most enriched (5.2 times), with respect to ground control cells. SPARC induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which leads to autophagy. Given the roles and importance of these two proteins in mammalian cells’ metabolism, their upregulation may hold the key to modulating cell proliferation and autophagy, in order to mitigate ICP and VIIP during and after space missions.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction It has been reported that microgravity induces intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) in astronauts after long-duration space missions. Both ICP and VIIP remain when astronauts return to Earth. These conditions represent a risk factor and a potential limitation to long-duration space missions such as flying to the Moon or Mars. The central nervous system (CNS) is a complex system that governs voluntary and involuntary functions and behaviors. It is continually adapting to challenges from the environment to sustain its functions. We have previously reported that oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells of the CNS, proliferate more in simulated microgravity (Sim-µG) and after exposure to it [1]. We have also reported that sim-µG enhances energy metabolism in OLPs [2]. The first goal of this investigation was to ascertain if human OLPs flown to space would proliferate more after space flight. We hypothesized that OLPs would have increased proliferation while in space and that this could be contributing to ICP and VIIP in astronauts that have flown to space because the symptoms do not disappear with time back on Earth. These findings led us to investigate (i) if space microgravity would produce similar results and (ii) how OLPs adapt to the Earth’s gravity after space flight. For this purpose, we used time-lapse imaging and analysis. Another goal was to (iii) study the secretome of OLPs exposed to space microgravity (SPC-OLPs) and compare it with ground control (GC) cells.",
    "methods": "2. Methods 2.1. Cells and Culture System Two years prior to the space flight, we tested several cell lines to select the most suitable for the space flight in terms of survival and hardware material compatibility, adequate seeding cell number to ensure cells would have enough nutrients for the duration of the trip, and so on. We finally selected a homogeneous population of neural stem cells, NSCs, which was obtained from human induced pluripotent stem cells, hiPS. The original hiPS cell line “CS83iCTR33-n1” (fibroblasts) was “reprogrammed” and provided to us by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Los Angeles CA. via a material transfer agreement. These cells were converted to “OLPs” using the protocol shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Ectoderm selection was performed by exposing hiPS to SB431542 (SB) and dorsomorphin (DM) to instruct ectoderm formation preferentially, while inhibiting endodermal and mesodermal commitment. Once specified, a stock of hiPS-derived OLPs was created for all pre-flight and post flight experiments in order to keep passage number low (18 passages maximum). Details of the procedure described here have been published [2]. This medium was designed to induce and maintain the OLP-phenotype. OLPs flew to space in OSM with N2 + B27. (Figure modified from [3]). The composition of the basal “OSM” (oligodendrocyte specification medium) is shown in Table 1.Dissolve the listed components in 500 mL of D-MEM/F12 medium (High glucose) to make OSMb (basal). To prepare OSM complete (OSMc), we added 10 µL of both N2 and B-27 with retinoic acid to OSMb. To prepare “welcoming medium” (WM), we used OSMb + IGF-1 (final concentration of 88–100 ng/mL, freshly prepared) without B-27 or N2, and allowed them to recover for six hours in the incubator prior to placing them in the imaging system. 2.2. Hardware and Space Flight The BioScience-4 mission launched onboard the Space-X 21 Dragon capsule on 6 December 2020. This is the first study to investigate the effects of space flight on human normal hiPS-derived OLPs. For the space flight, OLPs were seeded onto passive 8-well Petri dishes from Airbus-Kiwi (Friedrichshafen, DE), on floating mesh carriers 2 mm × 2 mm to which cells adhered firmly; this feature was necessary to ensure that cells would not detach and die during launching or while returning to Earth. OLPs were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and installed in the STAaRS F-1 Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 (STAaRS F-1) at 37 °C. Cells remained onboard the ISS for 38 days and then returned to Earth (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab OLPs, as part of the Bioscience-4 Space Biology NASA experiment, flew to the ISS on board SpaceX-21. This experiment was launched on the 6 of December, 2020, and landed (splashed-down) on the 13 of January, 2021. Cells remained in µG at an orbit height of 254 miles. The experiment is called “passive” because it was designed to mimic the trajectory astronauts’ brains undergo during space flight (i.e., launch, stay in space, and splash down when returning to Earth) without manipulation or medium change. (A) Example of mesh without cells. (B) View of a mesh carrier populated with cells after space flight. (C) View of the hardware units upon return to our laboratory. Ground control cells were seeded and maintained at 37 °C in the same type of hardware and the same conditions in our laboratory, the only difference was the Earth gravity vs. space microgravity. Upon splash-down, they were transferred from Kennedy Space Center to World Carrier and brought to our laboratory (UCLA) at 37 °C. 2.3. Time-Lapse of SPC-OLPs Behavior after Space Flight Upon arrival, cells were removed from the flying hardware and re-suspended in a culture medium designed to allow them to move forward in the lineage. This culture medium was made with OSMb + IGF-1 (final concentration of 88–100 ng/mL, freshly prepared) without B-27 or N2 and seeded onto T-25 flasks or flaskets with a glass bottom, at the initial seeding cell density of 0.3 × 106 OLPs per flasket. OLPs were allowed to recover for six hours in the incubator prior to being placed in the imaging system. For details on the functioning of this hardware, please see information from Yuri (Available online: https://www.yurigravity.com/, accessed on 30 November 2012). We used the Zeiss Axio Observer 7 fully motorized inverted research microscope with the Zeiss Axiocam 506 monochrome camera with Zeiss ZEN software, and definite focus equipped with the full Incubation XL chamber (Zeiss) for temperature and CO2 control with motorized scanning stage. 2.4. Secretome Collection and Proteomics Analysis For this part of the study, we chose the Automated Type IV hardware from Yuri, which allows for collecting culture medium in an automated manner. OLPs were seeded onto the mesh carriers to maximize the growth surface for the cells and to support strong adherence to it so that cells would not detach during take-off and re-entry. The experiment is summarized below (Figure 3). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Synopsis of the automated experiments. OLPs, as part of the Bioscience-4 Space Biology NASA experiment, flew to the ISS (A) on board SpaceX-16, together with the passive experiments. (B) Timeline on when the conditioned medium (secretome) for the initial portion of the flight was removed on T+2 d after OLPs reached space. This medium was in contact with the cells for 26 days, at which time the second culture medium was recovered into the second tank just prior to unberth, in order to capture the molecules secreted solely while cells were onboarding the ISS. During ascent, descent, and space flight, cells were maintained at 37 °C. Upon arrival to our laboratory, the culture medium that fed the cells during space flight (secretome) was recovered from the hardware separately, the medium from each well was recovered separately and placed in numbered tubes with addition of proteases inhibitor cocktail, and saved frozen at −80 °C. (C) View of the cell chamber where mesh carriers with cells and the travel culture medium travelled. (D,E) Tanks that contained the fresh medium to be released at T+2 to start the experiment. Tank 2 (E arrow) contained the second fresh medium with which the cells came back to Earth. 2.5. Secretome Proteomic Profile The conditioned medium samples (secretome) were thawed and vortexed for 20 s. The samples were spun for 30 min at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm and the supernatant was collected. For these samples, serum Albumin and IgG were removed using Thermo Scientific Albumin/IgG Removal Kit. Next, the depleted serum samples were concentrated and exchanged into 2D Lysis buffer (Sigma Millipore, St. Louis, MO, USA) (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, and 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). Protein concentration was measured in all samples using the Bio-Rad protein assay method. Gel layout, Internal Standard (Cy2), OLPs_0G (Cy3), OLPs_1G (Cy5). Internal Standard was made up of an equal amount of protein from each sample. CyDye labeling: For each sample, 30 µg of protein was mixed with 1.0 μL of diluted CyDye, and kept in dark on ice for 30 min. The labeling reaction was stopped by adding 1.0 µL of 10 mM lysine to each sample, and incubating in the dark on ice for an additional 15 min. The labeled samples were then mixed. The 2X 2D Sample buffer (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mg/mL DTT, 2% pharmalytes, and trace amount of bromophenol blue), 100 µL destreak solution, and Rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mg/mL DTT, 1% pharmalytes and trace amount of bromophenol blue) were added to the labeling mix to make the total volume of 250 µL. We mixed well and spun before loading the labeled samples into the strip holder. 2.6. IEF and SDS-PAGE After loading the labeled samples, IEF (pH3-10 Non-Linear) was run following the protocol provided by GE Healthcare. Upon finishing the IEF, the IPG strips were incubated in the freshly made equilibration buffer-1 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, trace amount of bromophenol blue and 10 mg/mL DTT) for 15 min with gentle shaking. Then, the strips were rinsed in the freshly made equilibration buffer-2 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, trace amount of bromophenol blue, and 45 mg/mL Iodoacetamide) for 10 min with gentle shaking. Next, the IPG strips were rinsed in the SDS-gel running buffer before transferring into 13.5% SDS-gels. The SDS-gels were run at 15 °C until the dye front ran out of the gels. 2.7. Image Scan and Data Analysis Gel images were scanned immediately following the SDS-PAGE using Typhoon TRIO (GE Healthcare). The scanned images were then analyzed by Image Quant software (version 6.0, GE Healthcare), which is based on a scanning laser-illumination system and photomultiplier detector, followed by in-gel analysis using DeCyder software (version 5.0, GE Healthcare). The fold change of the protein expression levels was obtained from in-gel DeCyder analysis. 2.8. Spot Picking and Trypsin Digestion The spots of interest were picked up by Ettan Spot Picker (Amersham BioSciences) based on the in-gel analysis and spot picking design by DeCyder software. The gel spots were washed and then digested in-gel with modified porcine trypsin protease (Trypsin Gold, Promega). The digested tryptic peptides were desalted by Zip-tip C18 (Millipore). Peptides were eluted from the Zip-tip with 0.5 ul of matrix solution (ά-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) and spotted on the AB SCIEX MALDI plate (Opti-TOFTM 384 Well Insert). 2.9. Mass Spectrometry MALDI-TOF MS and TOF/TOF tandem MS/MS were performed on an AB SCIEX TOF/TOF™ 5800 System (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired in reflectron positive ion mode, averaging 4000 laser shots per spectrum. TOF/TOF tandem MS fragmentation spectra were acquired for each sample, averaging 4000 laser shots per fragmentation spectrum on each of the 10 most abundant ions present in each sample (excluding trypsin autolytic peptides and other known background ions). 2.10. Database Search Both the resulting peptide mass and the associated fragmentation spectra were submitted to the GPS Explorer workstation equipped with the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science) to search the database of the  non-redundant (nr) or Swiss-Prot-database. Searches were performed without constraining protein molecular weight or isoelectric point, with variable carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine residues. One missed cleavage was also allowed in the search parameters. Candidates with either protein score C.I.% or Ion C.I.% greater than 95 were considered significant. For the analysis, we have considered only those pathways with a probability score, corrected for false discovery rate by the Benjamini–Hochberg method, p < 0.05. 2.11. Statistics Proteomics data displayed a normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test) and are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses for cell cycle duration and cell counts were performed using One-Way ANOVA, followed by Tukey post hoc test, in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.",

Results Upon return from the space flight on board SpX-21, OLPs were recovered from the passive flying hardware, seeded onto glass bottom flaskets and placed in the time-lapse system to ascertain cell proliferation. With time, both GC and SPC-flown OLPs increased in number, and the differences were significant across groups and at each time point studied (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Twenty-five hours after the experiment had started there were more than twice as many OLPs and although GC cells also proliferated, there were more cells in the SPC-flown group, and these differences were significant at 12 h and 25 h, but by the 50th hour, the differences were not significant anymore, as if they were tending to adapt to Earth gravity. Values are expressed as the mean ± SD of the total number of cells per field, from six different fields in three separate cultures. * p ˂ 0.05, ** p ˂ 0.01. Space-flown OLPs had recovered well from the space flight; some were round with small, or no cell processes, and most of these cells were dividing. We also studied cytokinesis in GC-OLPs; their appearance was slightly more mature than SPC-OLPs. They bore long processes and were mostly bipolar at the beginning of the study. Nonetheless, with time, they acquired more cell processes. We found that the cell cycle in these cells was more within a normal range between 16.5 h and 25 h. Within the SPC-OLPs group, we also found a subpopulation of SPC-OLPs that divided much faster; their cytokinesis occurred within 6.6 h, at least twice. Examples of cytokinesis in space-flown OLPs and GC counterparts are shown (Figure 5A–F) and (Figure 5G–L). Figure 5. Open in a new tab After seeding, SPC-OLPs were placed in the time-lapse microscope system with an incubator to control temperature and the CO2 environment. We captured phase contrast images every 10 min to visualize the changes occurring in cells after space flight and, in particular, cytokinesis. Sequential view of SPC-Flown OLPs (A–F).

(J) Five hours later, these cells developed multiple and robust processes (asterisks).

(L) One of these cells divided again 20h after it had been generated (arrow). The second cell in the top right did not divide during this interval. 3.1. Space-Flown OLPs Consisted of Three Distinct Sub-Populations We next examined the duration of cytokinesis in SPC-flown and GC-OLPs. Once a cell was identified, it was then studied using reverse-time tracking and verified forward. The cell cycle time was defined as the interval between when a cell was first generated by cytokinesis and when that cell subsequently divided, giving birth to two daughter cells. Quantitative data for both groups, GC-OLPs and SPC-OLPs, showed that GC-OLPs’ cytokinesis ranged between 13.66 h and 20.6 h, averaging 19.76 h. In the case of SPC-OLPs, the vast majority of SPC-flown OLPs had a cell cycle ranging between 14.33 h and 43.3 h with an average of 19.43 h; these differences were not significant (Figure 6A). Thus, the initial study on the duration of the cell cycle from space-flown OLPs appeared to show that the cells had not proliferated significantly faster after space flight when compared to GC-OLPs. Nonetheless, a detailed analysis demonstrated the existence of three subpopulations of OLPs, one exhibiting a long cell cycle (LCC) averaging 19.43 h and a second and third, with smaller OLPs groups exhibiting shorter cell cycles (SCC) with a duration of either 6.6 h or 3.3 h. (Figure 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab (A) The bar graph shows that most of the SPC-flown OLPs exhibited a long cell cycle comparable to GC-OLPs, averaging 19.43 h for SPC-OLPs and 19.76 h for GC-OLPs. The second group of SPC-OLPs divided much faster presenting cytokinesis duration of either 6.6 h (for the vast majority) or 3.3 h. One-way ANOVA showed that these differences were non-significant for the LCC group. In contrast, the differences in the short-cell cycle were significant concerning the long-cell cycle cells and the GC group. (B) The pie graph shows that 97% of SPC-OLPs had an average cell cycle of 19.76 h, while 2.6% displayed a shorter, and 0.4% exhibited even a much shorter cell cycle. Values are expressed as the mean ± SD of three separate cultures. * p ˂ 0.05. 3.2. Space Flight Upregulates Autophagy in OLPs Upon return, OLPs were transferred from Kennedy Space Center to UCLA. OLPs were recovered from each well separately and seeded onto separate poly-d-lysine (PdL) coated flaskets using OSM medium supplemented with IGF-1. We observed that the vast majority of the cells proliferated and migrated as expected. Six hours after being seeded, OLPs were placed in the time-lapse microscope system with an incubator to control temperature and the CO2 environment. We captured phase contrast images every 10 min to visualize cell changes after space flight. These cells had recovered well from the space flight, were highly migratory, and the vast majority presented bipolar or tripolar morphology. Nonetheless, some were round and adhered to the substratum, but without cell processes. In addition, we also found that some of these OLPs flown to space displayed autophagy; the number of autophagy instances is shown in Figure 7. Thus, although only a small percentage (0.12% of GC vs. 0.22% of SPC) of cells displayed autophagy, significantly more of these events were observed after space flight. Figure 7. Open in a new tab The field was examined to identify OLPs undergoing autophagy. Once a cell was identified, it was then studied using reverse-time tracking. (A) View of the round cell being studied 0 = 13.25 h after the start of the time-lapse capture. (B) Morphological changes occur where bleb-like structures are seen (arrows). The inset shows that the cell has left flat membrane-like material outside. (C) 8 h after, the cell changed morphology, looking like one round structure. (D) During the lapse of 4 h, the cell had deposited some of its contents onto the extracellular space. (E) Four hours later, the cell appeared to have internalized part of the expelled material, (F) The cell then contracted until there was just a small pocket-like structure and an empty sac-like structure. The event was completed within the lapse of 20 h—also see supplemental time lapse (TL) TL-1. (G) This bar graph shows the incidence of autophagic cell death in GC and SPC-flown OLPs three weeks after returning to Earth. The average total number of cells per field displaying autophagy in the GC group was 22 OLPs. In contrast, in SPC-OLPs cultures, 72 cells exhibited such behavior. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (*) p < 0.01. 3.3. Secretome Proteomics The culture medium that fed the cells during space flight was recovered from each tank separately. This medium is commonly known as the conditioned medium. For the purpose of this paper, we refer to it as “secretome”. Examination of the secretome of SPC-flown OLPs, using mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, revealed that heat shock protein 90 alpha/beta (HSP-90αβ) was the fifth most abundant, followed by SPARC seventh, and HSP90β eighth most abundant, and they were significantly increased in the secretome produced while OLPs were in space. Their enrichment, with respect to Earth-grown OLPs, is shown (Table 2). Other proteins within the first seven most enriched were Glyoxalase Domain Containing 4, GC protein, prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit beta, and Homeobox C11; these are to be discussed in separate papers currently in preparation.

    "discussion": "4. Discussion Gravity, the force that impacts our development, daily lives, and metabolic processes, is an integral part of our life, physiology, and cognition. The absence of gravity or its variation would consequently alter the development and function of all living organisms and systems. The space era has brought knowledge on the response of biological systems to microgravity. Weightlessness has been shown to cause cell damage and impair the cell cycle in various biological systems, including transiently in NSCs [4,5]. We and others [1,2,6,7] have started to unravel how CNS biological processes occur in µG. We have previously shown that the cell cycle is shortened and that more OLPs are produced in sim-µG [1]. We have also shown that OLPs exhibited an elevated energetic state and enhanced lipid secretion by human OLPs after 72 h in sim-µG [2]. Therefore, the absence of gravity provides us with a unique opportunity to gain new insights into the developmental and functional aspects of the CNS. With this in mind, we sought to determine how OLPs would behave upon exposure to space-µG. 4.1. OLPs Cytokinesis after Space Flight Cell cycle regulation and functional maturation in oligodendroglia (OLs) are two critical functions that, when in balance, ensure normal CNS development, as well as healthy OLs and myelin throughout the life of the organism. Upon lineage commitment, OLPs are generated mainly through symmetric self-renewing divisions [8]. OLPs’ cell cycle length in embryonic (E) life varies, and its frequency increases from 6 h (h) to 13 h, and subsequently, it extends up to 22 h in embryonic life E-17 [9]. Debate still exists on whether the deceleration of OLPs’ cell cycle is an inherent property of OLPs, whether extracellular signals determine it, and whether the microenvironment is conditioned by themselves and/or the presence of added mitogens and other trophic factors, including neuronal signaling [10]. We believe that both aspects act in concert to support OLP maturation towards myelinating oligodendrocytes. Initially, space-flown OLPs appeared to have not proliferated significantly more after space flight when compared to GC-OLPs. Nonetheless, a more exhaustive analysis demonstrated the existence of three subpopulations of OLPs, one exhibiting a long cell cycle similar in length to the GC cells, and two exhibiting shorter cell cycles of either 6.6 h or 3.3 h. Thus, compared to reports indicating that the perinatal OLPs cell cycle averages 16 h [11], our SPC-OLPs appeared to cover both the dividing pace of the early embryonic and perinatal OLPs cell cycle. Yet, we have no explanation for the even shorter cell cycle. We and others have described the well-defined developmental stages of OLs, from OLPs to mature myelinating OLs [12]. Each stage has “stage-specific” markers, which are molecules made by these cells as they progress along their lineage. Although our resources and cell numbers obtained after space flight did not allow for epigenetic analyses, the proteomic analysis of SPC-flown secretome was very instrumental: it revealed that while in space, OLPs secreted 3.5 times more transferrin than GC-OLPs, indicating that they were at an early OLP stage while in space [3]. Moreover, their proliferative characteristics acquired while in space were preserved upon return to Earth, as if they remembered having been in µG [3]. The global proteomics analysis is still an ongoing project. Proteins within the first seven most enriched were Glyoxalase Domain Containing 4, GC protein, prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit beta, and Homeobox C11. The potential relevance of these proteins will be discussed in separate papers currently in preparation. Nonetheless, we considered it of utmost importance to report the abundance of HSP90αβ, HSP90β, and SPARC because these proteins relate directly to the behavior of space-flown OLPs, as well as to autophagy. These experiments were designed to ascertain what molecules were produced by OLPs while in space. We were very successful because we discovered that OLPs are the cell population we should focus our efforts on to address ICP and VIIP. A cluster of molecules involved in essential roles in mammalian cellular homeostasis are the HSP90 family, and co-chaperones are the most important elements for the regulation of cytosolic HSP90. We have recently reported, using immunofluorescence, that OLPs flown to space expressed HSP-90β [3]. Proteomic analysis of the secretome demonstrated upregulation of this gene product. On Earth, the cytosolic form of HSP90 supports cell survival and controls the cell cycle, among other roles [13]. Several types of stress including reactive oxygen species, irradiation, and tissue injury result in secretion of HSP90α [14], and secreted HSPαß is beneficial because it promotes cell motility for wound healing [15]. Yet, some secreted forms have been reported to contribute to the development and progression of serious cancers and neurodegenerative diseases [13]. Therefore, ascertaining the enhanced presence of HSP90αβ and HSPβ in SPC-OLPs opens the possibility of using it as a target molecule to modulate cell proliferation in astronauts’ brains. Nonetheless, extensive research is needed to understand how these molecules interact in the entire brain, as opposed to one cell type in culture. Understanding the regulation and function of the HSP90 family members in microgravity is of the essence to harness specific countermeasures towards prevention and treatment of IP in astronauts. 4.2. Enhanced Autophagy in SPC-OLPs Degradation and recycling of dysfunctional proteins or whole organelles is a lysosome-mediated mechanism known as autophagy. This process ensures homeostasis in the CNS and other tissues [16,17] and it may lead to either cell survival or cell death, depending on the type and extent of the insult or cellular stress [18]. A protein acidic and rich in cysteine, “SPARC”, is involved in autophagy, and it is a matrix-associated protein. It is required for calcification of collagen in bone too, but it is also involved in extracellular matrix synthesis and cell morphological changes. In addition, SPARC has been associated with tumor suppression. Nonetheless, it has also been correlated with metastasis and tumorigenesis. Its capacity to induce a tumorigenic phenotype has been attributed to the modulation of signaling for integrins and growth factors influencing malignant progression, including extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, immune modulation, and metastasis. In the CNS, SPARC upregulates glioma matrix by promoting collagen fibrillogenesis [19]. On the other hand, SPARC induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which leads to autophagy [20]. Recent studies have provided evidence suggesting that simulated µG, using random positioning machines (RPMs), activate autophagy in RAW264.7 pre-osteoclast cells and seminomal cells [21,22]. Moreover, autophagy protects against µG-induced ER stress in HUVEC cells [23]. In the present study, SPARC was the seventh most expressed protein in the secretome from SPC-OLPs. When compared with the secretome from ground control OLPs, the level of SPARC contained in the secretome was 5.1 times higher. The pleiotropic effects of SPARC reflect the complexity of its interactions depending on the cell type. It plays roles in pro and anti-proliferation; it elicits endothelial reticulum (ER) stress that leads to autophagy-mediated apoptosis; it is a cell morphogen and can act as an oncogene, as well as tumor suppressor. Thus, understanding the effects of space flight on OLPs and how to modulate such effects are of the essence, as astronauts embark on more extended duration space travel such as to the Moon and Mars. Both of our OLPs, ground control and space-flown, remained unattended for 45 days, which could be considered a stressful situation, and which would suggest that autophagy occurred out of starvation. Nonetheless, while we found autophagic behavior in GC-OLPs, these events were significantly increased in SPC-OLPs. In addition, the time-lapse study was performed on cells that were fed with fresh medium prior to the start of imaging. Thus, space flight enhanced the autophagic properties of OLPs, which indicates that cells remembered having been transiently in microgravity and that despite being back to terrestrial gravity, these physiological changes while in space persisted. Epigenetic analysis to better understand these “memory” mechanisms is of the essence. Nonetheless, increased proliferation in SPC-OLPs and SPARC upregulation explain how nature may be using this mechanism to compensate for increased proliferation by increasing autophagy in OLPs exposed to space microgravity to maintain healthy cell numbers. Although our results do not demonstrate the occurrence of this phenomenon in the astronauts’ brains, it is plausible because intracranial hypertension does not subside after returning to Earth. 4.3. Benefits Expected for Astronauts Living and Working in Microgravity We have continued to unravel the effects of space flight on OLPs. The data presented here are examples of changes produced by microgravity on OLPs. Although these changes appear not to be deleterious to the vast majority of OLPs, they are very significant and long-lasting. Both OLPs proliferation and autophagy were enhanced by microgravity. Both mechanisms appear to exclude each other; the more cells there are in the brain, the more autophagy increases, resulting in benefits to astronauts that continue to live long lives upon returning to Earth. Moreover, to live on the Moon or Mars, gravity might mitigate the two phenomena to some extent, but they might persist while living in space. More research is needed to ascertain if both phenomena eventually subside as a function of time on Earth. An epigenetic study to understand the regulation of specific genes involved in both proliferation and autophagy will provide crucial information to modulate both phenomena in astronauts’ brains, and alleviate intracranial hypertension during and after space flight. 4.4. Benefits Expected for Humanity on Earth Originally, our long-term goal was and still is to produce healthy, transplantable, and functional OLPs in adequate numbers to be used for cell replacement therapies to treat myelin deficiencies and cerebral palsy on Earth. The use of the microgravity approach for a short term exposure i.e., 24 h to 72 h will be beneficial in that it would expedite the production of healthy OLPs to address both developmental disabilities and degenerative neural disorders, such as in the premature neonate or patients with other leukodystrophies and neurodegenerative disorders, such as MS for which currently there are no cures. Nonetheless, one must be cautious when using microgravity to generate large cell populations as other behaviors, such as a shortening of the cell cycle, may arise.",

Copyright notice ID: 9953055 PMID: 36830573 Abstract Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the consequences of long-term space missions. Here we examined the behavior of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) after space flight using time-lapse microscopy. We show that most OLPs divided more than ground control (GC) counterparts did. Nonetheless, a subpopulation of OLPs flown to space presented a significant increase in autophagic cell death. Examination of the proteomic profile of the secretome of space flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) revealed that the stress protein heat shock protein-90 beta “HSP-90β” was the 5th most enriched (6.8 times) and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine “SPARC” was the 7th most enriched (5.2 times), with respect to ground control cells. SPARC induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which leads to autophagy. Given the roles and importance of these two proteins in mammalian cells’ metabolism, their upregulation may hold the key to modulating cell proliferation and autophagy, in order to mitigate ICP and VIIP during and after space missions. Keywords: space flight, oligodendrocyte progenitors, autophagy, proliferation, visual impairment intracranial pressure, intracranial hypertension, SPARC, HSP-901. Introduction It has been reported that microgravity induces intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) in astronauts after long-duration space missions. Both ICP and VIIP remain when astronauts return to Earth. These conditions represent a risk factor and a potential limitation to long-duration space missions such as flying to the Moon or Mars. The central nervous system (CNS) is a complex system that governs voluntary and involuntary functions and behaviors. It is continually adapting to challenges from the environment to sustain its functions. We have previously reported that oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells of the CNS, proliferate more in simulated microgravity (Sim-µG) and after exposure to it [1]. We have also reported that sim-µG enhances energy metabolism in OLPs [2]. The first goal of this investigation was to ascertain if human OLPs flown to space would proliferate more after space flight. We hypothesized that OLPs would have increased proliferation while in space and that this could be contributing to ICP and VIIP in astronauts that have flown to space because the symptoms do not disappear with time back on Earth. These findings led us to investigate (i) if space microgravity would produce similar results and (ii) how OLPs adapt to the Earth’s gravity after space flight. For this purpose, we used time-lapse imaging and analysis. Another goal was to (iii) study the secretome of OLPs exposed to space microgravity (SPC-OLPs) and compare it with ground control (GC) cells.2. Methods 2.1. Cells and Culture System Two years prior to the space flight, we tested several cell lines to select the most suitable for the space flight in terms of survival and hardware material compatibility, adequate seeding cell number to ensure cells would have enough nutrients for the duration of the trip, and so on. We finally selected a homogeneous population of neural stem cells, NSCs, which was obtained from human induced pluripotent stem cells, hiPS. The original hiPS cell line “CS83iCTR33-n1” (fibroblasts) was “reprogrammed” and provided to us by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Los Angeles CA. via a material transfer agreement. These cells were converted to “OLPs” using the protocol shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Ectoderm selection was performed by exposing hiPS to SB431542 (SB) and dorsomorphin (DM) to instruct ectoderm formation preferentially, while inhibiting endodermal and mesodermal commitment. Once specified, a stock of hiPS-derived OLPs was created for all pre-flight and post flight experiments in order to keep passage number low (18 passages maximum). Details of the procedure described here have been published [2]. This medium was designed to induce and maintain the OLP-phenotype. OLPs flew to space in OSM with N2 + B27. (Figure modified from [3]). The composition of the basal “OSM” (oligodendrocyte specification medium) is shown in Table 1.Dissolve the listed components in 500 mL of D-MEM/F12 medium (High glucose) to make OSMb (basal). To prepare OSM complete (OSMc), we added 10 µL of both N2 and B-27 with retinoic acid to OSMb. To prepare “welcoming medium” (WM), we used OSMb + IGF-1 (final concentration of 88–100 ng/mL, freshly prepared) without B-27 or N2, and allowed them to recover for six hours in the incubator prior to placing them in the imaging system.2.2. Hardware and Space Flight The BioScience-4 mission launched onboard the Space-X 21 Dragon capsule on 6 December 2020. This is the first study to investigate the effects of space flight on human normal hiPS-derived OLPs. For the space flight, OLPs were seeded onto passive 8-well Petri dishes from Airbus-Kiwi (Friedrichshafen, DE), on floating mesh carriers 2 mm × 2 mm to which cells adhered firmly; this feature was necessary to ensure that cells would not detach and die during launching or while returning to Earth. OLPs were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and installed in the STAaRS F-1 Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 (STAaRS F-1) at 37 °C. Cells remained onboard the ISS for 38 days and then returned to Earth (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab OLPs, as part of the Bioscience-4 Space Biology NASA experiment, flew to the ISS on board SpaceX-21. This experiment was launched on the 6 of December, 2020, and landed (splashed-down) on the 13 of January, 2021. Cells remained in µG at an orbit height of 254 miles. The experiment is called “passive” because it was designed to mimic the trajectory astronauts’ brains undergo during space flight (i.e., launch, stay in space, and splash down when returning to Earth) without manipulation or medium change. (A) Example of mesh without cells. (B) View of a mesh carrier populated with cells after space flight. (C) View of the hardware units upon return to our laboratory. Ground control cells were seeded and maintained at 37 °C in the same type of hardware and the same conditions in our laboratory, the only difference was the Earth gravity vs. space microgravity. Upon splash-down, they were transferred from Kennedy Space Center to World Carrier and brought to our laboratory (UCLA) at 37 °C.2.3. Time-Lapse of SPC-OLPs Behavior after Space Flight Upon arrival, cells were removed from the flying hardware and re-suspended in a culture medium designed to allow them to move forward in the lineage. This culture medium was made with OSMb + IGF-1 (final concentration of 88–100 ng/mL, freshly prepared) without B-27 or N2 and seeded onto T-25 flasks or flaskets with a glass bottom, at the initial seeding cell density of 0.3 × 106 OLPs per flasket. OLPs were allowed to recover for six hours in the incubator prior to being placed in the imaging system. For details on the functioning of this hardware, please see information from Yuri (Available online: https://www.yurigravity.com/, accessed on 30 November 2012). We used the Zeiss Axio Observer 7 fully motorized inverted research microscope with the Zeiss Axiocam 506 monochrome camera with Zeiss ZEN software, and definite focus equipped with the full Incubation XL chamber (Zeiss) for temperature and CO2 control with motorized scanning stage.2.4. Secretome Collection and Proteomics Analysis For this part of the study, we chose the Automated Type IV hardware from Yuri, which allows for collecting culture medium in an automated manner. OLPs were seeded onto the mesh carriers to maximize the growth surface for the cells and to support strong adherence to it so that cells would not detach during take-off and re-entry. The experiment is summarized below (Figure 3). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Synopsis of the automated experiments. OLPs, as part of the Bioscience-4 Space Biology NASA experiment, flew to the ISS (A) on board SpaceX-16, together with the passive experiments. (B) Timeline on when the conditioned medium (secretome) for the initial portion of the flight was removed on T+2 d after OLPs reached space. This medium was in contact with the cells for 26 days, at which time the second culture medium was recovered into the second tank just prior to unberth, in order to capture the molecules secreted solely while cells were onboarding the ISS. During ascent, descent, and space flight, cells were maintained at 37 °C. Upon arrival to our laboratory, the culture medium that fed the cells during space flight (secretome) was recovered from the hardware separately, the medium from each well was recovered separately and placed in numbered tubes with addition of proteases inhibitor cocktail, and saved frozen at −80 °C. (C) View of the cell chamber where mesh carriers with cells and the travel culture medium travelled. (D,E) Tanks that contained the fresh medium to be released at T+2 to start the experiment. Tank 2 (E arrow) contained the second fresh medium with which the cells came back to Earth.2.5. Secretome Proteomic Profile The conditioned medium samples (secretome) were thawed and vortexed for 20 s. The samples were spun for 30 min at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm and the supernatant was collected. For these samples, serum Albumin and IgG were removed using Thermo Scientific Albumin/IgG Removal Kit. Next, the depleted serum samples were concentrated and exchanged into 2D Lysis buffer (Sigma Millipore, St. Louis, MO, USA) (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, and 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). Protein concentration was measured in all samples using the Bio-Rad protein assay method. Gel layout, Internal Standard (Cy2), OLPs_0G (Cy3), OLPs_1G (Cy5). Internal Standard was made up of an equal amount of protein from each sample. CyDye labeling: For each sample, 30 µg of protein was mixed with 1.0 μL of diluted CyDye, and kept in dark on ice for 30 min. The labeling reaction was stopped by adding 1.0 µL of 10 mM lysine to each sample, and incubating in the dark on ice for an additional 15 min. The labeled samples were then mixed. The 2X 2D Sample buffer (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mg/mL DTT, 2% pharmalytes, and trace amount of bromophenol blue), 100 µL destreak solution, and Rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mg/mL DTT, 1% pharmalytes and trace amount of bromophenol blue) were added to the labeling mix to make the total volume of 250 µL. We mixed well and spun before loading the labeled samples into the strip holder.2.6. IEF and SDS-PAGE After loading the labeled samples, IEF (pH3-10 Non-Linear) was run following the protocol provided by GE Healthcare. Upon finishing the IEF, the IPG strips were incubated in the freshly made equilibration buffer-1 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, trace amount of bromophenol blue and 10 mg/mL DTT) for 15 min with gentle shaking. Then, the strips were rinsed in the freshly made equilibration buffer-2 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, trace amount of bromophenol blue, and 45 mg/mL Iodoacetamide) for 10 min with gentle shaking. Next, the IPG strips were rinsed in the SDS-gel running buffer before transferring into 13.5% SDS-gels. The SDS-gels were run at 15 °C until the dye front ran out of the gels.2.7. Image Scan and Data Analysis Gel images were scanned immediately following the SDS-PAGE using Typhoon TRIO (GE Healthcare). The scanned images were then analyzed by Image Quant software (version 6.0, GE Healthcare), which is based on a scanning laser-illumination system and photomultiplier detector, followed by in-gel analysis using DeCyder software (version 5.0, GE Healthcare). The fold change of the protein expression levels was obtained from in-gel DeCyder analysis.2.8. Spot Picking and Trypsin Digestion The spots of interest were picked up by Ettan Spot Picker (Amersham BioSciences) based on the in-gel analysis and spot picking design by DeCyder software. The gel spots were washed and then digested in-gel with modified porcine trypsin protease (Trypsin Gold, Promega). The digested tryptic peptides were desalted by Zip-tip C18 (Millipore). Peptides were eluted from the Zip-tip with 0.5 ul of matrix solution (ά-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) and spotted on the AB SCIEX MALDI plate (Opti-TOFTM 384 Well Insert).2.9. Mass Spectrometry MALDI-TOF MS and TOF/TOF tandem MS/MS were performed on an AB SCIEX TOF/TOF™ 5800 System (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired in reflectron positive ion mode, averaging 4000 laser shots per spectrum. TOF/TOF tandem MS fragmentation spectra were acquired for each sample, averaging 4000 laser shots per fragmentation spectrum on each of the 10 most abundant ions present in each sample (excluding trypsin autolytic peptides and other known background ions).2.10. Database Search Both the resulting peptide mass and the associated fragmentation spectra were submitted to the GPS Explorer workstation equipped with the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science) to search the database of the  non-redundant (nr) or Swiss-Prot-database. Searches were performed without constraining protein molecular weight or isoelectric point, with variable carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine residues. One missed cleavage was also allowed in the search parameters. Candidates with either protein score C.I.% or Ion C.I.% greater than 95 were considered significant. For the analysis, we have considered only those pathways with a probability score, corrected for false discovery rate by the Benjamini–Hochberg method, p < 0.05.2.11. Statistics Proteomics data displayed a normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test) and are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses for cell cycle duration and cell counts were performed using One-Way ANOVA, followed by Tukey post hoc test, in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.3. Results Upon return from the space flight on board SpX-21, OLPs were recovered from the passive flying hardware, seeded onto glass bottom flaskets and placed in the time-lapse system to ascertain cell proliferation. With time, both GC and SPC-flown OLPs increased in number, and the differences were significant across groups and at each time point studied (Figure 4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Twenty-five hours after the experiment had started there were more than twice as many OLPs and although GC cells also proliferated, there were more cells in the SPC-flown group, and these differences were significant at 12 h and 25 h, but by the 50th hour, the differences were not significant anymore, as if they were tending to adapt to Earth gravity. Values are expressed as the mean ± SD of the total number of cells per field, from six different fields in three separate cultures. * p ˂ 0.05, ** p ˂ 0.01.Space-flown OLPs had recovered well from the space flight; some were round with small, or no cell processes, and most of these cells were dividing. We also studied cytokinesis in GC-OLPs; their appearance was slightly more mature than SPC-OLPs. They bore long processes and were mostly bipolar at the beginning of the study. Nonetheless, with time, they acquired more cell processes. We found that the cell cycle in these cells was more within a normal range between 16.5 h and 25 h. Within the SPC-OLPs group, we also found a subpopulation of SPC-OLPs that divided much faster; their cytokinesis occurred within 6.6 h, at least twice. Examples of cytokinesis in space-flown OLPs and GC counterparts are shown (Figure 5A–F) and (Figure 5G–L). Figure 5. Open in a new tab After seeding, SPC-OLPs were placed in the time-lapse microscope system with an incubator to control temperature and the CO2 environment. We captured phase contrast images every 10 min to visualize the changes occurring in cells after space flight and, in particular, cytokinesis. Sequential view of SPC-Flown OLPs (A–F).

(L) One of these cells divided again 20h after it had been generated (arrow). The second cell in the top right did not divide during this interval.3.1. Space-Flown OLPs Consisted of Three Distinct Sub-Populations We next examined the duration of cytokinesis in SPC-flown and GC-OLPs. Once a cell was identified, it was then studied using reverse-time tracking and verified forward. The cell cycle time was defined as the interval between when a cell was first generated by cytokinesis and when that cell subsequently divided, giving birth to two daughter cells. Quantitative data for both groups, GC-OLPs and SPC-OLPs, showed that GC-OLPs’ cytokinesis ranged between 13.66 h and 20.6 h, averaging 19.76 h. In the case of SPC-OLPs, the vast majority of SPC-flown OLPs had a cell cycle ranging between 14.33 h and 43.3 h with an average of 19.43 h; these differences were not significant (Figure 6A). Thus, the initial study on the duration of the cell cycle from space-flown OLPs appeared to show that the cells had not proliferated significantly faster after space flight when compared to GC-OLPs. Nonetheless, a detailed analysis demonstrated the existence of three subpopulations of OLPs, one exhibiting a long cell cycle (LCC) averaging 19.43 h and a second and third, with smaller OLPs groups exhibiting shorter cell cycles (SCC) with a duration of either 6.6 h or 3.3 h. (Figure 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab (A) The bar graph shows that most of the SPC-flown OLPs exhibited a long cell cycle comparable to GC-OLPs, averaging 19.43 h for SPC-OLPs and 19.76 h for GC-OLPs. The second group of SPC-OLPs divided much faster presenting cytokinesis duration of either 6.6 h (for the vast majority) or 3.3 h. One-way ANOVA showed that these differences were non-significant for the LCC group. In contrast, the differences in the short-cell cycle were significant concerning the long-cell cycle cells and the GC group. (B) The pie graph shows that 97% of SPC-OLPs had an average cell cycle of 19.76 h, while 2.6% displayed a shorter, and 0.4% exhibited even a much shorter cell cycle. Values are expressed as the mean ± SD of three separate cultures. * p ˂ 0.05.3.2. Space Flight Upregulates Autophagy in OLPs Upon return, OLPs were transferred from Kennedy Space Center to UCLA. OLPs were recovered from each well separately and seeded onto separate poly-d-lysine (PdL) coated flaskets using OSM medium supplemented with IGF-1. We observed that the vast majority of the cells proliferated and migrated as expected. Six hours after being seeded, OLPs were placed in the time-lapse microscope system with an incubator to control temperature and the CO2 environment. We captured phase contrast images every 10 min to visualize cell changes after space flight. These cells had recovered well from the space flight, were highly migratory, and the vast majority presented bipolar or tripolar morphology. Nonetheless, some were round and adhered to the substratum, but without cell processes. In addition, we also found that some of these OLPs flown to space displayed autophagy; the number of autophagy instances is shown in Figure 7. Thus, although only a small percentage (0.12% of GC vs. 0.22% of SPC) of cells displayed autophagy, significantly more of these events were observed after space flight. Figure 7. Open in a new tab The field was examined to identify OLPs undergoing autophagy. Once a cell was identified, it was then studied using reverse-time tracking.

The event was completed within the lapse of 20 h—also see supplemental time lapse (TL) TL-1. (G) This bar graph shows the incidence of autophagic cell death in GC and SPC-flown OLPs three weeks after returning to Earth. The average total number of cells per field displaying autophagy in the GC group was 22 OLPs. In contrast, in SPC-OLPs cultures, 72 cells exhibited such behavior. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (*) p < 0.01.3.3. Secretome Proteomics The culture medium that fed the cells during space flight was recovered from each tank separately. This medium is commonly known as the conditioned medium. For the purpose of this paper, we refer to it as “secretome”. Examination of the secretome of SPC-flown OLPs, using mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, revealed that heat shock protein 90 alpha/beta (HSP-90αβ) was the fifth most abundant, followed by SPARC seventh, and HSP90β eighth most abundant, and they were significantly increased in the secretome produced while OLPs were in space. Their enrichment, with respect to Earth-grown OLPs, is shown (Table 2). Other proteins within the first seven most enriched were Glyoxalase Domain Containing 4, GC protein, prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit beta, and Homeobox C11; these are to be discussed in separate papers currently in preparation.

Discussion Gravity, the force that impacts our development, daily lives, and metabolic processes, is an integral part of our life, physiology, and cognition. The absence of gravity or its variation would consequently alter the development and function of all living organisms and systems. The space era has brought knowledge on the response of biological systems to microgravity. Weightlessness has been shown to cause cell damage and impair the cell cycle in various biological systems, including transiently in NSCs [4,5]. We and others [1,2,6,7] have started to unravel how CNS biological processes occur in µG. We have previously shown that the cell cycle is shortened and that more OLPs are produced in sim-µG [1]. We have also shown that OLPs exhibited an elevated energetic state and enhanced lipid secretion by human OLPs after 72 h in sim-µG [2]. Therefore, the absence of gravity provides us with a unique opportunity to gain new insights into the developmental and functional aspects of the CNS. With this in mind, we sought to determine how OLPs would behave upon exposure to space-µG. 4.1. OLPs Cytokinesis after Space Flight Cell cycle regulation and functional maturation in oligodendroglia (OLs) are two critical functions that, when in balance, ensure normal CNS development, as well as healthy OLs and myelin throughout the life of the organism. Upon lineage commitment, OLPs are generated mainly through symmetric self-renewing divisions [8]. OLPs’ cell cycle length in embryonic (E) life varies, and its frequency increases from 6 h (h) to 13 h, and subsequently, it extends up to 22 h in embryonic life E-17 [9]. Debate still exists on whether the deceleration of OLPs’ cell cycle is an inherent property of OLPs, whether extracellular signals determine it, and whether the microenvironment is conditioned by themselves and/or the presence of added mitogens and other trophic factors, including neuronal signaling [10]. We believe that both aspects act in concert to support OLP maturation towards myelinating oligodendrocytes. Initially, space-flown OLPs appeared to have not proliferated significantly more after space flight when compared to GC-OLPs. Nonetheless, a more exhaustive analysis demonstrated the existence of three subpopulations of OLPs, one exhibiting a long cell cycle similar in length to the GC cells, and two exhibiting shorter cell cycles of either 6.6 h or 3.3 h. Thus, compared to reports indicating that the perinatal OLPs cell cycle averages 16 h [11], our SPC-OLPs appeared to cover both the dividing pace of the early embryonic and perinatal OLPs cell cycle. Yet, we have no explanation for the even shorter cell cycle. We and others have described the well-defined developmental stages of OLs, from OLPs to mature myelinating OLs [12]. Each stage has “stage-specific” markers, which are molecules made by these cells as they progress along their lineage. Although our resources and cell numbers obtained after space flight did not allow for epigenetic analyses, the proteomic analysis of SPC-flown secretome was very instrumental: it revealed that while in space, OLPs secreted 3.5 times more transferrin than GC-OLPs, indicating that they were at an early OLP stage while in space [3]. Moreover, their proliferative characteristics acquired while in space were preserved upon return to Earth, as if they remembered having been in µG [3]. The global proteomics analysis is still an ongoing project. Proteins within the first seven most enriched were Glyoxalase Domain Containing 4, GC protein, prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit beta, and Homeobox C11. The potential relevance of these proteins will be discussed in separate papers currently in preparation. Nonetheless, we considered it of utmost importance to report the abundance of HSP90αβ, HSP90β, and SPARC because these proteins relate directly to the behavior of space-flown OLPs, as well as to autophagy. These experiments were designed to ascertain what molecules were produced by OLPs while in space. We were very successful because we discovered that OLPs are the cell population we should focus our efforts on to address ICP and VIIP. A cluster of molecules involved in essential roles in mammalian cellular homeostasis are the HSP90 family, and co-chaperones are the most important elements for the regulation of cytosolic HSP90. We have recently reported, using immunofluorescence, that OLPs flown to space expressed HSP-90β [3]. Proteomic analysis of the secretome demonstrated upregulation of this gene product. On Earth, the cytosolic form of HSP90 supports cell survival and controls the cell cycle, among other roles [13]. Several types of stress including reactive oxygen species, irradiation, and tissue injury result in secretion of HSP90α [14], and secreted HSPαß is beneficial because it promotes cell motility for wound healing [15]. Yet, some secreted forms have been reported to contribute to the development and progression of serious cancers and neurodegenerative diseases [13]. Therefore, ascertaining the enhanced presence of HSP90αβ and HSPβ in SPC-OLPs opens the possibility of using it as a target molecule to modulate cell proliferation in astronauts’ brains. Nonetheless, extensive research is needed to understand how these molecules interact in the entire brain, as opposed to one cell type in culture. Understanding the regulation and function of the HSP90 family members in microgravity is of the essence to harness specific countermeasures towards prevention and treatment of IP in astronauts.4.2. Enhanced Autophagy in SPC-OLPs Degradation and recycling of dysfunctional proteins or whole organelles is a lysosome-mediated mechanism known as autophagy. This process ensures homeostasis in the CNS and other tissues [16,17] and it may lead to either cell survival or cell death, depending on the type and extent of the insult or cellular stress [18]. A protein acidic and rich in cysteine, “SPARC”, is involved in autophagy, and it is a matrix-associated protein. It is required for calcification of collagen in bone too, but it is also involved in extracellular matrix synthesis and cell morphological changes. In addition, SPARC has been associated with tumor suppression. Nonetheless, it has also been correlated with metastasis and tumorigenesis. Its capacity to induce a tumorigenic phenotype has been attributed to the modulation of signaling for integrins and growth factors influencing malignant progression, including extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, immune modulation, and metastasis. In the CNS, SPARC upregulates glioma matrix by promoting collagen fibrillogenesis [19]. On the other hand, SPARC induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which leads to autophagy [20]. Recent studies have provided evidence suggesting that simulated µG, using random positioning machines (RPMs), activate autophagy in RAW264.7 pre-osteoclast cells and seminomal cells [21,22]. Moreover, autophagy protects against µG-induced ER stress in HUVEC cells [23]. In the present study, SPARC was the seventh most expressed protein in the secretome from SPC-OLPs. When compared with the secretome from ground control OLPs, the level of SPARC contained in the secretome was 5.1 times higher. The pleiotropic effects of SPARC reflect the complexity of its interactions depending on the cell type. It plays roles in pro and anti-proliferation; it elicits endothelial reticulum (ER) stress that leads to autophagy-mediated apoptosis; it is a cell morphogen and can act as an oncogene, as well as tumor suppressor. Thus, understanding the effects of space flight on OLPs and how to modulate such effects are of the essence, as astronauts embark on more extended duration space travel such as to the Moon and Mars. Both of our OLPs, ground control and space-flown, remained unattended for 45 days, which could be considered a stressful situation, and which would suggest that autophagy occurred out of starvation. Nonetheless, while we found autophagic behavior in GC-OLPs, these events were significantly increased in SPC-OLPs. In addition, the time-lapse study was performed on cells that were fed with fresh medium prior to the start of imaging. Thus, space flight enhanced the autophagic properties of OLPs, which indicates that cells remembered having been transiently in microgravity and that despite being back to terrestrial gravity, these physiological changes while in space persisted. Epigenetic analysis to better understand these “memory” mechanisms is of the essence. Nonetheless, increased proliferation in SPC-OLPs and SPARC upregulation explain how nature may be using this mechanism to compensate for increased proliferation by increasing autophagy in OLPs exposed to space microgravity to maintain healthy cell numbers. Although our results do not demonstrate the occurrence of this phenomenon in the astronauts’ brains, it is plausible because intracranial hypertension does not subside after returning to Earth.4.3. Benefits Expected for Astronauts Living and Working in Microgravity We have continued to unravel the effects of space flight on OLPs. The data presented here are examples of changes produced by microgravity on OLPs. Although these changes appear not to be deleterious to the vast majority of OLPs, they are very significant and long-lasting. Both OLPs proliferation and autophagy were enhanced by microgravity. Both mechanisms appear to exclude each other; the more cells there are in the brain, the more autophagy increases, resulting in benefits to astronauts that continue to live long lives upon returning to Earth. Moreover, to live on the Moon or Mars, gravity might mitigate the two phenomena to some extent, but they might persist while living in space. More research is needed to ascertain if both phenomena eventually subside as a function of time on Earth. An epigenetic study to understand the regulation of specific genes involved in both proliferation and autophagy will provide crucial information to modulate both phenomena in astronauts’ brains, and alleviate intracranial hypertension during and after space flight.4.4. Benefits Expected for Humanity on Earth Originally, our long-term goal was and still is to produce healthy, transplantable, and functional OLPs in adequate numbers to be used for cell replacement therapies to treat myelin deficiencies and cerebral palsy on Earth. The use of the microgravity approach for a short term exposure i.e., 24 h to 72 h will be beneficial in that it would expedite the production of healthy OLPs to address both developmental disabilities and degenerative neural disorders, such as in the premature neonate or patients with other leukodystrophies and neurodegenerative disorders, such as MS for which currently there are no cures. Nonetheless, one must be cautious when using microgravity to generate large cell populations as other behaviors, such as a shortening of the cell cycle, may arise.Table 1. Preparation of OSM basal.

    "abstract": "Abstract Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the sequels of long-term space missions. Here we sought to determine how space microgravity (µG) impacts the metabolomics profile of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased glutamate and energy metabolism while the OLPs were in space for 26 days. We also show that after space flight, OLPs (SPC OLPs) display significantly increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. These data are in agreement with our previous work using simulated microgravity. In addition, our global metabolomics approach allowed for the discovery of endogenous metabolites secreted by OLPs while in space that are significantly modulated by microgravity. Our results provide, for the first time, relevant information about the energetic state of OLPs while in space and after space flight. The functional and molecular relevance of these specific pathways are promising targets for therapeutic intervention for humans in long-term space missions to the moon, Mars and beyond.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Numerous studies have shown that in normal mammalian cells grown in culture, microgravity induces an array of phenomena such as apoptosis and changes in their cytoskeleton, as well as in signal transduction, cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and adhesion. Effects differ depending on the cell type [1]. Microgravity also alters differentiation and augments apoptosis in thyroid carcinoma cells [2,3] and alters breast cancer-derived cells [4]. Microgravity is thus considered as a platform to study the metabolism of normal, developing, mature and cancerous cells, as well as the potential pharmacological approaches to treat, on Earth, neurodegeneration, developmental disabilities and cancer. We have pioneered the study of simulated microgravity (sim-μG) using the “the 3D-clinostat” robot (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) on neural cells and, in particular, neural stem cells and oligodendrocytes (OLs). OLs are the myelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are essential for the efficient synthesis and maintenance of myelin [5,6]. They form the compact segments of the myelin membrane that coil around the axon and allow for the saltatory conduction of action potentials, ensuring the healthy functioning of the CNS. Neurological diseases involving this cell type are characterized by myelin loss and an impairment in nerve conduction. A lack of or damaged myelin is debilitating and disabling because the nerve impulses slow down or even stop, causing neurological deficits. Understanding how OL progenitors (OLPs) differentiate and form myelin sheaths around nerve axons is of interest for the prevention and treatment of myelin-associated diseases. In many cases, OLPs fail to mature and, therefore, they cannot remyelinate axons in dys- and de-myelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease or after a traumatic injury. Moreover, a chronic lack of myelin leads to axonal transection [7]. As neurological impairments have been observed after human space journeys, e.g., intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), we have studied in previous papers the effects of artificial microgravity on cultured OLPs. Our first study using BrdU revealed that rodent and human OLPs displayed enhanced and sustained proliferation while they were in sim-µG with a concomitant shortening of the cell cycle. Moreover, these cells appeared to remember having been in µG and continued to proliferate more after having been placed in Earth’s gravity [8]. More recently, we studied the effects of space-µG on OLPs and found enhanced proliferation [9], yet some of them displayed incomplete cytokinesis [10]. Moreover, based on the expression of stage-specific developmental markers, we discovered that these cells came back in a more immature stage than that of the ground control OLPs [10]. Here we sought to determine A) the impact of space flight on the global metabolomic profile of the secretome produced by OLPs while in space-µG in order to start unraveling extracellular processes, as well as identifying gravitational-sensitive molecules, and B) the energetic status of OLPs after space flight. We found the presence of some gravitational-sensitive molecules, as well as enhanced energy and glutamate metabolism in the secretome generated while the OLPs were on board the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, we found an elevated energy demand in the OLPs upon return to Earth, which led to an increased use of glycolysis to support their energy demands. In previous decades, we have studied and developed culture conditions for OLs and their precursors using biochemical, histochemical and morphological signals [11,12]. Key features of OLs are their well-defined developmental stages characterized by the expression of numerous stage-specific markers from which their expression is either transient or permanent throughout the life of these cells. These markers also define the functions that OLs support, including the production and secretion of the iron carrier glycoprotein transferrin for its autocrine and paracrine use in CNS iron metabolism, as well as the synthesis of all myelin components when OLs mature until they reach the myelinating stage. These stages and markers have been reported and reviewed by us and other scientists [5,13,14]. For the purpose of understanding the contents of the secretome produced by space-flown OLPs, here we use our previous description of these developmental stages [15,16] (Supplementary Figure S1).",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Culture System for OLPs and Pre-Myelinating OLs For the present study, we used human induced pluripotent (hiPS)-derived OLPs. Four years prior to the space flight, we established a culture system with a homogeneous population of NSCs that was obtained from the original hiPS cell line “CS83iCTR-33-n1” (fibroblasts), “reprogrammed” and provided to us by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center via a material transfer agreement. We then prepared embryoid bodies and subsequently converted them to “OLPs” using the protocol previously described by Espinosa-Jeffrey et al. [12]. For the purpose of this study, we used the oligodendrocyte specification medium (OSM), whose composition is shown in Table 1. This medium was used for pre-flight and during the experiment on board the ISS. The return medium is named BS1; to prepare BS1, we used OSM without N2 and B-27 and added Insulin Growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (Table 1). Table 1. Complete DMEM/F12 medium with supplements. Reagents OSM BS1 Insulin 10 µg/mL 10 µg/mL Transferrin 100 µg/mL 100 µg/mL Putrescine 32.2 µg/mL 32.2 µg/mL Na-bicarbonate 4.4 µg/mL 4.4 µg/mL D(+) galactose 9.2 mg/mL 9.2 mg/mL Kanamycin 16 ng/mL 16 ng/mL Na-selenite 6.4 ng/mL 6.4 ng/mL N2 2% 0 B-27 2% 0 IGF-1 160 ng/µL Open in a new tab 2.2. Hardware and Space Flight OLPs grow optimally at a pH of 7.4; the culture medium was buffered with HEPES and its pH was adjusted to 7.4 for the space flight. The culture medium that fed the cells during the ascent to space was recovered automatically from the cell chamber. Subsequently, the fresh medium in tank 1 fed the OLPs while onboard the ISS for 26 days, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Collection system of secretome produced while cells were in space. Human OLPs, as part of the Bioscience-4 Space Biology NASA experiment, flew to the ISS on board SpaceX-21. This experiment was launched on 6 December 2020, and splashed down on 13 January 2021. These “active” experiments were designed to collect the conditioned medium (secretome) after the OLPs reached space and just before unberth to be able to capture the molecules secreted solely while cells were onboard the ISS (A). (B) The timeline depicting the handover moment and pre-launch. The travel culture medium was removed at T + 2 days and a fresh medium was left with the cells for 26 days, at which time the second culture medium was added to the cultures (a total of 26d + 2d) in space and the secretome was produced over 26 days while in space. (C) Cells travelled at 37 °C while in space for 28 days in the OSM contained in the cell chamber (asterisk). Cells were fed with BS1 on day T + 29 and returned to Earth in the same culture medium. The return medium was BS1 (see Table 1) from day 29 until delivery to the PI at UCLA. (D) View of the mesh carrier (2 mm × 2 mm). (E,F) Underneath the cell chamber, there are two tanks containing the fresh medium where the secretome was collected prior to unberth (arrows). This set of chambers was returned to Earth at 37 °C with a slow cool down in the second medium. The same number of chambers were flown to space or stayed on Earth in our laboratory as ground control. The OLPs travelled back from space in the second medium. Ground control OLPs were also seeded in these containers on mesh carriers and maintained in our laboratory at the same temperature, culture medium and conditions of space-flown OLPs. The only difference was Earth’s gravity vs. space microgravity. Upon splashdown, they were transferred from the Kennedy Space Center to the World Carrier and brought to our laboratory (UCLA) at 37 °C. (F) The mesh carriers populated with cells were transferred to poly-d-lysine=coated culture flasks and fed with a fresh medium. The secretome of each container and the tanks were all collected separately in numbered tubes and stored frozen at −80 °C. This medium is generally known as the conditioned medium. For the purpose of this manuscript, we refer to it as “secretome”. 2.3. Secretome Metabolomics Metabolic profiles were obtained for each individual group using the Metabolon Platform (Metabolon). Briefly, each sample or “group” consisted of 5 biological replicate specimens per group. Three groups of samples were compared: OSM 26D (n = 5), which consisted of the culture medium alone incubated in the same conditions and the hardware used for our cell cultures, 1G OLPs (n = 5) maintained in Earth gravity, and SPC OLPs (n = 5). Post-harvest, the conditioned medium was used to analyze, in a comparative manner, the molecules secreted by the OLPs in both conditions. This medium was subjected to methanol extraction, then split into aliquots for analysis via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) in the positive (two methods), negative or polar ion mode. Metabolites were identified via the automated comparison of ion features to a reference library of chemical standards, followed by visual inspection for quality control, as previously described [17]. Compound Identification: Raw data was extracted, peak-identified and QC processed. Biochemical identifications are based on three criteria: retention index within a narrow RI window of the proposed identification, accurate mass match to the library +/− 10 ppm, and the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the experimental data and authentic standards. The retention time/index (RI), mass to charge ratio (m/z), and chromatographic data (including MS/MS spectral data) are used simultaneously to distinguish and differentiate biochemicals. The MS/MS scores are based on the comparison of ions present in the experimental spectrum to the ions present in the library spectrum. While there may be similarities between these molecules based on just one of these factors, the use of all three data points simultaneously, provides more accuracy for the identification of the biochemicals. The repertoire of “standards”, consisting of 3300 purified molecules, is available for this type of analysis. For structurally unnamed biochemical, mass spectral entries have been created and identified by virtue of their recurrent nature (both chromatographic and mass spectral). The asterisk in figures indicates that this compound has been identified based on two of the three characteristics mentioned above. Compounds identified in this manner, have the potential for their future identification by classical structural analysis. Alternatively, a new standard may be added to the library and the biochemical name confirmed. 2.4. Statistical Analysis for the Metabolomics Study To determine the statistical significance, Welsh’s two-sample t-tests were performed on the SPC, 1G and control medium groups of n = 5 in ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) or “R” to compare data between them; p < 0.05 was considered significant (Array Studio, RRID:SCR_010970). The false discovery rate (Q-value) was calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies, with Q < 0.05 used as an indication of high confidence in a result. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) were performed in ArrayStudio. Random forest analysis was performed as described [18,19]. For the box plots, whiskers reflect the 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying the 25th to 75th quartiles); the bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” represents the population mean, [20]. We only considered the molecules that presented a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the groups shown, with a metabolite ratio of <1.00. 2.5. Launch to the ISS The Bioscience-4 mission launched onboard the Space-X 21 Dragon capsule on 6 December 2020. This is the first study to investigate the proliferation of human normal hiPS-derived OLPs in space microgravity. For space flight, the OLPs were seeded onto passive 8-well Petri dishes from Airbus–Kiwi (Friedrichshafen, Germany) on floating mesh carriers measuring 2 mm × 2 mm, to which the cells adhered firmly; this feature was necessary to ensure that the cells would not detach and die during launching or while returning to Earth. The OLPs were flown to the ISS and installed in the Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 (STAaRS F-1) at 37 °C. The cells remained onboard the ISS for 39 days and 9 h and then returned to Earth (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Synopsis of passive experiments. OLPs came back alive and were used for the respirometry analysis, a part of the Bioscience-4 space biology NASA experiment. These cells were flown to the ISS on board SpaceX-21 (A). It was launched on 6 December 2020 and landed (splashdown) on 13 January 2021. The cells remained in microgravity for 38 days. Its orbit height was 254 miles; its speed at orbit was 4.76 miles/s; and maximal speed reached 17,400 mph. On Earth, humans are exposed to 3 to 4 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation from natural sources per year, mainly from cosmic rays that make it through the atmosphere. On the ISS, astronauts receive about 150 mGv per six months. For the current mission, the average daily total radiation dose was 0.425 (mGv) on board the space station. This experiment is called “passive” because it was designed to mimic the trajectory that astronauts’ brains undergo during space flight (i.e., launch, stay in space, and splashdown when returning to Earth) without manipulation or medium change.

The same number of chambers was flown to space or stayed on Earth in our laboratory as ground control. Ground control cells were also seeded in these containers and maintained at the same temperature and conditions in our laboratory; the only difference was gravity vs. microgravity. (F) Secretome collected from each well separately. Upon splashdown, they were transferred from the Kennedy Space Center to the World Carrier and brought to our laboratory (UCLA) at 37 °C. 2.6. Cellular Bioenergetics Upon return from space, we ascertained a drop of pH from 7.4 to 7.1, which should represent the negligible effect of CO2 levels on the cells’ metabolism. For the assay, the OLPs were seeded onto an XF24 Cell Culture Microplate (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 5 × 104 cells per well in OSM. The cells were kept for 24 h in standard culture conditions (37 °C, 4.5% CO2). The following day, the wells were filled with fresh OSM. The following day, some of the supernatant was removed from the well plates. We used an XF24 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA) to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). The OCR and ECAR reflect the rates of cellular respiration and glycolysis, respectively. Measurements were performed with the cells in unbuffered Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 1 mM of pyruvate, 2 mM of glutamine, and 25 mM of glucose. Measures were recorded before (basal reading) and after the sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone/myxothiazol. The mitochondrial respiration was the difference between the total and rotenone/myxothiazol response. The maximal OCR was the response to the FCCP, whereas the maximal ECAR was the response to oligomycin. Values were normalized to the cellular protein concentration, determined with the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in all experiments.",
    "results": "3. Results 3.1. Global Profile of the Secretome from the Different Treatments Secretomes of the OLPs kept for 26 days in 1G (1G OLP 26D) or SPC (SPC OLP 26D) were compared to the reference medium (OSM alone), using five biological replicates (see Section 2). Their mass spectra were globally examined, then compared one by one for the intensity of their components’ signals, to evidence a specific profile for each of these groups. Altogether, 424 signals were recorded, among which 372 were identified. Table 2 compares in a global way the mass spectra of the two groups of secretomes to those of the OSM alone. They display differences in the number of signals whose intensity is modified. There were more metabolites that increased in the presence of cells (157 and 182 in 1G and SPC, respectively; p < 0.05) compared to decreased metabolites (90 and 55 in 1G and SPC, respectively; p < 0.05). Importantly, there were 136 metabolites that increased and 62 metabolites that decreased in SPC vs. 1G. Thus, after 26 days, an increase was observed for ca. 60% of the signals present in the secretome of the cells kept in 1G, while this increase was of ca. 40% in space; when these secretomes are compared to the OSM, a larger number of metabolites was secreted at normal gravity than in its absence. The osmolality box plot represents the cumulative signal intensities in cell secretomes. The osmolality was higher in the presence of cells than in the media alone, and was increased in the cells at 0G compared to 1G (Figure 3A). Altogether, these results indicate a quantitative and qualitative variation in the secretome of cells at 0G compared to 1G. These changes in intensity do not equally affect all signals: the plot in Figure 3B (random forest analysis) shows the top metabolites (notably amino acids and xenobiotics) differentiating the OSM 26D medium from the secretomes, either in 1G or SPC conditions.

The random forest analysis (B) represents the 30 top-ranking biochemicals in the secretomes. 3.2. Glycolysis and Energy-Related Metabolism The comparison of the control medium and the secretomes from the OLPs grown in SPC or 1G shows that the SPC OLPs secreted about half of the pyruvate and phosphates of the 1G OLPs, suggesting the high energy requirements of OLPs in space. Both the SPC and 1G secretomes contained elevated levels of lactate, citrate, aconitate and malate vs. OSM but at levels between 1G and SPC, indicating a comparable metabolism in the first part of the TCA cycle. In contrast, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate and malate displayed increased levels in both the SPC and 1G secretomes, but with a larger increase in SPC, suggesting a change in glutaminolysis and/or a BCCA catabolism influx in SPC compared to 1G (see TCA cycle, Figure 4. The scaled intensity figures illustrate how the 1G and SPC secretomes differ for their contents in pyruvate and fumarate. Pyruvate (a product of the glutamate pathway) is one of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production and it was decreased in the OLPs flown to space. It fuels the TCA cycle (glycolysis pathway scheme), which generates energy (stored as phosphorylated and reduced coenzymes), while fumarate and malate are end products in this cycle (Table 3 and Figure 4), as already reported [16]. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of metabolite utilization by 0G and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more fumarate than their 1G counterparts. OLPs from both groups secreted high levels of citrate and lactate, although with a slight but significantly higher level in 0G OLPs. (n = 5).

Differences in Glutamate Metabolism The detected metabolites were classified by their metabolic identity. Our present data confirm that OLs secrete glutamate metabolites into their milieu: α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), (1G), glutamine, and other glutamate derivatives were released at a high level in both 1G and SPC conditions vs. OSM; among those, the release was 40 to 55% higher in space for glutamine, glutamate and α-KG, while 4-hydroxy- and ß-citryl-glutamate derivatives were lower (20–30%). N-acetyl-glutamate was lower in the 1G medium than in OSM but higher in SPC vs. OSM, suggesting a shift from uptake to secretion in 1G to SPC. The scaled intensity block diagrams for glutamate, glutamine and α-KG illustrate that the three of them are released by the cells, and that this release is accentuated by SPC (Figure 5). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Comparison of metabolite utilization by SPC and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more glutamate and glutamine while both groups secreted similar levels of alpha-ketoglutarate (1G) (n = 5). For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while the plus sign (+) represents population mean; for details, see [20]. 3.4. Differences in Lipid Metabolism Glycerophosphate lipids (phospholipids) generated higher signals in the cell secretomes and were more secreted by SPC cells vs. 1G cells, consistent with previous observations [16]. However, phosphatidyl-cholines with short chains of unsaturated fatty acids and lysophospholipids (non myelin-specific species) were also more detected in cell secretome, but at a lower level in SPC than 1G. In the case of sphingomyelins, their levels of secretion were similar between the 1G and SPC OLPs. Taken together, these observations indicate that our OLPs have their developmental program at the very least delayed in the absence of gravity (Figure 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Comparison of metabolite utilization by SPC and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more glycerophosphoinositol than OLPs in 1G. In contrast, SPC OLPs secreted less palmitoyl-GPC than 1G OLPs (n = 5). The asterisk indicates that this compound was identified based on two of the three characteristics mentioned in Methods. Compounds identified in this manner, have the potential for their future identification by classical structural analysis. Alternatively, a new standard may be added to the library and the biochemical name confirmed. For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while the plus sign (+) represents population mean. 3.5. Space Flight Elicits Higher Respiration Rates in hiPS-Derived OLPs In order to ascertain the effects of space-µG on energy metabolism, we compared 1G OLPs and SPC OLPs. We quantified the OCR and ECAR as measures of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, respectively. We found that five days after splashdown, the SPC OLPs presented significantly higher basal, mitochondrial and maximal respiration when compared with the 1G OLPs, suggesting a higher mitochondria-dependent energy demand. In contrast, the glycolysis differences were not statistically significant (Figure 7). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Space-flown OLPs and 1G cells were cultured in Seahorse Bioscience V7 plate for 20 h. A higher basal OCR, mitochondrial and higher maximal OCR showed significant differences with regard to SPC OLPs, indicating that the cells were in a higher bioenergetics state. Interestingly, there were not significant differences for the ECAR. There were 12 samples per experiment. Values are expressed as mean + SD. Student’s t-test revealed that these differences were **: p < 0.01 ***: p < 0.001 vs. respective controls.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion We all were born, developed and have lived in Earth’s gravity and, for technical reasons, the effect of gravity has been, so far, poorly explored, although its mechanical effects are germane to the well-documented effect of cell contacts during their growth, development and differentiation. In our current study, we examined the metabolomic profile of the secretome produced by OLPs in space and discovered subtle but significant changes in the metabolite levels of the SPC OLPs vs. the 1G OLPs. Indeed, we found a differential regulation of metabolites in response to weightlessness. In addition, glutamate production and energy requirements were also increased. 4.1. Glycolysis and Energy Related Metabolites The total energy intake of the brain corresponds to 20% of overall energy intake, even though it weighs 2% of a person’s weight. During development, glucose and lactate are the main source of energy for oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) [21]. OLs use lactate as a source of energy as well as a precursor for lipid synthesis by converting it to pyruvate. Subsequently, pyruvate is transported to the mitochondria for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), or converted to ATP in their cytosol via glycolysis. During development and myelinogenesis, OLs have high energy demands and are extremely vulnerable to energy deprivation [22]. Metabolic dysfunction is commonly associated with MS [23,24]. In these patients, acute hypoxia-like lesions, mitochondrial impairment and a reduction in complex I and complex IV of the electron transport chain are reduced [25]. There are several patterns of de-myelination and several classifications of MS. One is named oligodendrogliopathy, where the cell processes of OLs are dying back, and it is the distinctive characteristic for “pattern III” MS [26]. It has been reported that OLs’ metabolism is impacted by dimethyl-fumarate (DMF, Tecfidera®). This compound is being used for the treatment of MS [27,28]. It is believed that it modulates both antioxidant and lipid metabolism in OLs [29]. Patients treated with this molecule displayed a higher brain magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and this was thought to correlate with the preservation of myelin density [30]. As observed previously in sim-μG, the OLPs secreted more fumarate and methyl-fumarate (mesaconate) in SPC while maintaining their progenitor stage [12]. Here, we show that the OLPs exposed to space μG displayed an enhanced need for energy with regard to their ground control counterparts. In addition, more lactate (produced during anaerobic oxidation to fulfill energy needs) was also significantly released by the SPC OLPs. The use of extra energy in the SPC OLPs cannot be explained through a stimulation of myelin synthesis; glycerate, a building element in the formation of triglycerides, was secreted by these cells, indicating that they were still at the immature developmental stage, while the 1G OLPs may have been moving forward towards maturation as previously demonstrated by Tran et al. [10]. Further studies are needed to ascertain the causes of such enhanced energy consumption by OLPs. 4.2. Glutamate Metabolism The glutamate pathway is a hub: glutamate forms from glutamine via deamination through phosphate-activated glutaminase; it is fed by the glycolysis (with alanine as a by-product); glutamate is also a co-substrate in all reactions catalyzed by aminotransferases, which convert it to α-KG, a key intermediate of the TCA cycle [31]; glutamate generates energy itself (NADH). Astrocytes are thought to be the only suppliers to the glutamate metabolism in the brain [32]. Nonetheless, it has been shown that OLs also express high levels of glutamate synthetase (GS) at the level of the midbrain and the spinal cord [33]. These authors also reported that OLs do not need glutamate for their survival or for their myelinating function, thus indicating that its synthesis in OLs is part of their genetic blueprint, where no neuronal signal is required. GS also catalyzes the metabolization of glutamate into glutamine [33]. But the most important fact is that the selective lack of glutamine and glutamate in the brain results in the neonate’s death [34], and the deletion of glutamate in OLs results in the disruption of neuronal (synaptic) glutamate signaling that consequently alters glutamate-dependent behavior [33]. Our data appear to complement those of the above-mentioned authors: they report that GS expression occurs “late” in their development. Here, we demonstrate that OLs express glutamate at an early, pre-myelinating stage, and OLPs in space secrete more glutamate than in 1G. Therefore, our novel data indicate that not only mature OLs support glutamatergic transmission through GS, but their progenitors may also play an important role in the glutamatergic transmission pathway even before myelination takes place. In another model of cell differentiation, α-KG is shown to induce the demethylation of histones as a cofactor of histone demethylases [35] and hence influence the differentiation of the cells [36]. Glutamine, on the other hand, promotes pluripotent cells via the removal of differentiated cells in culture [37]. The pivotal role of the glutamate–glutamine pair in cell lineage specification and developmental stage maintenance at the OLP stage points to its involvement in the effects of reduced gravity on maintaining them at a progenitor stage, as previously shown by the expression of early OLP markers by our cells flown to space with regard to the 1G OLPs [10]. Glutamate dysregulation has been linked to numerous pathologies such as epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, glutamate is present in sera from MS patients at higher levels than in the age-matched control population [38,39]. In addition, glutamate levels increase in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [40] and the brains of MS patients [41,42]. Moreover, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate receptors are also upregulated [43]. Our data show a significant increase in glutamate in the secretome of OLPs flown into space; considering that in MS, OLPs are available around the lesion but they do not mature, it is possible that glutamate is made and secreted by those OLPs. Based on our above-mentioned data, where the SPC OLPs produced more glutamate than those kept in 1G, serum measurements of glutamate levels before, during and after space missions are of the essence to monitor changes produced by space microgravity in astronauts. This is important because the excessive stimulation of neurons by glutamate that can be caused by energy deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium overload leads to an excitotoxicity that is characterized by the exacerbation of glutamate receptors, triggering a cascade of toxic effects that leads to neuronal cell death [44,45] and, consequently, nearly all brain functions, including learning and memory, are affected. 4.3. Lipid Metabolism The knowledge we have on the primary sources of energy for mammalian cells derives solely from experiments performed within Earth’s gravity. These sources are proteins, fats and sugars. Besides being a source of energy, lipids act as signaling molecules to direct OLPs and pre-myelinating OLs to either proliferation or maturation into myelinating OLs [46]. Moreover, fatty acids (FAS) are necessary for myelin synthesis. Myelin is the lipid-rich membrane that insulates the axons in the CNS, and it is essential for our daily life activities. Its composition differs from cellular membranes [47,48] in terms of their lipid to protein ratio, where lipids account for 70% myelin, whereas cholesterol and glycosphingolipids such as galactosylceramides, sulfatides and gangliosides account for 40% and 20% of the total lipids, respectively. Abnormal or impaired OLs result in severe CNS pathologies during development and in neurodegenerative disorders. In most myelin disorders, OLPs are present but fail to mature [49]. In the present study, we found that OLPs secreted phospholipids in a higher quantity in SPC than in 1G, except for certain species of phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, we did not observe differences in sphingomyelin secretion between 1G and SPC. 4.4. Post-Flight Energetics Here, using respirometry measurements, we demonstrate important differences in energy metabolism. The SPC OLPs consumed more oxygen (basal respiration) and were able to increase respiration under stress (maximal respiration), suggesting a higher mitochondria-dependent energy demand, and probably a higher mitochondria content. Based on our previous work, we hypothesized that we would have more OLPs after space flight, yet we had to obtain confirmatory evidence. Both findings, the increased proliferation [8] and enhanced energy metabolism, are in agreement with our previous report where, using sim-µG, we revealed that there was increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis after 24 h of exposure to sim-µG [16]. Interestingly, in the case of the SPC OLPs, they showed preferential oxidative respiration rather than glycolysis. This is a different outcome from that obtained when using the 3D-clinostat. The reasons for these differences are currently unknown. Nonetheless, although the glycolytic reserve capacity appears not to have been used, the SPC OLPs still had higher energy demands after space flight. We previously performed the same secretome analysis of OLPs in sim-µG [9,10]. Although there was major difference in the measure of the secretome of OLPs, like time (3 days vs. 26 days) and method (µG in 3D-clinostat vs. SPC), it is interesting to compare the similarities and the differences. In both instances, lipid secretion, especially phospholipids, was increased in µG/SPC. Mitochondrial respiration was also elevated in µG/SPC, suggesting that this increased ATP demand could be necessary to sustain lipid synthesis/secretion, as well as cell proliferation. Comparisons of the TCA cycle-related metabolites were not identical: more fumarate was secreted in µG/SPC, but the α-KG secretion was discordant [12]. 4.5. General Considerations We do not know how long human OLs would take to synthetize myelin and myelinate axons in space, but we recently showed that these cells expressed earlier OLP markers with regard to the 1G OLPs; thus, the maturation of these cells appeared to be delayed [10]. Here, we observe another indication of a delayed lineage progression. What we do not know is whether this delay is transient as part of adapting to weightlessness, or it would result in an arrest of their development. Longer studies with OLPs in space could answer these questions. Finally, the Seahorse experiments revealed significantly higher mitochondrial respiration in OLPs after space flight, revealing that OLPs and their progenies remember having been in space. This is a very important point, as the SPC OLPs also proliferated more in 1G after returning to Earth, pointing toward the imminent need to perform epigenetic studies. An important difference with our studies in sim-µG is that the glycolysis was equivalent in the SPC OLPs and 1G OLPs, indicating that they did not need to switch to glycolysis as their last resource for energy. 4.6. Significance Since, in most myelin disorders, OLPs are present but fail to mature, our current study shows that glutamate and energy metabolism are significantly enhanced in response to microgravity. Therefore, both pathways are plausible targets to address OLPs’ maturation in MS, as well as other related myelin disorders and developmental disabilities like peri-ventricular leukomalacia, in order to enhance myelination in myelin-deficient CNSs.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions We have started to unravel the effects of microgravity on the metabolic pathways inherent to OLPs that show significant changes. Nonetheless, so far, they appear not to be deleterious and appear to remain functional in astronauts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses space as a novel platform to understand molecular changes in OLs at their progenitor stage. How this new knowledge is applicable to astronauts will become clearer when more studies of this nature are performed as they embark on long-term space missions. Years ago, we started our work using microgravity to test if we could produce healthier human OLPs in short periods of time, aiming at transplanting them to remyelinate myelin-deficient CNSs, like in the case of MS or leukodystrophies. We have shown that both sim-µG and space microgravity increase OLPs’ proliferation. The present study provides evidence that OLPs produce glutamate and that this is enhanced by space flight, contributing perhaps to maintaining OLPs in an immature stage. This point is crucial to elucidate, as the modulation of glutamate in MS patients might lead to enhanced myelination.",

Copyright notice ID: 10528075 PMID: 37759473 Abstract Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the sequels of long-term space missions. Here we sought to determine how space microgravity (µG) impacts the metabolomics profile of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased glutamate and energy metabolism while the OLPs were in space for 26 days. We also show that after space flight, OLPs (SPC OLPs) display significantly increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. These data are in agreement with our previous work using simulated microgravity. In addition, our global metabolomics approach allowed for the discovery of endogenous metabolites secreted by OLPs while in space that are significantly modulated by microgravity. Our results provide, for the first time, relevant information about the energetic state of OLPs while in space and after space flight. The functional and molecular relevance of these specific pathways are promising targets for therapeutic intervention for humans in long-term space missions to the moon, Mars and beyond. Keywords: microgravity, oligodendrocyte progenitors, global metabolomics, oligodendrocyte progenitor energetics1. Introduction Numerous studies have shown that in normal mammalian cells grown in culture, microgravity induces an array of phenomena such as apoptosis and changes in their cytoskeleton, as well as in signal transduction, cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and adhesion. Effects differ depending on the cell type [1]. Microgravity also alters differentiation and augments apoptosis in thyroid carcinoma cells [2,3] and alters breast cancer-derived cells [4]. Microgravity is thus considered as a platform to study the metabolism of normal, developing, mature and cancerous cells, as well as the potential pharmacological approaches to treat, on Earth, neurodegeneration, developmental disabilities and cancer. We have pioneered the study of simulated microgravity (sim-μG) using the “the 3D-clinostat” robot (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) on neural cells and, in particular, neural stem cells and oligodendrocytes (OLs). OLs are the myelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are essential for the efficient synthesis and maintenance of myelin [5,6]. They form the compact segments of the myelin membrane that coil around the axon and allow for the saltatory conduction of action potentials, ensuring the healthy functioning of the CNS. Neurological diseases involving this cell type are characterized by myelin loss and an impairment in nerve conduction. A lack of or damaged myelin is debilitating and disabling because the nerve impulses slow down or even stop, causing neurological deficits. Understanding how OL progenitors (OLPs) differentiate and form myelin sheaths around nerve axons is of interest for the prevention and treatment of myelin-associated diseases. In many cases, OLPs fail to mature and, therefore, they cannot remyelinate axons in dys- and de-myelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease or after a traumatic injury. Moreover, a chronic lack of myelin leads to axonal transection [7]. As neurological impairments have been observed after human space journeys, e.g., intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), we have studied in previous papers the effects of artificial microgravity on cultured OLPs. Our first study using BrdU revealed that rodent and human OLPs displayed enhanced and sustained proliferation while they were in sim-µG with a concomitant shortening of the cell cycle. Moreover, these cells appeared to remember having been in µG and continued to proliferate more after having been placed in Earth’s gravity [8]. More recently, we studied the effects of space-µG on OLPs and found enhanced proliferation [9], yet some of them displayed incomplete cytokinesis [10]. Moreover, based on the expression of stage-specific developmental markers, we discovered that these cells came back in a more immature stage than that of the ground control OLPs [10]. Here we sought to determine A) the impact of space flight on the global metabolomic profile of the secretome produced by OLPs while in space-µG in order to start unraveling extracellular processes, as well as identifying gravitational-sensitive molecules, and B) the energetic status of OLPs after space flight. We found the presence of some gravitational-sensitive molecules, as well as enhanced energy and glutamate metabolism in the secretome generated while the OLPs were on board the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, we found an elevated energy demand in the OLPs upon return to Earth, which led to an increased use of glycolysis to support their energy demands. In previous decades, we have studied and developed culture conditions for OLs and their precursors using biochemical, histochemical and morphological signals [11,12]. Key features of OLs are their well-defined developmental stages characterized by the expression of numerous stage-specific markers from which their expression is either transient or permanent throughout the life of these cells. These markers also define the functions that OLs support, including the production and secretion of the iron carrier glycoprotein transferrin for its autocrine and paracrine use in CNS iron metabolism, as well as the synthesis of all myelin components when OLs mature until they reach the myelinating stage. These stages and markers have been reported and reviewed by us and other scientists [5,13,14]. For the purpose of understanding the contents of the secretome produced by space-flown OLPs, here we use our previous description of these developmental stages [15,16] (Supplementary Figure S1).2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Culture System for OLPs and Pre-Myelinating OLs For the present study, we used human induced pluripotent (hiPS)-derived OLPs. Four years prior to the space flight, we established a culture system with a homogeneous population of NSCs that was obtained from the original hiPS cell line “CS83iCTR-33-n1” (fibroblasts), “reprogrammed” and provided to us by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center via a material transfer agreement. We then prepared embryoid bodies and subsequently converted them to “OLPs” using the protocol previously described by Espinosa-Jeffrey et al. [12]. For the purpose of this study, we used the oligodendrocyte specification medium (OSM), whose composition is shown in Table 1. This medium was used for pre-flight and during the experiment on board the ISS. The return medium is named BS1; to prepare BS1, we used OSM without N2 and B-27 and added Insulin Growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (Table 1). Table 1. Complete DMEM/F12 medium with supplements. Reagents OSM BS1 Insulin 10 µg/mL 10 µg/mL Transferrin 100 µg/mL 100 µg/mL Putrescine 32.2 µg/mL 32.2 µg/mL Na-bicarbonate 4.4 µg/mL 4.4 µg/mL D(+) galactose 9.2 mg/mL 9.2 mg/mL Kanamycin 16 ng/mL 16 ng/mL Na-selenite 6.4 ng/mL 6.4 ng/mL N2 2% 0 B-27 2% 0 IGF-1 160 ng/µL Open in a new tab2.2. Hardware and Space Flight OLPs grow optimally at a pH of 7.4; the culture medium was buffered with HEPES and its pH was adjusted to 7.4 for the space flight. The culture medium that fed the cells during the ascent to space was recovered automatically from the cell chamber. Subsequently, the fresh medium in tank 1 fed the OLPs while onboard the ISS for 26 days, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Collection system of secretome produced while cells were in space. Human OLPs, as part of the Bioscience-4 Space Biology NASA experiment, flew to the ISS on board SpaceX-21. This experiment was launched on 6 December 2020, and splashed down on 13 January 2021. These “active” experiments were designed to collect the conditioned medium (secretome) after the OLPs reached space and just before unberth to be able to capture the molecules secreted solely while cells were onboard the ISS (A). (B) The timeline depicting the handover moment and pre-launch. The travel culture medium was removed at T + 2 days and a fresh medium was left with the cells for 26 days, at which time the second culture medium was added to the cultures (a total of 26d + 2d) in space and the secretome was produced over 26 days while in space. (C) Cells travelled at 37 °C while in space for 28 days in the OSM contained in the cell chamber (asterisk). Cells were fed with BS1 on day T + 29 and returned to Earth in the same culture medium. The return medium was BS1 (see Table 1) from day 29 until delivery to the PI at UCLA. (D) View of the mesh carrier (2 mm × 2 mm). (E,F) Underneath the cell chamber, there are two tanks containing the fresh medium where the secretome was collected prior to unberth (arrows). This set of chambers was returned to Earth at 37 °C with a slow cool down in the second medium. The same number of chambers were flown to space or stayed on Earth in our laboratory as ground control. The OLPs travelled back from space in the second medium. Ground control OLPs were also seeded in these containers on mesh carriers and maintained in our laboratory at the same temperature, culture medium and conditions of space-flown OLPs. The only difference was Earth’s gravity vs. space microgravity. Upon splashdown, they were transferred from the Kennedy Space Center to the World Carrier and brought to our laboratory (UCLA) at 37 °C. (F) The mesh carriers populated with cells were transferred to poly-d-lysine=coated culture flasks and fed with a fresh medium. The secretome of each container and the tanks were all collected separately in numbered tubes and stored frozen at −80 °C. This medium is generally known as the conditioned medium. For the purpose of this manuscript, we refer to it as “secretome”.2.3. Secretome Metabolomics Metabolic profiles were obtained for each individual group using the Metabolon Platform (Metabolon). Briefly, each sample or “group” consisted of 5 biological replicate specimens per group. Three groups of samples were compared: OSM 26D (n = 5), which consisted of the culture medium alone incubated in the same conditions and the hardware used for our cell cultures, 1G OLPs (n = 5) maintained in Earth gravity, and SPC OLPs (n = 5). Post-harvest, the conditioned medium was used to analyze, in a comparative manner, the molecules secreted by the OLPs in both conditions. This medium was subjected to methanol extraction, then split into aliquots for analysis via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) in the positive (two methods), negative or polar ion mode. Metabolites were identified via the automated comparison of ion features to a reference library of chemical standards, followed by visual inspection for quality control, as previously described [17]. Compound Identification: Raw data was extracted, peak-identified and QC processed. Biochemical identifications are based on three criteria: retention index within a narrow RI window of the proposed identification, accurate mass match to the library +/− 10 ppm, and the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the experimental data and authentic standards. The retention time/index (RI), mass to charge ratio (m/z), and chromatographic data (including MS/MS spectral data) are used simultaneously to distinguish and differentiate biochemicals. The MS/MS scores are based on the comparison of ions present in the experimental spectrum to the ions present in the library spectrum. While there may be similarities between these molecules based on just one of these factors, the use of all three data points simultaneously, provides more accuracy for the identification of the biochemicals. The repertoire of “standards”, consisting of 3300 purified molecules, is available for this type of analysis. For structurally unnamed biochemical, mass spectral entries have been created and identified by virtue of their recurrent nature (both chromatographic and mass spectral). The asterisk in figures indicates that this compound has been identified based on two of the three characteristics mentioned above. Compounds identified in this manner, have the potential for their future identification by classical structural analysis. Alternatively, a new standard may be added to the library and the biochemical name confirmed.2.4. Statistical Analysis for the Metabolomics Study To determine the statistical significance, Welsh’s two-sample t-tests were performed on the SPC, 1G and control medium groups of n = 5 in ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) or “R” to compare data between them; p < 0.05 was considered significant (Array Studio, RRID:SCR_010970). The false discovery rate (Q-value) was calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies, with Q < 0.05 used as an indication of high confidence in a result. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) were performed in ArrayStudio. Random forest analysis was performed as described [18,19]. For the box plots, whiskers reflect the 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying the 25th to 75th quartiles); the bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” represents the population mean, [20]. We only considered the molecules that presented a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the groups shown, with a metabolite ratio of <1.00.2.5. Launch to the ISS The Bioscience-4 mission launched onboard the Space-X 21 Dragon capsule on 6 December 2020. This is the first study to investigate the proliferation of human normal hiPS-derived OLPs in space microgravity. For space flight, the OLPs were seeded onto passive 8-well Petri dishes from Airbus–Kiwi (Friedrichshafen, Germany) on floating mesh carriers measuring 2 mm × 2 mm, to which the cells adhered firmly; this feature was necessary to ensure that the cells would not detach and die during launching or while returning to Earth. The OLPs were flown to the ISS and installed in the Space Technology and Advanced Research System Experiment Facility-1 (STAaRS F-1) at 37 °C. The cells remained onboard the ISS for 39 days and 9 h and then returned to Earth (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Synopsis of passive experiments. OLPs came back alive and were used for the respirometry analysis, a part of the Bioscience-4 space biology NASA experiment. These cells were flown to the ISS on board SpaceX-21 (A). It was launched on 6 December 2020 and landed (splashdown) on 13 January 2021. The cells remained in microgravity for 38 days. Its orbit height was 254 miles; its speed at orbit was 4.76 miles/s; and maximal speed reached 17,400 mph. On Earth, humans are exposed to 3 to 4 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation from natural sources per year, mainly from cosmic rays that make it through the atmosphere. On the ISS, astronauts receive about 150 mGv per six months. For the current mission, the average daily total radiation dose was 0.425 (mGv) on board the space station. This experiment is called “passive” because it was designed to mimic the trajectory that astronauts’ brains undergo during space flight (i.e., launch, stay in space, and splashdown when returning to Earth) without manipulation or medium change. (B) Example of mesh without cells. OLPs were seeded on the floating mesh carriers. (C) View of the 8-well Petri dishes used for the passive experiments on Earth. (D) All cells were maintained at 37 °C for the duration of the experiment. (E) View of the external shell in which the units travelled and stayed while in space. The same number of chambers was flown to space or stayed on Earth in our laboratory as ground control. Ground control cells were also seeded in these containers and maintained at the same temperature and conditions in our laboratory; the only difference was gravity vs. microgravity. (F) Secretome collected from each well separately. Upon splashdown, they were transferred from the Kennedy Space Center to the World Carrier and brought to our laboratory (UCLA) at 37 °C.2.6. Cellular Bioenergetics Upon return from space, we ascertained a drop of pH from 7.4 to 7.1, which should represent the negligible effect of CO2 levels on the cells’ metabolism. For the assay, the OLPs were seeded onto an XF24 Cell Culture Microplate (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 5 × 104 cells per well in OSM. The cells were kept for 24 h in standard culture conditions (37 °C, 4.5% CO2). The following day, the wells were filled with fresh OSM. The following day, some of the supernatant was removed from the well plates. We used an XF24 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA) to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). The OCR and ECAR reflect the rates of cellular respiration and glycolysis, respectively. Measurements were performed with the cells in unbuffered Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 1 mM of pyruvate, 2 mM of glutamine, and 25 mM of glucose. Measures were recorded before (basal reading) and after the sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone/myxothiazol. The mitochondrial respiration was the difference between the total and rotenone/myxothiazol response. The maximal OCR was the response to the FCCP, whereas the maximal ECAR was the response to oligomycin. Values were normalized to the cellular protein concentration, determined with the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in all experiments.3. Results 3.1. Global Profile of the Secretome from the Different Treatments Secretomes of the OLPs kept for 26 days in 1G (1G OLP 26D) or SPC (SPC OLP 26D) were compared to the reference medium (OSM alone), using five biological replicates (see Section 2). Their mass spectra were globally examined, then compared one by one for the intensity of their components’ signals, to evidence a specific profile for each of these groups. Altogether, 424 signals were recorded, among which 372 were identified. Table 2 compares in a global way the mass spectra of the two groups of secretomes to those of the OSM alone. They display differences in the number of signals whose intensity is modified. There were more metabolites that increased in the presence of cells (157 and 182 in 1G and SPC, respectively; p < 0.05) compared to decreased metabolites (90 and 55 in 1G and SPC, respectively; p < 0.05). Importantly, there were 136 metabolites that increased and 62 metabolites that decreased in SPC vs. 1G. Thus, after 26 days, an increase was observed for ca. 60% of the signals present in the secretome of the cells kept in 1G, while this increase was of ca. 40% in space; when these secretomes are compared to the OSM, a larger number of metabolites was secreted at normal gravity than in its absence. The osmolality box plot represents the cumulative signal intensities in cell secretomes. The osmolality was higher in the presence of cells than in the media alone, and was increased in the cells at 0G compared to 1G (Figure 3A). Altogether, these results indicate a quantitative and qualitative variation in the secretome of cells at 0G compared to 1G. These changes in intensity do not equally affect all signals: the plot in Figure 3B (random forest analysis) shows the top metabolites (notably amino acids and xenobiotics) differentiating the OSM 26D medium from the secretomes, either in 1G or SPC conditions.

The random forest analysis (B) represents the 30 top-ranking biochemicals in the secretomes.3.2. Glycolysis and Energy-Related Metabolism The comparison of the control medium and the secretomes from the OLPs grown in SPC or 1G shows that the SPC OLPs secreted about half of the pyruvate and phosphates of the 1G OLPs, suggesting the high energy requirements of OLPs in space. Both the SPC and 1G secretomes contained elevated levels of lactate, citrate, aconitate and malate vs. OSM but at levels between 1G and SPC, indicating a comparable metabolism in the first part of the TCA cycle. In contrast, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate and malate displayed increased levels in both the SPC and 1G secretomes, but with a larger increase in SPC, suggesting a change in glutaminolysis and/or a BCCA catabolism influx in SPC compared to 1G (see TCA cycle, Figure 4. The scaled intensity figures illustrate how the 1G and SPC secretomes differ for their contents in pyruvate and fumarate. Pyruvate (a product of the glutamate pathway) is one of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production and it was decreased in the OLPs flown to space. It fuels the TCA cycle (glycolysis pathway scheme), which generates energy (stored as phosphorylated and reduced coenzymes), while fumarate and malate are end products in this cycle (Table 3 and Figure 4), as already reported [16]. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of metabolite utilization by 0G and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more fumarate than their 1G counterparts. OLPs from both groups secreted high levels of citrate and lactate, although with a slight but significantly higher level in 0G OLPs. (n = 5).

Comparison of metabolites secreted by OLPs grown in 0G or 1G vs. OSM culture medium alone. The figures in columns 1 and 2 represent the ratio of the signal intensities between the secretomes (1 G or 0 G) and OSM. Column 3 compares these two ratios. The numbers in green indicate a low release (pyruvate, phosphate) and those in red a high release. The statistical significance of these ratios was rated applying the Welsh two-sample t-test, with rho ≤ 0.05 for the first nine metabolites and for phosphate, and ≤0.05 < rho < 0.1 for the others.

Differences in Glutamate Metabolism The detected metabolites were classified by their metabolic identity. Our present data confirm that OLs secrete glutamate metabolites into their milieu: α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), (1G), glutamine, and other glutamate derivatives were released at a high level in both 1G and SPC conditions vs. OSM; among those, the release was 40 to 55% higher in space for glutamine, glutamate and α-KG, while 4-hydroxy- and ß-citryl-glutamate derivatives were lower (20–30%). N-acetyl-glutamate was lower in the 1G medium than in OSM but higher in SPC vs. OSM, suggesting a shift from uptake to secretion in 1G to SPC. The scaled intensity block diagrams for glutamate, glutamine and α-KG illustrate that the three of them are released by the cells, and that this release is accentuated by SPC (Figure 5). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Comparison of metabolite utilization by SPC and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more glutamate and glutamine while both groups secreted similar levels of alpha-ketoglutarate (1G) (n = 5). For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while the plus sign (+) represents population mean; for details, see [20].3.4. Differences in Lipid Metabolism Glycerophosphate lipids (phospholipids) generated higher signals in the cell secretomes and were more secreted by SPC cells vs. 1G cells, consistent with previous observations [16]. However, phosphatidyl-cholines with short chains of unsaturated fatty acids and lysophospholipids (non myelin-specific species) were also more detected in cell secretome, but at a lower level in SPC than 1G. In the case of sphingomyelins, their levels of secretion were similar between the 1G and SPC OLPs. Taken together, these observations indicate that our OLPs have their developmental program at the very least delayed in the absence of gravity (Figure 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Comparison of metabolite utilization by SPC and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more glycerophosphoinositol than OLPs in 1G. In contrast, SPC OLPs secreted less palmitoyl-GPC than 1G OLPs (n = 5). The asterisk indicates that this compound was identified based on two of the three characteristics mentioned in Methods. Compounds identified in this manner, have the potential for their future identification by classical structural analysis. Alternatively, a new standard may be added to the library and the biochemical name confirmed. For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while the plus sign (+) represents population mean.3.5. Space Flight Elicits Higher Respiration Rates in hiPS-Derived OLPs In order to ascertain the effects of space-µG on energy metabolism, we compared 1G OLPs and SPC OLPs. We quantified the OCR and ECAR as measures of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, respectively. We found that five days after splashdown, the SPC OLPs presented significantly higher basal, mitochondrial and maximal respiration when compared with the 1G OLPs, suggesting a higher mitochondria-dependent energy demand. In contrast, the glycolysis differences were not statistically significant (Figure 7). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Space-flown OLPs and 1G cells were cultured in Seahorse Bioscience V7 plate for 20 h. A higher basal OCR, mitochondrial and higher maximal OCR showed significant differences with regard to SPC OLPs, indicating that the cells were in a higher bioenergetics state. Interestingly, there were not significant differences for the ECAR. There were 12 samples per experiment. Values are expressed as mean + SD. Student’s t-test revealed that these differences were **: p < 0.01 ***: p < 0.001 vs. respective controls.4. Discussion We all were born, developed and have lived in Earth’s gravity and, for technical reasons, the effect of gravity has been, so far, poorly explored, although its mechanical effects are germane to the well-documented effect of cell contacts during their growth, development and differentiation. In our current study, we examined the metabolomic profile of the secretome produced by OLPs in space and discovered subtle but significant changes in the metabolite levels of the SPC OLPs vs. the 1G OLPs. Indeed, we found a differential regulation of metabolites in response to weightlessness. In addition, glutamate production and energy requirements were also increased. 4.1. Glycolysis and Energy Related Metabolites The total energy intake of the brain corresponds to 20% of overall energy intake, even though it weighs 2% of a person’s weight. During development, glucose and lactate are the main source of energy for oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) [21]. OLs use lactate as a source of energy as well as a precursor for lipid synthesis by converting it to pyruvate. Subsequently, pyruvate is transported to the mitochondria for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), or converted to ATP in their cytosol via glycolysis. During development and myelinogenesis, OLs have high energy demands and are extremely vulnerable to energy deprivation [22]. Metabolic dysfunction is commonly associated with MS [23,24]. In these patients, acute hypoxia-like lesions, mitochondrial impairment and a reduction in complex I and complex IV of the electron transport chain are reduced [25]. There are several patterns of de-myelination and several classifications of MS. One is named oligodendrogliopathy, where the cell processes of OLs are dying back, and it is the distinctive characteristic for “pattern III” MS [26]. It has been reported that OLs’ metabolism is impacted by dimethyl-fumarate (DMF, Tecfidera®). This compound is being used for the treatment of MS [27,28]. It is believed that it modulates both antioxidant and lipid metabolism in OLs [29]. Patients treated with this molecule displayed a higher brain magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and this was thought to correlate with the preservation of myelin density [30]. As observed previously in sim-μG, the OLPs secreted more fumarate and methyl-fumarate (mesaconate) in SPC while maintaining their progenitor stage [12]. Here, we show that the OLPs exposed to space μG displayed an enhanced need for energy with regard to their ground control counterparts. In addition, more lactate (produced during anaerobic oxidation to fulfill energy needs) was also significantly released by the SPC OLPs. The use of extra energy in the SPC OLPs cannot be explained through a stimulation of myelin synthesis; glycerate, a building element in the formation of triglycerides, was secreted by these cells, indicating that they were still at the immature developmental stage, while the 1G OLPs may have been moving forward towards maturation as previously demonstrated by Tran et al. [10]. Further studies are needed to ascertain the causes of such enhanced energy consumption by OLPs.4.2. Glutamate Metabolism The glutamate pathway is a hub: glutamate forms from glutamine via deamination through phosphate-activated glutaminase; it is fed by the glycolysis (with alanine as a by-product); glutamate is also a co-substrate in all reactions catalyzed by aminotransferases, which convert it to α-KG, a key intermediate of the TCA cycle [31]; glutamate generates energy itself (NADH). Astrocytes are thought to be the only suppliers to the glutamate metabolism in the brain [32]. Nonetheless, it has been shown that OLs also express high levels of glutamate synthetase (GS) at the level of the midbrain and the spinal cord [33]. These authors also reported that OLs do not need glutamate for their survival or for their myelinating function, thus indicating that its synthesis in OLs is part of their genetic blueprint, where no neuronal signal is required. GS also catalyzes the metabolization of glutamate into glutamine [33]. But the most important fact is that the selective lack of glutamine and glutamate in the brain results in the neonate’s death [34], and the deletion of glutamate in OLs results in the disruption of neuronal (synaptic) glutamate signaling that consequently alters glutamate-dependent behavior [33]. Our data appear to complement those of the above-mentioned authors: they report that GS expression occurs “late” in their development. Here, we demonstrate that OLs express glutamate at an early, pre-myelinating stage, and OLPs in space secrete more glutamate than in 1G. Therefore, our novel data indicate that not only mature OLs support glutamatergic transmission through GS, but their progenitors may also play an important role in the glutamatergic transmission pathway even before myelination takes place. In another model of cell differentiation, α-KG is shown to induce the demethylation of histones as a cofactor of histone demethylases [35] and hence influence the differentiation of the cells [36]. Glutamine, on the other hand, promotes pluripotent cells via the removal of differentiated cells in culture [37]. The pivotal role of the glutamate–glutamine pair in cell lineage specification and developmental stage maintenance at the OLP stage points to its involvement in the effects of reduced gravity on maintaining them at a progenitor stage, as previously shown by the expression of early OLP markers by our cells flown to space with regard to the 1G OLPs [10]. Glutamate dysregulation has been linked to numerous pathologies such as epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, glutamate is present in sera from MS patients at higher levels than in the age-matched control population [38,39]. In addition, glutamate levels increase in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [40] and the brains of MS patients [41,42]. Moreover, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate receptors are also upregulated [43]. Our data show a significant increase in glutamate in the secretome of OLPs flown into space; considering that in MS, OLPs are available around the lesion but they do not mature, it is possible that glutamate is made and secreted by those OLPs. Based on our above-mentioned data, where the SPC OLPs produced more glutamate than those kept in 1G, serum measurements of glutamate levels before, during and after space missions are of the essence to monitor changes produced by space microgravity in astronauts. This is important because the excessive stimulation of neurons by glutamate that can be caused by energy deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium overload leads to an excitotoxicity that is characterized by the exacerbation of glutamate receptors, triggering a cascade of toxic effects that leads to neuronal cell death [44,45] and, consequently, nearly all brain functions, including learning and memory, are affected.4.3. Lipid Metabolism The knowledge we have on the primary sources of energy for mammalian cells derives solely from experiments performed within Earth’s gravity. These sources are proteins, fats and sugars. Besides being a source of energy, lipids act as signaling molecules to direct OLPs and pre-myelinating OLs to either proliferation or maturation into myelinating OLs [46]. Moreover, fatty acids (FAS) are necessary for myelin synthesis. Myelin is the lipid-rich membrane that insulates the axons in the CNS, and it is essential for our daily life activities. Its composition differs from cellular membranes [47,48] in terms of their lipid to protein ratio, where lipids account for 70% myelin, whereas cholesterol and glycosphingolipids such as galactosylceramides, sulfatides and gangliosides account for 40% and 20% of the total lipids, respectively. Abnormal or impaired OLs result in severe CNS pathologies during development and in neurodegenerative disorders. In most myelin disorders, OLPs are present but fail to mature [49]. In the present study, we found that OLPs secreted phospholipids in a higher quantity in SPC than in 1G, except for certain species of phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, we did not observe differences in sphingomyelin secretion between 1G and SPC.4.4. Post-Flight Energetics Here, using respirometry measurements, we demonstrate important differences in energy metabolism. The SPC OLPs consumed more oxygen (basal respiration) and were able to increase respiration under stress (maximal respiration), suggesting a higher mitochondria-dependent energy demand, and probably a higher mitochondria content. Based on our previous work, we hypothesized that we would have more OLPs after space flight, yet we had to obtain confirmatory evidence. Both findings, the increased proliferation [8] and enhanced energy metabolism, are in agreement with our previous report where, using sim-µG, we revealed that there was increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis after 24 h of exposure to sim-µG [16]. Interestingly, in the case of the SPC OLPs, they showed preferential oxidative respiration rather than glycolysis. This is a different outcome from that obtained when using the 3D-clinostat. The reasons for these differences are currently unknown. Nonetheless, although the glycolytic reserve capacity appears not to have been used, the SPC OLPs still had higher energy demands after space flight. We previously performed the same secretome analysis of OLPs in sim-µG [9,10]. Although there was major difference in the measure of the secretome of OLPs, like time (3 days vs. 26 days) and method (µG in 3D-clinostat vs. SPC), it is interesting to compare the similarities and the differences. In both instances, lipid secretion, especially phospholipids, was increased in µG/SPC. Mitochondrial respiration was also elevated in µG/SPC, suggesting that this increased ATP demand could be necessary to sustain lipid synthesis/secretion, as well as cell proliferation. Comparisons of the TCA cycle-related metabolites were not identical: more fumarate was secreted in µG/SPC, but the α-KG secretion was discordant [12].4.5. General Considerations We do not know how long human OLs would take to synthetize myelin and myelinate axons in space, but we recently showed that these cells expressed earlier OLP markers with regard to the 1G OLPs; thus, the maturation of these cells appeared to be delayed [10]. Here, we observe another indication of a delayed lineage progression. What we do not know is whether this delay is transient as part of adapting to weightlessness, or it would result in an arrest of their development. Longer studies with OLPs in space could answer these questions. Finally, the Seahorse experiments revealed significantly higher mitochondrial respiration in OLPs after space flight, revealing that OLPs and their progenies remember having been in space. This is a very important point, as the SPC OLPs also proliferated more in 1G after returning to Earth, pointing toward the imminent need to perform epigenetic studies. An important difference with our studies in sim-µG is that the glycolysis was equivalent in the SPC OLPs and 1G OLPs, indicating that they did not need to switch to glycolysis as their last resource for energy.4.6. Significance Since, in most myelin disorders, OLPs are present but fail to mature, our current study shows that glutamate and energy metabolism are significantly enhanced in response to microgravity. Therefore, both pathways are plausible targets to address OLPs’ maturation in MS, as well as other related myelin disorders and developmental disabilities like peri-ventricular leukomalacia, in order to enhance myelination in myelin-deficient CNSs.5. Conclusions We have started to unravel the effects of microgravity on the metabolic pathways inherent to OLPs that show significant changes. Nonetheless, so far, they appear not to be deleterious and appear to remain functional in astronauts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses space as a novel platform to understand molecular changes in OLs at their progenitor stage. How this new knowledge is applicable to astronauts will become clearer when more studies of this nature are performed as they embark on long-term space missions. Years ago, we started our work using microgravity to test if we could produce healthier human OLPs in short periods of time, aiming at transplanting them to remyelinate myelin-deficient CNSs, like in the case of MS or leukodystrophies. We have shown that both sim-µG and space microgravity increase OLPs’ proliferation. The present study provides evidence that OLPs produce glutamate and that this is enhanced by space flight, contributing perhaps to maintaining OLPs in an immature stage. This point is crucial to elucidate, as the modulation of glutamate in MS patients might lead to enhanced myelination.Acknowledgments We thank Fathi Karouia, Amie Gresser, Sungshin Choi, Elizabeth Pane, and Araceli (Medaya) Torres for their help with the logistics for the study.
