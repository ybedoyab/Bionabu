Keywords: Cartilage repair, stem cell, bioreactor, biomechanics, growth factorsINTRODUCTION Degenerative joint disease affects twenty million adults with an economic burden of over $40 billion per year in the US[1]. Once damaged, adult human articular cartilage has a limited capacity for intrinsic repair[2] and hence injuries can lead to progressive damage, joint degeneration, pain, and disability. Cell-based repair of small cartilage defects in the knee joint was first demonstrated clinically fifteen years ago[3]. Many cartilage tissue engineering studies use chondrocytes as the cell source[4,5], however this approach is challenged by limited supply of chondrocytes, their limited regenerative potential due to age, disease, de-differentiation during in vitro expansion, and the morbidity caused by chondrocyte harvest[6]. Therefore, other studies use mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) as the cell source[7,8], as these stem cells can be safely harvested by marrow biopsy, readily expanded in vitro, and selectively differentiated into chondrocytes[9]. Clinical translation of tissue engineered cartilage is currently limited by inadequate construct structure, mechanical function, and integration[2,10] Currently, most tissue engineered constructs for articular cartilage repair possess cartilage-mimetic material properties only after long-term (e.g., 1 to 6 month) in vitro culture[5,11,12]. This lack of early construct mechanical function implies a need for new tissue engineering technologies such as scaffolds and bioreactors[13,14]. For example, the stiffness and strength of previously used scaffolds were several orders of magnitude below normal articular cartilage, particularly in tension[12,15,16]. Likewise, mechanical properties of engineered cartilage produced using these scaffolds and hMSC were at least one order of magnitude below values reported for normal cartilage despite prolonged in vitro culture[17,18]. The goal of the present study was to produce mechanically functional tissue engineered cartilage from adult hMSC and three-dimensionally (3D) woven PCL scaffolds in 21 days in vitro. Effects of (i) scaffold structure (loosely vs. tightly woven PCL), (ii) culture vessel (static dish vs. oscillating bioreactor) and (iii) medium composition (chondrogenic additives with or without serum) on construct mechanical, biochemical, and molecular properties were quantified. A 3D weaving method[19] was applied to multi-filament PCL yarn to create scaffolds with cartilage-mimetic mechanical properties. The PCL was selected because it is a FDA-approved, biocompatible material[20,21] that supports chondrogenesis[22] and degrades slowly (i.e. less than 5% degradation at 2 years, as measured by mass loss) into by-products that are entirely cleared from the body[23,24]. The 3D woven PCL scaffolds were seeded with hMSC mixed with Matrigel® such that gel entrapment enhanced cell seeding efficiency[25] and also helped maintain spherical cell morphology for promotion of chondrogenesis[26]. The hMSC-PCL constructs were cultured either in static dishes or in an oscillatory bioreactor that provided bi-directional percolation of culture medium directly through the construct[27]. Bioreactors were studied because these devices are known to enable functional tissue engineering due to combined effects of enhanced mass transport and mechanotransduction[14,28–34]. Bi-directional rather than uni-directional perfusion was selected because the latter yielded different conditions at opposing construct upper and lower surfaces resulting in spatial concentration gradients and inhomogeneous tissue development[35,36]. Three different culture media were tested as follows. Differentiation medium 1 (DM1) containing serum and chondrogenic additives (TGF-β, ITS+ Premix, dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, proline, and non-essential amino acids) was selected based on our previous work[8,17,37]. Differentiation medium 2 (DM2) containing chondrogenic additives but not serum was selected based on reports that serum inhibited chondrogenesis by synoviocytes[38,39] and caused hypertrophy of chondrocytes[40]. Control medium (CM) without chondrogenic additives was tested to assess spontaneous chondrogenic differentiation in hMSC-PCL constructs.MATERIALS AND METHODS All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise specified. Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds A custom-built loom[19] was used to weave PCL multi-filament yarns (24 µm diameter per filament; 44 filaments/yarn, Grilon KE-60, EMS/Griltech, Domat, Switzerland) in three orthogonal directions (x-warp, y-weft, and a vertical z-direction) (Figure 1A). A loosely woven scaffold was made with widely spaced warp yarns (8 yarns/cm), closely spaced weft yarns (20 yarns/cm) and two z-layers between each warp yarn (Figure 1B). A tightly woven scaffold was made with closely spaced warp and weft yarns (24 and 20 yarns/cm, respectively) and one z-layer between each warp yarn. (Figure 1C). These weaving parameters, in conjunction with fiber size and the density of PCL (1.145 g/cm3)[41], determined scaffold porosity and pore dimensions. The loosely woven scaffold had porosity of 68 ± 0.3%, approximate pore dimensions of 850 µm ×1100 µm × 100 µm, and approximate thickness of 0.9 mm. The tightly woven scaffold had porosity of 61 ± 0.2 %, approximate pore dimensions of 330 µm × 260 µm × 100 µm and approximate thickness of 1.3 mm. Prior to cell culture, scaffolds were immersed in 4N NaOH for 18 h, thoroughly rinsed in de-ionized water, dried, ethylene oxide sterilized, and punched into 7 mm diameter discs using dermal punches (Acuderm Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL). Figure 1. Open in a new tab The 3D-woven PCL scaffold. (A) schematic; (B–C) scanning electron micrographs of (B) loosely and (C) tightly woven scaffolds. Scale bars: 1 mm.Human mesenchymal stem cells The hMSCs were derived from bone marrow aspirates obtained from a healthy middle-aged adult male at the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University. Informed consent was obtained, and an Institutional Review Board-approved aspiration procedure was used[42]. Briefly, the bone marrow sample was washed with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM-LG, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from a selected lot[9]. The sample was centrifuged at 460×g on a pre-formed Percoll density gradient (1.073 g/mL) to isolate the mononucleated cells. These cells were resuspended in serum-supplemented medium and seeded at a density of 1.8×105 cells/cm2 in 10 cm diameter plates. Non-adherent cells were removed after four days by changing the medium. For the remainder of the cell expansion phase, the medium was additionally supplemented with 10 ng/mL of recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-basic (rhFGF-2, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ)[43], and was replaced twice per week. The primary culture was trypsinized after approximately two weeks, and then cryopreserved using Gibco Freezing medium.Tissue engineered constructs The hMSC were thawed and expanded by approximately 10-fold during a single passage in which cells were plated at 5,500 cells/cm2 and cultured in DMEM-LG supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL of rhFGF-2, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone. Medium was completely replaced every 2–3 days for 7 days. Multi-potentiality was verified for the expanded hMSC by inducing differentiation into the chondrogenic lineage in pellet cultures of passage 2 (P2) cells[44], and into adipogenic and osteogenic lineages in monolayer culture[45]. The PCL scaffolds (a total of n= 15–20 per group, in three independent studies) were seeded with P2 hMSC by mixing cells in growth factor-reduced Matrigel® (B&D Biosciences) while working at 4°C, and pipetting the cell-gel mixture evenly onto both surfaces of the PCL scaffold. Each 7 mm diameter, 0.9 mm thick loosely woven scaffold was seeded with a cell pellet (1 million cells in 10 uL) mixed with 25 µL of Matrigel®, whereas each 7 mm diameter, 1.3 mm thick tightly woven scaffold was seeded with a similar cell pellet mixed with 35 µL of Matrigel®. Freshly seeded constructs were placed in 24-well plates (one construct per well), placed in a 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2/room air incubator for 30 min to allow Matrigel® gelation, and then 1 mL of medium was added to each well. After 24 h, constructs were transferred either into 6-well plates (one construct per well containing 9 mL of medium) and cultured statically, or into bioreactor chambers as previously described[27]. Briefly, each construct allocated to the bioreactor group was placed in a custom-built poly(dimethyl-siloxane) (PDMS) chamber that was connected to a loop of gas-permeable silicone rubber tubing (1/32 inch wall thickness, Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). Each loop was then mounted on a supporting disc, and medium (9 mL) was added, such that the construct was submerged in medium in the lower portion of the loop and a gas bubble was present in the upper portion of the loop[27]. Multiple loops were mounted on an incubator-compatible base that slowly oscillated the chamber about an arc of ~160°. Importantly, bioreactor oscillation directly applied bi-directional medium percolation and mechanical stimulation to their upper and lower surfaces of the discoid constructs. Three different medium compositions (DM1, DM2 and CM) were studied. Differentiation medium 1 (DM1) was DMEM-HG supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL hTGFβ-3 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 1% ITS+ Premix (B&D Biosciences), 10−7 M dexamethasone (Sigma), 50 mg/L ascorbic acid, 0.4 mM proline, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 U/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/mL of fungizone. Differentiation medium 2 (DM2) was identical to DM1 except without FBS. Control medium (CM) was identical to DM1 except without chondrogenic additives (TGFβ-3, ITS+ Premix, and dexamethasone). Media were replaced at a rate of 50% every 3–4 days, and constructs were harvested after 1, 7, 14, and 21 days.Mechanical testing Confined compression tests[46] were performed on 3 mm diameter cylindrical test specimens cored from the centers of 21-day constructs or acellular (initial) scaffolds using an ELF-3200 materials testing system (Bose-Enduratec, Framingham, MA). Specimens (n = 5–6 per group) placed in a 3 mm diameter confining chamber within a bath of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and compressive loads were applied using a solid piston against a rigid porous platen (porosity of 50%, pore size of 50–100 µm). Following equilibration of a 10 gf tare load, a step compressive load of 30 gf was applied to the sample and allowed to equilibrate for 2000s. Aggregate modulus (HA) and hydraulic permeability (k) were determined numerically by matching the solution for axial strain (εz) to the experimental data for all creep tests using a two-parameter, nonlinear least-squares regression procedure[47,48]. Unconfined compression tests were done by applying strains, ε, of 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16 to the specimens (n = 5–6 per group) in a PBS bath after equilibration of a 2% tare strain. Strain steps were held constant for 900s which allowed the specimens to relax to an equilibrium level. Young’s modulus was determined by linear regression on the resulting equilibrium stress-strain plot.Histology and immunohistochemistry Histological analyses were performed after specimens (n = 2 constructs per time point per group) were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h at 4°C, post fixed in 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned both en-face and in cross-section. Sections 5 µm thick were stained with safranin-O/fast green for proteoglycans. For immunohistochemical analysis, 20 µm thick sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. To efficiently expose epitopes, the sections were incubated with 700 U/mL bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma) and 2 U/mL pronase XIV (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C. Double immunostaining for collagen type I (mouse monoclonal antibody, ab6308; Abcam Inc. Cambridge, MA) and collagen type II (mouse monoclonal anitibody, CII/CI; Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) was performed using an Avidin/Biotin kit (Vector lab, Burlingame, CA). Control sections were incubated with PBS/1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) without primary antibody.Biochemical analyses Standard assays for DNA, ortho-hydroxyproline (OHP, an index of total collagen content), and GAG (an index of proteoglycan content) were performed (n = 3–4 bisected constructs per time point per group). Values obtained for all 1-day constructs produced from tightly woven PCL scaffolds in DM1, DM2, and CM groups were pooled, averaged, and used as a basis for comparison for subsequent (7, 14, and 21-day) constructs produced from tightly woven scaffolds. After measuring wet weight, constructs were diced and digested in papain for 12 h at 60°C. DNA was measured using the Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). GAG was measured using the Blyscan™ sulphated GAG assay (Biocolor, Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland). To measure total collagen, papain digests were hydrolyzed in HCl at 110°C overnight, dried in a desiccating chamber, reconstituted in acetate-citrate buffer, filtered through activated charcoal, and OHP was quantified by Ehrlich’s reaction[49]. Briefly, hydrolysates were oxidized with chloramine-T, treated with dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, read at 540 nm against a trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline standard curve, and total collagen was calculated by using a ratio of 10 µg of collagen per 1 µg of 4-hydroxyproline. The conversion factor of 10 was selected since immunohistochemical staining showed that type II collagen represented virtually all of the collagen present in the constructs[50,51].Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) The presence of two cartilage biomarkers were tested: Sox-9, one of the earliest markers for MSC differentiation towards the chondrocytic lineage, preceding the activation of collagen II[52], and collagen type II, a chondrocyte related gene. Collagen type I provided a marker for undifferentiated MSCs, and GAPDH provided an intrinsic control[53]. Total RNA was isolated from hMSCs prior to and after culture on PCL scaffolds (n = 3–4 bisected constructs per group per time point) using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. DNase treated RNA was used to make first stranded cDNA with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis for RT-PCR. The cDNA was amplified in a iCycler Thermal Cycler 582BR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using primer sequences given in Table 1. The cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 94°C; 30 cycles of (30 s at 94°C, 45s at 58°C, 1min at 72°C), and 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were analyzed by means of 2% agarose gel electrophoresis containing ethidium bromide (E-Gel® 2%, Invitrogen). TABLE 1.

Values of p <0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTS Effects of scaffold structure Scaffold structure did not have any significant effect on the amounts of DNA, total collagen, or GAG in constructs cultured statically for 21 days in DM1 (Table 2, Group A vs. B). In contrast, scaffold structure significantly impacted aggregate modulus (HA) and Young’s modulus (E) of initial (acellular) scaffolds and cultured constructs (Figure 2). Acellular loosely woven scaffolds exhibited lower (p<0.05) mechanical properties (HA of 0.18 ± 0.011 MPa and E of 0.042 ± 0.004 MPa) than acellular tightly woven scaffolds (HA of 0.46 ± 0.049 MPa and E of 0.27 ± 0.017 MPa). Likewise, 21-day constructs based on loosely woven scaffolds exhibited lower (p<0.05) mechanical properties (HA of 0.16 ± 0.006 MPa and E of 0.064 ± 0.004 MPa) than constructs based on tightly woven scaffolds (HA of 0.37 ± 0.030 MPa and E of 0.41 ± 0.023 MPa) (Figure 2). As compared to acellular scaffolds, the 21-day constructs exhibited similar aggregate modulus and higher (p<0.05) Young’s modulus. Table 2.

Construct amounts of DNA, total collagen, and GAG increased in a manner dependent on time, culture vessel and medium composition. DNA and GAG contents were similar in 21-day constructs cultured in bioreactors and statically (Figures 3A and 3C). Total collagen content was 1.5-fold higher (p < 0.05) in bioreactor compared to static cultures (Figure 3B; Table 2, Group B vs. C). Bioreactors yielded more homogeneous tissue development than static cultures based on qualitative histological appearance of cross-sections (Figure 4, row I). Chondrogenesis was demonstrated histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline-like matrix that immunostained strongly and homogeneously positive for collagen type II. Bioreactors yielded constructs in which Coll-II immunostaining was more pronounced than static cultures (Figure 4, row IV). Immunostaining for Col-I was minimal under all conditions tested. The RT-PCR analysis showed type of culture vessel did not affect the temporal expression of mRNAs for collagen type II (Figure 5A), Sox-9 (Figure 5B), collagen type I (not shown) and GAPDH (not shown).

Scale bars: 200 µm (Row I); 50 µm (Row II); 200 µm (Row III); 100 µm (Row IV).Figure 5. Open in a new tab Electrophoresis gels for RT-PCR products of collagen type II and of Sox-9. Lane 1= day 0 hMSCs; Lanes 2 and 3 = 7 days and 21 days static culture in DM1; Lanes 4 and 5 = 7 days and 21 days bioreactor culture in DM1; Lanes 6 and 7 = 7 days and 21 days static culture in DM2; Lane 8=control for DNA contamination.Effects of medium composition DNA content was 1.4-fold higher (p<0.05) in 21-day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Figure 3A, Table 2, Group B vs. D). Also, total collagen content was 1.8-fold higher (p<0.05) in 21-day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Figure 3B). Conversely, GAG content was lower (42% as high, p<0.05) in 21-day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Figure 3C). Likewise, the GAG/DNA ratio was lower (30% as high, p<0.05) in 21-day constructs cultured in DM1 compared to DM2 (Table 2). Culture in DM2 yielded more chondrogenic differentiation of hMSC than DM1, based on histological appearance of cells and ECM (more rounded chondrocytes; more homogeneously positive matrix staining for GAG and Coll-II, Figure 4, rows III and IV). Culture in DM2 yielded earlier expression of collagen type II mRNA (Figure 5A) such that this biomarker was present by day 7 in contrast to DM1. Constructs cultured in CM contained substantially lower amounts collagen and GAG compared to DM1 (Table 2, Group B vs. E). Chondrogenic differentiation was virtually absent in constructs cultured in CM with respect to rounded cell shape, matrix staining for GAG and collagen type II, and measured GAG and collagen contents (Figure 3 and Figure 4).DISCUSSION The findings of this study demonstrate the ability to produce functional tissue engineered cartilage starting from hMSC and a tightly woven PCL scaffold within 21 days in vitro. Importantly, aggregate and Young’s moduli of hMSC-PCL constructs cultured statically and in bioreactors (Table 2, Groups B and C), approached the values reported for normal articular cartilage (HA of 0.1 to 2.0 MPa; E of 0.4 to 0.8 MPa)[54–56]. Young’s modulus was higher for 21-day constructs than initial acellular scaffolds, which may be due to accumulation of cell-derived cartilaginous extracellular matrix within the 3D woven scaffold and associated increase in shear modulus. These effects would be expected to reduce relative PCL yarn movement and cross-sectional shape distortion during compressive testing and have a more pronounced effect during mechanical testing in the unconfined configuration (i.e., where scaffolds are not laterally constrained) than the confined configuration, thereby affecting E more than HA. Although short term maintenance of mechanical properties of constructs and scaffolds was demonstrated, further studies of constructs and acellular scaffolds are warranted to assess mechanical properties over longer time periods. Long-term maintenance can be reasonably expected due to the slow biodegradation of PCL[23,24] in concert with continued accumulation of cell-derived cartilaginous matrix. Efficient hMSC seeding and cartilaginous matrix deposition were observed for loosely and tightly woven PCL scaffolds, and can be attributed to the combination of Matrigel®-enhanced cell entrapment[25] and large, homogenously distributed pores in the scaffold (i.e. in-plane pores of 250 to 1000 µm, Figure 1). Consistently, scaffolds with 250 to 500µm pores were found to enhance GAG secretion as compared to smaller pores[57], and 380 to 405 µm pores were found suitable for chondrocyte proliferation[58]. Culture in an oscillating bioreactor yielded constructs with higher aggregate modulus, higher total collagen content, and more homogeneous tissue development, especially at the upper and lower surfaces than otherwise identical static cultures (Figure 2–Figure 4). Constructs from the oscillating bioreactor exhibited strongly positive immunostaining for Coll-II and virtually negative staining for Coll-I, although collagen type II as a fraction of the total collagen was not explicitly measured. We previously showed that constructs from rotating bioreactors contained more total and type II collagen than statically cultured controls[12], and in these constructs Coll-II represented 92 to 99 % of the total collagen[51,59]. Consistently, others showed hydrodynamic shear increased total collagen, type II collagen, and tensile modulus of multi-layered chondrocyte sheets[60], and bi-directional perfusion yielded more homogeneous tissue engineered cartilage than uni-directional perfusion[35,36]. Culture medium composition significantly impacted construct amounts of DNA and GAG, intensity of safranin-O staining and Coll-II immunostaining, and the temporal profile of chondrogenic differentiation by hMSC. Specifically, chondrogenic additives without serum (DM2) yielded constructs with higher GAG, higher GAG/DNA ratio, earlier expression of collagen II mRNA, and more homogenous immunostaining for Coll-II as compared to chondrogenic additives with serum (DM1) (Figure 3–Figure 5). Consistently, serum was recently reported to inhibit chondrogenic differentiation of synoviocytes[38,39], and this finding was attributed to an enhanced proliferation of the cells that hindered their differentiation capacity. Interestingly, the GAG/DNA ratio measured in the present study at culture day 21 exceeded the GAG/DNA ratios previously reported after prolonged in vitro cultivation[17,39,61].CONCLUSION In this work, a 3D-woven PCL scaffold combined with adult human stem cells yielded mechanically functional tissue engineered cartilage constructs within only 21 days in vitro. Scaffold structure significantly impacted construct aggregate and Young’s moduli (i.e., tightly woven scaffolds yielded constructs with higher moduli than more loosely woven scaffolds). Importantly, compressive moduli of 21-day constructs based on tightly woven scaffolds approached values reported for normal articular cartilage. Production of constructs with robust mechanical properties was accelerated by culture in oscillating bioreactors as compared to static dishes (i.e., the bioreactor yielded constructs with higher HA, higher total collagen content, more immunostaining for collagen type II, and more spatially homogenous tissue development). Chondrogenic differentiation of hMSC was observed only if culture medium was supplemented with chondrogenic additives (TGFβ, ITS+ Premix), and was accelerated if this medium did not contain serum (i.e., lack of serum yielded constructs with higher GAG content, higher GAG/DNA ratio, earlier expression of collagen type II mRNA, and more pronounced matrix staining for GAG and collagen type II).ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the Academy of Finland and the Finnish Cultural Foundation (PKV),  AR055414-01 (LEF) and NASA NNJ04HC72G (LEF),  AR050208 (JFW),  P01 AR053622 (AIC, JFW),  AR48852 (FG).

    "abstract": "Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) woven poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression were analyzed. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed extracellular matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended on culture duration and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001). The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical properties on the order of magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young's, and shear moduli of 0.15, 0.12, and 0.033 MPa, respectively). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα1)/Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis. Long-term culture of hMSC on 3D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered cartilage, and stiffer underlying scaffold. These findings merit consideration when developing grafts for osteochondral defect repair.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Articular cartilage possesses a complex, zonal architecture that enables smooth articulation at the joint surface and rigid attachment to the subchondral bone. Since bone-to-bone interfaces are known to integrate better and faster than cartilage-to-bone interfaces, tissue-engineered osteochondral constructs are a promising technique for articular cartilage repair.1,2 Indeed, various composite grafts have been explored for osteochondral tissue regeneration utilizing a variety of cell-seeded scaffolds, including hyaluronan sponges with calcium phosphate supports,3 nonwoven poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) meshes with collagen-hydroxyapatite supports,4 three-dimensional (3D) printed poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly(lactide) scaffolds with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/tricalcium phosphate supports,5 agarose gels with devitalized trabecular bones,6 and collagen gels with hydroxyapatite supports.7 Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a promising cell source for osteochondral tissue engineering, due to their multilineage differentiation potential.8,9 Moreover, dynamic interaction between intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (i.e., chemical, mechanical, and temporal) factors determine the developmental fate of hMSCs10,11 and tissue-engineered constructs.12,13 Appropriate control of these factors may lead to favorable outcomes in osteochondral tissue engineering. The present work describes cartilage and bone tissue engineering using hMSCs and a 3D woven scaffold that we recently developed.14 Poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) was selected as the scaffold material because it degrades relatively slowly15 and possesses an appropriately high bulk stiffness to facilitate MSC differentiation toward skeletal lineages.16 In our recent in vitro study17 chondrogenesis and mechanical functionality were clearly evident for 21-day constructs made from hMSCs embedded in Matrigel and cultured statically on 3D woven PCL scaffolds, with average aggregate and Young's moduli (HA of 0.37 MPa and E of 0.41 MPa, respectively) approaching values reported for normal articular cartilage (HA of 0.1–2.0 MPa; E of 0.4–0.8 MPa).18–20 In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression in engineered skeletal tissues generated using hMSCs and 3D woven PCL scaffolds. On the basis of our recent finding that static culture supported chondrogenesis in this in vitro model,17 all constructs in the present study were cultured statically. We selected to seed the PCL scaffolds with hMSC mixed in a type I collagen gel such that gel entrapment enhanced cell seeding efficiency and helped to maintain spherical cell morphology for promotion of chondrogenesis.21 In one group of constructs, the medium was supplemented with soluble molecular mediators associated with chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs (i.e., transforming growth factor [TGF]-β, insulin, and dexamethasone),22 whereas in the other group the medium contained additives associated with osteogenic differentiation (i.e., serum, β-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone).23 Properties of the resulting engineered tissues were assessed at multiple levels at culture days 1, 21, and 45.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Construct preparation and cultivation All cell culture reagents were obtained from InVitrogen or Sigma, unless otherwise specified. The hMSCs were derived from bone marrow aspirates obtained from a healthy, middle-aged adult man with informed consent according to an Institutional Review Board–approved protocol at Case Western Reserve University. Before seeding on PCL scaffolds, the hMSCs were expanded by ∼10-fold during a single passage in which cells were plated at 5500 cells/cm2 and cultured in basic medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/mL of fibroblast growth factor-2; Peprotech). The 3D woven scaffold was made from PCL yarn (24 μm diameter per filament; 44 filaments/yarn, Grilon KE-60; EMS/Griltech). In brief, 11 in-plane layers aligned perpendicularly in the warp (x) and weft (y) directions were interlocked by a third set of yarns running in the z direction using a custom-built loom.14 The roughly 1.4-mm-thick scaffolds had porosity of 61% ± 0.2%, and approximate pore dimensions of 330 × 260 × 100 μm. One million P2 hMSCs were mixed with 30 μL of 0.6% (w/v) type I collagen gel (BD Biosciences), and the resulting mixture was pipetted onto each PCL scaffold (7-mm-diameter, 1.3-mm-thick discs). The dry scaffolds readily absorbed the cell–hydrogel mixture and the initial distribution of cells throughout scaffolds appeared to be relatively uniform, as in our recent report,17 and therefore we did not elect to use the vacuum manifold setup described in other reports.14,24 The resulting constructs were placed in 12-well plates (one construct per well), incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2/room air incubator to allow collagen gelation, and then 2 mL of differentiation medium was added to each well. Two experimental groups were compared: (1) a chondrogenic group, in which basic medium was supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant human TGF-β3 (Peprotech), 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS+) premix (BD Biosciences), 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma), 82 mg/L ascorbic-2-phosphate, 0.4 mM proline, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 1 M HEPES buffer, and (2) an osteogenic group, in which basic medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 100 nM dexamethasone, and 50 mg/mL ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. Culture media were completely replaced every 2–3 days, and constructs were harvested at culture day 1, 21, or 45. For 21- and 45-day constructs, the differentiating medium was replaced with serum-free medium 24 h before harvest, and the constructs were rinsed at the time of harvest. The constructs were not intentionally moved during the culture; however, they may have been inadvertently flipped over during medium replacement. Construct analyses Samples for histology (n = 2 per group) were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned to 5 μm.17 Histological stains included hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, safranin-O/fast green, and alizarin red at Histoserv. Immunohistochemical stains included collagen types I and II; these markers were assessed individually, similar to our previous description.17 Apoptosis staining was done using a TACS 2 TdT-DAB in situ detection kit (Trevigen). Samples for microcomputerized tomography (1–2 per group) were formalin fixed, immersed in 70% ethanol, and loaded into a microCT 40 system (Scanco Medical). Medium-resolution scans were obtained in 16 μm increments at energy of 45 kVp and intensity of 177 μA. Three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained using accompanying commercial software (Scanco). Amounts of DNA, glycosaminoglycans (GAG), and ortho-hydroxyproline (OHP) were measured on papain-digested samples (n = 3 per group), as previously described.17 Construct amounts of calcium were measured (n = 3 per group) using a commercial assay (Pointe Scientific), following sample lyophilization, homogenization in 0.5 M HCl, and vigorous mixing for 16 h at 4°C. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was calculated (n = 3 per group) using Sigmafast p-nitrophenyl phosphate Tablets (Sigma) following sample homogenization in 0.75 M 2-amino-2-methyl propanol solution and measurement of absorptivity kinetics of reaction products at 405 nm with a Perkin Elmer Victor 3 plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Biphasic mechanical testing was performed to determine aggregate modulus (HA), hydraulic permeability (k), Young's modulus (E), and complex shear modulus (G*) as previously described.24 Test specimens were obtained (n = 3–6 per group) by punching 3-mm-diameter cores from the centers of harvested constructs. Confined-compression creep tests and unconfined stress–relaxation tests were performed using a Bose-Enduratec ELF 3200 materials testing system. For confined compression test, specimens from the chondrogenic group were subjected to a 5-gf tare load and a 15-gf step compressive load, to ensure that strains remained in the infinitesimal range; specimens from the osteogenic group equilibrated to a 10-gf tare load before application of a 30-gf step compressive load. For unconfined stress–relaxation tests, specimens were equilibrated to a 5-gf tare load, and then strain steps of 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16 were sequentially applied, with each step lasting for 900 s. Dynamic frequency sweep tests were performed using an ARES Rheometrics System. Specimens were placed between two porous rigid platens in a bath of phosphate-buffered saline. After equilibration to a compressive offset strain of 10%, a sinusoidal shear strain was applied. Parameters for the dynamic test include a shear strain amplitude 5% and an angular frequency (ω) that increased logarithmically from 1 to 50 rad/s. Values were reported for ω = 10 rad/s. Total RNA was isolated (n = 2 samples per group) by homogenization in Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by extraction in chloroform and centrifugation (20,800 g, 4°C, 20 min). The RNA was precipitated by adding 2-propanol followed by centrifugation (20,800 g, 4°C, 20 min). The pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, centrifuged (10,600 g, 4°C, 10 min), dried, dissolved in water, and frozen at −80°C. cDNA was synthesized by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) with a PCR Sprint Thermal cycler (Thermo Electron Co.). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) detecting reagent on a Sequence Step One Plus real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression level was first normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and then normalized to the mRNA level measured for the corresponding 1-day sample from the chondrogenic group.

Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
    "results": "Results Construct wet and dry weight increased significantly with culture time in both groups (Table 2). In the chondrogenic group, the upward-facing surfaces were smooth and hyaline like (Fig. 1A, B), whereas tissue formation was less pronounced at the lower surfaces facing the bottom of the culture well. In the osteogenic group the surfaces were rough with the woven contours of the underlying PCL scaffold clearly visible (Fig. 1C, D). In the chondrogenic group, abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) was present throughout the full thickness of the constructs at 21 days (Fig. 1E), and new tissue extended beyond the confines of the PCL scaffold at 45 days (Fig. 1F). In contrast, in the osteogenic group ECM was less prevalent and was confined within the PCL scaffold (Fig. 1G, H). DNA content was significantly influenced by culture time but not medium additives (Table 2). Between culture days 1 and 21, DNA increased by two- to threefold, whereas between days 21 and 45 DNA decreased slightly in both groups. In the chondrogenic group at 21 days, cell morphology was predominately polygonal, with some cells exhibiting rounded, chondrocytic morphology (Fig. 1I) and a few fibroblastic cells. After 45 days, various characteristics of mature chondrocytes were evident, including condensed cells in lacunae (Fig. 1J) and nesting cells (Fig. 1K). In the osteogenic group, cell morphologies at 21 and 45 days ranged from fibroblastic to elongated, with no chondrocytic cells present (Fig. 1L, M). Apoptosis was not prevalent, but pycnotic cells were occasionally present in the central and lower regions of constructs cultured in both types of media (data not shown). Table 2.

Color images available online at www.liebertonline.com/ten. The amount of OHP, an indicator of total collagen, depended on culture time and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001) (Table 2). In the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, 45-day constructs had OHP contents of 75 and 27 μg/construct, respectively (Table 2). In the chondrogenic group, the ECM was predominately hyaline like (Figs. 2A and 3A), whereas in the osteogenic group, the ECM was fibrocartilaginous (Figs. 2B and 3B). Collagen type I was present at low levels in both groups at both time points (data not shown). Collagen type II, the major collagen in cartilage, was prevalent in the chondrogenic group (Figs. 2C and 3C), but was not detected in the osteogenic group (Figs. 2D and 3D). The amount of GAG, an indicator of cartilage, depended on culture time and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001). In the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, 45-day constructs had GAG contents of 1370 μg/construct and 29 μg/construct, respectively (Table 2). Consistently, GAG staining by safranin-O was intense in the chondrogenic group (Fig. 3E), but was not detected in the osteogenic group (Fig. 3F). FIG. 2.

Stains were (A, B) Masson's trichrome, (C, D) collagen type II (green) and DAPI (blue), (E, F) safranin-O/fast green, and (G–J) alizarin red. Arrows (H, J) show mineralized cells. Scale bars: (A, B, E–J) 50 μm and (C, D) 500 μm. Color images available online at www.liebertonline.com/ten. In the chondrogenic group at 45 days, columns of rounded cells in lacunae were oriented perpendicular to the surface in the deep and middle portions of the construct, and elongated cells were aligned in parallel to the surface in the superficial portions (Fig. 3C). This cellular organization is analogous to certain architectural features present in normal articular cartilage. Mineralization was demonstrated by quantitative calcium assay, histological staining, and microCT imaging. The amount of calcium depended on culture time and medium additives, with significant interactive effects present (all p < 0.0001) (Table 2). In the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, 45-day constructs had calcium contents of 247 μg/construct and 441 μg/construct, respectively. In the chondrogenic group, ALP activity depended on culture time and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001) (Table 2). Between days 1 and 21, ALP activity increased 100-fold and 10-fold in the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, respectively. In the chondrogenic group, mineralized regions were not found at 21 days (Fig. 2G), but were present in some but not all regions at 45 days (Fig. 3G, H), by alizarin red staining. In the osteogenic group, mineralized regions were present at 21 days (Fig. 2H) and in some but not all regions at 45 days (Fig. 3 I, J). Small nodules were observed by phase-contrast microscopy in the chondrogenic group at 45 days and in the osteogenic group at 21 and 45 days (data not shown). The 45-day constructs from the chondrogenic group exhibited mineralization at the interface between newly formed tissue and the underlying PCL scaffold, and in a ring-like pattern, based on histological cross sections (Fig. 4A), and top-down microCT views (Fig. 4B), respectively. Mineralization was colocalized in areas where hyaline-like cartilage matrix was also deposited, based on serial histological sections. Specifically, in the same region where alizarin red stain revealed mineralization (Fig. 4A inset and C), a hyaline cartilage matrix was evident by safranin-O (Fig. 4D) and Masson's trichrome (Fig. 4E). In 21- and 45-day constructs in the osteogenic group, sparse mineralization was observed throughout the PCL scaffold, based on histological cross sections and microCT images (data not shown). FIG. 4.

In the chondrogenic group, mRNA expression patterns were characteristic of chondrogenesis followed by chondrocyte hypertrophy, as demonstrated by RT-PCR (Table 3). Specifically, Sox-9, collagen type II, and aggrecan were sequentially expressed. Moreover, early and late bone markers were also detected. Specifically, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα1/Runx2), ALP, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and osteocalcin were sequentially expressed. Collagen type I collagen and osteonectin expression was highest at day 1, followed by downregulation. In the osteogenic group genes characteristic of bone formation were expressed, but at levels similar to or lower than those in the chondrogenic group at days 1 and 21, and lower than those in chondrogenic group at day 45 (Table 3). In the osteogenic group, expression of the cartilage markers Sox-9, collagen type II, and aggrecan was at least one order of magnitude lower than in the chondrogenic group. Table 3.

At 21 days, constructs in the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups exhibited similar values of HA and k, but between days 21 and 45, HA decreased and k increased in the chondrogenic group, whereas neither parameter changed significantly in the osteogenic group (Table 2). Young's modulus depended significantly on medium additives (p < 0.0001), and was consistently lower in the chondrogenic group than in the osteogenic group (Table 2). Complex shear modulus was independent of medium additives and time (Table 2). Phase angle ranged from 20° to 30° under all conditions tested, suggesting viscoelastic solid-like behavior.",

In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed ECM at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. The study opens up new possibilities for osteochondral tissue engineering, which is a clinically relevant strategy for cartilage regeneration of the knee. For example, by providing different concentrations of oxygen and/or growth factors on the upper and lower surfaces of hMSC-based constructs, it may be feasible to maintain cartilaginous tissue on one side, while inducing bone formation on the opposite side. The finding that 21-day cultures in chondrogenic medium exhibited chondrogenic differentiation and mechanical functionality (Fig. 2; Tables 1 and 2) is consistent with our previous study.17 The finding of sequential regulation of the transcription factors Sox-9, collagen type II, and aggrecan (Table 3) provided evidence of active cellular processes. We attribute the development of cartilaginous tissue to soluble medium additives (TGF-β, ITS, and dexamethasone) in the context of a 3D cellular substrate with appropriate mechanical stiffness. Aggregate modulus (average ± standard deviation) of 21-day constructs in the present study (HA, 0.24 ± 0.044 MPa; Table 2) was somewhat lower than that of our previous study of 21-day constructs based on hMSCs embedded in Matrigel and 3D woven PCL and cultured statically (HA, 0.37 ± 0.079 MPa).17 Possible explanations for this difference, which may or may not be statistically significant, include use in the present study of collagen gel for cell seeding25 and operator-to-operator differences in cell seeding technique. Research to further optimize cell seeding technique is in progress. In the present study, aggregate moduli of 3D woven scaffolds seeded with hMSC and cultured for 21 days in chondrogenic and osteogenic media (HA ∼0.24 and ∼0.27 MPa, respectively, Table 2) were lower than those previously reported for the same scaffolds cultured without cells for 14–28 days (HA ∼0.45 MPa), which was the longest duration previously tested.24 In the present study, an increase in culture duration to 45 days was associated with a decrease in HA, an increase in k, and the formation of a thick tissue-like layer comprised of cells and ECM that extended beyond the confines of the scaffold in the chondrogenic group (Table 2 and Fig. 1E, F), while mechanical properties were maintained and thick surface layers did not form in the osteogenic group (Table 2; Fig. 1G, H). Together, these data suggest that construct mechanical properties were initially dominated by the 3D woven scaffold, which had a relatively high compressive modulus, but were then influenced by ECM that secreted by the cultured cells, which had a lower compressive modulus. This effect depended on culture duration and was particularly evident in the chondrogenic medium group, where under static culture conditions a thick layer of ECM was deposited at the construct surfaces led to reductions in HA and E and an increase in k (Table 2). We attribute the inhomogeneous overgrowth that occurred to the static culture conditions and potentially to the influence of type I collagen gel on chondrogenesis, based on previous studies.17,25–30 Further studies are warranted to determine relative contributions to construct mechanical properties of the scaffold versus ECM, and to assess longer term mechanical properties of the 3D woven PCL without and with cultured cells. An important finding of the present study was that of regional mineralization of the cartilaginous matrix after 45 days in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4 and Tables 1 and 2). While chondrogenic stimulation of constructs increased expression of cartilage markers, our findings also suggest that long-term culture of these constructs resulted in a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype. Thus, the mineralization pattern observed in these constructs may be analogous in some respects to processes that occur during endochondral ossification31,32 Upregulation of the bone transcription factor Cbfα1/Runx2 in association with other bone markers ALP, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and osteocalcin (Table 3) provided evidence of active cellular processes, although passive calcium deposition may also have occurred as in a recent study.33 Consistently, increased expression by hMSC of these genes as well as collagen type X, the hallmark of hypertrophic chondrocytes, was previously reported after chondrogenic induction.34–37 Moreover, bone marker expression was amplified by prolonged culture in some studies.38,39 Our use of type I collagen as the cell seeding gel may have played a role in committing some hMSC toward osteogenesis.40,41 On the basis of previous studies associating ECM stiffness with MSC lineage commitment,16 it is possible that mineralization was triggered by local mechanical cues imparted by the type I collagen gel and/or the PCL scaffold. For example, a comparative study of gel-like carrier materials showed that Matrigel suppressed calcification in ectopic implants of MSC-seeded constructs.25 Alternatively, the slowly degrading scaffold (e.g., PCL) may have played a role, since mineralization was not observed in vitro in constructs based on hMSCs and a rapidly degrading PGA scaffold, even after extended (i.e., 12 week) culture.13 Hence, different temporal patterns of mechanical cues provided by the two scaffold platforms (PCL or PGA) could explain the observed mineralization (or lack thereof). It is also possible that mineralization was triggered by local physiologic cues, such as gradients in oxygen tension or pH, as cartilage development is associated with anaerobic conditions, while bone development is associated with more aerobic conditions.42,43 However, measurement of these physicochemical parameters was beyond the scope of the present study; hence, future studies may address their roles in inducing site-specific tissue differentiation. Likewise, it would be interesting to know whether the differences observed between chondrogenic and osteogenic media would also be seen with different scaffold materials and structures. One limitation of the current work is that the data set was derived from a single cell donor, whereas five or six different donors would be required to address the donor-to-donor variability in hMSCs that can result in unforeseen irregularities not associated with the current experimental parameters. In our ongoing work, hMSCs from additional donors are being combined with 3D woven PCL to address the important issue of donor-to-donor variability. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that culture duration and medium additives significantly influenced chondrogenesis and/or osteogenesis by hMSCs in the context of a scaffold with appropriate mechanical properties. The study opens up new possibilities for osteochondral tissue engineering. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are expected to lead to improved regenerative platforms (i.e., scaffolds and in vitro culture environments), and to more reliable therapeutic products.",

Copyright notice ID: 2991213 PMID: 20673022 Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) woven poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression were analyzed. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed extracellular matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended on culture duration and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001). The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical properties on the order of magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young's, and shear moduli of 0.15, 0.12, and 0.033 MPa, respectively). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα1)/Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis. Long-term culture of hMSC on 3D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered cartilage, and stiffer underlying scaffold. These findings merit consideration when developing grafts for osteochondral defect repair.Introduction Articular cartilage possesses a complex, zonal architecture that enables smooth articulation at the joint surface and rigid attachment to the subchondral bone. Since bone-to-bone interfaces are known to integrate better and faster than cartilage-to-bone interfaces, tissue-engineered osteochondral constructs are a promising technique for articular cartilage repair.1,2 Indeed, various composite grafts have been explored for osteochondral tissue regeneration utilizing a variety of cell-seeded scaffolds, including hyaluronan sponges with calcium phosphate supports,3 nonwoven poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) meshes with collagen-hydroxyapatite supports,4 three-dimensional (3D) printed poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly(lactide) scaffolds with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/tricalcium phosphate supports,5 agarose gels with devitalized trabecular bones,6 and collagen gels with hydroxyapatite supports.7 Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a promising cell source for osteochondral tissue engineering, due to their multilineage differentiation potential.8,9 Moreover, dynamic interaction between intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (i.e., chemical, mechanical, and temporal) factors determine the developmental fate of hMSCs10,11 and tissue-engineered constructs.12,13 Appropriate control of these factors may lead to favorable outcomes in osteochondral tissue engineering. The present work describes cartilage and bone tissue engineering using hMSCs and a 3D woven scaffold that we recently developed.14 Poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) was selected as the scaffold material because it degrades relatively slowly15 and possesses an appropriately high bulk stiffness to facilitate MSC differentiation toward skeletal lineages.16 In our recent in vitro study17 chondrogenesis and mechanical functionality were clearly evident for 21-day constructs made from hMSCs embedded in Matrigel and cultured statically on 3D woven PCL scaffolds, with average aggregate and Young's moduli (HA of 0.37 MPa and E of 0.41 MPa, respectively) approaching values reported for normal articular cartilage (HA of 0.1–2.0 MPa; E of 0.4–0.8 MPa).18–20 In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression in engineered skeletal tissues generated using hMSCs and 3D woven PCL scaffolds. On the basis of our recent finding that static culture supported chondrogenesis in this in vitro model,17 all constructs in the present study were cultured statically. We selected to seed the PCL scaffolds with hMSC mixed in a type I collagen gel such that gel entrapment enhanced cell seeding efficiency and helped to maintain spherical cell morphology for promotion of chondrogenesis.21 In one group of constructs, the medium was supplemented with soluble molecular mediators associated with chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs (i.e., transforming growth factor [TGF]-β, insulin, and dexamethasone),22 whereas in the other group the medium contained additives associated with osteogenic differentiation (i.e., serum, β-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone).23 Properties of the resulting engineered tissues were assessed at multiple levels at culture days 1, 21, and 45.Materials and Methods Construct preparation and cultivation All cell culture reagents were obtained from InVitrogen or Sigma, unless otherwise specified. The hMSCs were derived from bone marrow aspirates obtained from a healthy, middle-aged adult man with informed consent according to an Institutional Review Board–approved protocol at Case Western Reserve University. Before seeding on PCL scaffolds, the hMSCs were expanded by ∼10-fold during a single passage in which cells were plated at 5500 cells/cm2 and cultured in basic medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/mL of fibroblast growth factor-2; Peprotech). The 3D woven scaffold was made from PCL yarn (24 μm diameter per filament; 44 filaments/yarn, Grilon KE-60; EMS/Griltech). In brief, 11 in-plane layers aligned perpendicularly in the warp (x) and weft (y) directions were interlocked by a third set of yarns running in the z direction using a custom-built loom.14 The roughly 1.4-mm-thick scaffolds had porosity of 61% ± 0.2%, and approximate pore dimensions of 330 × 260 × 100 μm. One million P2 hMSCs were mixed with 30 μL of 0.6% (w/v) type I collagen gel (BD Biosciences), and the resulting mixture was pipetted onto each PCL scaffold (7-mm-diameter, 1.3-mm-thick discs). The dry scaffolds readily absorbed the cell–hydrogel mixture and the initial distribution of cells throughout scaffolds appeared to be relatively uniform, as in our recent report,17 and therefore we did not elect to use the vacuum manifold setup described in other reports.14,24 The resulting constructs were placed in 12-well plates (one construct per well), incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2/room air incubator to allow collagen gelation, and then 2 mL of differentiation medium was added to each well. Two experimental groups were compared: (1) a chondrogenic group, in which basic medium was supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant human TGF-β3 (Peprotech), 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS+) premix (BD Biosciences), 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma), 82 mg/L ascorbic-2-phosphate, 0.4 mM proline, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 1 M HEPES buffer, and (2) an osteogenic group, in which basic medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 100 nM dexamethasone, and 50 mg/mL ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. Culture media were completely replaced every 2–3 days, and constructs were harvested at culture day 1, 21, or 45. For 21- and 45-day constructs, the differentiating medium was replaced with serum-free medium 24 h before harvest, and the constructs were rinsed at the time of harvest. The constructs were not intentionally moved during the culture; however, they may have been inadvertently flipped over during medium replacement.Construct analyses Samples for histology (n = 2 per group) were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned to 5 μm.17 Histological stains included hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, safranin-O/fast green, and alizarin red at Histoserv. Immunohistochemical stains included collagen types I and II; these markers were assessed individually, similar to our previous description.17 Apoptosis staining was done using a TACS 2 TdT-DAB in situ detection kit (Trevigen). Samples for microcomputerized tomography (1–2 per group) were formalin fixed, immersed in 70% ethanol, and loaded into a microCT 40 system (Scanco Medical). Medium-resolution scans were obtained in 16 μm increments at energy of 45 kVp and intensity of 177 μA. Three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained using accompanying commercial software (Scanco). Amounts of DNA, glycosaminoglycans (GAG), and ortho-hydroxyproline (OHP) were measured on papain-digested samples (n = 3 per group), as previously described.17 Construct amounts of calcium were measured (n = 3 per group) using a commercial assay (Pointe Scientific), following sample lyophilization, homogenization in 0.5 M HCl, and vigorous mixing for 16 h at 4°C. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was calculated (n = 3 per group) using Sigmafast p-nitrophenyl phosphate Tablets (Sigma) following sample homogenization in 0.75 M 2-amino-2-methyl propanol solution and measurement of absorptivity kinetics of reaction products at 405 nm with a Perkin Elmer Victor 3 plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Biphasic mechanical testing was performed to determine aggregate modulus (HA), hydraulic permeability (k), Young's modulus (E), and complex shear modulus (G*) as previously described.24 Test specimens were obtained (n = 3–6 per group) by punching 3-mm-diameter cores from the centers of harvested constructs. Confined-compression creep tests and unconfined stress–relaxation tests were performed using a Bose-Enduratec ELF 3200 materials testing system. For confined compression test, specimens from the chondrogenic group were subjected to a 5-gf tare load and a 15-gf step compressive load, to ensure that strains remained in the infinitesimal range; specimens from the osteogenic group equilibrated to a 10-gf tare load before application of a 30-gf step compressive load. For unconfined stress–relaxation tests, specimens were equilibrated to a 5-gf tare load, and then strain steps of 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16 were sequentially applied, with each step lasting for 900 s. Dynamic frequency sweep tests were performed using an ARES Rheometrics System. Specimens were placed between two porous rigid platens in a bath of phosphate-buffered saline. After equilibration to a compressive offset strain of 10%, a sinusoidal shear strain was applied. Parameters for the dynamic test include a shear strain amplitude 5% and an angular frequency (ω) that increased logarithmically from 1 to 50 rad/s. Values were reported for ω = 10 rad/s. Total RNA was isolated (n = 2 samples per group) by homogenization in Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by extraction in chloroform and centrifugation (20,800 g, 4°C, 20 min). The RNA was precipitated by adding 2-propanol followed by centrifugation (20,800 g, 4°C, 20 min). The pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, centrifuged (10,600 g, 4°C, 10 min), dried, dissolved in water, and frozen at −80°C. cDNA was synthesized by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) with a PCR Sprint Thermal cycler (Thermo Electron Co.). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) detecting reagent on a Sequence Step One Plus real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression level was first normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and then normalized to the mRNA level measured for the corresponding 1-day sample from the chondrogenic group. Sequences of PCR primers are provided in Table 1. Table 1.

Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results Construct wet and dry weight increased significantly with culture time in both groups (Table 2). In the chondrogenic group, the upward-facing surfaces were smooth and hyaline like (Fig. 1A, B), whereas tissue formation was less pronounced at the lower surfaces facing the bottom of the culture well. In the osteogenic group the surfaces were rough with the woven contours of the underlying PCL scaffold clearly visible (Fig. 1C, D). In the chondrogenic group, abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) was present throughout the full thickness of the constructs at 21 days (Fig. 1E), and new tissue extended beyond the confines of the PCL scaffold at 45 days (Fig. 1F). In contrast, in the osteogenic group ECM was less prevalent and was confined within the PCL scaffold (Fig. 1G, H). DNA content was significantly influenced by culture time but not medium additives (Table 2). Between culture days 1 and 21, DNA increased by two- to threefold, whereas between days 21 and 45 DNA decreased slightly in both groups. In the chondrogenic group at 21 days, cell morphology was predominately polygonal, with some cells exhibiting rounded, chondrocytic morphology (Fig. 1I) and a few fibroblastic cells. After 45 days, various characteristics of mature chondrocytes were evident, including condensed cells in lacunae (Fig. 1J) and nesting cells (Fig. 1K). In the osteogenic group, cell morphologies at 21 and 45 days ranged from fibroblastic to elongated, with no chondrocytic cells present (Fig. 1L, M). Apoptosis was not prevalent, but pycnotic cells were occasionally present in the central and lower regions of constructs cultured in both types of media (data not shown). Table 2.

Color images available online at www.liebertonline.com/ten.The amount of OHP, an indicator of total collagen, depended on culture time and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001) (Table 2). In the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, 45-day constructs had OHP contents of 75 and 27 μg/construct, respectively (Table 2). In the chondrogenic group, the ECM was predominately hyaline like (Figs. 2A and 3A), whereas in the osteogenic group, the ECM was fibrocartilaginous (Figs. 2B and 3B). Collagen type I was present at low levels in both groups at both time points (data not shown). Collagen type II, the major collagen in cartilage, was prevalent in the chondrogenic group (Figs. 2C and 3C), but was not detected in the osteogenic group (Figs. 2D and 3D). The amount of GAG, an indicator of cartilage, depended on culture time and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001). In the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, 45-day constructs had GAG contents of 1370 μg/construct and 29 μg/construct, respectively (Table 2). Consistently, GAG staining by safranin-O was intense in the chondrogenic group (Fig. 3E), but was not detected in the osteogenic group (Fig. 3F). FIG. 2.

Color images available online at www.liebertonline.com/ten.In the chondrogenic group at 45 days, columns of rounded cells in lacunae were oriented perpendicular to the surface in the deep and middle portions of the construct, and elongated cells were aligned in parallel to the surface in the superficial portions (Fig. 3C). This cellular organization is analogous to certain architectural features present in normal articular cartilage. Mineralization was demonstrated by quantitative calcium assay, histological staining, and microCT imaging. The amount of calcium depended on culture time and medium additives, with significant interactive effects present (all p < 0.0001) (Table 2). In the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, 45-day constructs had calcium contents of 247 μg/construct and 441 μg/construct, respectively. In the chondrogenic group, ALP activity depended on culture time and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001) (Table 2). Between days 1 and 21, ALP activity increased 100-fold and 10-fold in the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups, respectively. In the chondrogenic group, mineralized regions were not found at 21 days (Fig. 2G), but were present in some but not all regions at 45 days (Fig. 3G, H), by alizarin red staining. In the osteogenic group, mineralized regions were present at 21 days (Fig. 2H) and in some but not all regions at 45 days (Fig. 3 I, J). Small nodules were observed by phase-contrast microscopy in the chondrogenic group at 45 days and in the osteogenic group at 21 and 45 days (data not shown). The 45-day constructs from the chondrogenic group exhibited mineralization at the interface between newly formed tissue and the underlying PCL scaffold, and in a ring-like pattern, based on histological cross sections (Fig. 4A), and top-down microCT views (Fig. 4B), respectively. Mineralization was colocalized in areas where hyaline-like cartilage matrix was also deposited, based on serial histological sections. Specifically, in the same region where alizarin red stain revealed mineralization (Fig. 4A inset and C), a hyaline cartilage matrix was evident by safranin-O (Fig. 4D) and Masson's trichrome (Fig. 4E). In 21- and 45-day constructs in the osteogenic group, sparse mineralization was observed throughout the PCL scaffold, based on histological cross sections and microCT images (data not shown). FIG. 4.

Color images available online at www.liebertonline.com/ten.In the chondrogenic group, mRNA expression patterns were characteristic of chondrogenesis followed by chondrocyte hypertrophy, as demonstrated by RT-PCR (Table 3). Specifically, Sox-9, collagen type II, and aggrecan were sequentially expressed. Moreover, early and late bone markers were also detected. Specifically, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα1/Runx2), ALP, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and osteocalcin were sequentially expressed. Collagen type I collagen and osteonectin expression was highest at day 1, followed by downregulation. In the osteogenic group genes characteristic of bone formation were expressed, but at levels similar to or lower than those in the chondrogenic group at days 1 and 21, and lower than those in chondrogenic group at day 45 (Table 3). In the osteogenic group, expression of the cartilage markers Sox-9, collagen type II, and aggrecan was at least one order of magnitude lower than in the chondrogenic group. Table 3.

Aggregate modulus (HA) depended significantly on medium additives (p < 0.0001) (Table 2). Hydraulic permeability (k) depended on culture time and medium additives with a significant interactive effect (all p < 0.05). At 21 days, constructs in the chondrogenic and osteogenic groups exhibited similar values of HA and k, but between days 21 and 45, HA decreased and k increased in the chondrogenic group, whereas neither parameter changed significantly in the osteogenic group (Table 2). Young's modulus depended significantly on medium additives (p < 0.0001), and was consistently lower in the chondrogenic group than in the osteogenic group (Table 2). Complex shear modulus was independent of medium additives and time (Table 2). Phase angle ranged from 20° to 30° under all conditions tested, suggesting viscoelastic solid-like behavior.Discussion In this study, significant effects of culture duration and medium additives on hMSC-based tissue-engineered cartilage and bone were demonstrated by structural, compositional, mechanical, and genetic methods. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed ECM at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. The study opens up new possibilities for osteochondral tissue engineering, which is a clinically relevant strategy for cartilage regeneration of the knee. For example, by providing different concentrations of oxygen and/or growth factors on the upper and lower surfaces of hMSC-based constructs, it may be feasible to maintain cartilaginous tissue on one side, while inducing bone formation on the opposite side. The finding that 21-day cultures in chondrogenic medium exhibited chondrogenic differentiation and mechanical functionality (Fig. 2; Tables 1 and 2) is consistent with our previous study.17 The finding of sequential regulation of the transcription factors Sox-9, collagen type II, and aggrecan (Table 3) provided evidence of active cellular processes. We attribute the development of cartilaginous tissue to soluble medium additives (TGF-β, ITS, and dexamethasone) in the context of a 3D cellular substrate with appropriate mechanical stiffness. Aggregate modulus (average ± standard deviation) of 21-day constructs in the present study (HA, 0.24 ± 0.044 MPa; Table 2) was somewhat lower than that of our previous study of 21-day constructs based on hMSCs embedded in Matrigel and 3D woven PCL and cultured statically (HA, 0.37 ± 0.079 MPa).17 Possible explanations for this difference, which may or may not be statistically significant, include use in the present study of collagen gel for cell seeding25 and operator-to-operator differences in cell seeding technique. Research to further optimize cell seeding technique is in progress. In the present study, aggregate moduli of 3D woven scaffolds seeded with hMSC and cultured for 21 days in chondrogenic and osteogenic media (HA ∼0.24 and ∼0.27 MPa, respectively, Table 2) were lower than those previously reported for the same scaffolds cultured without cells for 14–28 days (HA ∼0.45 MPa), which was the longest duration previously tested.24 In the present study, an increase in culture duration to 45 days was associated with a decrease in HA, an increase in k, and the formation of a thick tissue-like layer comprised of cells and ECM that extended beyond the confines of the scaffold in the chondrogenic group (Table 2 and Fig. 1E, F), while mechanical properties were maintained and thick surface layers did not form in the osteogenic group (Table 2; Fig. 1G, H). Together, these data suggest that construct mechanical properties were initially dominated by the 3D woven scaffold, which had a relatively high compressive modulus, but were then influenced by ECM that secreted by the cultured cells, which had a lower compressive modulus. This effect depended on culture duration and was particularly evident in the chondrogenic medium group, where under static culture conditions a thick layer of ECM was deposited at the construct surfaces led to reductions in HA and E and an increase in k (Table 2). We attribute the inhomogeneous overgrowth that occurred to the static culture conditions and potentially to the influence of type I collagen gel on chondrogenesis, based on previous studies.17,25–30 Further studies are warranted to determine relative contributions to construct mechanical properties of the scaffold versus ECM, and to assess longer term mechanical properties of the 3D woven PCL without and with cultured cells. An important finding of the present study was that of regional mineralization of the cartilaginous matrix after 45 days in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4 and Tables 1 and 2). While chondrogenic stimulation of constructs increased expression of cartilage markers, our findings also suggest that long-term culture of these constructs resulted in a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype. Thus, the mineralization pattern observed in these constructs may be analogous in some respects to processes that occur during endochondral ossification31,32 Upregulation of the bone transcription factor Cbfα1/Runx2 in association with other bone markers ALP, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and osteocalcin (Table 3) provided evidence of active cellular processes, although passive calcium deposition may also have occurred as in a recent study.33 Consistently, increased expression by hMSC of these genes as well as collagen type X, the hallmark of hypertrophic chondrocytes, was previously reported after chondrogenic induction.34–37 Moreover, bone marker expression was amplified by prolonged culture in some studies.38,39 Our use of type I collagen as the cell seeding gel may have played a role in committing some hMSC toward osteogenesis.40,41 On the basis of previous studies associating ECM stiffness with MSC lineage commitment,16 it is possible that mineralization was triggered by local mechanical cues imparted by the type I collagen gel and/or the PCL scaffold. For example, a comparative study of gel-like carrier materials showed that Matrigel suppressed calcification in ectopic implants of MSC-seeded constructs.25 Alternatively, the slowly degrading scaffold (e.g., PCL) may have played a role, since mineralization was not observed in vitro in constructs based on hMSCs and a rapidly degrading PGA scaffold, even after extended (i.e., 12 week) culture.13 Hence, different temporal patterns of mechanical cues provided by the two scaffold platforms (PCL or PGA) could explain the observed mineralization (or lack thereof). It is also possible that mineralization was triggered by local physiologic cues, such as gradients in oxygen tension or pH, as cartilage development is associated with anaerobic conditions, while bone development is associated with more aerobic conditions.42,43 However, measurement of these physicochemical parameters was beyond the scope of the present study; hence, future studies may address their roles in inducing site-specific tissue differentiation. Likewise, it would be interesting to know whether the differences observed between chondrogenic and osteogenic media would also be seen with different scaffold materials and structures. One limitation of the current work is that the data set was derived from a single cell donor, whereas five or six different donors would be required to address the donor-to-donor variability in hMSCs that can result in unforeseen irregularities not associated with the current experimental parameters. In our ongoing work, hMSCs from additional donors are being combined with 3D woven PCL to address the important issue of donor-to-donor variability. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that culture duration and medium additives significantly influenced chondrogenesis and/or osteogenesis by hMSCs in the context of a scaffold with appropriate mechanical properties. The study opens up new possibilities for osteochondral tissue engineering. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are expected to lead to improved regenerative platforms (i.e., scaffolds and in vitro culture environments), and to more reliable therapeutic products.Acknowledgments This work was supported by  AR055414, NASA NNJ04HC72G, and C.S.

    "abstract": "Abstract The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility. Subject terms: Microbial communities, Microbial genetics, Metagenomics, Microbiota",
    "introduction": "Introduction The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27 of Earth’s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to Mars in the Global Exploration Roadmap1,2, and sustainable long-term lunar exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable this ambitious goal. These guiding objectives have driven development of the imminent commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) destinations and Gateway, and the Artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early 2030 s3. Major challenges associated to longer duration spaceflight and habitation off-Earth are identified in the NASA Moon to Mars Objectives4, including the goal to advance understanding of how biology responds to the Moon, Mars, and deep space to support safe human space missions. Consistently observed spaceflight-associated pathologies, notably disrupted glucose metabolism characterised by insulin resistance and lipid metabolism dysregulation, pose significant risks to astronaut health5,6. Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulated microgravity model system developed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre characterised increases in pancreatic production of α-TNF, which increased insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes7. In mice, a reduction of insulin sensitivity has been observed after microgravity simulation using hindlimb unloading8. This is reflected in the muscle transcriptome after spaceflight, where insulin receptor signalling is suggestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis9. Similarly, simulated microgravity on human oligodendrocyte10 and mesenchymal stem11 cell cultures increases production of fatty acids and complex lipids. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the intestinal lipid metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 respond to simulated microgravity, with RNAi knockdown of sbp-1 and mdt-15 reducing lipid toxicity12. Spaceflight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605, 690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87))13–15 characterised rats as hyperlipidemic, with spaceflight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and substantial increases in cholesterol (67%). Similar lipid dysregulation, suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently observed mammalian response to spaceflight alongside aligned disruption of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis16–20. These observations in mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic proteins which drive lipid metabolism, significant increases in steatosis, cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids. The immune system can be compromised by spaceflight, both in space and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before flight, infection with influenza and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been observed in astronauts21. Up to 50% of astronauts also exhibit immunodeficiency upon returning to Earth22, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This dysregulation manifests through decreased T cell and B cell abundance23, and impaired natural killer cell and macrophage function24,25. The underlying cause of these changes are thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with spaceflight26, as well as shifts in the gut microbiome27. On Earth, comparable changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, immune and psychophysiological function have been associated to gut microbiota28–32. Similarly, unique built environment surface microbiology arises from long-duration confinement, reshaping the bidirectional exchanges between usually diverse environmental microbial ecosystems and the gut microbiome to promote opportunistic pathogenicity33–37. Given the potential involvement of gut microbiota in spaceflight pathology, and their essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on Earth, there has been increasing research into gut microbiome dynamics associated with spaceflight. Using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) amplicon sequencing, Jiang et al.38 identified significant changes in the relative abundance of 16 OTUs in the gut microbiome of mice in Rodent Research (RR) 1 (RR-1) mission, some of which were annotated as within the genera Staphylococcus and Tyzzerella, and were lower in mice after spaceflight compared to ground controls. More recently, Bedree et al.39 explored the gut microbiome of BALB/c mice flown in the RR-5 mission using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identified 14 ASVs as different in relative abundance (p <0.1) between spaceflight (ISS) and ground controls after 9 weeks of spaceflight, including increases in the genera Clostridium, Romboutsia, Ruminiclostridium, and Shuttleworthia, and decreases in Hungatella, while WMS identified significant enrichment of Dorea sp. and the species Lactobacillus murinus. In this study, species-resolved 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and de novo co-assembled WMS were employed to capture metagenomic changes in the murine gut microbiome associated with spaceflight across multiple samples as part of the RR-6 mission (Fig. 1). Intestinal and hepatic transcriptomics were then used to assess the associated gene expression response of mice to spaceflight. Fig. 1. Experimental design.

    "methods": "Methods Experimental design Female 32 weeks-old C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconic Biosciences sources) from four treatment groups of the Rodent Research 6 mission were compared: flight live animal return (FLT_LAR), ground control for live animal return (GC_LAR), flight ISS (FLT_ISS) and ground control for ISS (GC_ISS) (Fig. 1). FLT_ISS and FLT_LAR mice comprised 40 mice that were launched on SpaceX-13 and transferred to the rodent research habitat on the ISS whereas their matched ground controls, GC_ISS and GC_LAR, were 40 mice kept in identical rodent habitats at Kennedy Space Centre. Not all mice were available to NASA GeneLab for DNA and RNA extractions (replicate numbers provided below). Diet (LabDiet Rodent 5001) and deionized autoclaved water were provided ad libitum, and a 12:12 h dark/light cycle maintained. After 29 days of flight onboard the ISS, FLT_LAR mice were returned to earth as part of the Live Animal Return (13/1/18) and sacrificed alongside GC_LAR using common processing at ages of 41 weeks old (16/1/18). FLT_ISS mice were sacrificed after 53–56 days of flight onboard the ISS at the same time as GC_ISS mice at the Kennedy Space Centre at 44 weeks old using a common timeline and methodology. During this period in the Destiny module (US laboratory) on the ISS, the mice were exposed to an average daily 165.8 µGy d−1 Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) dose and 117.3 µGy d−1 South Atlantic Anomaly (energetic protons) dose (data provided by Ames Life Sciences Data Archive - ALSDA). This is in line with standard range of exposure on the ISS148, and represents around a 100% increase to common exposure on earth. The temperature, relative humidity and elevated carbon dioxide levels on the ISS were mimicked in the ground control rodent habitats at the Kennedy Space over the 56 days of spaceflight, so were not significantly different (t-test, p > 0.05) between flight and ground controls, and averaged 22.75 (±0.35) °C, 41.49 (±2.28) % and 3219 (±340) CO2 ppm, respectively. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocol (Protocol number RR6) was approved on October 24, 2017, by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). As outlined in the NASA Genelab record (OSD-249), Anaesthesia for the LAR mice groups was induced using isoflurane. For the ISS mice groups, anaesthesia was administered via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine during the dissection period, which occurred 53–56 days post-launch. Blood samples were obtained via closed-chest cardiac puncture, though these were not used in this study. Euthanasia was performed by exsanguination followed by thoracotomy. The ISS spaceflight mice carcasses underwent hind limb dissection, which was not used in this study, then were wrapped in aluminium foil, placed in Ziploc bags, and stored at −80 °C or colder until return. The ISS Ground Control followed the same euthanasia methods and preservation timeline at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Experimental endpoints included the collection of blood samples, completion of hind limb dissection, and collection of faecal samples. Faecal samples were extruded from the colon during dissection, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Additionally, liver and colon (RNASeq explored here), and spleen, lung, thymus, and dorsal skin samples were collected for further analysis. DNA extraction Faecal samples from 32 RR6 mice were available for DNA extraction: n = 9 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 7 mice from GC_LAR, n = 7 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) (OSD-249). Half of a frozen faecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB solution and homogenised using tissue homogenising bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 4 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 °C and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was eluted in 105 µL RNAse free H2O and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research). Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All DNA sequence data is available in the NASA GeneLab record OSD-249. 16S rRNA gene amplification DNA library preparation was performed by the Genome Research Core (GRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 10 ng of genomic DNA was used as input to a two-stage PCR amplification protocol149,150. In the first stage, primers 515 F/806 R (Earth Microbiome Project, V4 targeting) containing Fluidigm ‘Common Sequence’ linkers (CS1 and CS2) were used to amplify gDNA. In the second stage, Fluidigm AccessArray barcoded primers were used to amplify PCR products from the first stage and incorporate Illumina sequencing adaptors and a sample barcode. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiniSeq mid-output flow cell, employing paired-end 2 × 153 base reads. Whole metagenome sequencing Whole metagenome sequence libraries were prepared using an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Input DNA was ~100 ng per reaction, and five cycles of PCR were performed. Index adaptors used were IDT for Illumina, 96-well Nextera Flex Dual Index Adapters, set A. Library fragment sizes (~550 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured with a KAPA Library quantification kit (Roche, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center). RNA extraction and sequencing Colon samples from 36 RR6 mice were available for RNA extraction: n = 10 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 8 mice from GC_LAR, n = 9 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. Liver samples from 39 mice were available for RNA extraction: n = 10 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 9 mice from GC_LAR, n = 10 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 10 mice from GC_ISS. RNA was extracted from mouse tissue samples using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenisation buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozen colon (OSD-247) or liver (OSD-245) tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenisation was performed using tissue homogenising bead mix (Zirconium Oxide 2.0 mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Kit or RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol. Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. Input RNA amounts were ~500 ng; RNA RIN values were > 4. Index adaptors were 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles of PCR were performed. Library fragment sizes (~300 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center) and all RNA sequencing data is provided for in the NASA GeneLab records OSD-247 (colon) or OSD-245 (liver). 16S rRNA gene barcoding Amplicon sequence reads were processed and annotated using Anchor28,35,139,151,152. Exact sequence variants (ESV) were identified in place of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)153,154. Sequences were aligned and dereplicated using Mothur155 and a count threshold parameter of 96. Annotation at family, genus or species-level used BLASTn criteria of >99% identity and coverage to the  16 S curated and  nr/nt databases (January 2022 versions). Differentially abundant ESVs were manually assessed for quality. When the highest identity/coverage was shared amongst multiple different references, all annotations were retained and reported. Differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2156,157, which performs well with sparse data and uneven library sizes158. Sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single sample was required to be <90% of the count in all samples, and ESV counts were required to be >0 in at least 3 samples from the same group35. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 correction was applied159. Whole metagenome sequencing co-assembly and annotation Quality control used Trim Galore! (v0.6.6)160, a wrapper script to automate quality and adaptor trimming as well as quality control. Trim Galore is based on cutadapt (v2.10)161 and fastqc (v0.11.5)162. Trim Galore! PARAMETERS : --trim-n --max_n 0 --paired --retain_unpaired --phred33 --length 75 -q 5 --stringency 1 -e 0.1 -j 1. BBMAP163 was used to remove potential contamination from human using the masked version of hg19 human assembly. To remove redundancy in read dataset and reduce the computational load, reads were normalised using ORNA164 with the following parameters: -sorting 1 -base 1.7 -kmer 21. MEGAHIT v1.2.9165 was used to assemble reads from all samples into one co-assembly using meta-large option. Kallisto (v0.46.2)166 expectation maximisation algorithm was used to complete metagenomics read assignment and infer contig abundance167. Prodigal (v2.6.3)168 was used with the option meta to predict open reading frames (ORFs) and BLAST v2.3.0169 was used to annotate contigs sequence. To assign contig taxonomy, a first alignment iteration was run using full contig lengths against the  nr/nt database (January 2022) and Reference Viral Database (RVDB v v25.0). To further resolve nucleotide taxonomic annotation, a second alignment was run against all databases which included selected genomes (additional 1148 sequences) from  refseq informed by first iteration. BLASTn was run using the following parameters: -evalue 1e-50 -word_size 128 -perc_identity 97. Contig alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given contig. Descriptive statistics were also provided for contigs with a common species annotation that had an average alignment identity > 97%, total alignment length > 3000 nt and an average query coverage > 20%. To validate ESV sequences using the metagenomics de novo assembly, ESVs were aligned to WMS contigs using BLASTn. To annotate genes, three protein databases ( nr, UniProtKB Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL; January 2022) were searched using the translated sequences of the predicted proteins. BLASTx was run with the following parameters: -evalue 1e-10 -word_size 6 -threshold 21. Alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given orf. GO, pfam, PANTHER, EMBL, InterPro, HAMAP, TIGRFAMs, STRING, HOGENOM, SUPFAM terms were mined from UniProtKB database. Amino acid sequences were used as input in the GhostKOALA webserver170 to add functional genes and pathways information. KEGG functional and taxonomic annotation was retrieved using complete and incomplete pathways. Extibacter muris strain DSM28560 bile acid-inducible operon sequence (baiBCDEFGHI)62, were manually added to default KEGG database. One bai sequence did not have a KEGG term associated to it (baiG MFS transporter; bile acid transporter) and a temporary KEGG term was assigned to it (K9999). Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) Using metagenome co-assembly from 3.4.2, genome binning was performed using MetaBAT2171. Genome quality estimation of all bins was performed using CheckM (version v1.1.6)172. Taxonomic classification was performed with Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) a pipeline for the taxonomic classification of metagenome assembled genomes173. Murine transcriptome reference mapping Mouse liver and colon RNA-Seq reads were processed and assembled following NASA GeneLab consensus pipeline, as described previously174. Alpha and beta diversity To estimate and compare microbial richness within samples, alpha diversity was measured using diversity indices using Phyloseq R library175 and was compared between groups with t-tests (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U (non-parametric) tests. Unsupervised multivariate analysis (ordination) was performed using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with normalised counts (Supplementary Data 1) while constrained ordination was based on distance-based Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CCA). Significance of constraints were assessed using ANOVA-like permutation testing for CCA (anova.cca). Vegan R library176 was used to conduct these analyses, statistics, and to produce graphs and draw dispersion ellipses. As an exploratory visualisation of annotated WMS contigs, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to reduce the dimensionality of beta diversity WMS contig count matrices. CPM normalised counts of differentially abundant species (30 in each comparison) were selected as input and umap function from the umap R package (v 0.2.10) was used for each comparison with default parameters. Care should be taken when interpreting relative abundances as amplicon-based and WMS microbiome profiling lacks absolute quantification and is vulnerable to biases from PCR amplification and/or sequencing depth. Differential abundance/expression analysis Prior to differential abundance analysis, sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV/contig/transcript count in a single sample must be <90% of the count across all samples and ESV/contig occurrence must be at least ≥ 3 in samples within the same design factor. Differential abundance (or expression) analysis was performed using DESeq2159 based on pre-processed raw abundance of ESVs/contigs/ORFs/transcripts. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 was applied for statistical significance156. Missingness is a known challenge for negative binomial regression models (such as used in DESeq2) when analyzing zero-inflated abundance tables177,178, contigs with an absolute zero across all replicated samples belonging to a same factor were assumed to be structural zeros and flagged as significantly differentially abundant. To address conservative p-value distribution179 of RNA-Seq differential expression analysis, local FDR values were computed from DESeq2 p-values using fdrtool (v1.2.17)180 R library. Functional enrichment analysis Ghostkoala output was organised into a gene count table using WMS ORF raw count table and used as input for over-representation analysis (ORA) of WMS data. ORA was used to statistically test the overlap between DA ORFs (FDR <0.1) and a geneset using pathways of interest (Supplementary Data 4). p-values were calculated using a hypergeometric test using clusterProfiler (v4.7.1.003) R library181. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNASeq data was performed on the Webgestalt182 platform using the entire gene list, rank-ordered combining significance and effect size from DESeq2 differential expression analysis, i.e. log2(FC)*-log(pValue)183. Gene symbols were inferred from assembly transcripts using org.Mm.eg.db (v3.16)184 R annotation library.",
    "results": "Results Spaceflight increased total body weight Four treatment groups from a single cohort of 32 weeks-old female mice included two spaceflight groups flown to the ISS on SpaceX-13: FLT_LAR, returned to Earth after 29 days of spaceflight as part of the Live Animal Return mission, and FLT_ISS, sampled on the ISS by the crew after 56 days of spaceflight. Two control groups included GC_LAR and GC_ISS, reared in identical habitats at the Kennedy Space Centre and sampled after 29 and 56 days of the mission, respectively. Although reduced muscle mass and bone density in astronauts and mice during spaceflight are commonly observed40,41, in this study, total mouse body weight was trending to increase after 29 days of spaceflight in Live Animal Return mice (FLT_LAR; n = 9) and significantly increased after 56 days of spaceflight in ISS mice (FLT_ISS; n = 7, p <0.05). Carcass mass did not differ significantly (t-test, p > 0.05) between Ground Control Live Animal Return (GC_LAR; n = 7) and FLT_LAR mice, which weighed 28.9 g−1 (±1.6) and 30.1 g−1 (±1.4), respectively, but did significantly (t-test, p <0.05) increase from 28.4 g−1 (±1.4) in Ground Control ISS (GC_ISS; n = 9) mice to 32.9 g−1 (±1.0) in FLT_ISS mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). Suzuki et al.42 observed similar increases in the mouse habitat unit 3 mission and attributed these changes to substantial increases in both white and brown adipose tissue, and large increases in total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. While healthy adipose cells play an important role in maintaining insulin sensitivity, dysregulated adipose can lead to production of pro-inflammatory and insulin-antagonistic molecules43,44. Spaceflight alters murine gut microbiota Insulin resistance and lipid accumulation are common spaceflight phenotypes45 which are influenced by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and can be improved through butyrate dietary interventions in ground-based murine studies46,47. As butyrate and other SCFAs are predominantly produced by bacteria within the gut48, alterations in RR6 gut microbiome composition were explored. Characterisation of microbiota used 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well as WMS sequencing from faecal samples collected from GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (after 29 days of spaceflight) as well as GC_ISS and FLT_ISS mice (after 56 days of spaceflight). Sequencing of amplicon libraries generated 2,146,311 sequences after quality control, with an average of 77,015 ± 853 per sample (Fig. 2A–E; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). A total of 133 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were inferred across all samples; these ESVs accounted for 1,959,722 (91.32%) of reads. Thirty-five ESVs were annotated as putative bacterial species, 12 at genera level and 11 at family level, with an average of > 99.9% nucleotide identity, while 74 ESVs were dissimilar to any well-characterised taxa (<99% nucleotide identity; 14 of which were flagged as putative chimeras). Most counts (73.1%) were captured by ESVs annotated as putative species, 24 of these could be assigned to a single species and 11 to multiple species which share identical rRNA gene sequences at the V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Bacterial species putatively identified across all mice using amplicons belonged to the phyla Firmicutes (28), Proteobacteria (4), Actinobacteria (1), Deferribacteres (1) and Bacteroidetes (1). Parabacteroides goldsteinii had the highest relative abundance throughout the samples and accounted for 53.7% of sequence counts. Fig. 2.

Extended details in Supplementary data 1–3.WMS of faecal DNA generated 277,294,078 reads after quality control, with an average of 8,665,440 ± 1,423,541 per sample (Fig. 2F–I; Supplementary Fig. 4 and Data 2). Co-assembly across all 32 mice generated 219,259 contigs and back-mapping captured 85.1% of raw counts after filtering out reads using the mouse genome (154,692,460 counts). This included 22,318 contigs which could be provisionally annotated (>90% nucleotide identity) from 175 species and shared an average of 99.1% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with known species or strains (and capturing 84.5% of total counts) (Fig. 2G, H). After sparsity (>90% counts in a single sample) and minimum sample (<3) occurrence filtering to allow statistical detection of spaceflight associated differences across biological replicates, 45,890 contigs remained which captured 154,238,826 counts. These contigs were provisionally annotated as putative bacteria (50.6%), viruses (0.9%) and metazoa (3.0%), or were unknown (45.4%). Grouping WMS contigs by species annotation and filtering for high confidence (>97% ANI, and > 3000 nt total length) identified 97 putative species representing 81 bacterial species within Firmicutes, and 7 Proteobacteria, 4 Actinobacteria, 1 Bacteroidetes, and 1 Deferribacteres, as well as the helminths, Trichinella nativa and Trichinella pseudospiralis (Supplementary Data 3). These species groups ranged from 2–2734 contigs, with an average total alignment length of > 880,000 nt and an ANI of 98.8%. Prevalent taxa included P. goldstienii representing 73.1%, Enterocloster clostridioformis representing 1.47% and all other species representing below 1% of relative abundance across all mice, including non-bacterial species such as T. nativa, representing 0.03% of relative abundance and present in all mice. P. goldsteinii is a ubiquitous commensal gut microbiome inhabitant in mice, and the species includes strains that play a role in reducing intestinal inflammation and maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity49,50. Microbial alpha diversity indices did not significantly differ between mice groups using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing or WMS data (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates showed both FLT_ISS and GC_ISS as well as FLT_LAR and GC_LAR samples segregated by group, and the first axes explained 25.46% and 17.63% of variation using 16 S rRNA gene amplification and 19.41% and 11.49% of variation using WMS, respectively. ANOVA-like permutation tests confirmed significant variation between groups under constraint for both amplicon and WMS data (Fig. 2E, I; p <0.05; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3), suggesting spaceflight influenced gut microbiota in both comparisons regardless of the metagenomic approach taken. Significant spaceflight microbiome changes are associated with short-chain fatty acid metabolism, bile acid conversion and pathogenicity Differential abundance analysis of amplicon data identified 45 ESVs that were significantly different in relative abundance between spaceflight and ground control mice, including 34 ESVs between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR and 18 ESVs between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3A, B; av p-value = 0.004, av padj = 0.02, Supplementary Figs. 5, 6, Data 1). Although there were divergent changes in the relative abundance of H. xylanolytica, the common significant enrichment of E. muris and D. welbionis in mice after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight, compared to separate matched control groups, suggests spaceflight had some common influence of gut microbiota which persisted over the 29–56 days onboard the ISS as well as some distinct effects over time.

Amplicon sequencing: Species enriched in FLT_LAR mice compared to controls included Coprobacillus cateniformis, Dysosmobacter welbionis, Enterocloster aldenensis, Extibacter muris and Hungatella xylanolytica, while depleted species included Intestinimonas butyriciproducens and ESVs ambiguous to multiple Enterocloster species (including E.lavalensis) and Ligilactobacillus species (including L.murinus). Species enriched in FLT_ISS mice included D.welbionis, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Enterocloster clostridioformis, E.muris, Guopingia tenuis, Romboutsia ilealis and Romboutsia timonensis, while depleted species included H.xylanolytica. WMS: Microbiome species significantly enriched in after 29 days of spaceflight comprised 14 Firmicutes, including Blautia pseudococcoides, Clostridioides difficile, C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis, E.clostridioformis, E.muris, G.tenuis, Hungatella hathewayi, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Schaedlerella arabinosiphila and the proteobacteria Delftia lacustris. Significantly depleted species included 20 firmicutes, including Acutalibacter muris, Anaerostipes caccae, Blautia wexlerae, Clostridium scindens, Enterococcus faecalis, Ligilactobacillus murinus, Enterocloster bolteae, E.lavalensis, Flavonifractor plautii, I.butyriciproducens, Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus xylosus, and the Proteobacteria Providencia rettgeri. These findings agreed with significant differential abundance of C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis, E.clostridioformis, E.muris and I.butyriciproducens inferred from 16 S rRNA amplicon analysis and resolved species ambiguity for E.bolteae, E.lavalensis and L.murinus. Microbiome species which were significantly enriched in after 56 days of spaceflight comprised 14 Firmicutes, including B.pseudococcoides, C.difficile, D.welbionis, E.clostridioformis, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, E.muris, F.plautii, G.tenuis, H.hathewayi and R.lactatiformans. Significantly depleted species included 17 Firmicutes, including A.muris, Anaerostipes caccae, B.wexlerae, C.scindens, C.cateniformis, E.aldenensis, E.bolteae, E.lavalensis, L.lactis, S.arabinosiphila and as well as the Proteobacteria Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri and Delftia lacustris.Differential abundance analysis of WMS identified 13,996 contigs that were significantly different (DESeq2 FDR <0.1) in relative abundance between spaceflight and ground control mice, including 11,087 between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 3,997 between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3C–H). From these, 35 putative species (99.0% ANI; Supplementary Note, Data 3) identified as significantly differentially abundant between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (Fig. 3I) with an average total length of 390,616nt per species, while 34 species (99.0% ANI) significantly differed between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3J) with an average total length of 180,554 nt. D. welbionis was recently characterised by Roy et al.51,52 as a butyrate producer likely present in the gut of most humans and was negatively correlated with BMI in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. The same team used murine supplementation experiments to illustrate that D. welbionis could partially counteract insulin resistance, adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation as well as suggest a potential association with mitochondrial content and activity in adipose tissue after high fat diet induction of obesity52. In mice, changes in microbially produced butyrate are also know to directly influence expression of hepatic circadian clock regulating genes, such as Per2 and Bmal1, in a bidirectional interaction which can disrupt host metabolism53. Enrichment of D. welbionis in both groups of spaceflight mice (Fig. 3A, B, I, J) compared to their respective ground controls here is therefore noteworthy given the high lipid accumulation, liver and mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype repeatedly observed in rodent research missions and astronauts17,18,45. Whether the relative increase of this species might be counteracting or contributing towards spaceflight pathology is unclear and merits further study. Conversely, other butyrate producers, such as Intestinimonas butyriciproducens54, were depleted after 29 days of spaceflight. L. murinus and Acutalibacter muris were depleted in mice during spaceflight (Fig. 3A, I), as well as some Enterocloster species after 29 days of spaceflight, which can have high expression of bile salt hydrolases (BSHs), able to deconjugate bile salts into less toxic bile acids, and can promote microbially mediated 7α-dehydroxylation of host primary bile acids into secondary bile acids55–59. Conversion of the major human primary bile acids in humans, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), to the secondary BAs deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), is mediated by a limited number of closely related clostridia containing the bile acid inducible (bai) operon, such as Clostridium scindens60,61 which was significantly reduced in abundance after spaceflight (Fig. 3I, J). The major murine primary bile acids also include α- and β-muricholic acid (αMCA and βMCA), which are transformed by 7α-dehydroxylation to murideoxycholic acid (MDCA). E. muris, which significantly increased in both spaceflight groups of mice compared to ground controls (Fig. 3A, B, I, J), has been recently characterised as 7α-dehydroxylating in mice62, containing the bile acid inducible operons BaiBCDEFGI and BaiJKL, and BaiA, homologous to Clostridium scindens. The Bai operon enables E. muris and C. scindens to increase concentrations of 7α-dehydroxylated secondary BAs that alter the host bile acid pool and act as ligands to bile acid receptors to influence host inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism62–66. For example, bile sensor farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) modulates enterohepatic recirculation and host cholesterol metabolism through bile acid regulation of cyp7A166. Similarly, secondary bile acids such as DCA and LCA are potent agonists of the bile acid receptor TGR5, which controls glucose homoeostasis in adipose tissue and muscle by altering intestinal cell release of the insulin secretion regulator glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)67–69. Liver production of α-MCA and β-MCA (in mice) is mediated by cyp2c70 genes70,71 but 7α/β-dehydroxylation mediated by microbes such as E.muris can modify MCAs after epimerization into HDCA72, and critically regulate lipid metabolism73,74. Interestingly, E. clostridioformis, significantly higher in relative abundance after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 3), is reported as increasing in the presence of E. muris62 and harbours 7α/β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH)59,75, which can also transform primary and secondary BAs into oxo-bile acids64. This agrees with findings from the RR-5 mission39, which found significantly increased levels of serum choline in mice after spaceflight, suggesting a broad impact on lipid metabolism. Immune suppression has previously been described as a response to spacefight76 and could result as bile acid dysregulation77,78. So increased relative abundance of C. difficile after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight is of potential concern if toxigenic. Changes in spaceflight associated metagenome functional prediction Metagenomic functional prediction identified 4,583,759 genes in the co-assembly generated from all 32 mice, 392,631 of which were annotated by Kegg database (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, a high proportion (91.4%) of genes, including differentially abundant genes, remain unannotated. Kegg annotated genes included the pathogenicity locus (including tcdAB) from C. difficile, suggesting significant enrichment of the species after 29 and 56 days (Fig. 3I, J) could include a toxigenic strain. Bile acid metabolism genes were identified, including 17 bile salt hydrolases, including that from spaceflight enriched A. muris (Cbh), and 57 non-redundant Bai genes, including from C. scindens (BaiABCDEFGI) and I. butyriciproducens (BaiA and BaiCD), species which were significantly depleted after spaceflight as well as A. muris (BaiCD), Eisenbergiella massiliensis (BaiA) and Blautia pseudococcoides (BaiCD), species which were significantly enriched after spaceflight (Supplementary Data 2 and 3). E. aldenensis and S. arabinosiphila both contained the important BaiCD gene and were significantly enriched in mice after 29 days of spaceflight but significantly depleted after 56 days. Alongside significant enrichment of the rare 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris, these shifts suggest dynamic changes in secondary bile acid production and potential influence on the composition of the host bile acid pool56,79. Differential abundance analysis inferred 52,370 genes were significantly different (FDR <0.1) in abundance after 29 days and 37,068 genes after 56 days of spaceflight, which could be assigned to 2,811 and 2,572 unique KEGG ontology terms, respectively (Fig. 4A). Over-representation analysis identified significant (FDR <0.1) increases in pathways of interest related to fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, antimicrobial resistance and potential host interactions (ECM, carbohydrates and pathogenicity), after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight compared to ground controls (Fig. 4B, C; Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, these significant changes in metagenomic gene inventories, and specific bacterial species with well-characterised functions, due to spaceflight suggest gut microbiome changes which should influence lipid and bile acid homoeostasis, and the immune system of the murine host.

B GC_LAR vs FLT_LAR Over-representation analysis (ORA) of KEGG ontology (Brite, pathway and module) and (C) GC_ISS vs FLT_ISS ORA KEGG ontology. Changes in fatty acid pathways included Fatty acid biosynthesis (00061), Fatty acid metabolism (01212), Fatty acid degradation (00071) and Butanoate metabolism (00650), including butyryl CoA:acetate CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.8) and butyrate kinase (EC:2.7.2.7). Over-representation of bile acid metabolism was reflected in Bile secretion (04976) and Cholesterol metabolism (04979) and Secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways, including bile salt hydrolase (cbh, EC:3.5.1.24) and 3-oxocholoyl-CoA 4-desaturase (baiCD, EC:1.3.1.115). Over-representation of the antimicrobial resistance was represented in Brite ontology Antimicrobial resistance genes (ko01504) and the pathways for beta-Lactam resistance (01501), Biosynthesis of various antibiotics (00998) and Biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics (01055). The Brite ontology Bacterial toxins (ko02042) was over-represented, including tight junction interacting zona occludens toxin (K10954), as well as the pathways Pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (05130) and Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells (05100). Diverse carbohydrate metabolism and ECM interacting pathways were represented by Galactose metabolism (00052), Mannose type O-glycan biosynthesis (00515), Glycosaminoglycan degradation (00531), Other glycan degradation (00511), ECM-receptor interaction (04512) as well as the Brite ontology of Glycosaminoglycan binding proteins (ko00536), Peptidoglycan biosynthesis and degradation proteins (ko01011) and Glycosyltransferases (ko01003). These included putative Mucin-associated glycosyl hydrolases (GHs)185, GH2s: β-galactosidase (EC:3.2.1.23), β-mannosidase (EC:3.2.1.25), β-glucuronidase (EC:3.2.1.31), α-l-arabinofuranosidase (EC:3.2.1.55), β-xylosidase (EC:3.2.1.37), β-glucosidase (EC:3.2.1.21), GH20: β-hexosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52), GH29: α-l-fucosidase (EC:3.2.1.51), and GH84: N-acetyl β-glucosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52). Spaceflight alters host intestinal gene expression Faecal or serum fatty acid or bile acid concentrations were not measured within the Rodent Research 6 mission; however, host colon and liver gene expression were assessed from all four groups of mice, allowing host responses to spaceflight at the host-gut microbiome interface to be investigated. Host intestinal gene expression revealed extensive significant (FDR <0.1) changes after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight when compared to ground controls, including 4613 differentially expressed (DE) genes between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 4,476 DE genes between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 5A–H; Supplementary Figs. 7, 8 and Data 5). Of these, 43% and 44% were increased due to flight in LAR and ISS mice, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway level after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 5I, J), including immune suppression, dysregulation off cholesterol and bile acid, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling.

Full DE gene list is available in Supplementary data 5 and select KEGG pathways of interest with differentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 9–14. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway level between 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. This included widespread downregulation of the components of the intestinal immune system after spaceflight, including intestinal immune network for IgA production, antigen processing and presentation, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, PARR signalling metabolism of xenobiotics, Staphylococcus aureus infection, T cell receptor signalling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, graft-vs-host disease and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions pathways, as well as downregulation of cholesterol pathways, including cholesterol metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Spaceflight also led to common upregulation of pathways associated to intestinal extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, including ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, tight junction, gap junction pathways, and cortisol production represented through the Cushing syndrome pathway. The bile secretion pathway was significantly upregulated after 29 days of spaceflight, but downregulated after 56 days, suggesting bile acid dynamics should be explored at the gene level. Similarly, mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, pathways in cancer and insulin resistance were only upregulated at the pathway level after 29 days of spaceflight, while bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, NAFLD, butonoate metabolism, insulin secretion and insulin signalling pathways were upregulated and the circadian rhythm pathway was downregulated after only 56 days of spaceflight. Intestinal bile acid and circadian rhythm gene expression Significant microbiome alteration in some of the few well-characterised 7α-dehydroxylating bacterial species, including increases in E. muris after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight (below detection in ground controls) as well as depletion of C. scindens, suggests secondary bile acid production and the bile acid pool is likely altered in the murine gut during spaceflight. In the host intestine, bile acids are passively absorbed or actively taken up through the apical membrane by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, ASBT (Slc10A2), bound to the cytosolic ileal bile acid binding protein, IBABP (Fabp6), and then transported across the basolateral membrane by organic solute transporters, Ostα and Ostβ (Slc51A and Slc51B), or glucuronidated by UGTs (such as Ugt1a1) and exported back to the lumen by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, MRP2 (Abcc2 transporter)80,81. Increases in intestinal bile acid also activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) heterodimer which regulates production and secretion of fibroblast growth factor FGF15/19, the negative feedback hormone which travels through portal circulation to bind hepatic FGFR4 receptors which suppress liver bile acid biosynthesis via inhibition of Cyp7A182. After 29 days of spaceflight, Abcc2 was significantly downregulated, suggesting reduced BA export to the colon, while Asbt, Ibabp, Ostα, Ostβ and Ugt1a1 were all significantly upregulated as well as Rxrα (not Fxr), Fgf15/19 and Fgfr4 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). Taken together, these changes suggest spaceflight led to an alteration in bile acid metabolism in the intestine which would lead to bile acid suppression of hepatic Cyp7A1 and accumulation of cholesterol or hypercholesterolaemia83. Interestingly, intestinal Cyp7A1 expression was identified as significantly repressed after 29 days of spaceflight. Previous proteomic research in Biom-1M mice suggested a decrease in bile secretion during spaceflight84 while hepatic metabolite assessment of mice after spaceflight in the Space Shuttle Atlantis measured increased accumulation of cholate and taurodeoxycholate16. As the major cholesterol degradation mechanism in humans and mice is conversion to bile acids, cholesterol accumulation, alongside bile acid dysregulation and suppression of Cyp71A, should increase direct intestinal cholesterol excretion85. Supporting this extrapolation, both cholesterol excretion transporter genes, Abcg5 and Abcg8, were significantly upregulated in the intestine after 29 days of spaceflight. After 56 days, intestinal Cyp7A1 was still significantly repressed and both Abcg5 and Abcg8 upregulated, but GSEA indicated a further shift in intestinal bile acid metabolism (Fig. 5I, J; Supplementary Figs. 9–14). This was underlined by significant downregulation of the apical bile acid transporter Asbt compared to ground controls as well as Ntcp (Slc10a1)86, indicating a switch to active reduction in bile acid uptake. Coinciding with this was significant increases in expression of Lxrβ, the liver x receptor gene expressed widely in different tissues, which can help prevent bile acid toxicity through induction of Abcg5 and Abcg8 mediated cholesterol excretion87–90. In gene expression analysis of multiple tissues in mice after spaceflight, da Silveira et al.18 found that enrichment within the circadian rhythm pathway of the kidney, liver, eye, adrenal gland and various muscle tissues. Within the intestine here, the major clock genes, the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) and brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (Bmal1; Arntl) transcription factors, were significantly upregulated after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight, and the neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 (Npas2) was upregulated after 56 days (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). These regulate the major clock-controlled genes reverse-erythroblastosis (Rev-Erbα and β) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors, including gamma (Rorc)91, as well as Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3), Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) protein (Dec1 and Dec2) genes92,93, all of which were significantly downregulated after 56 days of spaceflight except for Rev-Erbα (Nr1d1) (only downregulated after 29 days). These genes can feedback to inhibit Clock/Npas2 and Bmal1 as part of a feedback loop94,95, and also regulate other the clock controlled genes such as DBP, HLF and TEF, significantly downregulated, and Nfil3 (E4BP4), significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight. These spaceflight-associated changes in core clock genes, such as upregulation of Bmal1, Arntl and Npas2, largely agree with those found in murine muscle tissue after longer-term spaceflight which were characterised as similar to age-related gene expression on earth96. These clock genes regulate nutrient absorption, gut motility, intestinal barrier function and immunity92 and have also been shown to require and interact with the microbiome, including in response to microbially-derived molecules, such as butyrate and bile acids, and in direct response to microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)53,92,97–99. In addition to the widespread intestinal gene expression responses to bile acids, the major butyrate receptor free fatty acid receptor 2 (Ffar2; Gpr43)100 was significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight. Similarly, the archetypal intestinal MAMP recognising mannose-binding lectin genes, Mbl-1 and Mbl-2101, were significantly downregulated. Furthermore, Wang et al.102 reported host immune responses to microbial flagellin and lipopolysaccharide in the intestine increased expression of Il-23, and Il-22, leading to a downregulation of Rev-Erb and subsequent upregulation of Nfil3, which in turn can regulate clock-associated nutrient absorption and immunity. Here, mice followed this specific expression pattern after spaceflight (Supplementary Data 5), implying the spaceflight associated microbiome alterations could have been recognised and influenced these changes in clock gene expression. Intestinal extracellular matrix remodelling and immune compromise during spaceflight Changes in the extracellular matrix-receptor interactions pathway were underpinned by significant upregulation of collagens (Col1a1-2, Col3a1, Col4a1-2, Col5a1-2, Col5a3, Col6a2-3, Col12a1, Col26a1), laminins (Lama3), thrombospondin (Thbs1) and tenascins (Tnc) in mice after 29 days of spaceflight, which became more pronounced after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Data 5). This coincided with upregulation of integrin (Itga5 and Itga7) and matrix glycoprotein (Sdc4 and Gp5) receptors, collectively implying extensive extracellular matrix remodelling during spaceflight. The ECM and mucosal collagen scaffold in particular are known to be shaped by microbiota103, as are mucins, which make up the intestinal mucus layer and have a dynamic relationship with commensal bacteria as well as serving as a critical barrier against colonisation by pathogenic bacteria104. Significant increase in the secretory mucin gene Muc2 and significant decreases in the membrane bound Muc3 and mucosal pentraxin 1 (Mptx1), three of the mostly highly abundant transcripts in the murine intestine here, were observed after 56 days of spaceflight, suggesting alterations to mucin within the intestinal lumen in direct contact with microbiota. Mucin 2 (Muc2) is well characterised as regulated by intestinal bacteria, with O-glycans serving as nutrients and adhesion sites for microbiota105, but are also differentially expressed in response to pathogens104, including Trichinella106, identified here. Extensive changes to mucosa were indicated by widespread downregulation of cell adhesion molecules during spaceflight, including downregulation of CD8a and CD8b1 genes, genes encoding costimulatory molecules CD2,6,80,86,40 and ICOSL within intestinal antigen presenting cells as well as their T cell activating binding partners CD48,166,28 and ICOS107–109 (Fig. 5G; Supplementary Data 5). Cytokine genes, such as the chemokine Ccl22 and receptor Ccr4 involved in the intestinal immune response to enteric bacterial pathogens in murine mucosa110, were also uniformly downregulated (Fig. 5F), alongside others111–113: Ccl3,5,6 and 22, Ccr4,7 and 9, Cxcr2,3 and 6, Il-5,7,12 and 16, and Il-2r,5r,7r,10r,12r,18r,21r,23r and 27r. An exception to this pattern of cytokine downregulation was upregulation IL-23 and IL-22, which interact with circadian regulation95, and specific members of the mucosal homoeostasis critical interleukin 17 family114, Il-17d, which promotes pathogenicity during infection through suppression of CD8 + T cells115, and Il-17rc, which increases expression during compromised epithelial barrier integrity (wounding)116. These expression profiles, alongside consistent downregulation of genes within the Intestinal IgA pathway (Fig. 5H), suggest suppression of immunity and widespread tissue remodelling at the host-gut microbiome interface in mice after spaceflight. This agrees with reports of reduced cytokine production in mice after simulated microgravity117, immune dysfunction in splenic tissue of mice after 13 days of spaceflight on the Space Shuttle Atlantis118 and in astronauts, alongside increases in plasma cortisol concentration which reached Cushing syndrome levels, during spaceflight119. Taken together, this provides an insight into the role the host-gut-microbiome interface might play in the current broad consensus of immune dysregulation in spaceflight environments120. Spaceflight alters gene expression in the liver Hepatic gene differential expression analysis comparing mice after 29 days and 56 days in space to their relative ground controls identified 4029 DE genes and 4068 DE genes, respectively (FDR <0.1; Fig. 6A, H; Supplementary Figs. 15, 16 and Data 5). Of these, 48% and 49% were increased due to 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight, respectively. GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6I, J), including disruption of bile acid and energy metabolism.

C–H Differentially expressed gene from select KEGG pathways of interest, (I) Significant Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 29 days (modified from WebGestalt182), and (J) Significant GSEA 56 days spaceflight. Full DE gene list is available in Supplementary data 5 and select KEGG pathways of interest with differentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 17–21. GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceflight. These comprised downregulation of immune response pathways, similar to those seen in the intestine, as well as steroid metabolism, type I diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease and NAFLD. Spaceflight also led to common upregulation of insulin resistance, Hippo signalling, inositol phosphate metabolism, Cushing syndrome and hepatocellular cancer pathways at both 29 and 56 days. Certain pathways were different over time. After 29 days of spaceflight, long-term depression and maturity onset diabetes of the young pathways were upregulated, whereas after 56 days, bile secretion and circadian rhythm were downregulated, while glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were upregulated. Bile acid disruption underlies hepatic cholesterol accumulation The most abundant intestinal transcripts in mice after 56 days of spaceflight, differentially expressed and representing 8% and 9% of normalised counts, were from the non-coding RNA Rn7s1 and Rn7s2 genes (7 S RNA 1 and 2; Supplementary Data 5), respectively, which were recently characterised as inhibitors of global mitochondrial transcription in mammals121. This is consistent with the mitochondrial dysfunction highlighted as characteristic of spaceflight pathogenicity in recent multiomic analysis performed by de Silveira et al.18, who also characterised compromised liver function in mice and astronauts after spaceflight compared ground controls, including upregulation of Fgf21, a negative repressor of bile synthesis122, and accumulation of total cholesterol (higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Here, another potent repressor of Cyp7A1 bile synthesis, fibroblast growth factor 1 (fgf1)123, was upregulated in the liver of mice after 29 days of spaceflight, and the more well known Fgf2116 was significantly upregulated in the liver after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. Within the liver, Sterol 14-demethylase (Cyp51) catalyses the transformation of lanosterol into cholesterol and Cyp7A1 is then the first (and rate-limiting) enzymatic step in transformation of cholesterol in primary bile acid biosynthesis, which itself is strictly inhibited by bile acid concentrations124. The production of bile salts is then a stepwise transformation process dependent on gene expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (Hsd3b7) gene, cholic acid-specific Cyp8b1 gene and acyl-Coenzyme A oxidase 2 (Acox2) before conjugation by Baat, Acnat1 and Acnat2, and subsequent excretion in the bile duct by bile salt exporter pump (BSEP)125,126. Cyp51, Cyp8b1 and Acox2 genes were significantly upregulated and Cyp7a1 and Fxr (Nr1h4) were significantly downregulated in the liver of mice after 56 days on the ISS (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The cholesterol transporter genes Abcg5 and Abcg8 (intestinally upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight) were upregulated in the liver after 29 days, but no longer significantly upregulated after 56 days, and Abcg8 was significantly downregulated. This reduction is surprising given the uniform accumulation of cholesterol observed after extended spaceflight; in contrast, Bsep and the bile acid conjugating acyl-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (Acnat1 and Acnat2; Baatp1/2) genes were significantly upregulated. Taken together, these expression profiles suggest hepatic accumulation of cholesterol, characteristic of glucose and lipid metabolic dysruption97, and describe a subsequent increase in the production bile acids in the liver, preferentially cholic acid, their subsequent conjugation and export as bile salts, with the seemingly contradictory reduction in Cyp7A1 consistent with feedback inhibition. The other major mechanism for detoxification during cholesterol and bile acid accumulation in the liver is sulfonation of bile acids, the transfer of a sulfonate group to a hydroxyl (OH) by a subfamily of cytosolic sulfotransferases (Sult2a genes) which increases their solubility, decreases enterohepatic recirculation, and increase excretion127. After 29 days of spaceflight, hepatic Sult2a1, Sult2a4 and Sult2a5 were downregulated, which shifted to downregulation of Sult2a7 and Sult2a8 after 56 days (Supplementary Data 5). In humans, bile acid sulfonation is catalysed by Sult2a1, which sulfonates the 3-OH of bile acids. In contrast, mice have 8 Sult2a genes, with Sult2a1-6 sharing close homology to Sult2a1 but Sult2a8 being recently characterised as having major function in sulfonating 7α-OH of bile acids128,129, of particular relevance here due to spaceflight microbiome changes in 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris and C. scindens. Notably, during acute phase immune responses, alterations to fatty acid, cholesterol, and bile acid metabolism, Sult2a1 is known to be suppressed by cholesterol and bile acid regulating nuclear Fxr (Nr1h4) and Car (Nr1i3) nuclear receptors130, the latter of which also regulates bile acid responsive transporter gene Mdr1 (ABCB1)131, all three of which were downregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6C) and provide further evidence of bile acid dysregulation and toxic stress consistent with extensive disruption of the gut-liver axis132. Hepatic energy homoeostasis disruption after spaceflight Beheshti et al.17 observed significant depletion in Cyp7A1 protein levels in mice after spaceflight (RR1 and RR3), alongside disruption in glucose and lipid metabolism133 as well as NAFLD134. Here, pathways related to energy homoeostasis consistently altered in gene expression due to spaceflight after 29 and 56 days included enrichment of fatty acid degradation, insulin signalling and insulin resistance (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The highest relative abundance (CPM) of transcripts significantly increased in the liver of mice after 56 days of spaceflight included fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the liver fat accumulation-associated carbonic anhydrase 3 (Car3)135, and the rate limiting enzyme for fatty acid desaturation, Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), recently identified as a key role at the crossroads of immune response and lipid metabolism through interplay with PPARγ136, also significantly upregulated here (Fig. 6F). Glucose metabolism was also disrupted by spaceflight as the glucose transporter Glut2 (Slc2a2) gene, required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion137, and glycogen synthase 2 (Gys2) gene, the rate limiting enzyme for glycogenesis138, were downregulated in the liver (and intestine) after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. The free fatty acid and glycolysis regulating PPARα was also downregulated, and liver glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3β) were significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6G). Taken together, the indicated decrease in glycogen synthesis and increase in glycogenolysis is characteristic of insulin resistance leading to the elevated fasting plasma glucose to pre-diabetic levels previously observed in crew of the Mars500 analogue mission and during spaceflight139–141. Interestingly, in light of spaceflight induced changes to gut microbiota, upregulation of Gsk3β is also known to be activated by microbial-associated molecular patterns142 and promotes acute liver failure through inhibition of the PPARα pathway143. Other pathways enriched in the liver after spaceflight included Cushing Syndrome, hypercortisolism consistent with elevation of cholesterol levels, and hepatocellular cancer pathways. Notably, claudins, which were largely downregulated in the intestine where they are commonly expressed within tight junctions, were upregulated in liver tissue after 56 days of spaceflight (Supplementary Data 5), including highly significant and high relative abundance increases in CLDN1 and CLDN2. So-called non-tight junction claudins have only recently been experimentally explored and, in hepatic cells, CLDN1 is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)144. More broadly, significant upregulation of Tgf-α and genes involved in complex Tgf-β signalling (Tgfb2, Tgfb3, Tab2, Tgfbrap, Smad3), alongside other markers (Dapk2, Vegfa, Dvl3)145,146 are associated to HCC, as well as immune suppression through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (p21cip1; Cdkn1a)147, also significantly upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight. Previous gene expression analysis of mice exposed to high-energy ion particle radiation to simulate exposure to Galactic Cosmic Rays reported induction of spontaneous HCC146. These prominent transcriptomic shifts after 56 days of spaceflight, if reflected in longer term studies in humans, could represent a serious health concern.",
    "discussion": "Discussion A challenge for biological experimentation conducted in space is low replication, compared to model studies using mice on Earth. An important associated shortfall of this research is the lack of assessment of inter-cage variation. The commonalities between LAR and ISS mice groups and use of distinct metagenomic methodologies, 16 S rRNA gene barcoding and co-assembled WMS, helped provide some biological and technical confidence in the spaceflight-associated changes in microbiome species detected here; however, it is likely that low n reduced statistical power and that important microbiome associations were missed, particularly those of low abundance bacteria. It is important that the imminent commercial low Earth orbit destinations (CLDs), Gateway, and Lunar Base Camp increase the capacity of their experimental habitats and growth facilities to support replicate numbers for multiomic science, in order to maximise discoveries and enable future interventional microbiome studies. This research also lacked truly independent cohorts of mice, as Liver Animal Return (29 days spaceflight) and ISS (56 days spaceflight), and their respective ground controls, derived from the same initial cohort of mice. Future studies should ensure common data gathering approaches to enable high resolution multiomic data to be directly compared across missions and different cohorts of mice. Integration of metagenomic and host transcriptomic data here provided a highly complementary picture of the multiomic response to spaceflight, and is a strength of an Open Science culture and public multiomic resources such as GeneLab. The addition of untargeted serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened this research and future studies should aim to quantitatively profile the specific deconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the system. Alongside metatranscriptomic analysis of the gut microbiome, this would represent an important next step likely to help clarify the directionality of the host-gut microbiome responses associated to spaceflight pathology.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions Through metagenomic assessment of the murine gut microbiome, significant spaceflight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identified. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceflight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when using distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation. Collectively, these multiomic findings suggest host-gut microbiome interactions during spaceflight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health.",

Copyright notice ID: 11362537 PMID: 39209868 Abstract The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility. Subject terms: Microbial communities, Microbial genetics, Metagenomics, MicrobiotaIntroduction The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27 of Earth’s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to Mars in the Global Exploration Roadmap1,2, and sustainable long-term lunar exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable this ambitious goal. These guiding objectives have driven development of the imminent commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) destinations and Gateway, and the Artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early 2030 s3. Major challenges associated to longer duration spaceflight and habitation off-Earth are identified in the NASA Moon to Mars Objectives4, including the goal to advance understanding of how biology responds to the Moon, Mars, and deep space to support safe human space missions. Consistently observed spaceflight-associated pathologies, notably disrupted glucose metabolism characterised by insulin resistance and lipid metabolism dysregulation, pose significant risks to astronaut health5,6. Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulated microgravity model system developed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre characterised increases in pancreatic production of α-TNF, which increased insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes7. In mice, a reduction of insulin sensitivity has been observed after microgravity simulation using hindlimb unloading8. This is reflected in the muscle transcriptome after spaceflight, where insulin receptor signalling is suggestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis9. Similarly, simulated microgravity on human oligodendrocyte10 and mesenchymal stem11 cell cultures increases production of fatty acids and complex lipids. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the intestinal lipid metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 respond to simulated microgravity, with RNAi knockdown of sbp-1 and mdt-15 reducing lipid toxicity12. Spaceflight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605, 690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87))13–15 characterised rats as hyperlipidemic, with spaceflight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and substantial increases in cholesterol (67%). Similar lipid dysregulation, suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently observed mammalian response to spaceflight alongside aligned disruption of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis16–20. These observations in mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic proteins which drive lipid metabolism, significant increases in steatosis, cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids. The immune system can be compromised by spaceflight, both in space and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before flight, infection with influenza and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been observed in astronauts21. Up to 50% of astronauts also exhibit immunodeficiency upon returning to Earth22, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This dysregulation manifests through decreased T cell and B cell abundance23, and impaired natural killer cell and macrophage function24,25. The underlying cause of these changes are thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with spaceflight26, as well as shifts in the gut microbiome27. On Earth, comparable changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, immune and psychophysiological function have been associated to gut microbiota28–32. Similarly, unique built environment surface microbiology arises from long-duration confinement, reshaping the bidirectional exchanges between usually diverse environmental microbial ecosystems and the gut microbiome to promote opportunistic pathogenicity33–37. Given the potential involvement of gut microbiota in spaceflight pathology, and their essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on Earth, there has been increasing research into gut microbiome dynamics associated with spaceflight. Using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) amplicon sequencing, Jiang et al.38 identified significant changes in the relative abundance of 16 OTUs in the gut microbiome of mice in Rodent Research (RR) 1 (RR-1) mission, some of which were annotated as within the genera Staphylococcus and Tyzzerella, and were lower in mice after spaceflight compared to ground controls. More recently, Bedree et al.39 explored the gut microbiome of BALB/c mice flown in the RR-5 mission using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identified 14 ASVs as different in relative abundance (p <0.1) between spaceflight (ISS) and ground controls after 9 weeks of spaceflight, including increases in the genera Clostridium, Romboutsia, Ruminiclostridium, and Shuttleworthia, and decreases in Hungatella, while WMS identified significant enrichment of Dorea sp. and the species Lactobacillus murinus. In this study, species-resolved 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and de novo co-assembled WMS were employed to capture metagenomic changes in the murine gut microbiome associated with spaceflight across multiple samples as part of the RR-6 mission (Fig. 1). Intestinal and hepatic transcriptomics were then used to assess the associated gene expression response of mice to spaceflight. Fig. 1. Experimental design. Open in a new tab A Analysis design of data from the Rodent Research 6 mission and B multiomic data analysis strategy. Figure created with BioRender.com.Results Spaceflight increased total body weight Four treatment groups from a single cohort of 32 weeks-old female mice included two spaceflight groups flown to the ISS on SpaceX-13: FLT_LAR, returned to Earth after 29 days of spaceflight as part of the Live Animal Return mission, and FLT_ISS, sampled on the ISS by the crew after 56 days of spaceflight. Two control groups included GC_LAR and GC_ISS, reared in identical habitats at the Kennedy Space Centre and sampled after 29 and 56 days of the mission, respectively. Although reduced muscle mass and bone density in astronauts and mice during spaceflight are commonly observed40,41, in this study, total mouse body weight was trending to increase after 29 days of spaceflight in Live Animal Return mice (FLT_LAR; n = 9) and significantly increased after 56 days of spaceflight in ISS mice (FLT_ISS; n = 7, p <0.05). Carcass mass did not differ significantly (t-test, p > 0.05) between Ground Control Live Animal Return (GC_LAR; n = 7) and FLT_LAR mice, which weighed 28.9 g−1 (±1.6) and 30.1 g−1 (±1.4), respectively, but did significantly (t-test, p <0.05) increase from 28.4 g−1 (±1.4) in Ground Control ISS (GC_ISS; n = 9) mice to 32.9 g−1 (±1.0) in FLT_ISS mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). Suzuki et al.42 observed similar increases in the mouse habitat unit 3 mission and attributed these changes to substantial increases in both white and brown adipose tissue, and large increases in total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. While healthy adipose cells play an important role in maintaining insulin sensitivity, dysregulated adipose can lead to production of pro-inflammatory and insulin-antagonistic molecules43,44.Spaceflight alters murine gut microbiota Insulin resistance and lipid accumulation are common spaceflight phenotypes45 which are influenced by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and can be improved through butyrate dietary interventions in ground-based murine studies46,47. As butyrate and other SCFAs are predominantly produced by bacteria within the gut48, alterations in RR6 gut microbiome composition were explored. Characterisation of microbiota used 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well as WMS sequencing from faecal samples collected from GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (after 29 days of spaceflight) as well as GC_ISS and FLT_ISS mice (after 56 days of spaceflight). Sequencing of amplicon libraries generated 2,146,311 sequences after quality control, with an average of 77,015 ± 853 per sample (Fig. 2A–E; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). A total of 133 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were inferred across all samples; these ESVs accounted for 1,959,722 (91.32%) of reads. Thirty-five ESVs were annotated as putative bacterial species, 12 at genera level and 11 at family level, with an average of > 99.9% nucleotide identity, while 74 ESVs were dissimilar to any well-characterised taxa (<99% nucleotide identity; 14 of which were flagged as putative chimeras). Most counts (73.1%) were captured by ESVs annotated as putative species, 24 of these could be assigned to a single species and 11 to multiple species which share identical rRNA gene sequences at the V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Bacterial species putatively identified across all mice using amplicons belonged to the phyla Firmicutes (28), Proteobacteria (4), Actinobacteria (1), Deferribacteres (1) and Bacteroidetes (1). Parabacteroides goldsteinii had the highest relative abundance throughout the samples and accounted for 53.7% of sequence counts. Fig. 2.

Co-assembly across all 32 mice generated 219,259 contigs and back-mapping captured 85.1% of raw counts after filtering out reads using the mouse genome (154,692,460 counts). This included 22,318 contigs which could be provisionally annotated (>90% nucleotide identity) from 175 species and shared an average of 99.1% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with known species or strains (and capturing 84.5% of total counts) (Fig. 2G, H). After sparsity (>90% counts in a single sample) and minimum sample (<3) occurrence filtering to allow statistical detection of spaceflight associated differences across biological replicates, 45,890 contigs remained which captured 154,238,826 counts. These contigs were provisionally annotated as putative bacteria (50.6%), viruses (0.9%) and metazoa (3.0%), or were unknown (45.4%). Grouping WMS contigs by species annotation and filtering for high confidence (>97% ANI, and > 3000 nt total length) identified 97 putative species representing 81 bacterial species within Firmicutes, and 7 Proteobacteria, 4 Actinobacteria, 1 Bacteroidetes, and 1 Deferribacteres, as well as the helminths, Trichinella nativa and Trichinella pseudospiralis (Supplementary Data 3). These species groups ranged from 2–2734 contigs, with an average total alignment length of > 880,000 nt and an ANI of 98.8%. Prevalent taxa included P. goldstienii representing 73.1%, Enterocloster clostridioformis representing 1.47% and all other species representing below 1% of relative abundance across all mice, including non-bacterial species such as T. nativa, representing 0.03% of relative abundance and present in all mice. P. goldsteinii is a ubiquitous commensal gut microbiome inhabitant in mice, and the species includes strains that play a role in reducing intestinal inflammation and maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity49,50. Microbial alpha diversity indices did not significantly differ between mice groups using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing or WMS data (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 and Data 1). Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates showed both FLT_ISS and GC_ISS as well as FLT_LAR and GC_LAR samples segregated by group, and the first axes explained 25.46% and 17.63% of variation using 16 S rRNA gene amplification and 19.41% and 11.49% of variation using WMS, respectively. ANOVA-like permutation tests confirmed significant variation between groups under constraint for both amplicon and WMS data (Fig. 2E, I; p <0.05; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3), suggesting spaceflight influenced gut microbiota in both comparisons regardless of the metagenomic approach taken.Significant spaceflight microbiome changes are associated with short-chain fatty acid metabolism, bile acid conversion and pathogenicity Differential abundance analysis of amplicon data identified 45 ESVs that were significantly different in relative abundance between spaceflight and ground control mice, including 34 ESVs between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR and 18 ESVs between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3A, B; av p-value = 0.004, av padj = 0.02, Supplementary Figs. 5, 6, Data 1). Although there were divergent changes in the relative abundance of H. xylanolytica, the common significant enrichment of E. muris and D. welbionis in mice after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight, compared to separate matched control groups, suggests spaceflight had some common influence of gut microbiota which persisted over the 29–56 days onboard the ISS as well as some distinct effects over time.

Extended details in Supplementary Data 1–3. Amplicon sequencing: Species enriched in FLT_LAR mice compared to controls included Coprobacillus cateniformis, Dysosmobacter welbionis, Enterocloster aldenensis, Extibacter muris and Hungatella xylanolytica, while depleted species included Intestinimonas butyriciproducens and ESVs ambiguous to multiple Enterocloster species (including E.lavalensis) and Ligilactobacillus species (including L.murinus). Species enriched in FLT_ISS mice included D.welbionis, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Enterocloster clostridioformis, E.muris, Guopingia tenuis, Romboutsia ilealis and Romboutsia timonensis, while depleted species included H.xylanolytica. WMS: Microbiome species significantly enriched in after 29 days of spaceflight comprised 14 Firmicutes, including Blautia pseudococcoides, Clostridioides difficile, C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis, E.clostridioformis, E.muris, G.tenuis, Hungatella hathewayi, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Schaedlerella arabinosiphila and the proteobacteria Delftia lacustris. Significantly depleted species included 20 firmicutes, including Acutalibacter muris, Anaerostipes caccae, Blautia wexlerae, Clostridium scindens, Enterococcus faecalis, Ligilactobacillus murinus, Enterocloster bolteae, E.lavalensis, Flavonifractor plautii, I.butyriciproducens, Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus xylosus, and the Proteobacteria Providencia rettgeri. These findings agreed with significant differential abundance of C.cateniformis, D.welbionis, E.aldenensis, E.clostridioformis, E.muris and I.butyriciproducens inferred from 16 S rRNA amplicon analysis and resolved species ambiguity for E.bolteae, E.lavalensis and L.murinus. Microbiome species which were significantly enriched in after 56 days of spaceflight comprised 14 Firmicutes, including B.pseudococcoides, C.difficile, D.welbionis, E.clostridioformis, Eisenbergiella massiliensis, E.muris, F.plautii, G.tenuis, H.hathewayi and R.lactatiformans. Significantly depleted species included 17 Firmicutes, including A.muris, Anaerostipes caccae, B.wexlerae, C.scindens, C.cateniformis, E.aldenensis, E.bolteae, E.lavalensis, L.lactis, S.arabinosiphila and as well as the Proteobacteria Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri and Delftia lacustris.Differential abundance analysis of WMS identified 13,996 contigs that were significantly different (DESeq2 FDR <0.1) in relative abundance between spaceflight and ground control mice, including 11,087 between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 3,997 between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3C–H). From these, 35 putative species (99.0% ANI; Supplementary Note, Data 3) identified as significantly differentially abundant between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (Fig. 3I) with an average total length of 390,616nt per species, while 34 species (99.0% ANI) significantly differed between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 3J) with an average total length of 180,554 nt. D. welbionis was recently characterised by Roy et al.51,52 as a butyrate producer likely present in the gut of most humans and was negatively correlated with BMI in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. The same team used murine supplementation experiments to illustrate that D. welbionis could partially counteract insulin resistance, adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation as well as suggest a potential association with mitochondrial content and activity in adipose tissue after high fat diet induction of obesity52. In mice, changes in microbially produced butyrate are also know to directly influence expression of hepatic circadian clock regulating genes, such as Per2 and Bmal1, in a bidirectional interaction which can disrupt host metabolism53. Enrichment of D. welbionis in both groups of spaceflight mice (Fig. 3A, B, I, J) compared to their respective ground controls here is therefore noteworthy given the high lipid accumulation, liver and mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype repeatedly observed in rodent research missions and astronauts17,18,45. Whether the relative increase of this species might be counteracting or contributing towards spaceflight pathology is unclear and merits further study. Conversely, other butyrate producers, such as Intestinimonas butyriciproducens54, were depleted after 29 days of spaceflight. L. murinus and Acutalibacter muris were depleted in mice during spaceflight (Fig. 3A, I), as well as some Enterocloster species after 29 days of spaceflight, which can have high expression of bile salt hydrolases (BSHs), able to deconjugate bile salts into less toxic bile acids, and can promote microbially mediated 7α-dehydroxylation of host primary bile acids into secondary bile acids55–59. Conversion of the major human primary bile acids in humans, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), to the secondary BAs deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), is mediated by a limited number of closely related clostridia containing the bile acid inducible (bai) operon, such as Clostridium scindens60,61 which was significantly reduced in abundance after spaceflight (Fig. 3I, J). The major murine primary bile acids also include α- and β-muricholic acid (αMCA and βMCA), which are transformed by 7α-dehydroxylation to murideoxycholic acid (MDCA). E. muris, which significantly increased in both spaceflight groups of mice compared to ground controls (Fig. 3A, B, I, J), has been recently characterised as 7α-dehydroxylating in mice62, containing the bile acid inducible operons BaiBCDEFGI and BaiJKL, and BaiA, homologous to Clostridium scindens. The Bai operon enables E. muris and C. scindens to increase concentrations of 7α-dehydroxylated secondary BAs that alter the host bile acid pool and act as ligands to bile acid receptors to influence host inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism62–66. For example, bile sensor farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) modulates enterohepatic recirculation and host cholesterol metabolism through bile acid regulation of cyp7A166. Similarly, secondary bile acids such as DCA and LCA are potent agonists of the bile acid receptor TGR5, which controls glucose homoeostasis in adipose tissue and muscle by altering intestinal cell release of the insulin secretion regulator glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)67–69. Liver production of α-MCA and β-MCA (in mice) is mediated by cyp2c70 genes70,71 but 7α/β-dehydroxylation mediated by microbes such as E.muris can modify MCAs after epimerization into HDCA72, and critically regulate lipid metabolism73,74. Interestingly, E. clostridioformis, significantly higher in relative abundance after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 3), is reported as increasing in the presence of E. muris62 and harbours 7α/β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH)59,75, which can also transform primary and secondary BAs into oxo-bile acids64. This agrees with findings from the RR-5 mission39, which found significantly increased levels of serum choline in mice after spaceflight, suggesting a broad impact on lipid metabolism. Immune suppression has previously been described as a response to spacefight76 and could result as bile acid dysregulation77,78. So increased relative abundance of C. difficile after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight is of potential concern if toxigenic.Changes in spaceflight associated metagenome functional prediction Metagenomic functional prediction identified 4,583,759 genes in the co-assembly generated from all 32 mice, 392,631 of which were annotated by Kegg database (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, a high proportion (91.4%) of genes, including differentially abundant genes, remain unannotated. Kegg annotated genes included the pathogenicity locus (including tcdAB) from C. difficile, suggesting significant enrichment of the species after 29 and 56 days (Fig. 3I, J) could include a toxigenic strain. Bile acid metabolism genes were identified, including 17 bile salt hydrolases, including that from spaceflight enriched A. muris (Cbh), and 57 non-redundant Bai genes, including from C. scindens (BaiABCDEFGI) and I. butyriciproducens (BaiA and BaiCD), species which were significantly depleted after spaceflight as well as A. muris (BaiCD), Eisenbergiella massiliensis (BaiA) and Blautia pseudococcoides (BaiCD), species which were significantly enriched after spaceflight (Supplementary Data 2 and 3). E. aldenensis and S. arabinosiphila both contained the important BaiCD gene and were significantly enriched in mice after 29 days of spaceflight but significantly depleted after 56 days. Alongside significant enrichment of the rare 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris, these shifts suggest dynamic changes in secondary bile acid production and potential influence on the composition of the host bile acid pool56,79. Differential abundance analysis inferred 52,370 genes were significantly different (FDR <0.1) in abundance after 29 days and 37,068 genes after 56 days of spaceflight, which could be assigned to 2,811 and 2,572 unique KEGG ontology terms, respectively (Fig. 4A). Over-representation analysis identified significant (FDR <0.1) increases in pathways of interest related to fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, antimicrobial resistance and potential host interactions (ECM, carbohydrates and pathogenicity), after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight compared to ground controls (Fig. 4B, C; Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, these significant changes in metagenomic gene inventories, and specific bacterial species with well-characterised functions, due to spaceflight suggest gut microbiome changes which should influence lipid and bile acid homoeostasis, and the immune system of the murine host.

B GC_LAR vs FLT_LAR Over-representation analysis (ORA) of KEGG ontology (Brite, pathway and module) and (C) GC_ISS vs FLT_ISS ORA KEGG ontology. Changes in fatty acid pathways included Fatty acid biosynthesis (00061), Fatty acid metabolism (01212), Fatty acid degradation (00071) and Butanoate metabolism (00650), including butyryl CoA:acetate CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.8) and butyrate kinase (EC:2.7.2.7). Over-representation of bile acid metabolism was reflected in Bile secretion (04976) and Cholesterol metabolism (04979) and Secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways, including bile salt hydrolase (cbh, EC:3.5.1.24) and 3-oxocholoyl-CoA 4-desaturase (baiCD, EC:1.3.1.115). Over-representation of the antimicrobial resistance was represented in Brite ontology Antimicrobial resistance genes (ko01504) and the pathways for beta-Lactam resistance (01501), Biosynthesis of various antibiotics (00998) and Biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics (01055). The Brite ontology Bacterial toxins (ko02042) was over-represented, including tight junction interacting zona occludens toxin (K10954), as well as the pathways Pathogenic Escherichia coli infection (05130) and Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells (05100). Diverse carbohydrate metabolism and ECM interacting pathways were represented by Galactose metabolism (00052), Mannose type O-glycan biosynthesis (00515), Glycosaminoglycan degradation (00531), Other glycan degradation (00511), ECM-receptor interaction (04512) as well as the Brite ontology of Glycosaminoglycan binding proteins (ko00536), Peptidoglycan biosynthesis and degradation proteins (ko01011) and Glycosyltransferases (ko01003). These included putative Mucin-associated glycosyl hydrolases (GHs)185, GH2s: β-galactosidase (EC:3.2.1.23), β-mannosidase (EC:3.2.1.25), β-glucuronidase (EC:3.2.1.31), α-l-arabinofuranosidase (EC:3.2.1.55), β-xylosidase (EC:3.2.1.37), β-glucosidase (EC:3.2.1.21), GH20: β-hexosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52), GH29: α-l-fucosidase (EC:3.2.1.51), and GH84: N-acetyl β-glucosaminidase (EC:3.2.1.52).Spaceflight alters host intestinal gene expression Faecal or serum fatty acid or bile acid concentrations were not measured within the Rodent Research 6 mission; however, host colon and liver gene expression were assessed from all four groups of mice, allowing host responses to spaceflight at the host-gut microbiome interface to be investigated. Host intestinal gene expression revealed extensive significant (FDR <0.1) changes after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight when compared to ground controls, including 4613 differentially expressed (DE) genes between GC_LAR and FLT_LAR, and 4,476 DE genes between GC_ISS and FLT_ISS (Fig. 5A–H; Supplementary Figs. 7, 8 and Data 5). Of these, 43% and 44% were increased due to flight in LAR and ISS mice, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway level after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 5I, J), including immune suppression, dysregulation off cholesterol and bile acid, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling.

Open in a new tab MA plots showing (A) GC_LAR vs FLT_LAR (29 days of spaceflight) and (B) GC_ISS vs FLT_ISS (56 days of spaceflight) differentially expressed genes in the colon (FDR <0.1). C–H Differentially expressed gene from select KEGG pathways of interest, (I) Significant Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 29 days (modified from WebGestalt182) and (J) Significant GSEA 56 days spaceflight. Full DE gene list is available in Supplementary data 5 and select KEGG pathways of interest with differentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 9–14. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed consistent responses at a pathway level between 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. This included widespread downregulation of the components of the intestinal immune system after spaceflight, including intestinal immune network for IgA production, antigen processing and presentation, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, PARR signalling metabolism of xenobiotics, Staphylococcus aureus infection, T cell receptor signalling, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, graft-vs-host disease and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions pathways, as well as downregulation of cholesterol pathways, including cholesterol metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Spaceflight also led to common upregulation of pathways associated to intestinal extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, including ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, tight junction, gap junction pathways, and cortisol production represented through the Cushing syndrome pathway. The bile secretion pathway was significantly upregulated after 29 days of spaceflight, but downregulated after 56 days, suggesting bile acid dynamics should be explored at the gene level. Similarly, mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, pathways in cancer and insulin resistance were only upregulated at the pathway level after 29 days of spaceflight, while bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, NAFLD, butonoate metabolism, insulin secretion and insulin signalling pathways were upregulated and the circadian rhythm pathway was downregulated after only 56 days of spaceflight.Intestinal bile acid and circadian rhythm gene expression Significant microbiome alteration in some of the few well-characterised 7α-dehydroxylating bacterial species, including increases in E. muris after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight (below detection in ground controls) as well as depletion of C. scindens, suggests secondary bile acid production and the bile acid pool is likely altered in the murine gut during spaceflight. In the host intestine, bile acids are passively absorbed or actively taken up through the apical membrane by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, ASBT (Slc10A2), bound to the cytosolic ileal bile acid binding protein, IBABP (Fabp6), and then transported across the basolateral membrane by organic solute transporters, Ostα and Ostβ (Slc51A and Slc51B), or glucuronidated by UGTs (such as Ugt1a1) and exported back to the lumen by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, MRP2 (Abcc2 transporter)80,81. Increases in intestinal bile acid also activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) heterodimer which regulates production and secretion of fibroblast growth factor FGF15/19, the negative feedback hormone which travels through portal circulation to bind hepatic FGFR4 receptors which suppress liver bile acid biosynthesis via inhibition of Cyp7A182. After 29 days of spaceflight, Abcc2 was significantly downregulated, suggesting reduced BA export to the colon, while Asbt, Ibabp, Ostα, Ostβ and Ugt1a1 were all significantly upregulated as well as Rxrα (not Fxr), Fgf15/19 and Fgfr4 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). Taken together, these changes suggest spaceflight led to an alteration in bile acid metabolism in the intestine which would lead to bile acid suppression of hepatic Cyp7A1 and accumulation of cholesterol or hypercholesterolaemia83. Interestingly, intestinal Cyp7A1 expression was identified as significantly repressed after 29 days of spaceflight. Previous proteomic research in Biom-1M mice suggested a decrease in bile secretion during spaceflight84 while hepatic metabolite assessment of mice after spaceflight in the Space Shuttle Atlantis measured increased accumulation of cholate and taurodeoxycholate16. As the major cholesterol degradation mechanism in humans and mice is conversion to bile acids, cholesterol accumulation, alongside bile acid dysregulation and suppression of Cyp71A, should increase direct intestinal cholesterol excretion85. Supporting this extrapolation, both cholesterol excretion transporter genes, Abcg5 and Abcg8, were significantly upregulated in the intestine after 29 days of spaceflight. After 56 days, intestinal Cyp7A1 was still significantly repressed and both Abcg5 and Abcg8 upregulated, but GSEA indicated a further shift in intestinal bile acid metabolism (Fig. 5I, J; Supplementary Figs. 9–14). This was underlined by significant downregulation of the apical bile acid transporter Asbt compared to ground controls as well as Ntcp (Slc10a1)86, indicating a switch to active reduction in bile acid uptake. Coinciding with this was significant increases in expression of Lxrβ, the liver x receptor gene expressed widely in different tissues, which can help prevent bile acid toxicity through induction of Abcg5 and Abcg8 mediated cholesterol excretion87–90. In gene expression analysis of multiple tissues in mice after spaceflight, da Silveira et al.18 found that enrichment within the circadian rhythm pathway of the kidney, liver, eye, adrenal gland and various muscle tissues. Within the intestine here, the major clock genes, the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock) and brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1 (Bmal1; Arntl) transcription factors, were significantly upregulated after 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight, and the neuronal PAS Domain Protein 2 (Npas2) was upregulated after 56 days (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Figs. 9–14 and Data 5). These regulate the major clock-controlled genes reverse-erythroblastosis (Rev-Erbα and β) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors, including gamma (Rorc)91, as well as Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3), Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) protein (Dec1 and Dec2) genes92,93, all of which were significantly downregulated after 56 days of spaceflight except for Rev-Erbα (Nr1d1) (only downregulated after 29 days). These genes can feedback to inhibit Clock/Npas2 and Bmal1 as part of a feedback loop94,95, and also regulate other the clock controlled genes such as DBP, HLF and TEF, significantly downregulated, and Nfil3 (E4BP4), significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight. These spaceflight-associated changes in core clock genes, such as upregulation of Bmal1, Arntl and Npas2, largely agree with those found in murine muscle tissue after longer-term spaceflight which were characterised as similar to age-related gene expression on earth96. These clock genes regulate nutrient absorption, gut motility, intestinal barrier function and immunity92 and have also been shown to require and interact with the microbiome, including in response to microbially-derived molecules, such as butyrate and bile acids, and in direct response to microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)53,92,97–99. In addition to the widespread intestinal gene expression responses to bile acids, the major butyrate receptor free fatty acid receptor 2 (Ffar2; Gpr43)100 was significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight. Similarly, the archetypal intestinal MAMP recognising mannose-binding lectin genes, Mbl-1 and Mbl-2101, were significantly downregulated. Furthermore, Wang et al.102 reported host immune responses to microbial flagellin and lipopolysaccharide in the intestine increased expression of Il-23, and Il-22, leading to a downregulation of Rev-Erb and subsequent upregulation of Nfil3, which in turn can regulate clock-associated nutrient absorption and immunity. Here, mice followed this specific expression pattern after spaceflight (Supplementary Data 5), implying the spaceflight associated microbiome alterations could have been recognised and influenced these changes in clock gene expression.Intestinal extracellular matrix remodelling and immune compromise during spaceflight Changes in the extracellular matrix-receptor interactions pathway were underpinned by significant upregulation of collagens (Col1a1-2, Col3a1, Col4a1-2, Col5a1-2, Col5a3, Col6a2-3, Col12a1, Col26a1), laminins (Lama3), thrombospondin (Thbs1) and tenascins (Tnc) in mice after 29 days of spaceflight, which became more pronounced after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Data 5). This coincided with upregulation of integrin (Itga5 and Itga7) and matrix glycoprotein (Sdc4 and Gp5) receptors, collectively implying extensive extracellular matrix remodelling during spaceflight. The ECM and mucosal collagen scaffold in particular are known to be shaped by microbiota103, as are mucins, which make up the intestinal mucus layer and have a dynamic relationship with commensal bacteria as well as serving as a critical barrier against colonisation by pathogenic bacteria104. Significant increase in the secretory mucin gene Muc2 and significant decreases in the membrane bound Muc3 and mucosal pentraxin 1 (Mptx1), three of the mostly highly abundant transcripts in the murine intestine here, were observed after 56 days of spaceflight, suggesting alterations to mucin within the intestinal lumen in direct contact with microbiota. Mucin 2 (Muc2) is well characterised as regulated by intestinal bacteria, with O-glycans serving as nutrients and adhesion sites for microbiota105, but are also differentially expressed in response to pathogens104, including Trichinella106, identified here. Extensive changes to mucosa were indicated by widespread downregulation of cell adhesion molecules during spaceflight, including downregulation of CD8a and CD8b1 genes, genes encoding costimulatory molecules CD2,6,80,86,40 and ICOSL within intestinal antigen presenting cells as well as their T cell activating binding partners CD48,166,28 and ICOS107–109 (Fig. 5G; Supplementary Data 5). Cytokine genes, such as the chemokine Ccl22 and receptor Ccr4 involved in the intestinal immune response to enteric bacterial pathogens in murine mucosa110, were also uniformly downregulated (Fig. 5F), alongside others111–113: Ccl3,5,6 and 22, Ccr4,7 and 9, Cxcr2,3 and 6, Il-5,7,12 and 16, and Il-2r,5r,7r,10r,12r,18r,21r,23r and 27r. An exception to this pattern of cytokine downregulation was upregulation IL-23 and IL-22, which interact with circadian regulation95, and specific members of the mucosal homoeostasis critical interleukin 17 family114, Il-17d, which promotes pathogenicity during infection through suppression of CD8 + T cells115, and Il-17rc, which increases expression during compromised epithelial barrier integrity (wounding)116. These expression profiles, alongside consistent downregulation of genes within the Intestinal IgA pathway (Fig. 5H), suggest suppression of immunity and widespread tissue remodelling at the host-gut microbiome interface in mice after spaceflight. This agrees with reports of reduced cytokine production in mice after simulated microgravity117, immune dysfunction in splenic tissue of mice after 13 days of spaceflight on the Space Shuttle Atlantis118 and in astronauts, alongside increases in plasma cortisol concentration which reached Cushing syndrome levels, during spaceflight119. Taken together, this provides an insight into the role the host-gut-microbiome interface might play in the current broad consensus of immune dysregulation in spaceflight environments120.Spaceflight alters gene expression in the liver Hepatic gene differential expression analysis comparing mice after 29 days and 56 days in space to their relative ground controls identified 4029 DE genes and 4068 DE genes, respectively (FDR <0.1; Fig. 6A, H; Supplementary Figs. 15, 16 and Data 5). Of these, 48% and 49% were increased due to 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight, respectively. GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6I, J), including disruption of bile acid and energy metabolism. Fig. 6. Microbiome-host metabolism: spaceflight alters liver gene expression. Open in a new tab MA plots showing (A) GC_LAR vs FLT_LAR (29 days of spaceflight) and (B) GC_ISS vs FLT_ISS (56 days of spaceflight) differentially expressed genes in the liver (FDR <0.1).

Full DE gene list is available in Supplementary data 5 and select KEGG pathways of interest with differentially expressed gene highlighted are available in Supplementary Figs. 17–21. GSEA of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceflight. These comprised downregulation of immune response pathways, similar to those seen in the intestine, as well as steroid metabolism, type I diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease and NAFLD. Spaceflight also led to common upregulation of insulin resistance, Hippo signalling, inositol phosphate metabolism, Cushing syndrome and hepatocellular cancer pathways at both 29 and 56 days. Certain pathways were different over time. After 29 days of spaceflight, long-term depression and maturity onset diabetes of the young pathways were upregulated, whereas after 56 days, bile secretion and circadian rhythm were downregulated, while glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were upregulated.Bile acid disruption underlies hepatic cholesterol accumulation The most abundant intestinal transcripts in mice after 56 days of spaceflight, differentially expressed and representing 8% and 9% of normalised counts, were from the non-coding RNA Rn7s1 and Rn7s2 genes (7 S RNA 1 and 2; Supplementary Data 5), respectively, which were recently characterised as inhibitors of global mitochondrial transcription in mammals121. This is consistent with the mitochondrial dysfunction highlighted as characteristic of spaceflight pathogenicity in recent multiomic analysis performed by de Silveira et al.18, who also characterised compromised liver function in mice and astronauts after spaceflight compared ground controls, including upregulation of Fgf21, a negative repressor of bile synthesis122, and accumulation of total cholesterol (higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Here, another potent repressor of Cyp7A1 bile synthesis, fibroblast growth factor 1 (fgf1)123, was upregulated in the liver of mice after 29 days of spaceflight, and the more well known Fgf2116 was significantly upregulated in the liver after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. Within the liver, Sterol 14-demethylase (Cyp51) catalyses the transformation of lanosterol into cholesterol and Cyp7A1 is then the first (and rate-limiting) enzymatic step in transformation of cholesterol in primary bile acid biosynthesis, which itself is strictly inhibited by bile acid concentrations124. The production of bile salts is then a stepwise transformation process dependent on gene expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (Hsd3b7) gene, cholic acid-specific Cyp8b1 gene and acyl-Coenzyme A oxidase 2 (Acox2) before conjugation by Baat, Acnat1 and Acnat2, and subsequent excretion in the bile duct by bile salt exporter pump (BSEP)125,126. Cyp51, Cyp8b1 and Acox2 genes were significantly upregulated and Cyp7a1 and Fxr (Nr1h4) were significantly downregulated in the liver of mice after 56 days on the ISS (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The cholesterol transporter genes Abcg5 and Abcg8 (intestinally upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight) were upregulated in the liver after 29 days, but no longer significantly upregulated after 56 days, and Abcg8 was significantly downregulated. This reduction is surprising given the uniform accumulation of cholesterol observed after extended spaceflight; in contrast, Bsep and the bile acid conjugating acyl-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (Acnat1 and Acnat2; Baatp1/2) genes were significantly upregulated. Taken together, these expression profiles suggest hepatic accumulation of cholesterol, characteristic of glucose and lipid metabolic dysruption97, and describe a subsequent increase in the production bile acids in the liver, preferentially cholic acid, their subsequent conjugation and export as bile salts, with the seemingly contradictory reduction in Cyp7A1 consistent with feedback inhibition. The other major mechanism for detoxification during cholesterol and bile acid accumulation in the liver is sulfonation of bile acids, the transfer of a sulfonate group to a hydroxyl (OH) by a subfamily of cytosolic sulfotransferases (Sult2a genes) which increases their solubility, decreases enterohepatic recirculation, and increase excretion127. After 29 days of spaceflight, hepatic Sult2a1, Sult2a4 and Sult2a5 were downregulated, which shifted to downregulation of Sult2a7 and Sult2a8 after 56 days (Supplementary Data 5). In humans, bile acid sulfonation is catalysed by Sult2a1, which sulfonates the 3-OH of bile acids. In contrast, mice have 8 Sult2a genes, with Sult2a1-6 sharing close homology to Sult2a1 but Sult2a8 being recently characterised as having major function in sulfonating 7α-OH of bile acids128,129, of particular relevance here due to spaceflight microbiome changes in 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris and C. scindens. Notably, during acute phase immune responses, alterations to fatty acid, cholesterol, and bile acid metabolism, Sult2a1 is known to be suppressed by cholesterol and bile acid regulating nuclear Fxr (Nr1h4) and Car (Nr1i3) nuclear receptors130, the latter of which also regulates bile acid responsive transporter gene Mdr1 (ABCB1)131, all three of which were downregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6C) and provide further evidence of bile acid dysregulation and toxic stress consistent with extensive disruption of the gut-liver axis132.Hepatic energy homoeostasis disruption after spaceflight Beheshti et al.17 observed significant depletion in Cyp7A1 protein levels in mice after spaceflight (RR1 and RR3), alongside disruption in glucose and lipid metabolism133 as well as NAFLD134. Here, pathways related to energy homoeostasis consistently altered in gene expression due to spaceflight after 29 and 56 days included enrichment of fatty acid degradation, insulin signalling and insulin resistance (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The highest relative abundance (CPM) of transcripts significantly increased in the liver of mice after 56 days of spaceflight included fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the liver fat accumulation-associated carbonic anhydrase 3 (Car3)135, and the rate limiting enzyme for fatty acid desaturation, Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), recently identified as a key role at the crossroads of immune response and lipid metabolism through interplay with PPARγ136, also significantly upregulated here (Fig. 6F). Glucose metabolism was also disrupted by spaceflight as the glucose transporter Glut2 (Slc2a2) gene, required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion137, and glycogen synthase 2 (Gys2) gene, the rate limiting enzyme for glycogenesis138, were downregulated in the liver (and intestine) after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. The free fatty acid and glycolysis regulating PPARα was also downregulated, and liver glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3β) were significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6G). Taken together, the indicated decrease in glycogen synthesis and increase in glycogenolysis is characteristic of insulin resistance leading to the elevated fasting plasma glucose to pre-diabetic levels previously observed in crew of the Mars500 analogue mission and during spaceflight139–141. Interestingly, in light of spaceflight induced changes to gut microbiota, upregulation of Gsk3β is also known to be activated by microbial-associated molecular patterns142 and promotes acute liver failure through inhibition of the PPARα pathway143. Other pathways enriched in the liver after spaceflight included Cushing Syndrome, hypercortisolism consistent with elevation of cholesterol levels, and hepatocellular cancer pathways. Notably, claudins, which were largely downregulated in the intestine where they are commonly expressed within tight junctions, were upregulated in liver tissue after 56 days of spaceflight (Supplementary Data 5), including highly significant and high relative abundance increases in CLDN1 and CLDN2. So-called non-tight junction claudins have only recently been experimentally explored and, in hepatic cells, CLDN1 is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)144. More broadly, significant upregulation of Tgf-α and genes involved in complex Tgf-β signalling (Tgfb2, Tgfb3, Tab2, Tgfbrap, Smad3), alongside other markers (Dapk2, Vegfa, Dvl3)145,146 are associated to HCC, as well as immune suppression through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (p21cip1; Cdkn1a)147, also significantly upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight. Previous gene expression analysis of mice exposed to high-energy ion particle radiation to simulate exposure to Galactic Cosmic Rays reported induction of spontaneous HCC146. These prominent transcriptomic shifts after 56 days of spaceflight, if reflected in longer term studies in humans, could represent a serious health concern.Discussion A challenge for biological experimentation conducted in space is low replication, compared to model studies using mice on Earth. An important associated shortfall of this research is the lack of assessment of inter-cage variation. The commonalities between LAR and ISS mice groups and use of distinct metagenomic methodologies, 16 S rRNA gene barcoding and co-assembled WMS, helped provide some biological and technical confidence in the spaceflight-associated changes in microbiome species detected here; however, it is likely that low n reduced statistical power and that important microbiome associations were missed, particularly those of low abundance bacteria. It is important that the imminent commercial low Earth orbit destinations (CLDs), Gateway, and Lunar Base Camp increase the capacity of their experimental habitats and growth facilities to support replicate numbers for multiomic science, in order to maximise discoveries and enable future interventional microbiome studies. This research also lacked truly independent cohorts of mice, as Liver Animal Return (29 days spaceflight) and ISS (56 days spaceflight), and their respective ground controls, derived from the same initial cohort of mice. Future studies should ensure common data gathering approaches to enable high resolution multiomic data to be directly compared across missions and different cohorts of mice. Integration of metagenomic and host transcriptomic data here provided a highly complementary picture of the multiomic response to spaceflight, and is a strength of an Open Science culture and public multiomic resources such as GeneLab. The addition of untargeted serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened this research and future studies should aim to quantitatively profile the specific deconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the system. Alongside metatranscriptomic analysis of the gut microbiome, this would represent an important next step likely to help clarify the directionality of the host-gut microbiome responses associated to spaceflight pathology.Conclusions Through metagenomic assessment of the murine gut microbiome, significant spaceflight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identified. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceflight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when using distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation. Collectively, these multiomic findings suggest host-gut microbiome interactions during spaceflight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health.Methods Experimental design Female 32 weeks-old C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconic Biosciences sources) from four treatment groups of the Rodent Research 6 mission were compared: flight live animal return (FLT_LAR), ground control for live animal return (GC_LAR), flight ISS (FLT_ISS) and ground control for ISS (GC_ISS) (Fig. 1). FLT_ISS and FLT_LAR mice comprised 40 mice that were launched on SpaceX-13 and transferred to the rodent research habitat on the ISS whereas their matched ground controls, GC_ISS and GC_LAR, were 40 mice kept in identical rodent habitats at Kennedy Space Centre. Not all mice were available to NASA GeneLab for DNA and RNA extractions (replicate numbers provided below). Diet (LabDiet Rodent 5001) and deionized autoclaved water were provided ad libitum, and a 12:12 h dark/light cycle maintained. After 29 days of flight onboard the ISS, FLT_LAR mice were returned to earth as part of the Live Animal Return (13/1/18) and sacrificed alongside GC_LAR using common processing at ages of 41 weeks old (16/1/18). FLT_ISS mice were sacrificed after 53–56 days of flight onboard the ISS at the same time as GC_ISS mice at the Kennedy Space Centre at 44 weeks old using a common timeline and methodology. During this period in the Destiny module (US laboratory) on the ISS, the mice were exposed to an average daily 165.8 µGy d−1 Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) dose and 117.3 µGy d−1 South Atlantic Anomaly (energetic protons) dose (data provided by Ames Life Sciences Data Archive - ALSDA). This is in line with standard range of exposure on the ISS148, and represents around a 100% increase to common exposure on earth. The temperature, relative humidity and elevated carbon dioxide levels on the ISS were mimicked in the ground control rodent habitats at the Kennedy Space over the 56 days of spaceflight, so were not significantly different (t-test, p > 0.05) between flight and ground controls, and averaged 22.75 (±0.35) °C, 41.49 (±2.28) % and 3219 (±340) CO2 ppm, respectively. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocol (Protocol number RR6) was approved on October 24, 2017, by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). As outlined in the NASA Genelab record (OSD-249), Anaesthesia for the LAR mice groups was induced using isoflurane. For the ISS mice groups, anaesthesia was administered via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine during the dissection period, which occurred 53–56 days post-launch. Blood samples were obtained via closed-chest cardiac puncture, though these were not used in this study. Euthanasia was performed by exsanguination followed by thoracotomy. The ISS spaceflight mice carcasses underwent hind limb dissection, which was not used in this study, then were wrapped in aluminium foil, placed in Ziploc bags, and stored at −80 °C or colder until return. The ISS Ground Control followed the same euthanasia methods and preservation timeline at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Experimental endpoints included the collection of blood samples, completion of hind limb dissection, and collection of faecal samples. Faecal samples were extruded from the colon during dissection, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Additionally, liver and colon (RNASeq explored here), and spleen, lung, thymus, and dorsal skin samples were collected for further analysis.DNA extraction Faecal samples from 32 RR6 mice were available for DNA extraction: n = 9 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 7 mice from GC_LAR, n = 7 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) (OSD-249). Half of a frozen faecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB solution and homogenised using tissue homogenising bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 4 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 °C and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was eluted in 105 µL RNAse free H2O and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research). Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All DNA sequence data is available in the NASA GeneLab record OSD-249.16S rRNA gene amplification DNA library preparation was performed by the Genome Research Core (GRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 10 ng of genomic DNA was used as input to a two-stage PCR amplification protocol149,150. In the first stage, primers 515 F/806 R (Earth Microbiome Project, V4 targeting) containing Fluidigm ‘Common Sequence’ linkers (CS1 and CS2) were used to amplify gDNA. In the second stage, Fluidigm AccessArray barcoded primers were used to amplify PCR products from the first stage and incorporate Illumina sequencing adaptors and a sample barcode. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiniSeq mid-output flow cell, employing paired-end 2 × 153 base reads.Whole metagenome sequencing Whole metagenome sequence libraries were prepared using an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Input DNA was ~100 ng per reaction, and five cycles of PCR were performed. Index adaptors used were IDT for Illumina, 96-well Nextera Flex Dual Index Adapters, set A. Library fragment sizes (~550 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured with a KAPA Library quantification kit (Roche, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center).RNA extraction and sequencing Colon samples from 36 RR6 mice were available for RNA extraction: n = 10 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 8 mice from GC_LAR, n = 9 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 9 mice from GC_ISS. Liver samples from 39 mice were available for RNA extraction: n = 10 mice from FLT_LAR, n = 9 mice from GC_LAR, n = 10 mice from FLT_ISS and n = 10 mice from GC_ISS. RNA was extracted from mouse tissue samples using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenisation buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozen colon (OSD-247) or liver (OSD-245) tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenisation was performed using tissue homogenising bead mix (Zirconium Oxide 2.0 mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Kit or RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol. Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. Input RNA amounts were ~500 ng; RNA RIN values were > 4. Index adaptors were 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles of PCR were performed. Library fragment sizes (~300 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center) and all RNA sequencing data is provided for in the NASA GeneLab records OSD-247 (colon) or OSD-245 (liver).16S rRNA gene barcoding Amplicon sequence reads were processed and annotated using Anchor28,35,139,151,152. Exact sequence variants (ESV) were identified in place of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)153,154. Sequences were aligned and dereplicated using Mothur155 and a count threshold parameter of 96. Annotation at family, genus or species-level used BLASTn criteria of >99% identity and coverage to the  16 S curated and  nr/nt databases (January 2022 versions). Differentially abundant ESVs were manually assessed for quality. When the highest identity/coverage was shared amongst multiple different references, all annotations were retained and reported. Differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2156,157, which performs well with sparse data and uneven library sizes158. Sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single sample was required to be <90% of the count in all samples, and ESV counts were required to be >0 in at least 3 samples from the same group35. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 correction was applied159.Whole metagenome sequencing co-assembly and annotation Quality control used Trim Galore! (v0.6.6)160, a wrapper script to automate quality and adaptor trimming as well as quality control. Trim Galore is based on cutadapt (v2.10)161 and fastqc (v0.11.5)162. Trim Galore! PARAMETERS : --trim-n --max_n 0 --paired --retain_unpaired --phred33 --length 75 -q 5 --stringency 1 -e 0.1 -j 1. BBMAP163 was used to remove potential contamination from human using the masked version of hg19 human assembly. To remove redundancy in read dataset and reduce the computational load, reads were normalised using ORNA164 with the following parameters: -sorting 1 -base 1.7 -kmer 21. MEGAHIT v1.2.9165 was used to assemble reads from all samples into one co-assembly using meta-large option. Kallisto (v0.46.2)166 expectation maximisation algorithm was used to complete metagenomics read assignment and infer contig abundance167. Prodigal (v2.6.3)168 was used with the option meta to predict open reading frames (ORFs) and BLAST v2.3.0169 was used to annotate contigs sequence. To assign contig taxonomy, a first alignment iteration was run using full contig lengths against the  nr/nt database (January 2022) and Reference Viral Database (RVDB v v25.0). To further resolve nucleotide taxonomic annotation, a second alignment was run against all databases which included selected genomes (additional 1148 sequences) from  refseq informed by first iteration. BLASTn was run using the following parameters: -evalue 1e-50 -word_size 128 -perc_identity 97. Contig alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given contig. Descriptive statistics were also provided for contigs with a common species annotation that had an average alignment identity > 97%, total alignment length > 3000 nt and an average query coverage > 20%. To validate ESV sequences using the metagenomics de novo assembly, ESVs were aligned to WMS contigs using BLASTn. To annotate genes, three protein databases ( nr, UniProtKB Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL; January 2022) were searched using the translated sequences of the predicted proteins. BLASTx was run with the following parameters: -evalue 1e-10 -word_size 6 -threshold 21. Alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given orf. GO, pfam, PANTHER, EMBL, InterPro, HAMAP, TIGRFAMs, STRING, HOGENOM, SUPFAM terms were mined from UniProtKB database. Amino acid sequences were used as input in the GhostKOALA webserver170 to add functional genes and pathways information. KEGG functional and taxonomic annotation was retrieved using complete and incomplete pathways. Extibacter muris strain DSM28560 bile acid-inducible operon sequence (baiBCDEFGHI)62, were manually added to default KEGG database. One bai sequence did not have a KEGG term associated to it (baiG MFS transporter; bile acid transporter) and a temporary KEGG term was assigned to it (K9999).Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) Using metagenome co-assembly from 3.4.2, genome binning was performed using MetaBAT2171. Genome quality estimation of all bins was performed using CheckM (version v1.1.6)172. Taxonomic classification was performed with Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) a pipeline for the taxonomic classification of metagenome assembled genomes173.Murine transcriptome reference mapping Mouse liver and colon RNA-Seq reads were processed and assembled following NASA GeneLab consensus pipeline, as described previously174.Alpha and beta diversity To estimate and compare microbial richness within samples, alpha diversity was measured using diversity indices using Phyloseq R library175 and was compared between groups with t-tests (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U (non-parametric) tests. Unsupervised multivariate analysis (ordination) was performed using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with normalised counts (Supplementary Data 1) while constrained ordination was based on distance-based Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CCA). Significance of constraints were assessed using ANOVA-like permutation testing for CCA (anova.cca). Vegan R library176 was used to conduct these analyses, statistics, and to produce graphs and draw dispersion ellipses. As an exploratory visualisation of annotated WMS contigs, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to reduce the dimensionality of beta diversity WMS contig count matrices. CPM normalised counts of differentially abundant species (30 in each comparison) were selected as input and umap function from the umap R package (v 0.2.10) was used for each comparison with default parameters. Care should be taken when interpreting relative abundances as amplicon-based and WMS microbiome profiling lacks absolute quantification and is vulnerable to biases from PCR amplification and/or sequencing depth.Differential abundance/expression analysis Prior to differential abundance analysis, sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV/contig/transcript count in a single sample must be <90% of the count across all samples and ESV/contig occurrence must be at least ≥ 3 in samples within the same design factor. Differential abundance (or expression) analysis was performed using DESeq2159 based on pre-processed raw abundance of ESVs/contigs/ORFs/transcripts. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 was applied for statistical significance156. Missingness is a known challenge for negative binomial regression models (such as used in DESeq2) when analyzing zero-inflated abundance tables177,178, contigs with an absolute zero across all replicated samples belonging to a same factor were assumed to be structural zeros and flagged as significantly differentially abundant. To address conservative p-value distribution179 of RNA-Seq differential expression analysis, local FDR values were computed from DESeq2 p-values using fdrtool (v1.2.17)180 R library.Functional enrichment analysis Ghostkoala output was organised into a gene count table using WMS ORF raw count table and used as input for over-representation analysis (ORA) of WMS data. ORA was used to statistically test the overlap between DA ORFs (FDR <0.1) and a geneset using pathways of interest (Supplementary Data 4). p-values were calculated using a hypergeometric test using clusterProfiler (v4.7.1.003) R library181. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNASeq data was performed on the Webgestalt182 platform using the entire gene list, rank-ordered combining significance and effect size from DESeq2 differential expression analysis, i.e. log2(FC)*-log(pValue)183. Gene symbols were inferred from assembly transcripts using org.Mm.eg.db (v3.16)184 R annotation library.Supplementary information Supplementary Material (2.4MB, pdf) nr-reporting-summary (1.6MB, pdf) 41522_2024_545_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx (86.4KB, xlsx) Supplementary file 1 – RR6 amplicon-based metagenomics 41522_2024_545_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx (7.1MB, xlsx) Supplementary file 4 – RR6 WMS-based function 41522_2024_545_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx (5.3MB, xlsx) Supplementary file 5 – RR6 host transcriptomics 41522_2024_545_MOESM6_ESM.xlsx (102.5KB, xlsx) Supplementary file 2 – RR6 WMS processing summary 41522_2024_545_MOESM7_ESM.xlsx (3.3MB, xlsx) Supplementary file 3 – RR6 WMS-based taxonomy Acknowledgements This research was generated by the NASA GeneLab Analysis Working Group for Microbes.

    "abstract": "Abstract While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens. Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Human pathogens occupy a wide variety of ecological niches, including those in the harsh conditions imposed by spaceflight. Understanding the effects that spaceflight may have on the adaptation and fitness of human pathogens is necessary to predict potential causes of health problems during future missions, where the availability of treatment and prevention options is limited. This is even more important in the context of opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which typically produce benign infections, until they are challenged by certain environmental conditions or when host immune impairments occur, which can then equip them with the ability to cause serious health concerns [1]. One such environmental condition is spaceflight, which has been demonstrated to convert opportunistic pathogens to primary pathogens, enabling them to take advantage of a compromised immune system that may occur to astronauts during spaceflight [2, 3]. In line with this, there is mounting evidence that primary bacterial pathogens often undergo a diversity of significant phenotypic shifts during spaceflight, including increased antibiotic resistance [4, 5, 6, 7], increased virulence [8, 9, 10, 11], and morphological changes associated with pathogenicity [12]. Despite mounting research in these primary pathogens, much less is known about phenotypic shifts that occur to opportunistic pathogens when exposed to microgravity. Specifically, there is little known about how pathogens may be utilizing nutrients differently in the microgravity environment of space compared to ground microbes, and potentially how these mechanistic changes might be influencing the host immune response during infection. Due to increased nosocomial reports, the human opportunistic bacteria, Serratia marcescens, has emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance [13, 14]. S. marcescens is a ubiquitous pathogen that occupies a wide variety of habitats and hosts. It can adapt quickly to antibiotics independently and simultaneously, which is likely due to the loss of conserved genetic elements and large genomic diversity among strains [14, 15, 16]. Furthermore, S. marcescens was found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station [17, 18]. Therefore, this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts that are more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens and especially considering the complications with antibiotic resistance [2, 18]. Research in our laboratory has demonstrated that there is a significant shift in virulence with S. marcescens (Db11) after spaceflight. When cultured aboard the International Space Station, S. marcescens Db11 killed healthy ground-reared Drosophila melanogaster hosts significantly faster than an identical control of the bacteria that was cultured on the ground [11]. However, the specific mechanisms of increased Db11 virulence and reduced D. melanogaster survival are currently unknown. In line with this, increased virulence is observed with various space and low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG)-isolated bacteria, including studies with Salmonella [19], and Staphylococcus aureus [20], which pose a threat to astronaut health during spaceflight. Our prior research has shown that Serratia marcescens also shows a significant increase in host lethality of D. melanogaster after growth in simulated microgravity (LSMMG) conditions [11]. Since spaceflight studies are costly and can be difficult to perform due to constraints on experimental design and the availability of spaceflight opportunities, many researchers perform ground-based studies using devices such as the rotating wall vessel (RWV) to simulate microgravity [21, 22, 23]. The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles, thereby creating a low fluid shear environment that simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during spaceflight [24] and is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated such that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earth's gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g) without continuous suspension while acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the vessel itself. Although this method is not an exact recreation of the spaceflight environment, the effects of the LSMMG environment have been demonstrated to recapitulate findings from spaceflight studies [10, 11]. Drosophila melanogaster, as used in this study, has proven to be a useful host model for spaceflight and ground-based studies in the past. This is due to their well-characterized innate immune system, tractable genetics, ease of use, short life-cycle, genetic homology to mammalian systems, and low resource requirements for breeding large colonies [11, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. In the current study, we use LSMMG to investigate the specific mechanisms that enable microgravity-treated Serratia marcescens bacteria to kill the host D. melanogaster more quickly than control bacterial cultures. A screen of several genes related to known S. marcescens virulence factors did not reveal any differences of expression in LSMMG compared to RWV-Control. Further testing revealed a LSMMG-dependent overexpression of the gene asparagine synthetase B (asnB), which is implicated in virulence and resistance to drugs in other pathogenic bacteria [36, 37]. This gene is involved with amino acid metabolism and has been linked to both pathogen growth and virulence [38]. Amino acids like asparagine are thought to be important to the competition between hosts and pathogens in determining the outcome of an infection [38]. Since our previous study indicated that the LSMMG-reared S. marcescens killed the host faster after infection [11] than control S. marcescens cultures, we wanted to explore whether the asparagine pathway might be linked to the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG treatment. Here, we show that LSMMG treatment causes a change in the expression of key asparagine pathway related genes in S. marcescens with a concomitant increase in host mortality. Further, we find that these changes in key asparagine pathway genes and increased host mortality can be recapitulated in an LSMMG-specific manner by the addition of aspartate and glutamine (the substrates of asparagine synthesis) to minimal media. We also show that the addition of L-asparaginase, which catabolizes asparagine, can mitigate the LSMMG-induced increase in host virulence. Thus, this study allows us to understand the phenotypic shifts occurring in microbes exposed to altered gravity, and more specifically, how amino acid metabolism may affect the mortality rate of the host. In addition, these results will allow us to explore the asparagine pathway further and develop countermeasures that target amino acid biosynthesis in opportunistic pathogens such as S. marcescens, as an essential consideration to maintain host health during spaceflight.",
    "methods": "4. Methods 4.1. D. melanogaster fly strains Fly lines were maintained in a 12-hour light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (∼24 °C). Fly line used in this study was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, w1118 (#3605). 4.2. Growth of S. marcescens Db11 in rotating wall vessel (RWV) S. marcescens Db11 were taken from stock cultures frozen at -80 °C in Copan Cryovials and were grown in sterile 50 mL conical tubes at 37 °C in liquid LB media containing 100 μg/mL streptomycin for 24 h. Liquid subcultures were then diluted down to A600 of 0.100 in LB media and loaded into a sterile 10 mL rotating wall vessel (Synthecon). The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles and simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during spaceflight [24] and this is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated with an axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the orientation of the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earth's gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g), thereby acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the container vessel itself [19]. Air bubbles were removed from the vessel and vessels were sealed. Pairs of RWV were then placed in either vertical (simulated microgravity) or horizontal (normal gravity, or RWV-Control) orientation at 37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al. [19]). Samples were grown for 24 h to ensure that stationary phase was reached. 4.3. Asparagine and glutamine quantification At 6 and 14 h of growth, 200 μl of sample was taken from the RWV using a sterile 2 mL syringe, and the sample was used per manufacturer protocol to estimate abundances of L-asparagine and L-glutamine. The sample removed from the RWV was replaced with sterile PBS, and any air bubbles were removed before resuming rotation. The entire sample removal procedure took less than 5 min. For enzymatic tests, we used the L-Asparagine/L-Glutamine/Ammonia Assay Kit (Megazyme) following the manufacturer's recommendations and using asparagine or glutamine (final concentration 0.6 mM) as substrates. Enzymatic activities were measured by following the disappearance of the NADPH from the buffer along time as an indirect indication of asparagine deamination at 340 nm using a microplate reader (VERSAmax microplate reader, Molecular Devices). Experiments were performed in three independent replicates. 4.4. Growth of S. marcescens with L-asparaginase Stocks of Db11 were prepared for growth in RWV as described above in either vertical (simulated microgravity with axis of rotation being perpendicular to the gravity vector) or horizontal (normal gravity RWV-control orientation with the axis of rotation being parallel to the gravity vector) orientations at 37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al. [19]). One hundred microliters of L-asparaginase (Millipore Sigma) suspended in sterile water was added to the growth media for half of the vessels, and the other half received only 100 μl of the sterile water. Growth of the bacteria was estimated by absorbance at 600 nm and was measured every 3 h. Samples were grown for 24 h total to ensure that stationary phase was reached. The sample removed from the RWV for quantification was replaced with sterile PBS, and any air bubbles were removed before resuming rotation. These experiments were run in three independent replicates. 4.5. L-asparaginase treatment S. marcescens in the stationary phase were preserved at -80 °C in 10 mL of 20% glycerol. Concentrations of samples for injections were determined by performing colony counts of Serratia in different concentrations of PBS on LB plates. The PBS source without added bacteria was plated as a negative control for contamination. Based on these colony counts, samples were then diluted to 4 × 105 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections. For infections and survival, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting as described previously by our laboratory [11]. Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was approximately 10 CFU/fly. A total of 180 flies were injected, with 60 total flies assigned to each bacterial treatment group. Control bacteria, simulated microgravity-treated bacteria, or a glycerol sham were then injected into the 30 anesthetized 2-3 day-old males and 30 females (post-eclosion) D. melanogaster in the ventral abdomen near the seventh/eighth segment. One hour later, half of those flies (15 per sex) were injected with 32 nL L-asparaginase. After injections, flies were kept at 25 °C on the same standard dextrose food that they were reared on, and survival was monitored every hour for at least 24 h. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates. 4.6. Growth in Davis minimal media supplemented with amino acids Bacteria were prepared using the protocol previously mentioned, but Davis Minimal Media supplemented with 10 mM of aspartate, glutamine, or a 50/50 mixture of aspartate and glutamine was used in place of LB broth. To quantify growth, 20 μl of sample diluted in 180 μl of PBS was read at an absorbance of A600 every 24 h for 72 h. To keep the volume of the RWV consistent, 20 μl of sterile PBS was placed in each vessel to make up for the volume lost during sampling. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates. S. marcescens in the stationary phase were preserved at -80 °C in 10 mL of 20% glycerol. Concentrations of samples for injections were determined by performing colony counts of Serratia in different concentrations of PBS on LB plates. The PBS source without added bacteria were plated as a negative control for contamination. Based on these colony counts, samples were then diluted to 4 × 105 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections. For infections and survival, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting as described previously by our laboratory [11]. Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was approximately 10 CFU/fly. A total of 30 flies (15 males and 15 females) were infected with each experimental sample, including 30 total flies injected with a glycerol sham. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates. 4.7. Expression analysis of amino acid genes Samples were diluted to 1 × 108 cells and pelleted, and RNA was extracted from pelleted samples using the RNEasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). Relative gene expression levels were quantified using the 7500 Real Time PCR instrument from Applied Biosystems and SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed with Primer-Blast, . Real-time cycler conditions were; 95 °C for 15 min for initial activation step, and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for denaturation, annealing, and extension respectively. Data were normalized to the reference gene recA. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates, including RNA extraction from three independent growth trials and three qPCR runs of each sample (9 total plates). Additionally, each plate (replicate) contained 6 identical wells which were averaged to give a mean CT value of a given gene, ensuring that any pipetting errors were minimized in the data. 4.8. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and JMP Pro 15 (SAS). Graphs were made in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and Excel (version 15.4). For survival analyses, a Cox Proportional Hazards model was used. The Cox Proportional Hazards model allows for the comparison of survival between all groups when there are multiple risk factors or treatments involved. The proportional hazards test generates a ‘risk ratio’ when comparing treatment curves, which can be interpreted in infection experiments as a rate of death. For example, a risk ratio of 2.0 means that one treatment kills the host twice as fast as the treatment it's being compared to. For all growth measurements, a one-way ANOVA was used in combination with a Tukey-Kramer posthoc analysis. For gene expression, expression values are reported as fold change relative to the Davis minimal media values, which were calculated in Excel using the ΔΔ Ct method. For all statistical analyses, only results with a statistical significance <0.05 are reported, due to the magnitude of results tables.",
    "results": "2. Results 2.1. The asparagine pathway and extracellular asparagine and glutamine concentrations are affected by simulated microgravity treatment of S. marcescens Our previous findings have indicated that S. marcescens exposed to LSMMG for 24 h grow at a faster rate inside the host after infection and caused increased host lethality in D.melanogaster [11]. First, we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control bacteria (Table 3). We, therefore, looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms and found that genes related to asparagine metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG. More specifically, we found that there was a significant upregulation in asnB (asparagine synthetase B), which is a gene that regulates the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine (Figure 1A,B). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of genes that are important for asparagine and glutamine metabolism. Gene expression analyses showed that the expression level of the gene asnB (asparagine synthetase B) was 39.17 fold higher in LSMMG-treated cells relative to the RWV-control (P < 0.0001), as well as a 10.5 fold increase in expression of L-asparaginase (L-ap, P = 0.054), but there was no significant difference in expression for the other genes tested, although several genes showed a positive trend for expression levels: L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase) (Figure 1D). asnB is a gene that catalyzes the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine, and is known to be linked to virulence and antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens [36, 37]. The L-asparaginase subunits assist with asparagine catabolism and nitrogen homeostasis [39], therefore, an overexpression of these genes suggests that there is an increase in asparagine catabolism as part of the overall homeostatic regulation of the asparagine pathway. Table 3. Expression values of candidate genes in S. marcescens for growth, motility, and virulence as measured by qPCR. Expression values are reported as fold change in LSMMG relative to RWV-Control and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Samples were grown in the RWV for 24 h, then fixed in RNAlater for extraction. Samples were run with three technical replicates per plate, and were performed in three biological replicates. Values reported are the average across all replicates. All averaged replicates reported are p < 0.01.

Measurements of amino acid consumption were performed by removing cells from media by centrifugation and utilizing spectrophotometric analysis with Megazyme™ reagent. A) The asparagine biosynthesis pathway. B) At the end of the growth period of S. marcescens in simulated microgravity (LSMMG orientation), gene expression for each sample was measured via qPCR: L-ap (L-asparaginase), L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), asnB (asparagine synthetase B), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). Expression values are reported as fold change relative to the RWV-Control orientation and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Specific genes represented by the blue end of the color spectrum indicated gene overexpression and those towards the red end indicated inhibition of gene expression. Error bars represent one standard error. Measurements of C) extracellular asparagine and D) extracellular glutamine were performed at hours 0, 6, and 14 of growth in the rotating wall vessel, with an initial starting concentration of 1 × 108 CFU.The observation that asnB expression is significantly increased, led us to hypothesize that there is an increased presence of asparagine in LSMMG that may contribute to the increase in pathogen growth rate, and therefore an increase in consumption of glutamine and aspartate in the media. To confirm this, we quantified the rates at which S. marcescens utilized extracellular glutamine and asparagine in the nutrient-rich LB media, in order to see whether the consumption rates of these amino acids matched the increased growth of the bacteria in LSMMG. For asparagine measurements (Figure 1C), there was no difference between the RWV-control and the LSMMG at 0 h (F = 4.348, P = 0.11) or at 14 h (F = 0.007, P = 0.939). At 6 h of growth, LSMMG had significantly lower extracellular asparagine than the RWV-Control (F = 1540.68, P < 0.0001). Similarly, extracellular glutamine (Figure 1D) was not significantly different at hours 0 (F = 2.251, P = 0.208) or 14 (F = 0.669, P = 0.459), but LSMMG had significantly lower glutamine at hour 6 (F = 282.056, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that the S. marcescens in LSMMG are consuming extracellular glutamine and asparagine more quickly during the active growth phase of the culture, which is consistent with the increase in growth that we see in LSMMG-reared bacteria in rich media [11]. Taken together, the almost 40-fold overexpression of the asnB gene in LSMMG coupled with the overexpression of the asparaginase subunits (Figure 1B), along with the increased consumption of asparagine (Figure 1C), indicated that the asparagine pathway was likely to play a significant role in the phenotypic changes observed in S. marcescens under reduced gravity LSMMG conditions. 2.2. S. marcescens growth is affected by L-asparaginase treatment in vitro under simulated microgravity conditions Since we saw an increase in asparagine consumption with LSMMG treatment, we studied whether the depletion of exogenous L-asparagine using the enzyme L-asparaginase would negatively influence growth in LSMMG. When S. marcescens was grown in LSMMG with asparaginase, growth was significantly lower than the LSMMG without asparaginase at hours 18 (P = 0.034), 21 (P = 0.0004), and 24 (P = 0.0008) of growth (Figure 2B). For the RWV-Control sample, asparaginase reduced growth only at hour 15 (P = 0.031), but not at any other timepoints. The LSMMG + asparaginase growth was significantly lower than the RWV-Control at hour 18 (P = 0.0296) but was not significantly different from the control at any other time point (Figure 2B). These results provide evidence that L-asparaginase reduces the growth of S. marcescens in the LSMMG condition compared to the control, but does not significantly impact growth in the control samples, suggesting that the growth-suppressive effect of L-asparaginase is LSMMG-specific. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Exogenously added L-asparaginase can inhibit growth of LSMMG-treated bacteria and reduce host-lethality. A) The breakdown of asparagine catalyzed by the asparaginase enzyme. B) The starting concentration of 1 × 108 CFU of S. marcescens was placed in a 10 mL rotating wall vessel at 37 °C in LB media. One hundred microliters of L-asparaginase was added to the growth media, and growth of bacteria estimated by absorbance at 600 nm was measured every 3 h. L-asparaginase addition in vitro reduces the rate of growth most significantly in the LSMMG samples. Error bars represent one standard error. C and D) Bacteria were grown in RWV with LB media only. After 24 h of growth, bacteria were fixed in 20% glycerol for injections. Flies were injected with S. marcescens. One hour after infection, flies were then injected with a treatment of L-asparaginase, or sterile water (no treatment). The LSMMG bacteria kills flies at a lower rate when L-asparaginase is injected in vivo (C) and similarly in vivo injected L-asparaginase does not impact survival of the RWV-Control (D). (The statistical results for the comparisons shown in Figures 2C and 2D are included in Table 1.) 2.3. Injection of LSMMG S. marcescens with in vivo L-asparaginase treatment reduces lethality in the D. melanogaster host Next, since the synthesis of asparagine by S. marcescens was closely linked with LSMMG treatment, we investigated whether L-asparaginase could mitigate increased virulence of LSMMG-reared pathogens after injection into a host as measured by host mortality. To do this, LSMMG or RWV-Control-treated S. marcescens were injected into D. melanogaster hosts, and the infected hosts were then injected again with L-asparaginase 1 h after bacterial infection. There was no difference in overall fly survival between the LSMMG and the LSMMG + asparaginase treatment in the early part of the survival curve indicating that there was no harmful effect from asparaginase injections of the host (Figure 2C, P = 0.0976). However, when the survival curve was analyzed for the latter half of the experiment (12–24 h) when the majority of the host death typically occurs from an S. marcescens infection, then there was a significant difference in survival with and without asparaginase treatment. We demonstrated that the LSMMG-injected flies died faster than the LSMMG with asparaginase treatment (Figure 2C, Risk Ratio = 2.92, P = 0.0197). There was no difference between the RWV-Control with water or with asparaginase (Figure 2D, Risk Ratio = 1.33, P = 0.348). For the complete result of this statistical analysis, please see Table 1. These results indicate that the addition of exogenous asparaginase into the host, during infection with S. marcescens, can inhibit the increased S. marcescens virulence that is associated with reduced gravity treatment of the microbe (Figure 2C). L-asparaginase does not prevent host death and does not affect the time-course of host lethality in the RWV-Control bacteria (Figure 2D), but it does target the gravity-specific increase in host lethality by S. marcescens that we have shown in our previous study [11]. Table 1. Results of the proportional hazards survival model for the asparaginase treatment injections (Figure 2). ‘Ratio’ refers to the ratio of the hazard rates corresponding to the conditions described by Level 1 and Level 2, respectively. This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2. Hours 1–24 refers to the full analysis of all 24 data points for the survival experiment, 24 h total. Hours 12–24 refers to the final 12 h of the experiment, which is when the majority of the death in the survival analysis occurs. This distinction is made due to the effects of the treatment being applied in this experiment, which has the strongest effect during this time period.

Both aspartate and glutamine supplementation in combination are required in minimal media to recapitulate the asparagine pathway gene expression changes seen in rich media Next, we examined the effect of specific amino acids that are substrates in the asparagine synthesis pathway, on bacterial growth kinetics and gene expression. To do this, we grew S. marcescens in a minimal media supplemented with glutamine, aspartate, or both amino acids together, in LSMMG and in the RWV-Control. For all amino acid growth measures, there was no significant difference between the LSMMG and RWV-Control S. marcescens, except for the aspartate-supplemented sample at 24 h (Figure 3D, F = 1.76, P = 0.0023). This suggests that aspartate in isolation is sufficient to stimulate the LSMMG-specific increase in growth. Figure 3.

Starting concentration of 1 × 108 CFU of S. marcescens was placed in a 10 mL rotating wall vessel at 37 °C, containing A) Davis minimal media only, B) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate and 10 mM glutamine, C) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM glutamine, and D) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate. Growth was measured every 24 h for 72 h. E) At the end of growth period, gene expression for each sample was measured via qPCR:: L-ap (L-asparaginase), L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), asnB (asparagine synthetase B), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). Expression values are reported as fold change in LSMMG relative to the Davis minimal media values and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Even though aspartate addition increases growth in LSMMG cultures but asnB and L-ap genes are overexpressed in LSMMG compared to control only when both glutamine and aspartate are present.However, when we looked at how these growth conditions influenced gene expression, the expression level of 38.95 relative to the RWV-control was significantly higher for the gene asnB (asparagine synthetase B) in the combined glutamine and aspartate supplemented media but not in the media with either glutamine or aspartate alone (Figure 3E, P < 0.0001). Similarly, the gene L-ap (L-asparaginase) with a relative expression value of 21.45 was significantly higher in the combined media than in the glutamine or aspartate media alone (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference across media conditions for the other genes tested: L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). This suggests that while aspartate alone can increase the growth of S. marcescens in LSMMG in minimal media, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are necessary to induce the LSMMG-specific overexpression of asnB at a similar level to the nutrient-rich media (Figure 1B and Figure 3E). 2.5. Maximal host mortality rates of D. melanogaster are seen only when minimal media is supplemented with aspartate and glutamine, substrates of asparagine synthesis Given the significantly increased expression of asnB in LSMMG-grown bacteria in minimal media supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine, it was important to test whether bacteria grown in this way would also increase its virulence in the D. melanogaster host. In the minimal media supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine, flies injected with the bacteria grown in LSMMG died faster than those injected with bacteria grown in the RWV-Control (Ratio = 2.46, P = 0.0021, Figure 4A). Similarly, the media with aspartate supplementation showed an increase in the rate of fly death after injection with the LSMMG-grown bacteria compared to the control (Ratio = 2.26, P = 0.007, Figure 4B). For the LSMMG-grown bacteria, there was a greater rate of fly death from the bacteria grown in aspartate and glutamine media compared to the bacteria grown in aspartate alone (Ratio = 1.98, P = 0.0221, Figure 4A,B). There is no significant difference in mortality rates between the flies injected with bacteria reared in LSMMG with a media composition composed of just the Davis minimal media (P = 0.46) or in the minimal media with just glutamine added (P = 0.55, Figure 4C). The full results of these comparisons can be seen in Table 2. This indicates that while either aspartate alone or both aspartate and glutamine together, can cause an increase in bacterial growth rate in vitro, only the combination of the two amino acids together can cause the LSMMG-specific induction of asnB expression and also causes the maximum increase in LSMMG-dependent virulence of the bacteria in terms of mortality of the fly host (Figures 3 and 4). In other words, the increased growth rate in the LSMMG is not a complete determinant for the increased virulence of S. marcescens, but that a change in the metabolism of nutrients like asparagine plays a critical role in the heightened mortality induced by gravity-treated bacteria on a host. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Infection of flies with S. marcescens shows maximum host mortality with LSMMG bacteria when supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine. Sample was grown in A) Davis minimal media (DMM) either alone or with 10 mM aspartate and 10 mM glutamine, B) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate, C) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM glutamine. Bacteria were grown for 24 h in the RWV, then fixed in 20% glycerol for injections into D. melanogaster hosts. Both glutamine and aspartate must be present together to elicit the maximum LSMMG-induced increase in host mortality as shown in Figure 4A.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion In this study, we provide evidence for the importance of nutrient utilization during bacterial growth as a factor for increased host mortality after pathogen growth in LSMMG. Host mortality is a direct measure of pathogen virulence, and therefore an increased rate of host death is one indication of increased virulence of a pathogen [40]. While there are studies showing an increase in virulence of pathogens after exposure to spaceflight and simulated microgravity, the specific mechanisms that underlie these changes are largely unknown. In our previous study [11], we found that S. marcescens in spaceflight and in LSMMG show an increase in virulence via increased rate of host mortality, and that the in vivo growth of the pathogen after infection of the host is higher from both spaceflight and LSMMG treated bacteria. While in vivo growth is only an indirect proxy for virulence, faster pathogen growth immediately following infection is often linked to the ability of the pathogen to overcome host immunity and sustain infection [41, 42]. Therefore it was necessary for us to examine in more detail the specific potential mechanisms for increased virulence of S. marcescens in LSMMG. First we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control (Table 3). We therefore looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms, and found that genes related to amino acid metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG (Figure 1B). We found that several genes within the asparagine synthesis pathway were overexpressed in LSMMG, but specifically saw the largest overexpression, an almost 40-fold increase, in the asparagine synthetase B (asnB gene). Asparagine synthetase B is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine using aspartate, and glutamine as a nitrogen source [43, 44]. The deletion of the asnB gene leads to a slow-growth phenotype in the pathogen Bacillus subtilis, and in most pathogens (including S. marcescens) is the main gene involved in asparagine biosynthesis [45]. This gene has not been implicated previously in S. marcescens virulence, but has been shown to mediate virulence and resistance to drugs in other bacterial pathogens [36, 37]. While this gene and others in amino acid uptake pathways are important for growth and division of the cell, they are also important mediators of host-pathogen interactions [38]. While the host utilizes amino acid metabolism to support defense responses against a pathogen, conversely, the pathogen can modulate amino acid metabolism for its own advantage [38]. Therefore, amino acid utilization and assimilation mechanisms can be important mediators of infection at the host-pathogen interface, and asparagine metabolism has been linked to virulence and resistance of some pathogens to antibiotics [36, 37, 38]. In this study we characterize the underlying indicators for the increased host mortality that we previously reported after infection with microgravity-treated S. marcescens [11]. We show that S. marcescens grown in LSMMG consume key amino acids glutamine and asparagine at a faster rate than the control (Figure 1C, D), suggesting that the LSMMG might be priming these pathogens to compete with responding host immune cells for extracellular amino acids necessary for proliferation. In fact, this is the method by which some pathogens are successful colonizers of their hosts. The virulence of pathogen Francisella tularensis is dependent on the pathogen's ability to replicate inside the host and escape from macrophages [46]. Asparagine acquisition is critical in this pathogen's success in replicating inside the host cell, where they use the host as a substrate for asparagine and aspartate necessary to replicate [46]. Similarly, S. marcescens has been shown to have the ability to survive and proliferate inside non-phagocytic host cells, suggesting that there may be a similar mechanism of host-pathogen competition for amino acids [47]. We see in our study that growth in LSMMG increases the expression of asnB (Figure 1B), implying an increased consumption of aspartate and glutamine to synthesize asparagine more efficiently, that may allow these pathogens to out-compete host immune cells for amino acids during infection. The presence of both aspartate and glutamine causes a significant overexpression of asnB, even when they are the only amino acids present in minimal media (Figure 3E). This suggests that these two amino acid substrates, which are both required for asparagine synthesis, are important for LSMMG-induced overexpression of asnB. Therefore, we believe that the LSMMG-induced increase in pathogen virulence may be mediated by the ability of S. marcescens to utilize asparagine more efficiently within the host after infection, although further studies are needed to evaluate how S. marcescens reared in LSMMG are specifically interacting with the host's immune cells. We also found evidence that there is an overexpression of some L-asparaginase subunits, including L-asparaginase (Figure 3E and Figure 1B) when asnB is overexpressed in the presence of its substrates, aspartate and glutamine. The homeostatic maintenance of the asparagine pathway consists of the anabolic and catabolic processes catalyzed by asnB and L-ap respectively which could result in the upregulation of both enzymes with increased asparagine metabolism. In Salmonella typhimurium infections, it has been shown that L-asparaginase suppresses T-cell responses by suppressing T-cell blastogenesis, proliferation, and cytokine production in the host, and that this effect could be attenuated by treatment with L-asparagine [48]. This highlights the fact that asparagine can be a key amino acid both for mammalian immune responses to bacterial pathogens, and is also important for bacterial growth and virulence properties. In this study, we provide evidence that the asparagine pathway is a critical determinant of the LSMMG-dependent increase in host mortality induced by S. marcescens. While aspartate alone can increase in vitro growth of S. marcescens in an LSMMG-specific manner (Figure 3D), the combination of both aspartate and glutamine (substrates for asparagine synthesis) are required to cause the maximal increase in host lethality during the infection of D.melanogaster with LSMMG treated bacteria (Figure 4A). Similarly, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are required to elicit the full induction of asnB gene expression which is not seen with aspartate or glutamine addition alone (Figure 3E). Interestingly, these results indicate that increased division rate of the pathogen during the growth phase alone (Figure 3) is not sufficient to recapitulate the full extent of host mortality observed after infection with microgravity-treated S. marcescens (Figure 4). Therefore, the microgravity dependent increase in host mortality induced by S. marcescens, appears to be linked specifically with asparagine pathway function under LSMMG conditions, and cannot be fully accounted for simply by increasing bacterial growth rate with the addition of amino acid substrates. To further characterize the effect of the asparagine pathway, the direct suppression of the expression of asnB through controlled genetic mechanisms was not within the scope of this study. However, as mentioned above, we demonstrated that the attenuation of the asparagine pathway, via the absence of relevant amino acids from the growth media, suppresses the overexpression of asnB in LSMMG (Figure 3E) and correlates with increased host survival (Figure 4B,C). Additional studies that target asnB gene with a knockdown will be conducted in future. When we co-infect flies with both LSMMG-reared S. marcescens and exogenously-added purified L-asparaginase, we see a therapeutic effect, and the flies die at a significantly slower rate than the LSMMG-reared bacteria injected alone (Figure 2C). This is in line with our hypothesis that growth in LSMMG is priming S. marcescens with the ability to compete effectively with the host for asparagine utilization. The addition of L-asparaginase would break down extracellular asparagine, thereby diminishing the ability of the bacteria to out-compete the host's ability to utilize asparagine for its cellular processes. Consistent with this, L-asparaginase added to the growth medium causes suppression of S. marcescens growth, but only in LSMMG and not in the RWV-Control (Figure 2B). These results suggest that additional exogenous L-asparaginase has a detrimental effect on the pathogen itself and causes it to become less virulent in LSMMG, perhaps by reducing the amount of available asparagine that otherwise would have enhanced the LSMMG-treated microbe's ability to utilize this amino acid in the host's body. In growth media without the presence of exogenous L-asparaginase, the L-asparagine in the growth media is consumed at a significantly faster rate in LSMMG than in the RWV-Control (Figure 1C), and a similar effect is seen with the consumption of glutamine (Figure 1D). In some pathogens, mutants lacking the ability to synthesize glutamine or to acquire glutamine from the host, show attenuated virulence, since this is an important source of nitrogen assimilation during colonization of the pathogen in the host [49, 50]. These studies further support the idea that amino acids that are critical for several cellular processes, including protein synthesis, can also be important for pathogen virulence. To summarize the results of our study, we report that genes related to asparagine biosynthesis were overexpressed after exposing S. marcescens to LSMMG, and that the consumption rates of extracellular asparagine and glutamine in rich media were higher in LSMMG than in the control (Figure 1). In nutrient-limited media, these gene expression and virulence patterns can be recapitulated by supplying only the precursors for asparagine biosynthesis: glutamine and aspartate (Figures 3E and 4A). The addition of aspartate causes a LSMMG-specific increase in growth of S. marcescens but not a concomitant increase in asnB gene expression (Figure 3D,E). Therefore, LSMMG-specific increase in expression of the asnB gene is only seen in media that contains both aspartate and glutamine, the precursors for asparagine synthesis (Figure 3E). Consistent with this, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine in the media during growth is also necessary for the greatest increase in host mortality in LSMMG compared to the control (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the coinjection of exogenous asparaginase during the infection of fly hosts with LSMMG-reared S. marcescens, results in a therapeutic effect and the flies die more slowly than with injections of the LSMMG-treated bacteria alone (Figure 2C). The results of this study provide compelling evidence for the involvement of the asparagine pathway in increasing S. marcescens' effectiveness to kill its host in a microgravity-specific manner. This study provides a novel mechanism by which microgravity might be affecting S. marcescens virulence via modified nutrient utilization capabilities. Importantly, we found that L-asparaginase could be used as a potential therapeutic agent during infections with bacteria in LSMMG. An interesting sequelae to this study would be to test the L-asparaginase as a countermeasure where both the host and the pathogen are exposed to microgravity during spaceflight. This study also furthers our need for understanding how LSMMG may be a unique stressor on bacterial pathogens, and emphasizes the importance of the use of ground-based models in informing spaceflight research. 3.1. Limitations of the study While this work provides evidence that LSMMG is priming the pathogen to out-compete the host immune system by the efficient utilization of amino acids such as asparagine, we have not yet evaluated the metabolomics of the host-pathogen interface after infection. That data will be collected in a subsequent study as a follow-on to this body of work where we have identified a novel mechanistic pathway that correlates Serratia marcescens virulence induced by reduced gravity environments. We were also constrained to using qPCR as the method for analyzing gene expression in this study, although RNA-seq could provide a more global assessment of gene expression changes. However, we have RNA-seq analyses ongoing for S. marcescens samples from a recent spaceflight mission. We anticipate that RNA-seq data will provide additional data to query the LSMMG-treated bacterial samples for additional genetic pathways that may be involved, since both spaceflight and LSMMG treatment results in increased growth and host mortality induced by S. marcescens. Lastly, while D. melanogaster is an excellent model for characterizing host-pathogen interactions, a future goal would be to conduct complementary studies in mammalian models in preparation for testing countermeasures like asparaginase for future spaceflight experiments. 3.2.

Copyright notice ID: 9111996 PMID: 35592661 Abstract While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens. Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy.

Introduction Human pathogens occupy a wide variety of ecological niches, including those in the harsh conditions imposed by spaceflight. Understanding the effects that spaceflight may have on the adaptation and fitness of human pathogens is necessary to predict potential causes of health problems during future missions, where the availability of treatment and prevention options is limited. This is even more important in the context of opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which typically produce benign infections, until they are challenged by certain environmental conditions or when host immune impairments occur, which can then equip them with the ability to cause serious health concerns [1]. One such environmental condition is spaceflight, which has been demonstrated to convert opportunistic pathogens to primary pathogens, enabling them to take advantage of a compromised immune system that may occur to astronauts during spaceflight [2, 3]. In line with this, there is mounting evidence that primary bacterial pathogens often undergo a diversity of significant phenotypic shifts during spaceflight, including increased antibiotic resistance [4, 5, 6, 7], increased virulence [8, 9, 10, 11], and morphological changes associated with pathogenicity [12]. Despite mounting research in these primary pathogens, much less is known about phenotypic shifts that occur to opportunistic pathogens when exposed to microgravity. Specifically, there is little known about how pathogens may be utilizing nutrients differently in the microgravity environment of space compared to ground microbes, and potentially how these mechanistic changes might be influencing the host immune response during infection. Due to increased nosocomial reports, the human opportunistic bacteria, Serratia marcescens, has emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance [13, 14]. S. marcescens is a ubiquitous pathogen that occupies a wide variety of habitats and hosts. It can adapt quickly to antibiotics independently and simultaneously, which is likely due to the loss of conserved genetic elements and large genomic diversity among strains [14, 15, 16]. Furthermore, S. marcescens was found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station [17, 18]. Therefore, this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts that are more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens and especially considering the complications with antibiotic resistance [2, 18]. Research in our laboratory has demonstrated that there is a significant shift in virulence with S. marcescens (Db11) after spaceflight. When cultured aboard the International Space Station, S. marcescens Db11 killed healthy ground-reared Drosophila melanogaster hosts significantly faster than an identical control of the bacteria that was cultured on the ground [11]. However, the specific mechanisms of increased Db11 virulence and reduced D. melanogaster survival are currently unknown. In line with this, increased virulence is observed with various space and low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG)-isolated bacteria, including studies with Salmonella [19], and Staphylococcus aureus [20], which pose a threat to astronaut health during spaceflight. Our prior research has shown that Serratia marcescens also shows a significant increase in host lethality of D. melanogaster after growth in simulated microgravity (LSMMG) conditions [11]. Since spaceflight studies are costly and can be difficult to perform due to constraints on experimental design and the availability of spaceflight opportunities, many researchers perform ground-based studies using devices such as the rotating wall vessel (RWV) to simulate microgravity [21, 22, 23]. The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles, thereby creating a low fluid shear environment that simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during spaceflight [24] and is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated such that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earth's gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g) without continuous suspension while acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the vessel itself. Although this method is not an exact recreation of the spaceflight environment, the effects of the LSMMG environment have been demonstrated to recapitulate findings from spaceflight studies [10, 11]. Drosophila melanogaster, as used in this study, has proven to be a useful host model for spaceflight and ground-based studies in the past. This is due to their well-characterized innate immune system, tractable genetics, ease of use, short life-cycle, genetic homology to mammalian systems, and low resource requirements for breeding large colonies [11, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. In the current study, we use LSMMG to investigate the specific mechanisms that enable microgravity-treated Serratia marcescens bacteria to kill the host D. melanogaster more quickly than control bacterial cultures. A screen of several genes related to known S. marcescens virulence factors did not reveal any differences of expression in LSMMG compared to RWV-Control. Further testing revealed a LSMMG-dependent overexpression of the gene asparagine synthetase B (asnB), which is implicated in virulence and resistance to drugs in other pathogenic bacteria [36, 37]. This gene is involved with amino acid metabolism and has been linked to both pathogen growth and virulence [38]. Amino acids like asparagine are thought to be important to the competition between hosts and pathogens in determining the outcome of an infection [38]. Since our previous study indicated that the LSMMG-reared S. marcescens killed the host faster after infection [11] than control S. marcescens cultures, we wanted to explore whether the asparagine pathway might be linked to the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG treatment. Here, we show that LSMMG treatment causes a change in the expression of key asparagine pathway related genes in S. marcescens with a concomitant increase in host mortality. Further, we find that these changes in key asparagine pathway genes and increased host mortality can be recapitulated in an LSMMG-specific manner by the addition of aspartate and glutamine (the substrates of asparagine synthesis) to minimal media. We also show that the addition of L-asparaginase, which catabolizes asparagine, can mitigate the LSMMG-induced increase in host virulence. Thus, this study allows us to understand the phenotypic shifts occurring in microbes exposed to altered gravity, and more specifically, how amino acid metabolism may affect the mortality rate of the host. In addition, these results will allow us to explore the asparagine pathway further and develop countermeasures that target amino acid biosynthesis in opportunistic pathogens such as S. marcescens, as an essential consideration to maintain host health during spaceflight.2. Results 2.1. The asparagine pathway and extracellular asparagine and glutamine concentrations are affected by simulated microgravity treatment of S. marcescens Our previous findings have indicated that S. marcescens exposed to LSMMG for 24 h grow at a faster rate inside the host after infection and caused increased host lethality in D.melanogaster [11]. First, we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control bacteria (Table 3). We, therefore, looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms and found that genes related to asparagine metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG. More specifically, we found that there was a significant upregulation in asnB (asparagine synthetase B), which is a gene that regulates the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine (Figure 1A,B). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of genes that are important for asparagine and glutamine metabolism. Gene expression analyses showed that the expression level of the gene asnB (asparagine synthetase B) was 39.17 fold higher in LSMMG-treated cells relative to the RWV-control (P < 0.0001), as well as a 10.5 fold increase in expression of L-asparaginase (L-ap, P = 0.054), but there was no significant difference in expression for the other genes tested, although several genes showed a positive trend for expression levels: L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase) (Figure 1D). asnB is a gene that catalyzes the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine, and is known to be linked to virulence and antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens [36, 37]. The L-asparaginase subunits assist with asparagine catabolism and nitrogen homeostasis [39], therefore, an overexpression of these genes suggests that there is an increase in asparagine catabolism as part of the overall homeostatic regulation of the asparagine pathway.

B) At the end of the growth period of S. marcescens in simulated microgravity (LSMMG orientation), gene expression for each sample was measured via qPCR: L-ap (L-asparaginase), L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), asnB (asparagine synthetase B), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). Expression values are reported as fold change relative to the RWV-Control orientation and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Specific genes represented by the blue end of the color spectrum indicated gene overexpression and those towards the red end indicated inhibition of gene expression. Error bars represent one standard error. Measurements of C) extracellular asparagine and D) extracellular glutamine were performed at hours 0, 6, and 14 of growth in the rotating wall vessel, with an initial starting concentration of 1 × 108 CFU.The observation that asnB expression is significantly increased, led us to hypothesize that there is an increased presence of asparagine in LSMMG that may contribute to the increase in pathogen growth rate, and therefore an increase in consumption of glutamine and aspartate in the media. To confirm this, we quantified the rates at which S. marcescens utilized extracellular glutamine and asparagine in the nutrient-rich LB media, in order to see whether the consumption rates of these amino acids matched the increased growth of the bacteria in LSMMG. For asparagine measurements (Figure 1C), there was no difference between the RWV-control and the LSMMG at 0 h (F = 4.348, P = 0.11) or at 14 h (F = 0.007, P = 0.939). At 6 h of growth, LSMMG had significantly lower extracellular asparagine than the RWV-Control (F = 1540.68, P < 0.0001). Similarly, extracellular glutamine (Figure 1D) was not significantly different at hours 0 (F = 2.251, P = 0.208) or 14 (F = 0.669, P = 0.459), but LSMMG had significantly lower glutamine at hour 6 (F = 282.056, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that the S. marcescens in LSMMG are consuming extracellular glutamine and asparagine more quickly during the active growth phase of the culture, which is consistent with the increase in growth that we see in LSMMG-reared bacteria in rich media [11]. Taken together, the almost 40-fold overexpression of the asnB gene in LSMMG coupled with the overexpression of the asparaginase subunits (Figure 1B), along with the increased consumption of asparagine (Figure 1C), indicated that the asparagine pathway was likely to play a significant role in the phenotypic changes observed in S. marcescens under reduced gravity LSMMG conditions.2.2. S. marcescens growth is affected by L-asparaginase treatment in vitro under simulated microgravity conditions Since we saw an increase in asparagine consumption with LSMMG treatment, we studied whether the depletion of exogenous L-asparagine using the enzyme L-asparaginase would negatively influence growth in LSMMG. When S. marcescens was grown in LSMMG with asparaginase, growth was significantly lower than the LSMMG without asparaginase at hours 18 (P = 0.034), 21 (P = 0.0004), and 24 (P = 0.0008) of growth (Figure 2B). For the RWV-Control sample, asparaginase reduced growth only at hour 15 (P = 0.031), but not at any other timepoints. The LSMMG + asparaginase growth was significantly lower than the RWV-Control at hour 18 (P = 0.0296) but was not significantly different from the control at any other time point (Figure 2B). These results provide evidence that L-asparaginase reduces the growth of S. marcescens in the LSMMG condition compared to the control, but does not significantly impact growth in the control samples, suggesting that the growth-suppressive effect of L-asparaginase is LSMMG-specific. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Exogenously added L-asparaginase can inhibit growth of LSMMG-treated bacteria and reduce host-lethality. A) The breakdown of asparagine catalyzed by the asparaginase enzyme. B) The starting concentration of 1 × 108 CFU of S. marcescens was placed in a 10 mL rotating wall vessel at 37 °C in LB media. One hundred microliters of L-asparaginase was added to the growth media, and growth of bacteria estimated by absorbance at 600 nm was measured every 3 h. L-asparaginase addition in vitro reduces the rate of growth most significantly in the LSMMG samples. Error bars represent one standard error. C and D) Bacteria were grown in RWV with LB media only. After 24 h of growth, bacteria were fixed in 20% glycerol for injections. Flies were injected with S. marcescens. One hour after infection, flies were then injected with a treatment of L-asparaginase, or sterile water (no treatment). The LSMMG bacteria kills flies at a lower rate when L-asparaginase is injected in vivo (C) and similarly in vivo injected L-asparaginase does not impact survival of the RWV-Control (D). (The statistical results for the comparisons shown in Figures 2C and 2D are included in Table 1.)2.3. Injection of LSMMG S. marcescens with in vivo L-asparaginase treatment reduces lethality in the D. melanogaster host Next, since the synthesis of asparagine by S. marcescens was closely linked with LSMMG treatment, we investigated whether L-asparaginase could mitigate increased virulence of LSMMG-reared pathogens after injection into a host as measured by host mortality. To do this, LSMMG or RWV-Control-treated S. marcescens were injected into D. melanogaster hosts, and the infected hosts were then injected again with L-asparaginase 1 h after bacterial infection. There was no difference in overall fly survival between the LSMMG and the LSMMG + asparaginase treatment in the early part of the survival curve indicating that there was no harmful effect from asparaginase injections of the host (Figure 2C, P = 0.0976). However, when the survival curve was analyzed for the latter half of the experiment (12–24 h) when the majority of the host death typically occurs from an S. marcescens infection, then there was a significant difference in survival with and without asparaginase treatment. We demonstrated that the LSMMG-injected flies died faster than the LSMMG with asparaginase treatment (Figure 2C, Risk Ratio = 2.92, P = 0.0197). There was no difference between the RWV-Control with water or with asparaginase (Figure 2D, Risk Ratio = 1.33, P = 0.348). For the complete result of this statistical analysis, please see Table 1. These results indicate that the addition of exogenous asparaginase into the host, during infection with S. marcescens, can inhibit the increased S. marcescens virulence that is associated with reduced gravity treatment of the microbe (Figure 2C). L-asparaginase does not prevent host death and does not affect the time-course of host lethality in the RWV-Control bacteria (Figure 2D), but it does target the gravity-specific increase in host lethality by S. marcescens that we have shown in our previous study [11].

Both aspartate and glutamine supplementation in combination are required in minimal media to recapitulate the asparagine pathway gene expression changes seen in rich media Next, we examined the effect of specific amino acids that are substrates in the asparagine synthesis pathway, on bacterial growth kinetics and gene expression. To do this, we grew S. marcescens in a minimal media supplemented with glutamine, aspartate, or both amino acids together, in LSMMG and in the RWV-Control. For all amino acid growth measures, there was no significant difference between the LSMMG and RWV-Control S. marcescens, except for the aspartate-supplemented sample at 24 h (Figure 3D, F = 1.76, P = 0.0023). This suggests that aspartate in isolation is sufficient to stimulate the LSMMG-specific increase in growth. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Growth and gene expression changes of LSMMG-treated S. marcescens in Davis minimal media supplemented with amino acids. Starting concentration of 1 × 108 CFU of S. marcescens was placed in a 10 mL rotating wall vessel at 37 °C, containing A) Davis minimal media only, B) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate and 10 mM glutamine, C) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM glutamine, and D) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate. Growth was measured every 24 h for 72 h. E) At the end of growth period, gene expression for each sample was measured via qPCR:: L-ap (L-asparaginase), L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), asnB (asparagine synthetase B), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). Expression values are reported as fold change in LSMMG relative to the Davis minimal media values and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Even though aspartate addition increases growth in LSMMG cultures but asnB and L-ap genes are overexpressed in LSMMG compared to control only when both glutamine and aspartate are present.However, when we looked at how these growth conditions influenced gene expression, the expression level of 38.95 relative to the RWV-control was significantly higher for the gene asnB (asparagine synthetase B) in the combined glutamine and aspartate supplemented media but not in the media with either glutamine or aspartate alone (Figure 3E, P < 0.0001). Similarly, the gene L-ap (L-asparaginase) with a relative expression value of 21.45 was significantly higher in the combined media than in the glutamine or aspartate media alone (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference across media conditions for the other genes tested: L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). This suggests that while aspartate alone can increase the growth of S. marcescens in LSMMG in minimal media, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are necessary to induce the LSMMG-specific overexpression of asnB at a similar level to the nutrient-rich media (Figure 1B and Figure 3E).2.5. Maximal host mortality rates of D. melanogaster are seen only when minimal media is supplemented with aspartate and glutamine, substrates of asparagine synthesis Given the significantly increased expression of asnB in LSMMG-grown bacteria in minimal media supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine, it was important to test whether bacteria grown in this way would also increase its virulence in the D. melanogaster host. In the minimal media supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine, flies injected with the bacteria grown in LSMMG died faster than those injected with bacteria grown in the RWV-Control (Ratio = 2.46, P = 0.0021, Figure 4A). Similarly, the media with aspartate supplementation showed an increase in the rate of fly death after injection with the LSMMG-grown bacteria compared to the control (Ratio = 2.26, P = 0.007, Figure 4B). For the LSMMG-grown bacteria, there was a greater rate of fly death from the bacteria grown in aspartate and glutamine media compared to the bacteria grown in aspartate alone (Ratio = 1.98, P = 0.0221, Figure 4A,B). There is no significant difference in mortality rates between the flies injected with bacteria reared in LSMMG with a media composition composed of just the Davis minimal media (P = 0.46) or in the minimal media with just glutamine added (P = 0.55, Figure 4C). The full results of these comparisons can be seen in Table 2. This indicates that while either aspartate alone or both aspartate and glutamine together, can cause an increase in bacterial growth rate in vitro, only the combination of the two amino acids together can cause the LSMMG-specific induction of asnB expression and also causes the maximum increase in LSMMG-dependent virulence of the bacteria in terms of mortality of the fly host (Figures 3 and 4). In other words, the increased growth rate in the LSMMG is not a complete determinant for the increased virulence of S. marcescens, but that a change in the metabolism of nutrients like asparagine plays a critical role in the heightened mortality induced by gravity-treated bacteria on a host. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Infection of flies with S. marcescens shows maximum host mortality with LSMMG bacteria when supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine. Sample was grown in A) Davis minimal media (DMM) either alone or with 10 mM aspartate and 10 mM glutamine, B) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate, C) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM glutamine. Bacteria were grown for 24 h in the RWV, then fixed in 20% glycerol for injections into D. melanogaster hosts. Both glutamine and aspartate must be present together to elicit the maximum LSMMG-induced increase in host mortality as shown in Figure 4A.

Discussion In this study, we provide evidence for the importance of nutrient utilization during bacterial growth as a factor for increased host mortality after pathogen growth in LSMMG. Host mortality is a direct measure of pathogen virulence, and therefore an increased rate of host death is one indication of increased virulence of a pathogen [40]. While there are studies showing an increase in virulence of pathogens after exposure to spaceflight and simulated microgravity, the specific mechanisms that underlie these changes are largely unknown. In our previous study [11], we found that S. marcescens in spaceflight and in LSMMG show an increase in virulence via increased rate of host mortality, and that the in vivo growth of the pathogen after infection of the host is higher from both spaceflight and LSMMG treated bacteria. While in vivo growth is only an indirect proxy for virulence, faster pathogen growth immediately following infection is often linked to the ability of the pathogen to overcome host immunity and sustain infection [41, 42]. Therefore it was necessary for us to examine in more detail the specific potential mechanisms for increased virulence of S. marcescens in LSMMG. First we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control (Table 3). We therefore looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms, and found that genes related to amino acid metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG (Figure 1B). We found that several genes within the asparagine synthesis pathway were overexpressed in LSMMG, but specifically saw the largest overexpression, an almost 40-fold increase, in the asparagine synthetase B (asnB gene). Asparagine synthetase B is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine using aspartate, and glutamine as a nitrogen source [43, 44]. The deletion of the asnB gene leads to a slow-growth phenotype in the pathogen Bacillus subtilis, and in most pathogens (including S. marcescens) is the main gene involved in asparagine biosynthesis [45]. This gene has not been implicated previously in S. marcescens virulence, but has been shown to mediate virulence and resistance to drugs in other bacterial pathogens [36, 37]. While this gene and others in amino acid uptake pathways are important for growth and division of the cell, they are also important mediators of host-pathogen interactions [38]. While the host utilizes amino acid metabolism to support defense responses against a pathogen, conversely, the pathogen can modulate amino acid metabolism for its own advantage [38]. Therefore, amino acid utilization and assimilation mechanisms can be important mediators of infection at the host-pathogen interface, and asparagine metabolism has been linked to virulence and resistance of some pathogens to antibiotics [36, 37, 38]. In this study we characterize the underlying indicators for the increased host mortality that we previously reported after infection with microgravity-treated S. marcescens [11]. We show that S. marcescens grown in LSMMG consume key amino acids glutamine and asparagine at a faster rate than the control (Figure 1C, D), suggesting that the LSMMG might be priming these pathogens to compete with responding host immune cells for extracellular amino acids necessary for proliferation. In fact, this is the method by which some pathogens are successful colonizers of their hosts. The virulence of pathogen Francisella tularensis is dependent on the pathogen's ability to replicate inside the host and escape from macrophages [46]. Asparagine acquisition is critical in this pathogen's success in replicating inside the host cell, where they use the host as a substrate for asparagine and aspartate necessary to replicate [46]. Similarly, S. marcescens has been shown to have the ability to survive and proliferate inside non-phagocytic host cells, suggesting that there may be a similar mechanism of host-pathogen competition for amino acids [47]. We see in our study that growth in LSMMG increases the expression of asnB (Figure 1B), implying an increased consumption of aspartate and glutamine to synthesize asparagine more efficiently, that may allow these pathogens to out-compete host immune cells for amino acids during infection. The presence of both aspartate and glutamine causes a significant overexpression of asnB, even when they are the only amino acids present in minimal media (Figure 3E). This suggests that these two amino acid substrates, which are both required for asparagine synthesis, are important for LSMMG-induced overexpression of asnB. Therefore, we believe that the LSMMG-induced increase in pathogen virulence may be mediated by the ability of S. marcescens to utilize asparagine more efficiently within the host after infection, although further studies are needed to evaluate how S. marcescens reared in LSMMG are specifically interacting with the host's immune cells. We also found evidence that there is an overexpression of some L-asparaginase subunits, including L-asparaginase (Figure 3E and Figure 1B) when asnB is overexpressed in the presence of its substrates, aspartate and glutamine. The homeostatic maintenance of the asparagine pathway consists of the anabolic and catabolic processes catalyzed by asnB and L-ap respectively which could result in the upregulation of both enzymes with increased asparagine metabolism. In Salmonella typhimurium infections, it has been shown that L-asparaginase suppresses T-cell responses by suppressing T-cell blastogenesis, proliferation, and cytokine production in the host, and that this effect could be attenuated by treatment with L-asparagine [48]. This highlights the fact that asparagine can be a key amino acid both for mammalian immune responses to bacterial pathogens, and is also important for bacterial growth and virulence properties. In this study, we provide evidence that the asparagine pathway is a critical determinant of the LSMMG-dependent increase in host mortality induced by S. marcescens. While aspartate alone can increase in vitro growth of S. marcescens in an LSMMG-specific manner (Figure 3D), the combination of both aspartate and glutamine (substrates for asparagine synthesis) are required to cause the maximal increase in host lethality during the infection of D.melanogaster with LSMMG treated bacteria (Figure 4A). Similarly, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are required to elicit the full induction of asnB gene expression which is not seen with aspartate or glutamine addition alone (Figure 3E). Interestingly, these results indicate that increased division rate of the pathogen during the growth phase alone (Figure 3) is not sufficient to recapitulate the full extent of host mortality observed after infection with microgravity-treated S. marcescens (Figure 4). Therefore, the microgravity dependent increase in host mortality induced by S. marcescens, appears to be linked specifically with asparagine pathway function under LSMMG conditions, and cannot be fully accounted for simply by increasing bacterial growth rate with the addition of amino acid substrates. To further characterize the effect of the asparagine pathway, the direct suppression of the expression of asnB through controlled genetic mechanisms was not within the scope of this study. However, as mentioned above, we demonstrated that the attenuation of the asparagine pathway, via the absence of relevant amino acids from the growth media, suppresses the overexpression of asnB in LSMMG (Figure 3E) and correlates with increased host survival (Figure 4B,C). Additional studies that target asnB gene with a knockdown will be conducted in future. When we co-infect flies with both LSMMG-reared S. marcescens and exogenously-added purified L-asparaginase, we see a therapeutic effect, and the flies die at a significantly slower rate than the LSMMG-reared bacteria injected alone (Figure 2C). This is in line with our hypothesis that growth in LSMMG is priming S. marcescens with the ability to compete effectively with the host for asparagine utilization. The addition of L-asparaginase would break down extracellular asparagine, thereby diminishing the ability of the bacteria to out-compete the host's ability to utilize asparagine for its cellular processes. Consistent with this, L-asparaginase added to the growth medium causes suppression of S. marcescens growth, but only in LSMMG and not in the RWV-Control (Figure 2B). These results suggest that additional exogenous L-asparaginase has a detrimental effect on the pathogen itself and causes it to become less virulent in LSMMG, perhaps by reducing the amount of available asparagine that otherwise would have enhanced the LSMMG-treated microbe's ability to utilize this amino acid in the host's body. In growth media without the presence of exogenous L-asparaginase, the L-asparagine in the growth media is consumed at a significantly faster rate in LSMMG than in the RWV-Control (Figure 1C), and a similar effect is seen with the consumption of glutamine (Figure 1D). In some pathogens, mutants lacking the ability to synthesize glutamine or to acquire glutamine from the host, show attenuated virulence, since this is an important source of nitrogen assimilation during colonization of the pathogen in the host [49, 50]. These studies further support the idea that amino acids that are critical for several cellular processes, including protein synthesis, can also be important for pathogen virulence. To summarize the results of our study, we report that genes related to asparagine biosynthesis were overexpressed after exposing S. marcescens to LSMMG, and that the consumption rates of extracellular asparagine and glutamine in rich media were higher in LSMMG than in the control (Figure 1). In nutrient-limited media, these gene expression and virulence patterns can be recapitulated by supplying only the precursors for asparagine biosynthesis: glutamine and aspartate (Figures 3E and 4A). The addition of aspartate causes a LSMMG-specific increase in growth of S. marcescens but not a concomitant increase in asnB gene expression (Figure 3D,E). Therefore, LSMMG-specific increase in expression of the asnB gene is only seen in media that contains both aspartate and glutamine, the precursors for asparagine synthesis (Figure 3E). Consistent with this, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine in the media during growth is also necessary for the greatest increase in host mortality in LSMMG compared to the control (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the coinjection of exogenous asparaginase during the infection of fly hosts with LSMMG-reared S. marcescens, results in a therapeutic effect and the flies die more slowly than with injections of the LSMMG-treated bacteria alone (Figure 2C). The results of this study provide compelling evidence for the involvement of the asparagine pathway in increasing S. marcescens' effectiveness to kill its host in a microgravity-specific manner. This study provides a novel mechanism by which microgravity might be affecting S. marcescens virulence via modified nutrient utilization capabilities. Importantly, we found that L-asparaginase could be used as a potential therapeutic agent during infections with bacteria in LSMMG. An interesting sequelae to this study would be to test the L-asparaginase as a countermeasure where both the host and the pathogen are exposed to microgravity during spaceflight. This study also furthers our need for understanding how LSMMG may be a unique stressor on bacterial pathogens, and emphasizes the importance of the use of ground-based models in informing spaceflight research. 3.1. Limitations of the study While this work provides evidence that LSMMG is priming the pathogen to out-compete the host immune system by the efficient utilization of amino acids such as asparagine, we have not yet evaluated the metabolomics of the host-pathogen interface after infection. That data will be collected in a subsequent study as a follow-on to this body of work where we have identified a novel mechanistic pathway that correlates Serratia marcescens virulence induced by reduced gravity environments. We were also constrained to using qPCR as the method for analyzing gene expression in this study, although RNA-seq could provide a more global assessment of gene expression changes. However, we have RNA-seq analyses ongoing for S. marcescens samples from a recent spaceflight mission. We anticipate that RNA-seq data will provide additional data to query the LSMMG-treated bacterial samples for additional genetic pathways that may be involved, since both spaceflight and LSMMG treatment results in increased growth and host mortality induced by S. marcescens. Lastly, while D. melanogaster is an excellent model for characterizing host-pathogen interactions, a future goal would be to conduct complementary studies in mammalian models in preparation for testing countermeasures like asparaginase for future spaceflight experiments.3.2. Resource availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on request.4. Methods 4.1. D. melanogaster fly strains Fly lines were maintained in a 12-hour light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (∼24 °C). Fly line used in this study was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, w1118 (#3605).4.2. Growth of S. marcescens Db11 in rotating wall vessel (RWV) S. marcescens Db11 were taken from stock cultures frozen at -80 °C in Copan Cryovials and were grown in sterile 50 mL conical tubes at 37 °C in liquid LB media containing 100 μg/mL streptomycin for 24 h. Liquid subcultures were then diluted down to A600 of 0.100 in LB media and loaded into a sterile 10 mL rotating wall vessel (Synthecon). The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles and simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during spaceflight [24] and this is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated with an axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the orientation of the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earth's gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g), thereby acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the container vessel itself [19]. Air bubbles were removed from the vessel and vessels were sealed. Pairs of RWV were then placed in either vertical (simulated microgravity) or horizontal (normal gravity, or RWV-Control) orientation at 37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al. [19]). Samples were grown for 24 h to ensure that stationary phase was reached.4.3. Asparagine and glutamine quantification At 6 and 14 h of growth, 200 μl of sample was taken from the RWV using a sterile 2 mL syringe, and the sample was used per manufacturer protocol to estimate abundances of L-asparagine and L-glutamine. The sample removed from the RWV was replaced with sterile PBS, and any air bubbles were removed before resuming rotation. The entire sample removal procedure took less than 5 min. For enzymatic tests, we used the L-Asparagine/L-Glutamine/Ammonia Assay Kit (Megazyme) following the manufacturer's recommendations and using asparagine or glutamine (final concentration 0.6 mM) as substrates. Enzymatic activities were measured by following the disappearance of the NADPH from the buffer along time as an indirect indication of asparagine deamination at 340 nm using a microplate reader (VERSAmax microplate reader, Molecular Devices). Experiments were performed in three independent replicates.4.4. Growth of S. marcescens with L-asparaginase Stocks of Db11 were prepared for growth in RWV as described above in either vertical (simulated microgravity with axis of rotation being perpendicular to the gravity vector) or horizontal (normal gravity RWV-control orientation with the axis of rotation being parallel to the gravity vector) orientations at 37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al. [19]). One hundred microliters of L-asparaginase (Millipore Sigma) suspended in sterile water was added to the growth media for half of the vessels, and the other half received only 100 μl of the sterile water. Growth of the bacteria was estimated by absorbance at 600 nm and was measured every 3 h. Samples were grown for 24 h total to ensure that stationary phase was reached. The sample removed from the RWV for quantification was replaced with sterile PBS, and any air bubbles were removed before resuming rotation. These experiments were run in three independent replicates.4.5. L-asparaginase treatment S. marcescens in the stationary phase were preserved at -80 °C in 10 mL of 20% glycerol. Concentrations of samples for injections were determined by performing colony counts of Serratia in different concentrations of PBS on LB plates. The PBS source without added bacteria was plated as a negative control for contamination. Based on these colony counts, samples were then diluted to 4 × 105 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections. For infections and survival, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting as described previously by our laboratory [11]. Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was approximately 10 CFU/fly. A total of 180 flies were injected, with 60 total flies assigned to each bacterial treatment group. Control bacteria, simulated microgravity-treated bacteria, or a glycerol sham were then injected into the 30 anesthetized 2-3 day-old males and 30 females (post-eclosion) D. melanogaster in the ventral abdomen near the seventh/eighth segment. One hour later, half of those flies (15 per sex) were injected with 32 nL L-asparaginase. After injections, flies were kept at 25 °C on the same standard dextrose food that they were reared on, and survival was monitored every hour for at least 24 h. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates.4.6. Growth in Davis minimal media supplemented with amino acids Bacteria were prepared using the protocol previously mentioned, but Davis Minimal Media supplemented with 10 mM of aspartate, glutamine, or a 50/50 mixture of aspartate and glutamine was used in place of LB broth. To quantify growth, 20 μl of sample diluted in 180 μl of PBS was read at an absorbance of A600 every 24 h for 72 h. To keep the volume of the RWV consistent, 20 μl of sterile PBS was placed in each vessel to make up for the volume lost during sampling. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates. S. marcescens in the stationary phase were preserved at -80 °C in 10 mL of 20% glycerol. Concentrations of samples for injections were determined by performing colony counts of Serratia in different concentrations of PBS on LB plates. The PBS source without added bacteria were plated as a negative control for contamination. Based on these colony counts, samples were then diluted to 4 × 105 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections. For infections and survival, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting as described previously by our laboratory [11]. Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was approximately 10 CFU/fly. A total of 30 flies (15 males and 15 females) were infected with each experimental sample, including 30 total flies injected with a glycerol sham. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates.4.7. Expression analysis of amino acid genes Samples were diluted to 1 × 108 cells and pelleted, and RNA was extracted from pelleted samples using the RNEasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). Relative gene expression levels were quantified using the 7500 Real Time PCR instrument from Applied Biosystems and SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed with Primer-Blast, . Real-time cycler conditions were; 95 °C for 15 min for initial activation step, and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for denaturation, annealing, and extension respectively. Data were normalized to the reference gene recA. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates, including RNA extraction from three independent growth trials and three qPCR runs of each sample (9 total plates). Additionally, each plate (replicate) contained 6 identical wells which were averaged to give a mean CT value of a given gene, ensuring that any pipetting errors were minimized in the data.4.8. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and JMP Pro 15 (SAS). Graphs were made in GraphPad Prism 7.0 and Excel (version 15.4). For survival analyses, a Cox Proportional Hazards model was used. The Cox Proportional Hazards model allows for the comparison of survival between all groups when there are multiple risk factors or treatments involved. The proportional hazards test generates a ‘risk ratio’ when comparing treatment curves, which can be interpreted in infection experiments as a rate of death. For example, a risk ratio of 2.0 means that one treatment kills the host twice as fast as the treatment it's being compared to. For all growth measurements, a one-way ANOVA was used in combination with a Tukey-Kramer posthoc analysis. For gene expression, expression values are reported as fold change relative to the Davis minimal media values, which were calculated in Excel using the ΔΔ Ct method. For all statistical analyses, only results with a statistical significance <0.05 are reported, due to the magnitude of results tables.Declarations Author contribution statement Rachel R Gilbert: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.

    "abstract": "Abstract A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade. Keywords: International Space Station (ISS), novel bacteria, Cohnella, space biology, pangenome analysis",
    "introduction": "Introduction The International Space Station (ISS) is an orbital space habitat which has been continuously inhabited by astronauts for 22 years (Robinson et al., 2006) and is therefore the only current model for how the microbiome of a space habitat evolves over time. Because the ISS is hermetically sealed against the vacuum of space, sources of its microbiome must necessarily be the human commensals from the astronauts, new equipment and supplies, or experiments conducted on board (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022). With a number of both governmental and commercial closed-habitat space facilities planned for both earth and lunar orbit in the near future, studying the microbiome of this unique habitat is vital to understanding both how astronaut health is affected by the presence of bacteria and fungi exposed to the space environment, and how those microbes can be utilized for biotechnological applications. Part of this effort should include the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and taxonomic classification of microbes isolated from the ISS, to track their sources, spread, interactions, and potential applications. Until the mid-2010s, monitoring of bacteria and fungi aboard the ISS was mainly done via traditional culturing and identification using Sanger sequencing methods, to ensure crew health and food and water safety (La Duc et al., 2004; Checinska et al., 2015). More recently, a series of NASA Space Biology-funded missions known as Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 investigated the metagenomes of ISS surfaces and performed WGS on all isolated bacteria and fungi (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2016; Venkateswaran et al., 2017; Urbaniak et al., 2018; Bijlani et al., 2020; Daudu et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020; Blachowicz et al., 2021; Simpson et al., 2021a,b), in order to fully characterize the ISS microbiome and how it changes over time (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022). In the ongoing Microbial Tracking investigation of the ISS, spore-forming bacteria have been isolated multiple times from the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus; however, this is the first instance that a bacterium from the genus Cohnella has been isolated from an ISS surface. As part of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series, during April of 2018, astronauts sampled various surfaces aboard the ISS (Urbaniak et al., 2022) with pre-packaged, pre-sterilized wipes, including the panel behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Upon return to Earth, the strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from the WHC sample wipe, on blood agar incubated at 37°C. Preliminary 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed strain F6_2S_P_1T in the genus Cohnella. The genus Cohnella (family Paenibacillaceae, order Bacillales, phylum Firmicutes/Bacillota) was first proposed by Kampfer et al. (2006) as distinct from the genus Paenibacillus, with the description of Cohnella thermotolerans (type species, isolated during hygiene checks at a starch production company in Sweden) and the reclassification of Paenibacillus hongkongensis as Cohnella hongkongensis (Teng et al., 2003). Cohnella species are differentiated from Paenibacillus due to high iso-C16:0 content in their fatty acid profiles (Kampfer et al., 2006). Members of Cohnella are rod-shaped, usually endospore-forming, and gram-positive. Cohnella species have been first isolated from a wide variety of environmental samples, most usually in soil (Kampfer et al., 2014), but also in plant tissue (Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008; Flores-Felix et al., 2014) and compost heaps (He et al., 2013). Species from this genus are used in industrial applications including fermentation, biofuel production, and wastewater treatment bioreactors (Lin et al., 2020; Hero et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Mohammadi et al., 2022). As with the genus Paenibacillus, many members of the genus Cohnella are strongly associated with the plant rhizosphere environment, particularly that of legume species (Niang et al., 2018). Multiple novel Cohnella species have been discovered in the root nodules of leguminous plants, although only two species are known to fix nitrogen (Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012, 2015; Flores-Felix et al., 2014; Takada et al., 2019). Cohnella species are also thought to play an important role in recycling plant biomass within soil, with multiple members of the genus possessing genes for degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose, and xylan (Khianngam et al., 2010; Hameed et al., 2013; Hero et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2021). Overall, while Cohnella species have been occasionally detected in the blood and oral cavities of immune-compromised or otherwise unhealthy individuals (Teng et al., 2003; Abou Abdallah et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2021), they do not appear to be common human commensals. In this study, we completed the characterization study of strain F6_2S_P_1T and describe it here with three main objectives. The first objective was to establish Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T as a novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes), and comparative genomic analyses were carried out. In addition, initial taxonomic analysis for strain F6_2S_P_1T showed that it was most closely related to four Cohnella species without publicly available genomes, two of which are officially recognized species (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014). Thus, the strains Cohnella ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and Cohnella rhizosphaerae DSM 28161T were acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) and whole-genome-sequenced, and assembled draft genomes were generated for these species. The second objective was to discover the phylogenetic placement of strain F6_2S_P_1T within the genus Cohnella, for which we performed multiple phylogenetic analyses as well as a pangenome, and a genome-based tree containing all shared single-copy core genes from the genus Cohnella. The third objective was to explore the functional traits predicted by the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Because strain F6_2S_P_1T is part of a branch of the genus Cohnella which is only distantly related to the rest of the genus, the functional traits predicted for the entire closely related clade of which strain F6_2S_P_1T is a member were characterized.",

In addition, WGSs of C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae were generated and compared with the genome of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Assembly statistics for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1, C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae are summarized in Table 1. Genome sizes are 9.06 Mb for strain F6_2S_P_1, 7.22 Mb for C. ginsengisoli, and 8.5 Mb for C. rhizosphaerae. GC content ranged from 58.37% for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T to 59.49% for C. rhizosphaerae. In general, among 39 sequenced Cohnella genomes, genome size varied from 4.0 to 9.4 Mb. This genome variation should be investigated for any functional genes acquired or shed over time. Table 1.

The 16S rDNA sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 98.84 to 97.37%. “C. plantaginis” and “C. capsici” form their own well-supported branch within this clade, while C. rhizosphaerae is basal to strain F6_2S_P_1T and C. ginsengisoli is the most basal species of the clade (Figure 1). However, branch support for the divergence of strain F6_2S_P_1T from C. rhizosphaerae was low (50) and not shown in Figure 1. A gyrB-based phylogeny was also generated using all publicly available Cohnella genomes plus the outgroups T. dichotomicus and T. vulgaris (Figure 2). The gyrB sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 93.99 to 93.55%. The gyrB tree supports the position of strain F6_2S_P_1T as non-basal to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, with C. ginsengisoli as the most basal species in this branch of the genus Cohnella. Since WGSs of “C. plantaginis” and “C. capsici” are not available, they were not included in the gyrB phylogeny. Figure 1.

Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on gyrB sequences of the genus Cohnella.The genome-based tree (Figure 3) for all sequenced and fully described Cohnella species was based on a concatenated alignment of 14 gene clusters containing a total of 294 single-copy core genes common to all species in the genus. This tree supports the position of C. rhizosphaerae as basal to C. ginsengisoli, in contrast to the 16S and gyrB trees. Nevertheless, the position of strain F6_2S_P_1T remains the same. A second genome-based tree was generated using a second pangenome analysis including genomes of all Cohnella species along with yet-to-be described species (Supplementary Figure S1), which showed that Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 are also part of this clade, with Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 as the most basal species and Cohnella sp. OV330 as basal to C. ginsengisoli and strain F6_2S_P_1T. Figure 3.

Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization Light microscopy and staining with safranin and malachite green show that cells are rod-shaped and vary extensively in length and that strain F6_2S_P_1T forms ellipsoidal/oval endospores which quickly convert back to vegetative cells (Figure 4). SEM imaging reveals the presence of peritrichous flagella attached to F6_2S_P_1T cells (Figure 5A) and confirms the presence of elongated cells (Figure 5B). Figure 4.

F6_2S_P_1T with other Cohnella species are depicted in Table 3. Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T grew at temperatures between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies were weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. Catalase positive in C. ginsengisoli, C. plantaginis, and C. capsici; absence of growth at 3% NaCl and production of oxidase in C. ginsengisoli; absence of endospore formation in C. rhizosphaerae; nitrate reduction not seen in C. plantaginis and C. capsica were some of the phenotypic characteristics that could differentiate Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T from other Cohnella species. Table 3. Phenotypic characteristics of strain F6_2S_P_1T and closely related species of genus Cohnella.

F6_2S_P_1T and in C rhizosphaerae could be used to differentiate the novel species described in this study. However, production of iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C15:0 was very high in Cohnella sp.

This profile is in agreement with other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). The quinone system contained menaquinones MK-7 (98%) and MK-8 (2%). The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain F6_2S_P_1T contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid, which is the case for other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade where that data are reported. All other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade also contain MK-7 as the dominant menaquinone (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). Descriptions of C. capsici and C. plantaginis do not report low abundance menaquinones, but the quinone system of F6_2S_P_1T is similar to that of C. rhizosphaerae (99.8% MK-7, 0.2% MK-8), while C. ginsengisoli has 93% MK-7 and 7% MK-6. Comparative genomic analysis of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade The genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T contained 309 genes not aligned with other species of Cohnella, named or undescribed (Figure 6). Of these genes, 121 of them received an annotation from at least one predictive database. Annotated genes specific to strain F6_2S_P_1T were dominated by the COG pathways of carbohydrate and/or amino acid transport and metabolism (27 genes), transcription (10 genes), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (11 genes), and signal transduction mechanisms (+ transcription) (18 genes). The large number of carbon-cycling metabolic genes found in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T within Cohnella is unsurprising, given the diverse nature of the carbon substrates which strain F6_2S_P_1T, C. capsici, and C. plantaginis can metabolize compared to the fairly limited substrates utilized by C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli (Table 3). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Pangenomic analysis of the genus Cohnella, including C. hashimotonis sp. nov. (pink) as well as its previously unsequenced closest relatives C. rhizosphaerae (blue) and C. ginsengisoli (green).Because C. capsici and C. plantaginis are both characterized as fixing N2, the annotations for the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T were searched extensively for genes having to do with nitrogen fixation, as well as blastn and blastx searches for key genes involved in N2 fixation. However, despite the presence of the gene nifU in most species of the genus Cohnella, there was no indication that strain F6_2S_P_1T encodes for N2 fixation. Other genes of interest predicted by annotation on the RAST platform include multiple genes for endospore formation and for the plant growth hormone auxin, genes which are likely shared by many members of the genus Cohnella, which belongs to the order Bacillales (including many known spore formers) and which are common plant endophytes. BGCs which might produce secondary metabolites were predicted in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T via the antiSMASH pipeline, including two lassopeptides, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, one agrD-like cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide, one protein cluster, and one heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase. All are uncharacterized except the two lassopeptides; these are moderate matches to the lasso peptide paeninodin which was characterized from the species Paenibacillus dendritiformis (Zhu et al., 2016). Paeninodin and BGCs showing similarity to it have been predicted in multiple Bacillus and Paenibacillus endophyte species and are suspected to have biocontrol properties that combat plant pathogens (Muñoz et al., 2022; Semenzato et al., 2022). The genomes of C. ginsengisoli, C. rhizosphaerae, and strain F6_2S_P_1T all contained 2–3 predicted BGCs for paeninodin, with C. ginsengisoli containing one that is a 100% match, while C. nanjingensis (the most closely related species outside the C. ginsengisoli clade) contained a single paeninodin match. The only other match in any of these species to a known BGC is a predicted cluster in the C. rhizosphaerae which is a moderate match to ectoine. Other differences include multiple cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide BGCs predicted in the genome of C. nanjingensis (vs. a single one in all other tested genomes), and a siderophore predicted in the genome of C. rhizosphaerae. Strain F6_2S_P_1T was the only genome in the genus Cohnella which a heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase was detected; these BGCs are used by cyanobacteria to compartmentalize N2 fixation and are activated in low-nitrogen conditions (Campbell et al., 1997), but as strain F6_2S_P_1T does not contain a full suite of genes for N2 fixation and the cluster is not a strong match, it is likely a producer of some kind of potentially uncharacterized lipid compound. No genes for antimicrobial resistance or virulence were predicted by the ABRicate pipeline. The entire closely related branch of which strain F6_2S_P_1T is a member, which we term the C. ginsengisoli clade (due to its basal position and status as the first officially described species within the clade), contained 322 gene clusters not found in any other publicly available Cohnella genome. All members of this clade in addition to strain F6_2S_P_1T were originally isolated from plant tissue or the rhizosphere environment, including C. ginsengisoli (isolated from soil in which ginseng was grown, Kim et al., 2010), C. rhizosphaerae (isolated from healthy maize seed tissue, Kampfer et al., 2014), C. capsici (isolated from Capsicum rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2015), C. plantaginis (isolated from plantain rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2012), Cohnella sp. OV330 (isolated from poplar rhizosphere, JGI, 2015), and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 (isolated from Ginko biloba root tissue, Zou et al., 2021). It is speculated that strain F6_2S_P_1T might have originated from the plants grown in ISS. Since shotgun metagenomics of plants associated samples (tissue, water, and soil) were not available, the source of this novel strain isolated from the WHC location could not be confirmed. Cohnella was one of the top 30 genera recently detected via 16S amplicon sequencing of plant tissue of chili peppers grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat from sterilized seeds aboard the ISS, though it was not a top genus detected in artificial soil medium (Khodadad et al., 2022). Cohnella was also not a dominant member of the microbiome of Outredgeous lettuce grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020). However, since in these ISS studies, a 250-bp 16S rRNA gene amplicon was used for the microbial diversity analyses, Cohnella species might have not been identified appropriately. Functional enrichment analysis for the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella species using the COG20 and KOfam databases revealed hundreds of statistically significantly enriched predicted functions (p < 0.05 with FDR adjustment) annotating one or more gene clusters, including 11 functions which were detected in all C. ginsengisoli clade members (Supplementary Table S1) but in none of the rest of the genus. Most notably, C. ginsengisoli clade species were enriched in genes for heme oxygenase and for a bacteriophytochrome (annotated on  as diguanylate cyclase), which were detected using both COG20 and KOfam database annotation. Consensus protein sequences for genes related to these functions, when aligned to the  database, most closely match to the genome of Paenibacillus chitinolyticus (after matches to members of the C. ginsengisoli clade); heme oxygenase and diguanylate cyclase are located one after the other in the assembled chromosome of this species (NZ_CP026520.1). Heme oxygenase (HO-1) breaks down heme and releases iron and is a regulator of intracellular iron availability in plants and animals (Singh and Bhatla, 2022). Enhanced HO-1 expression in plants and animals is also associated with stress response as the resulting biliverdin and bilirubin scavenge ROS species (Singh and Bhatla, 2022); the bacterial species Paenibacillus polymyxa applied as a probiotic induces increased intestinal HO-1 expression as part of its anti-oxidant effects on gut health in animals (Wu et al., 2019). In bacteria, expression and production of heme oxygenase are associated with iron scavenging within a host, and heme oxygenase expression can have either beneficial anti-oxidant or enhanced pathogenic effects on plant or animal hosts (Richard et al., 2019). In non-photosynthetic bacteria, heme oxygenase also produces biliverdin which is used as the chromatophore in bacteriophytochromes (Takemoto et al., 2019). It is also possible that this HO-1/diguanylate cyclase complex acts as an oxygen sensor (Martínková et al., 2013). Other functions significantly enriched in this clade include stress response genes such as heat shock protein DnaJ. KEGG pathway analysis predicted two functional pathways in all C. ginsengisoli clade species which were not present in any other Cohnella species: a pathway for carbon fixation (incomplete reductive citrate cycle) and a pathway for plant terpenoid biosynthesis (specifically beta-carotene biosynthesis). Predictive analysis of the presence of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes, Drula et al., 2022) was followed by ordination (Figure 7; Supplementary Figure S3) and heatmap generation (Supplementary Figure S4). Both heatmaps and ordinations show that strain F6_2S_P1T and its closest relatives cluster tightly together, along with C. fermenti (isolated from a fermented vegetable, Lin et al., 2020), C. phaseoli (isolated from the root nodule of a legume species, Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008), C. zeiphila (isolated from corn tissue, Johnson et al., 2021), and several undescribed strains; members of the C. ginsengisoli clade, therefore, appear to be both taxonomically similar and have similar profiles of carbohydrate-cycling genes. PERMANOVA analysis confirmed that the centroid of the C. ginsengisoli clade was significantly different from that of other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (p < 0.001). One axis out of three in the NMDS ordination clearly differentiates the C. ginsengisoli clade and the other Cohnella species mentioned above from the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (NMDS2, shown in Figure 7; Supplementary Figure S3); therefore, scores correlating CAZyme ordination vectors to this axis using the envfit function were assessed for significance, plotted, and ranked against the axis in question. Figure 7. Open in a new tab First two axes of NMDS ordination (standardization = “range,” distance = “Bray-Curtis,” maxit = 500, k = 3, stress = 0.129, R2 = 0.98) for counts of different predicted CAZymes in the genomes of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species. Also present in the figure are CAZyme vector correlations with axes 1 and 2 (not original coordinates) via envfit/Pearson's correlation with fdr correction + p < 0.01. Species belonging to the C. ginsengisoli clade and the top 4 CAZyme families/subfamilies positively correlated with axis 2 are labeled.Most strongly associated with this axis and the C. ginsengisoli clade are the CAZyme families CBM67 and GH78, which were both identified as part of the enzyme α-L-rhamnosidase which alters flavonoids and other rhamnose-containing glycosides such as pectins in plant cell walls (Yadav et al., 2010). Flavonoids are phenolic compounds produced by plants that often have medicinal or flavorful properties. α-L-rhamnosidase cleaves terminal α-rhamnose residues and in doing so helps concentrate and improve the action of flavonoids; α-L-rhamnosidase from different bacterial species is used for many industrial applications such as improving wine aroma, sweetening fruit juice, and increasing concentration and efficacy of antibiotic and anti-cancer compounds (Xie et al., 2022). The C. ginsengisoli clade and other Cohnella species enriched in α-L-rhamnosidase enzyme modules are all confirmed or likely plant symbionts or feed on plant tissue; however, since the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species appear to have at least some association with plant tissue or rhizosphere, there may be additional promising applications for these particular species in processing plant medicinal or other plant phenolic compounds. CAZymes negatively associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade (and associated mainly with Paenibacillus species) include chitosanases (GH46 and CBM12), endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GH85), and β-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GT17). Four CAZyme families associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species had an effect size of 0.5 or greater (Kruskal–Wallis); these were maltooligosaccharide-producing α-amylases (CG13_5), chondroitin AC lyase (PL8_3), and alginate lyases (PL34 and PL14_3). Presence of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T in ISS metagenomes Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces, crew capsule, and ISS HEPA filter particulates (Venkateswaran et al., 2014; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022) were mapped to the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Most metagenomes had <0.05% of reads that mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, with a maximum of 0.22% of reads mapping to strain F6_2S_P_1T for a low-read-number sample collected from the cupola of the ISS during Flight 4 of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series. But upon examination of regions to which the metagenomic reads mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, 98+% of reads mapped to regions of 16S or 23S rRNA genes and were only considered significant by bowtie2 because of the conserved nature of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. We therefore concluded that strain F6_2S_P_1T is not dominant in the ISS environmental surfaces or air particulates collected during the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 mission series. However, molecular microbial diversity-based examination of plant and its associated materials using culturing and metagenomics would allow NASA to trace the source of this strain, since Cohnella species were reported to produce hormones that might promote growth of plants. For example, as mentioned above, Cohnella was an abundant genus in the microbiome of healthy plant tissue of chili plants grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2022).",

    "conclusion": "Conclusion We used multiple means of characterization, including phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional genome-prediction methods to characterize Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and place it within the established taxonomy of the genus Cohnella. Based on these data, we propose that this novel species be named C. hashimotonis. We also characterized the branch of Cohnella within which C. hashimotonis is placed and predicted functional characteristics of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade as a whole. All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.",

Copyright notice ID: 10308117 PMID: 37396358 Abstract A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade. Keywords: International Space Station (ISS), novel bacteria, Cohnella, space biology, pangenome analysisIntroduction The International Space Station (ISS) is an orbital space habitat which has been continuously inhabited by astronauts for 22 years (Robinson et al., 2006) and is therefore the only current model for how the microbiome of a space habitat evolves over time. Because the ISS is hermetically sealed against the vacuum of space, sources of its microbiome must necessarily be the human commensals from the astronauts, new equipment and supplies, or experiments conducted on board (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022). With a number of both governmental and commercial closed-habitat space facilities planned for both earth and lunar orbit in the near future, studying the microbiome of this unique habitat is vital to understanding both how astronaut health is affected by the presence of bacteria and fungi exposed to the space environment, and how those microbes can be utilized for biotechnological applications. Part of this effort should include the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and taxonomic classification of microbes isolated from the ISS, to track their sources, spread, interactions, and potential applications. Until the mid-2010s, monitoring of bacteria and fungi aboard the ISS was mainly done via traditional culturing and identification using Sanger sequencing methods, to ensure crew health and food and water safety (La Duc et al., 2004; Checinska et al., 2015). More recently, a series of NASA Space Biology-funded missions known as Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 investigated the metagenomes of ISS surfaces and performed WGS on all isolated bacteria and fungi (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2016; Venkateswaran et al., 2017; Urbaniak et al., 2018; Bijlani et al., 2020; Daudu et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020; Blachowicz et al., 2021; Simpson et al., 2021a,b), in order to fully characterize the ISS microbiome and how it changes over time (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022). In the ongoing Microbial Tracking investigation of the ISS, spore-forming bacteria have been isolated multiple times from the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus; however, this is the first instance that a bacterium from the genus Cohnella has been isolated from an ISS surface. As part of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series, during April of 2018, astronauts sampled various surfaces aboard the ISS (Urbaniak et al., 2022) with pre-packaged, pre-sterilized wipes, including the panel behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Upon return to Earth, the strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from the WHC sample wipe, on blood agar incubated at 37°C. Preliminary 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed strain F6_2S_P_1T in the genus Cohnella. The genus Cohnella (family Paenibacillaceae, order Bacillales, phylum Firmicutes/Bacillota) was first proposed by Kampfer et al. (2006) as distinct from the genus Paenibacillus, with the description of Cohnella thermotolerans (type species, isolated during hygiene checks at a starch production company in Sweden) and the reclassification of Paenibacillus hongkongensis as Cohnella hongkongensis (Teng et al., 2003). Cohnella species are differentiated from Paenibacillus due to high iso-C16:0 content in their fatty acid profiles (Kampfer et al., 2006). Members of Cohnella are rod-shaped, usually endospore-forming, and gram-positive. Cohnella species have been first isolated from a wide variety of environmental samples, most usually in soil (Kampfer et al., 2014), but also in plant tissue (Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008; Flores-Felix et al., 2014) and compost heaps (He et al., 2013). Species from this genus are used in industrial applications including fermentation, biofuel production, and wastewater treatment bioreactors (Lin et al., 2020; Hero et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Mohammadi et al., 2022). As with the genus Paenibacillus, many members of the genus Cohnella are strongly associated with the plant rhizosphere environment, particularly that of legume species (Niang et al., 2018). Multiple novel Cohnella species have been discovered in the root nodules of leguminous plants, although only two species are known to fix nitrogen (Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012, 2015; Flores-Felix et al., 2014; Takada et al., 2019). Cohnella species are also thought to play an important role in recycling plant biomass within soil, with multiple members of the genus possessing genes for degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose, and xylan (Khianngam et al., 2010; Hameed et al., 2013; Hero et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2021). Overall, while Cohnella species have been occasionally detected in the blood and oral cavities of immune-compromised or otherwise unhealthy individuals (Teng et al., 2003; Abou Abdallah et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2021), they do not appear to be common human commensals. In this study, we completed the characterization study of strain F6_2S_P_1T and describe it here with three main objectives. The first objective was to establish Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T as a novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes), and comparative genomic analyses were carried out. In addition, initial taxonomic analysis for strain F6_2S_P_1T showed that it was most closely related to four Cohnella species without publicly available genomes, two of which are officially recognized species (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014). Thus, the strains Cohnella ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and Cohnella rhizosphaerae DSM 28161T were acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) and whole-genome-sequenced, and assembled draft genomes were generated for these species. The second objective was to discover the phylogenetic placement of strain F6_2S_P_1T within the genus Cohnella, for which we performed multiple phylogenetic analyses as well as a pangenome, and a genome-based tree containing all shared single-copy core genes from the genus Cohnella. The third objective was to explore the functional traits predicted by the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Because strain F6_2S_P_1T is part of a branch of the genus Cohnella which is only distantly related to the rest of the genus, the functional traits predicted for the entire closely related clade of which strain F6_2S_P_1T is a member were characterized.Materials and methods Sample collection and isolation Methods for preparing sampling kits and processing samples were similar to those used in the Microbial Tracking 1 mission (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). For each of five flight missions for Microbial Tracking 2, Sterile TexTra™ 10 TX3224 Dry Cleanroom Wipers were moistened with 15 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), folded into quarters and placed in sterile Ziploc baggies, which were later used to assemble sampling kits at NASA Ames. Sampling kits were transported to the ISS, where astronauts collected surface particulates from a square meter area of eight surfaces: (1) the cupola, (2) the WHC, (3) the advanced resistive exercise device, (4) dining table, (5) Zero-Gravity Stowage Rack overhead 4, (6) permanent multipurpose module Port 1, (7) laboratory overhead 3, and (8) crew quarters bump-out exterior wall (see Singh et al., 2018 for detailed surface descriptions). For each surface, the astronaut tasked with sampling donned a new pair of sterile gloves, removed and unfolded a sterile wipe from its bag, and wiped a square meter area of the surface three times, folding the wipe in half for the second pass and into quarters for the third pass; each time, the surface was sampled in a different direction (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) using the new previously unexposed surface of the wipe. Additionally, a wipe was removed from its bag and briefly exposed to the air, as an environmental control. A total of nine (eight locations and one control) samples were produced for each flight and stored at 4°C aboard the ISS and during transport to earth. Upon delivery to Jet Propulsion Laboratory, ISS wipes and unopened control wipes were processed for the isolation of environmental microbes within a 12-h period. Each wipe was placed in a sterile 500-ml bottle with 200-ml sterile PBS and shaken vigorously for 2 min. PBS was then concentrated using an Innovaprep CP-150 (Innovaprep LLC, Drexel, Missouri, United States) with a 0.2 μm polysulfone hollow fiber concentrating pipette tip (Innovaprep LLC, SKU CC08022-10). Using additional sterile PBS, dilutions of 10−1 through 10−6 were prepared and plated onto Reasoner's 2 agar (R2A, BD Diagnostics Cat # 218263), potato dextrose agar (BD Diagnostics Cat #213400) with 0.05 g/L chloramphenicol, and blood agar (Hardy Diagnostics, #A10) media. Five colonies from each sample on each media type were selected and stored in one-tenth strength tryptic soy agar (TSA) stabs. Strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from blood agar inoculated with the PBS concentrate from Location 2 (wall behind WHC), collected during Flight 6 (third flight in the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series).DNA extraction and whole-genome sequencing The ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit was used to extract genomic DNA from strain F6_2S_P_1T according to the manufacturer's instructions. An Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit was used to prepare the library for WGS as in Simpson et al. (2021b). The library was sequenced as part of a run on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform. FastQC v0.11.7 (Bioinformatics, 2011) was used to quality filter and trim reads, and fastp v0.20 (Chen et al., 2018) was used to remove adapter sequences. A draft genome was assembled to the scaffold level using SPAdes v3.11.1 (Bankevich et al., 2012). Assembly quality, including number of contigs, genome size, and N50 value, was assessed using QUAST v5.0.2 (Gurevich et al., 2013). Default settings were used for all steps except for fastp, which included 512 adapters screening. A secondary round of sequencing for strain F6_2S_P_1T, as well as C. ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and C. rhizosphaerae DSM 28161T, was conducted using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. C. ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and C. rhizosphaerae DSM 28161T were ordered from the DSMZ and cryostocks prepared for long term storage. To produce a more resolved genome for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and to provide WGS, all strains were re-streaked from cryostock on TSA and genomic DNA was extracted using a Zymo QuikSpin DNA extraction kit. Nanopore sequencing libraries were prepared using an SQK-LSK110 Ligation Sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore) and sequenced on an R9.4.1 flow cell, with base calling via MinKNOW/Guppy. Porechop (Wick et al., 2017a) and Nanofilt (De Coster et al., 2018) were used to remove adapter sequences and filter reads using the settings “-q 10 -l 200.” A hybrid genome assembly for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T was generated via Unicycler (Wick et al., 2017b) using Nanopore reads to polish the Illumina assembly. Flye (Kolmogorov et al., 2019) followed by polishing with Medaka (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was used to assemble draft genomes for type strains of C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae from Nanopore reads, and assembly quality was assessed using QUAST v5.0.2 (Gurevich et al., 2013).Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences was carried out by extracting the 16S rDNA sequence from the WGS of strain F6_2S_P_1T and aligning it to the  nucleotide database via blast search. The top 30 matching 16S rRNA sequences were retrieved. In addition, all publicly available genomes from the genus Cohnella were downloaded, and their 16S rDNA sequences were extracted using a blast wrapper script. 16S rRNA genes from the species Paenibacillus barengoltzii, Paenibacillus terrae, Thermoflavimicrobial dichotomicus, and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris were used to root the tree. Similarly, gyrB sequences from strain F6_2S_P_1T and from all publicly available Cohnella genomes, and the outgroups T. dichotomicus and T. vulgaris were extracted with the same wrapper script. For both gyrB and 16S trees, alignment was performed in R using the DECIPHER package (Wright, 2016). Trimming and tree-building using maximum likelihood and the substitution model GTR + G + I were performed using the phangorn package, including model selection using AIC values and 1,000 bootstrap replicates (Schliep, 2011). Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA and gyrB genes were visualized using ggtree (Yu et al., 2017). A genome-based phylogenetic tree was also generated using genes detected from the pangenomic analysis, which contained all publicly available Cohnella genomes, plus those of strain F6_2S_P_1T, C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae generated during this study (see below section for methods for pangenomic tree generation). Aligned, single-copy core genes which were shared by all species and had a geometric homogeneity of 1, but a functional homogeneity below 0.9, were extracted from the Cohnella genus pangenome into a concatenated FASTA file. A maximum likelihood genome-based tree was generated using raxml v8.2.12 (Stamatakis, 2014; Kozlov et al., 2019) with a GTR-GAMMA substitution model and the option “autoMRE” to automatically choose the optimal number of bootstrap replicates. The tree was visualized using the online platform Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) (Letunic and Bork, 2007). Additionally, average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) were calculated for strain F6_2S_P_1T against all sequenced and described Cohnella species using fastANI v1.33 (Jain et al., 2018) and DSMZ's online Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator v3.0 (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2022).Light microscopy and SEM A liquid culture of strain F6_2S_P_1T was incubated at 80°C for 10 min, then plated on R2A and grown at 30°C for 5 days to induce endospore formation. Endospore staining with malachite green and safranin was performed using the Schaeffer–Fulton method (Schaeffer and Fulton, 1933). Light microscopy and phase contrast images were taken on an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 camera using Olympus cellSens software. To prepare a colony of strain F6_2S_P_1T for SEM, the strain was streaked out on TSA and allowed to grow at 30°C for 48 h. A pure colony was then suspended in chilled 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, United States) in 0.1M sodium cacodylate (NaCaco) (Sigma Aldrich) solution for 1 h. The sample was then filtered through a 0.2 μm Isopore filter membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, United States) and moved into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. The sample was then incubated in 0.1 M NaCaco solution at 4°C for 10 min and then replaced with fresh 0.1 M NaCaco solution; this replacement was repeated three times. The sample was then dehydrated in a series of increasing IPA solutions mixed with water for 10 min each. The series was 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%, with the final 100% IPA rinsing occurring three times. The specimen was stored at 4°C in 100% IPA until it was critical point dried in a Tousimis Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Rockville, MD, United States). Samples were adhered with carbon tape to SEM stubs (Ted Pella Inc.) and then underwent ~12 nm thick carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Deerfield, IL, United States). SEM micrographs were captured on a FEI Quanta 200F microscope (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, United States) located at the California Institute of Technologies Kavli Nanoscience Institute.Pangenomic analysis and other genome characterization Pangenomic analysis was carried out using anvi'o v7.1 (Eren et al., 2015) similar to methods described in Singh et al. (2021). Open reading frames were annotated with COG, KEGG, and KOfam database pathways/functions, and ANI between all genomes was additionally calculated. Two pangenomes were generated: one including all publicly available Cohnella genomes including unnamed species and one containing only named species. The function anvi-compute-functional-enrichment-in-pan was used to calculate functional enrichment in the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to the rest of the genus Cohnella. The genome of the strain F6_2S_P_1T was also uploaded and annotated using the online Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology (RAST platform) (Aziz et al., 2008). The presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) which might produce secondary metabolites was predicted in the strain F6_2S_P_1T genome using the antiSMASH pipeline (Blin et al., 2021). The presence of antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes was predicted by the ABRicate pipeline (Seemann, 2018). To evaluate the diversity of carbohydrate-degrading and other carbohydrate-cycling enzymes (Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes, i.e., CAZymes) (Drula et al., 2022), the dbcan3 stand-alone tool (Zhang et al., 2018) was run against all publicly available genomes in the genera Cohnella and Paenibacillus as well as the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T, C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae. The results were parsed to generate a count matrix for the number of each CAZyme family/subfamily predicted in the genome of each species. All statistics and plots from analysis of this data were generated in R [v 4.2.2, “Innocent and Trusting,” R Core Team (2022)] utilizing the Tidyverse package (Wickham et al., 2019). An NMDS ordination (stress = 12.9, k = 3) was generated via vegan (Oksanen et al., 2019) using Bray–Curtis distance after standardization of each CAZyme category to between 0 and 1, and individual Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed for each CAZyme testing mean abundance between members of the C. ginsengisoli clade and other species of Cohnella and Paenibacillus with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Additionally, a heatmap of abundance for each category was generated using the pheatmap package (Kolde and Kolde, 2018) after standardization of the data using robust centered log ratios.Phenotypic characterization Growth temperature was determined by inoculating both solid (R2A plates) and liquid (trypticase soy broth (TSB), BD Diagnostics Cat # 257107) media in 15 ml loose-capped centrifuge tubes with strain F6_2S_P_1T and growing at 4, 15, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C. Plates and tubes were checked for growth daily for 7 days and incubation was halted if growth was observed. Samples grown at 4 and 15°C were incubated for additional time before final growth assessment: 2 weeks total for growth at 15°C and 4 weeks total at 4°C. Salt tolerance was determined by inoculating strain F6_2S_P_1T onto R2A with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% added NaCl, as well as agar containing only peptone plus 0 or 1% NaCl, and examining growth after 7 days of incubation at 30°C. Oxidase activity was determined by testing solid culture with OxiDrops™ liquid oxidase reagent (Hardy Diagnostics). Catalase activity was determined by mixing colonies of strain F6_2S_P_1T with hydrogen peroxide on a sterile glass slide and monitoring for the presence of effervescence. pH tolerance (4–10) was tested by adjusting the pH of TSB broth with biological buffers as in Xu et al. (2005).Mapping of metagenomic reads to genome Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces from Microbial Tracking 1 (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019) and Microbial Tracking 2 (Urbaniak et al., 2022) were mapped to the genome of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), using the flags “—no-mixed” (no unpaired alignments) and “—no-discordant” (only matches where both forward and reverse reads map to the same area are considered). The number of matches where both a forward and reverse read mapped to the Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T genome were reported as a percentage of total reads.Chemotaxonomic analysis Cells grown in TSB medium were harvested when growth of the cultures reached approximately 70% of the maximal optical density (exponential growth phase) and used for analysis of cellular fatty acids, polar lipids, and quinones, which was done as described previously (Ramaprasad et al., 2015). In brief, for cellular fatty acids analysis, 40 mg of bacterial cells were subjected to a series of four different reagents followed by saponification and methylation of fatty acids, thus enabling their cleavage from lipids. The fatty acid methyl esters thus obtained were analyzed by gas chromatography. The peaks obtained were then labeled and the equivalent chain length values were computed as published elsewhere (MIDI, 2012). The polar lipid profile was analyzed by extracting polar lipids with methanol/chloroform/saline (2:1:0.8, by vol.) from 1 g freeze-dried bacterial cells. Separation of lipids was done by two-dimensional chromatography on a silica gel TLC plate (Kieselgel 60 F254; Merck) using chloroform–methanol–water (75:32:4 by vol.) in the first dimension and chloroform–methanol–acetic acid–water (86:16:15:4 by vol.) in the second dimension. Total polar lipid profiles were detected by spraying with 6% ethanolic molybdophosphoric acid. The respiratory isoprenoid quinone was extracted with chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1, v/v), evaporated under a vacuum, re-extracted with acetone, and analyzed using high-performance lipid chromatography according to previously reported methods (Ramaprasad et al., 2018). Polyamines were analyzed as described by Busse and Auling (1988) and Busse et al. (1997). The peptidoglycan of cells of strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated following disruption of the cells by shaking with glass beads and subsequent trypsin digestion, according to the method of Schleifer (1985). Cell wall was hydrolyzed for amino acid analyses as described by Schleifer and Kandler (1972). Amino acids in cell-wall hydrolysates were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Mckerrow et al., 2000; Ramaprasad et al., 2015). Carbon substrate utilization profile analysis was carried out as per the BioLog protocol provided by the manufacturer for Firmicutes using the GEN III MicroPlate test assay with a Biolog system (Hayward, CA, USA).Results and discussion Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T isolated from the ISS was subjected to polyphasic taxonomic characterization to determine its phylogenetic affiliation. In addition, WGSs of C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae were generated and compared with the genome of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Assembly statistics for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1, C. ginsengisoli, and C. rhizosphaerae are summarized in Table 1. Genome sizes are 9.06 Mb for strain F6_2S_P_1, 7.22 Mb for C. ginsengisoli, and 8.5 Mb for C. rhizosphaerae. GC content ranged from 58.37% for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T to 59.49% for C. rhizosphaerae. In general, among 39 sequenced Cohnella genomes, genome size varied from 4.0 to 9.4 Mb. This genome variation should be investigated for any functional genes acquired or shed over time. Table 1.

The 16S rDNA sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 98.84 to 97.37%. “C. plantaginis” and “C. capsici” form their own well-supported branch within this clade, while C. rhizosphaerae is basal to strain F6_2S_P_1T and C. ginsengisoli is the most basal species of the clade (Figure 1). However, branch support for the divergence of strain F6_2S_P_1T from C. rhizosphaerae was low (50) and not shown in Figure 1. A gyrB-based phylogeny was also generated using all publicly available Cohnella genomes plus the outgroups T. dichotomicus and T. vulgaris (Figure 2). The gyrB sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 93.99 to 93.55%. The gyrB tree supports the position of strain F6_2S_P_1T as non-basal to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, with C. ginsengisoli as the most basal species in this branch of the genus Cohnella. Since WGSs of “C. plantaginis” and “C. capsici” are not available, they were not included in the gyrB phylogeny. Figure 1.

Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on gyrB sequences of the genus Cohnella.The genome-based tree (Figure 3) for all sequenced and fully described Cohnella species was based on a concatenated alignment of 14 gene clusters containing a total of 294 single-copy core genes common to all species in the genus. This tree supports the position of C. rhizosphaerae as basal to C. ginsengisoli, in contrast to the 16S and gyrB trees. Nevertheless, the position of strain F6_2S_P_1T remains the same. A second genome-based tree was generated using a second pangenome analysis including genomes of all Cohnella species along with yet-to-be described species (Supplementary Figure S1), which showed that Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 are also part of this clade, with Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 as the most basal species and Cohnella sp. OV330 as basal to C. ginsengisoli and strain F6_2S_P_1T. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree based on 294 single-copy core genes shared by all available Cohnella species genomes.Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization Light microscopy and staining with safranin and malachite green show that cells are rod-shaped and vary extensively in length and that strain F6_2S_P_1T forms ellipsoidal/oval endospores which quickly convert back to vegetative cells (Figure 4). SEM imaging reveals the presence of peritrichous flagella attached to F6_2S_P_1T cells (Figure 5A) and confirms the presence of elongated cells (Figure 5B). Figure 4.

F6_2S_P_1T with other Cohnella species are depicted in Table 3. Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T grew at temperatures between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies were weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. Catalase positive in C. ginsengisoli, C. plantaginis, and C. capsici; absence of growth at 3% NaCl and production of oxidase in C. ginsengisoli; absence of endospore formation in C. rhizosphaerae; nitrate reduction not seen in C. plantaginis and C. capsica were some of the phenotypic characteristics that could differentiate Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T from other Cohnella species. Table 3. Phenotypic characteristics of strain F6_2S_P_1T and closely related species of genus Cohnella.

C. rhizosphaerae showed >25% of C16:0 saturated fatty acid, whereas other Cohnella species exhibited <10% production. Absence of branched fatty acid such as iso-C14:0 in Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and in C rhizosphaerae could be used to differentiate the novel species described in this study. However, production of iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C15:0 was very high in Cohnella sp.

This profile is in agreement with other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). The quinone system contained menaquinones MK-7 (98%) and MK-8 (2%). The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain F6_2S_P_1T contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid, which is the case for other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade where that data are reported. All other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade also contain MK-7 as the dominant menaquinone (Kim et al., 2010; Kampfer et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). Descriptions of C. capsici and C. plantaginis do not report low abundance menaquinones, but the quinone system of F6_2S_P_1T is similar to that of C. rhizosphaerae (99.8% MK-7, 0.2% MK-8), while C. ginsengisoli has 93% MK-7 and 7% MK-6.Comparative genomic analysis of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade The genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T contained 309 genes not aligned with other species of Cohnella, named or undescribed (Figure 6). Of these genes, 121 of them received an annotation from at least one predictive database. Annotated genes specific to strain F6_2S_P_1T were dominated by the COG pathways of carbohydrate and/or amino acid transport and metabolism (27 genes), transcription (10 genes), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (11 genes), and signal transduction mechanisms (+ transcription) (18 genes). The large number of carbon-cycling metabolic genes found in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T within Cohnella is unsurprising, given the diverse nature of the carbon substrates which strain F6_2S_P_1T, C. capsici, and C. plantaginis can metabolize compared to the fairly limited substrates utilized by C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli (Table 3). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Pangenomic analysis of the genus Cohnella, including C. hashimotonis sp. nov. (pink) as well as its previously unsequenced closest relatives C. rhizosphaerae (blue) and C. ginsengisoli (green).Because C. capsici and C. plantaginis are both characterized as fixing N2, the annotations for the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T were searched extensively for genes having to do with nitrogen fixation, as well as blastn and blastx searches for key genes involved in N2 fixation. However, despite the presence of the gene nifU in most species of the genus Cohnella, there was no indication that strain F6_2S_P_1T encodes for N2 fixation. Other genes of interest predicted by annotation on the RAST platform include multiple genes for endospore formation and for the plant growth hormone auxin, genes which are likely shared by many members of the genus Cohnella, which belongs to the order Bacillales (including many known spore formers) and which are common plant endophytes. BGCs which might produce secondary metabolites were predicted in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T via the antiSMASH pipeline, including two lassopeptides, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, one agrD-like cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide, one protein cluster, and one heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase. All are uncharacterized except the two lassopeptides; these are moderate matches to the lasso peptide paeninodin which was characterized from the species Paenibacillus dendritiformis (Zhu et al., 2016). Paeninodin and BGCs showing similarity to it have been predicted in multiple Bacillus and Paenibacillus endophyte species and are suspected to have biocontrol properties that combat plant pathogens (Muñoz et al., 2022; Semenzato et al., 2022). The genomes of C. ginsengisoli, C. rhizosphaerae, and strain F6_2S_P_1T all contained 2–3 predicted BGCs for paeninodin, with C. ginsengisoli containing one that is a 100% match, while C. nanjingensis (the most closely related species outside the C. ginsengisoli clade) contained a single paeninodin match. The only other match in any of these species to a known BGC is a predicted cluster in the C. rhizosphaerae which is a moderate match to ectoine. Other differences include multiple cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide BGCs predicted in the genome of C. nanjingensis (vs. a single one in all other tested genomes), and a siderophore predicted in the genome of C. rhizosphaerae. Strain F6_2S_P_1T was the only genome in the genus Cohnella which a heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase was detected; these BGCs are used by cyanobacteria to compartmentalize N2 fixation and are activated in low-nitrogen conditions (Campbell et al., 1997), but as strain F6_2S_P_1T does not contain a full suite of genes for N2 fixation and the cluster is not a strong match, it is likely a producer of some kind of potentially uncharacterized lipid compound. No genes for antimicrobial resistance or virulence were predicted by the ABRicate pipeline. The entire closely related branch of which strain F6_2S_P_1T is a member, which we term the C. ginsengisoli clade (due to its basal position and status as the first officially described species within the clade), contained 322 gene clusters not found in any other publicly available Cohnella genome. All members of this clade in addition to strain F6_2S_P_1T were originally isolated from plant tissue or the rhizosphere environment, including C. ginsengisoli (isolated from soil in which ginseng was grown, Kim et al., 2010), C. rhizosphaerae (isolated from healthy maize seed tissue, Kampfer et al., 2014), C. capsici (isolated from Capsicum rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2015), C. plantaginis (isolated from plantain rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2012), Cohnella sp. OV330 (isolated from poplar rhizosphere, JGI, 2015), and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 (isolated from Ginko biloba root tissue, Zou et al., 2021). It is speculated that strain F6_2S_P_1T might have originated from the plants grown in ISS. Since shotgun metagenomics of plants associated samples (tissue, water, and soil) were not available, the source of this novel strain isolated from the WHC location could not be confirmed. Cohnella was one of the top 30 genera recently detected via 16S amplicon sequencing of plant tissue of chili peppers grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat from sterilized seeds aboard the ISS, though it was not a top genus detected in artificial soil medium (Khodadad et al., 2022). Cohnella was also not a dominant member of the microbiome of Outredgeous lettuce grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020). However, since in these ISS studies, a 250-bp 16S rRNA gene amplicon was used for the microbial diversity analyses, Cohnella species might have not been identified appropriately. Functional enrichment analysis for the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella species using the COG20 and KOfam databases revealed hundreds of statistically significantly enriched predicted functions (p < 0.05 with FDR adjustment) annotating one or more gene clusters, including 11 functions which were detected in all C. ginsengisoli clade members (Supplementary Table S1) but in none of the rest of the genus. Most notably, C. ginsengisoli clade species were enriched in genes for heme oxygenase and for a bacteriophytochrome (annotated on  as diguanylate cyclase), which were detected using both COG20 and KOfam database annotation. Consensus protein sequences for genes related to these functions, when aligned to the  database, most closely match to the genome of Paenibacillus chitinolyticus (after matches to members of the C. ginsengisoli clade); heme oxygenase and diguanylate cyclase are located one after the other in the assembled chromosome of this species (NZ_CP026520.1). Heme oxygenase (HO-1) breaks down heme and releases iron and is a regulator of intracellular iron availability in plants and animals (Singh and Bhatla, 2022). Enhanced HO-1 expression in plants and animals is also associated with stress response as the resulting biliverdin and bilirubin scavenge ROS species (Singh and Bhatla, 2022); the bacterial species Paenibacillus polymyxa applied as a probiotic induces increased intestinal HO-1 expression as part of its anti-oxidant effects on gut health in animals (Wu et al., 2019). In bacteria, expression and production of heme oxygenase are associated with iron scavenging within a host, and heme oxygenase expression can have either beneficial anti-oxidant or enhanced pathogenic effects on plant or animal hosts (Richard et al., 2019). In non-photosynthetic bacteria, heme oxygenase also produces biliverdin which is used as the chromatophore in bacteriophytochromes (Takemoto et al., 2019). It is also possible that this HO-1/diguanylate cyclase complex acts as an oxygen sensor (Martínková et al., 2013). Other functions significantly enriched in this clade include stress response genes such as heat shock protein DnaJ. KEGG pathway analysis predicted two functional pathways in all C. ginsengisoli clade species which were not present in any other Cohnella species: a pathway for carbon fixation (incomplete reductive citrate cycle) and a pathway for plant terpenoid biosynthesis (specifically beta-carotene biosynthesis). Predictive analysis of the presence of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes, Drula et al., 2022) was followed by ordination (Figure 7; Supplementary Figure S3) and heatmap generation (Supplementary Figure S4). Both heatmaps and ordinations show that strain F6_2S_P1T and its closest relatives cluster tightly together, along with C. fermenti (isolated from a fermented vegetable, Lin et al., 2020), C. phaseoli (isolated from the root nodule of a legume species, Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008), C. zeiphila (isolated from corn tissue, Johnson et al., 2021), and several undescribed strains; members of the C. ginsengisoli clade, therefore, appear to be both taxonomically similar and have similar profiles of carbohydrate-cycling genes. PERMANOVA analysis confirmed that the centroid of the C. ginsengisoli clade was significantly different from that of other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (p < 0.001). One axis out of three in the NMDS ordination clearly differentiates the C. ginsengisoli clade and the other Cohnella species mentioned above from the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (NMDS2, shown in Figure 7; Supplementary Figure S3); therefore, scores correlating CAZyme ordination vectors to this axis using the envfit function were assessed for significance, plotted, and ranked against the axis in question. Figure 7. Open in a new tab First two axes of NMDS ordination (standardization = “range,” distance = “Bray-Curtis,” maxit = 500, k = 3, stress = 0.129, R2 = 0.98) for counts of different predicted CAZymes in the genomes of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species. Also present in the figure are CAZyme vector correlations with axes 1 and 2 (not original coordinates) via envfit/Pearson's correlation with fdr correction + p < 0.01. Species belonging to the C. ginsengisoli clade and the top 4 CAZyme families/subfamilies positively correlated with axis 2 are labeled.Most strongly associated with this axis and the C. ginsengisoli clade are the CAZyme families CBM67 and GH78, which were both identified as part of the enzyme α-L-rhamnosidase which alters flavonoids and other rhamnose-containing glycosides such as pectins in plant cell walls (Yadav et al., 2010). Flavonoids are phenolic compounds produced by plants that often have medicinal or flavorful properties. α-L-rhamnosidase cleaves terminal α-rhamnose residues and in doing so helps concentrate and improve the action of flavonoids; α-L-rhamnosidase from different bacterial species is used for many industrial applications such as improving wine aroma, sweetening fruit juice, and increasing concentration and efficacy of antibiotic and anti-cancer compounds (Xie et al., 2022). The C. ginsengisoli clade and other Cohnella species enriched in α-L-rhamnosidase enzyme modules are all confirmed or likely plant symbionts or feed on plant tissue; however, since the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species appear to have at least some association with plant tissue or rhizosphere, there may be additional promising applications for these particular species in processing plant medicinal or other plant phenolic compounds. CAZymes negatively associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade (and associated mainly with Paenibacillus species) include chitosanases (GH46 and CBM12), endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GH85), and β-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GT17). Four CAZyme families associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species had an effect size of 0.5 or greater (Kruskal–Wallis); these were maltooligosaccharide-producing α-amylases (CG13_5), chondroitin AC lyase (PL8_3), and alginate lyases (PL34 and PL14_3).Presence of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T in ISS metagenomes Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces, crew capsule, and ISS HEPA filter particulates (Venkateswaran et al., 2014; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019; Urbaniak et al., 2022) were mapped to the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Most metagenomes had <0.05% of reads that mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, with a maximum of 0.22% of reads mapping to strain F6_2S_P_1T for a low-read-number sample collected from the cupola of the ISS during Flight 4 of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series. But upon examination of regions to which the metagenomic reads mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, 98+% of reads mapped to regions of 16S or 23S rRNA genes and were only considered significant by bowtie2 because of the conserved nature of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. We therefore concluded that strain F6_2S_P_1T is not dominant in the ISS environmental surfaces or air particulates collected during the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 mission series. However, molecular microbial diversity-based examination of plant and its associated materials using culturing and metagenomics would allow NASA to trace the source of this strain, since Cohnella species were reported to produce hormones that might promote growth of plants. For example, as mentioned above, Cohnella was an abundant genus in the microbiome of healthy plant tissue of chili plants grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2022).Conclusion We used multiple means of characterization, including phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional genome-prediction methods to characterize Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and place it within the established taxonomy of the genus Cohnella. Based on these data, we propose that this novel species be named C. hashimotonis. We also characterized the branch of Cohnella within which C. hashimotonis is placed and predicted functional characteristics of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade as a whole. All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.Description of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. Cohnella hashimotonis (ha.shi.mo.to.nis. masc. n. hashimotonis named in honor of Professor Hideo Hashimoto, a food microbiologist from Hiroshima Univ., Japan). Cells are endospore-forming, aerobic, and gram-positive rods, 0.5–0.6 μm in width and 0.8–100+ μm in length. In addition to normal cells, elongated, spaghetti-like cells (Figures 4D, 5B) are observed in light microscopy and SEM images. Colonies are translucent cream-colored, acquiring a pinkish tinge after multiple days of growth, and grow well on R2A but poorly on TSA. Growth occurs at between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies are weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. This species reduces nitrate to nitrite, produces dextrin from starch, and utilizes the following carbon substrates: alanine, histidine, serine, sucrose, L-arabinose, melibiose, D-fructose, inositol, and lactose. The following substances are utilized for acid production: maltose, sucrose, D-fructose, D-ribose, N-acetyl, glucosamine, lactose, and trisodium citrate. Major fatty acids composing C. hashimotonis are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%). The polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three aminophospholipids, and a phospholipid. The major quinone system is menaquinones MK-7. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid. C. hashimotonis is closely related to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli based on 16 rRNA gene sequence similarity (<99%). However, the phylogenetic position of the strain F6_2S_P_1T was resolved as a novel species due to gyrB sequence similarity (<94%), ANI (<89%), and dDDH (<35%) analyses with any other sequenced Cohnella species. GC content is 58.37%. The type strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment, i.e., the space toilet, aboard the ISS, in 2018; its genome is available on , accession number JAGRPV000000000. The type strain F6_2S_P_1T is submitted to two culture collections (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T).Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Several investigations on the microbial diversity and functional properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics.Results In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii) and one novel bacterial species (Methylobacterium ajmalii). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.Conclusions Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth.

    "introduction": "Introduction Since the publication of the first metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) in 2004 [1], MAGs have been used to confirm genomic data for taxonomic identification of uncultivated microorganisms, metabolic profiling, microbiome dynamics, and host-microbe relationships [2]. When a MAG is assembled, annotation and interpretation of genes are possible, allowing researchers to better understand the metabolic potential of the microbe, including its potential resistance to antibiotics, interactions with other microbes in the microbial community, and association with a host [3]. MAGs have been successfully used to discover uncultivated species [4], candidatus organisms like Candidatus Amarolinea aalborgensis gen. nov., sp. nov. [5], and novel genera like Spiribacter [6] and Kalamiella [7]. MAGs have also been used to recover genomic clusters of secondary metabolites [8], genetic mobility [4], metabolic pathways [9], and in situ replication [10]. Projects retrieving thousands of MAGs have also been documented to understand yet-to-be cultured microbiomes of cow rumens and other environmental samples [11]. In addition, MAGs have revealed new microbial phyla, which have expanded the tree of life [12]. Lowering sequencing cost, curated data availability in public database, and advances in computational biology have made assembling MAGs from complex and extreme environments easy. A higher number of reference genomes makes the binning easier and more reliable. Multiple best practices are available to construct accurate and complete genomes from metagenomes, but high-quality MAGs are still relatively rare. Most MAGs reported in many MAG-related papers have completeness levels between 50 and 60% [13]. Recently, MAGs generated from International Space Station (ISS) environmental metagenomes paved a way to describe a novel genus and species, Kalamiella piersonii [7]. We have retrieved four K. piersonii MAGs (100% genome sequence identity) from ISS environmental metagenomes that allowed us to identify a cultivated isolate archived from the same samples using gene-specific assays [7]. This “genome to phenome” approach enabled the differentiation of closely related genera Pantoea from Kalamiella and facilitated the isolation of several ISS strains (n = 7) that were archived and previously unidentified [7]. Furthermore, the use of MAGs and whole-genome sequences (WGS) of biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from three consecutive samplings of the ISS at eight defined locations made it possible to track the source of the original BSL-2 strain and understand the succession, persistence, and spread of this opportunistic pathogen detected in the ISS [14]. The objectives of this study were to retrieve near full-length genomes from metagenomes generated from ISS environmental samples and perform in-depth functional and phylogenetic analyses. Among 46 MAGs generated during this study, functional analyses such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence characteristic, and metabolic traits/stress responses were carried out for 20 prokaryotic MAGs. In addition to the prokaryotic MAGs (~85% completeness), this is the first-time eukaryotic MAGs (~50% completeness) were also generated from ISS metagenomes using the co-assembly strategy.",

    "results": "Results and discussion Metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes Out of the 42 ISS metagenomes submitted at , only PMA-treated metagenomes (n = 21) representing the viable/intact cells were used for generating bacterial MAGs. Characteristics of MAGs (n = 46) such as genome size (2.6 to 6.6 Mb), completeness, contamination percentage, the average mean coverage, number of scaffolds, and N50 (5 to 670 Kb) were calculated using CheckM, and assembly statistics are summarized in Table 1. Sample collection date, location, relative humidity, radiation exposure, etc. are given in Table 1, and various other details such as materials of the location and partial pressure have already been published [14, 15]. A bacterial MAG was considered acceptable during this study if CheckM completeness was more than 85% and contamination was less than 10%. When metaSPAdes was used, 20 MAGs were recovered, and housekeeping genes were used to confirm the identity, contamination, and completeness of MAGs. In addition, when metaWRAP was used, 26 MAGs were assembled from the same 21 PMA-treated ISS environmental metagenomes. When metaSPAdes and metaWRAP pipelines generated MAGs were compared, a total of 16 one-to-one matches were detected between them, suggesting these two different assembly strategies identified the identical genomes. Among the metaWRAP-assembled genomes, 11 MAGs had smaller genome sizes, which may be due to the more conservative nature of the metaWRAP procedure. The correlation between metaSPAde (20 MAGs) and metaWRAP (26 MAGs) is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 (R2 was 0.85). Table 1.

[37] bTEPC US tissue equivalent proportional counter Species assignment analysis of ISS bacterial MAGs Phylogenetic analysis of 30 unique bacterial MAGs of 46 generated showed 18 species (Table 1). The bacterial species identity was based on the average nucleotide index (ANI; > 95%) of MAGs compared with the corresponding type strain. The majority of the MAGs (22 out of 46) belonged to the members of the order Enterobacterales and matched with six established enterobacterial species. In addition, MAGs from spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus 1 MAG; Paenibacillus 4 MAGs); human skin microbes, e.g., Staphylococcus (8 MAGs); and actinobacterial (4 MAGs) members were retrieved. However, 11 MAGs were not identified to any of the genomes of well-established bacterial species. Subsequently, the gyrB gene [39] sequences were pulled from the MAGs and screened with sequences of a large number of ISS isolates (n = 500 strains) archived in our culture collection. The ISS strains that exhibited the highest gyrB sequence similarity (> 95%) were further sequenced for the whole genome and compared with the above 11 MAGs. This “metagenome to phenome” approach has enabled the description of one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii; 8 MAGs; Singh et al., [7]) and another novel bacterial species, Methylobacterium ajmalii (n = 3 MAGs; Bijlani et al., 2021). Interestingly, Sphingomonadaceae MAGs retrieved from F2-7P samples that matched with yet to be identified Sphingomonas sp. K11 strain genome (GenBank no. CP013916.1) also matched with the WGS of three ISS strains isolated from the same location (flight no. 2, location no. 7). These were identified as Sphingomonas sanguinis, and functional characteristics were established, and production of plant growth-promoting substances was identified [40]. Metagenome-assembled fungal genomes Conventional tools for MAG assembly are historically not meant for eukaryotic MAG assembly (strategy 1). Additionally, the sequencing depth requirement for eukaryotic MAG assembly is much higher compared to the prokaryotic genomes. We used a co-assembly-based analysis (strategy 2), using the tool ANVIO [18] on the complete ISS dataset containing both the PMA-treated and untreated samples to increase the available data to accommodate eukaryotic MAG assembly. In an effort to make strategy 2 completely independent from strategy 1, the process was rerun using the ANVIO tool from the very initial step of read trimming and filtering. The minimum contig length considered to be included in the data was 1000 bp. The merged profile database that was generated with the minimum contig length of 1000 contained 40,455 contigs, which corresponded to 100% of all contigs, and 100% of all nucleotides found in the contigs database generated during the process. Out of the 84 bins, four bins were classified into the eukaryotic domain. As per the minimum requirement for MAG, completeness should be ≥ 50%, and contamination should be ≤ 10% [41]. Two out of four genomes did not have the required 50% completeness, while the other two were subjected to genome refinement to reduce the redundancy below 10%. After genome evaluation with BUSCO, only four genome bins met the minimal standard for draft MAG, i.e., bins 7, 12, 60, and 73 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Local phylogeny showing placement of the Bin7 MAG, based on a larger phylogeny embracing 145 Tremellomycetes taxa (class where members of the genus Naganishia in nested within). Position (in red) relative to its closest clade (in blue) is shownThe four fungal MAGs (Bin7, Bin12, Bin60, and Bin73) could be assigned to the species level by BLASTn searches plus Mash distance comparisons. Bin12 had four (among five) random genomic segments of 2000 bp matching Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (ATCC 58901) > 99.9% hit identity, and the remaining segment corresponding Rhodotorula sp. (CCFEE 5036). Bin12 Mash distance against the most complete assembly of this species (R. mucilaginosa IF1SW-B1, an ISS strain; GCA_013036955.1) was 0.0049, well below the 0.04 Mash distance threshold for k-mer sizes between 16 and 22 bp [32], and therefore confirming it as R. mucilaginosa (Table 2). Regarding Bin60, the five BLASTn searches matched Penicillium chrysogenum (genome Wisconsin 54-1255; GCA_000710275.1) with percent similarity in the range 98.4–99.95% for the five segments. Mash confirmed the species, with a distance value of 0.007 (Table 2). Regarding Bin73, the five BLASTn searches matched Papiliotrema laurentii 5307AH v1.0 with a low Mash distance which confirmed the species as P. laurentii and also showed high relationship with the genome of an ISS isolate IF7SW-B5 (GCA_012922625.1; Table 2). Regarding Bin7, BLASTn searches resulted in close matches to members of the Naganishia genus. Mash distance calculation against the six closest genomes of this genus (four Naganishia tulchinskyi and two Naganishia liquefaciens) showed that Bin7 can be assigned to species N. tulchinskyi (Table 2); for this bin, a phylogenetic analysis was also carried out confirming the N. tulchinskyi classification (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that the “metagenome to phenome” approach applied for the bacterial MAGs also enabled the description of a novel yeast, N. tulchinskyi, from the ISS samples [42]. Table 2.

They are as follows: Acinetobacter pittii, E. bugandensis, K. piersonii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, M. ajmalii, and S. aureus. The BRIG analysis revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across genomes of the ISS isolates and MAGs, when compared against their type strain genomes (Fig. 2). Additionally, patterns of GC content for each bacterial species tested were highly similar to that of their respective type strain. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Comparisons of genome assemblies from isolates (purple) and MAGs (blue) against their respective type strains using BRIG. Innermost rings correspond to the pseudo-coordinates of the concatenated reference assemblies and their respective sliding GC content. Ordering of the blast comparisons of each of the assemblies is displayed for the isolates (purple, right) and MAGs (blue, left), ordered from innermost to outermost blast comparison ring. The outermost plot in each figure highlights annotations of relevant markers. Nucleotide identities generated by blastn are color coded for each assembly, with upper identity and lower identity cutoffs at 90% and 80%, respectively, and a minimum e-value of 1e-05. Comparative phylogenetic analysis reveals evolution The possible evolution in the ISS microorganisms was investigated with a careful species-by-species phylogenetic analysis. In this exercise, the following criteria were used: (i) ISS isolates, (ii) ISS MAGs, and (iii) at least one Earth-origin reference genome. The resulting candidate species genome data are shown in Supplementary Table S2, and they belong to K. piersonii, K. quasipneumoniae, P. brenneri, S. aureus, and S. saprophyticus. The phylogenetic analyses for those five species showed that ISS genomes (isolates and MAGs) are always monophyletic. This is already suggestive of ISS-specific evolution. For two of those trees (Kalamiella and Pantoea), there were not enough Earth-origin genomes available (Supplementary Fig. S2). With reference to the Staphylococcus aureus and K. quasipneumoniae phylogenetic analysis with core genes, the inferred tree contains two ISS clades (Fig. 3 A and C, respectively), suggesting in both cases at least two separate introductions from an Earth source. However, for S Staphylococcus saprophyticus, all ISS genomes were placed within a single clade (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of A S. aureus, B S. saprophyticus, and C Klebsiella quasipneumoniae. Clades in red contain only ISS genomesThe single-copy genes specific to either the ISS genomes or the Earth-origin genomes were checked and found none. Furthermore, mutation (indels and substitutions) analyses were carried out that were specific to the ISS clades. The amino acid substitutions that changed a hydrophobic amino acid into a hydrophilic one or vice versa were checked and found many changes. The genes affected by these changes were analyzed in terms of Gene Ontology classifications (Biological Process only; Supplementary Fig. S3). The two ISS-specific clades of the S. aureus tree allowed us to compare the two clades in terms of indels. There were 63 indels found to be shared by both clades of S. aureus, as opposed to 14 indels specific to clade 1 and 57 specific to clade 2. The GO analysis of the genes affected by the 63 shared indels resulted in 10 GO terms (Supplementary Fig. S4). Many of the GO terms with high frequency that resulted from these analyses are related to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape. This is consistent with previous reports regarding the effects of microgravity on cellular morphology, proliferation, and adhesion [43]. Taken together, the present results exhibit strong evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution. Gene-based functional analysis Variations in the AMR and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs have been summarized in Supplemental Table S1. Since multiple studies show that the microbial virulence increases in microgravity [44, 45], AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of type strains and ISS isolates [46, 47]. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the E. bugandensis F1-2P MAG, whereas these were not present in the other MAGs of BSL-2 microorganisms studied during this study. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in the ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Comparative analyses of MAG and WGS of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity. Among 20 MAGs processed, 13 AMR genes were found to be the most prominent among the bacteria (Table 3). These 13 genes were housekeeping genes and have a unique, specialized role determined by their protein type and function. For example, the LSU ribosomal unit is the primary site where protein synthesis occurs in the translation process. Other genes include copper translocating P-type ATPase, DNA gyrase subunits A and B, LSU ribosomal unit 20p and 35p, SSU ribosomal unit 7p, and 12p, DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta subunit, topoisomerase IV subunits A and B, translation initiation factor 3, translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and translation elongation factor G (EF-G). Functions of genes characterized during this study are given in Supplemental Table S2. Single-nucleotide variation (SNV) among these 13 housekeeping genes in MAGs of six different bacterial species are summarized below. Table 3.

The subsystem features include genes responsible for various metabolisms, in which genes responsible for carbohydrates and amino acids metabolism were high. Genes related to motility and chemotaxis were absent in the members of the genera Acinetobacter, Kocuria, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella. In contrast, genes associated with stress response were present in high numbers (90 to 167 genes) within members of family Enterobacteriaceae, whereas such genes were less abundant (19 to 75 genes) with Staphylococcus and actinobacterial species. Similarly, sporulation and dormancy genes were mainly present in Paenibacillus polymyxa, since they are the only spore-forming bacterium MAG found. Table 4.

Likewise, MAGs of Pseudomonas brenneri (F1-5P and F2-5P) and Pantoea dispersa (F3-4P) had positional variation compared to their type strains (LMG 24534T and DSM 30073T, respectively). In contrast, no sequence variation in the copper translocating P-type ATPase was noticed when analyzing the WGS of the S. aureus ATCC12600T type strain, a nosocomial isolate, and S. aureus MAGs (F1-4P and F2-8P). Similarly, K. pneumoniae MAG F3-3P had no SNVs compared to its type strain ATCC 13883T. Acinetobacter pittii F2-1P MAG had maximum similarity of copper translocating P-type ATPase sequence with not only its type strain DSM 25618T but also with Acinetobacter baumannii DSM 30007T which was isolated from human urine. WGS of the novel species K. piersonii, whose type strain IIIF1SW-P2T was also isolated from location no. 1 of the ISS [7], was compared with the MAGs (F3-1P, F3-5P, F3-7P, and F3-8P). This comparison exhibited the same genetic composition, which confirms that the MAGs might have originated from the living cells. In addition, the comparative genomic analysis of the uropathogenic strain of K. piersonii strain YU22, isolated from human urine [48], revealed no SNVs.DNA gyrase subunit A To observe positional sequence variation in the DNA gyrase subunit A, S. aureus MAG F2-8P was compared with the genomes of the type strain ATCC 12600T, isolated from pleural fluid, and most SNPs were found.

There were no SNPs found in K. pneumoniae F3-3P, but SNPs were found in A. pittii F2-1P with strain ST220 which was retrieved from sputum. P. brenneri F2-5P has no SNPs.Translation elongation factor Tu S. aureus F2-8P had SNPs found in strain AR071, and the rest of the S. aureus F1-4P MAG has SNPs in ATCC 12600. E. bugandensis F1-2P had scattered SNPs, but Klebsiella strains have no SNPs. P. brenneri F2-5P and K. piersonii MAGs (F3-1P and F3-7P) have SNPs when compared to the type strain. K. piersonii F3-5P had SNPs found in Pantoea stewartii strain DC283, whereas K. piersonii MAG F3-8P did not have any SNPs. P. dispersa MAG F3-4P has SNPs in Pantoea rwandensis strain ND04. A. pittii was extremely dissimilar to its type strain. Many SNPs found in these 333 alignments have been found in the Earth homologs. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the most SNPs found within the ISS strain. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. More epigenetic and chemical analyses are needed to understand why members of these species are particularly sensitive to these conditions. The difference may also lie in the low percent identity the Earth homologs had. In regards to the Staphylococcus strains, ATCC12600 and GD1108 are both nosocomial strains which seem to act differently in each gene. For example, in some genes, ATCC12600 exhibits SNPs, while GD1108 is the only Earth homolog that has the exact same sequence as the ISS strain. Strain GD1108 was isolated from a school child from a prevalence survey in 2011 in Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China [50]. Common SNPs were not found between the ISS and homolog strains within alignments. SNPs in Earth homologs symbolize differences in where the strain was found from. For example, Earth homologs that are found in soil exhibit very different sequences with the ISS strain, therefore explaining the SNPs. In addition, most SNPs have been found in human fluids as well as soil/plants with a few animal excretions. This demonstrates that the ISS strain has some nosocomial/soil background in relation to the rest of the alignment. Strains that are similar/dissimilar to the ISS strain show no common isolation source for the most part. Therefore, more biochemical analyses on the molecular level are needed. In MAG gene analysis (Supplemental Table S1), it was observed that similar genes were responsible for antibiotic resistance and virulence. This common gene-based resistant phenomenon suggests that changes are an adaptation strategy in microbes. Genes related to biofilm characteristics Biofilm forming and quorum-sensing (QS) genes analyzed in this study and their predicted functions are tabulated in Supplemental Table S2. Sequences of all four E. bungandensis ISS strains and the MAG (F1-2P) exhibited 100% sequence similarities among them for the genes responsible for biofilm (pgaABCD) and QS (LsrABCD, LsrR, LsrK, and AI-LuxS) functions. The variable residues (SNPs) of genes related to biofilm formation and QS-related genes in E. bungandensis MAG when compared to E. bugandensis strains (n = 11) isolated from clinical samples are given in Table 5. The comparative sequence analysis of E. bugandensis MAG shows that the biofilm and QS genes are highly conserved (< 1% SNPs variation) across most of the clinical strains of E. bugandensis (n = 10). This pattern is also consistent with the neighbor-joining tree of each one of these genes for all the strains tested and one MAG (data not shown). These analyses confirmed that E. bugandensis strains might have hitch-hiked with the healthy crew and landed on ISS surfaces. In contrast, the sequence variation of all biofilm and QS genes of E. bugandensis strain MBRL 1077 was highly variable (2.4 to 25%). The average nucleic acid index (ANI) of MBRL 1077 and the E. bugandensis type strain EB-247 were ~95%, whereas the ANI was > 99% for the other 10 clinical strains, four ISS isolates, and one MAG. The higher SNPs and lower ANI values of MBRL 1077 strain with all other 14 strains and one MAG suggested that MBRL 1077 might not belong to E. bugandensis. Table 5.

This result is interesting because this gene codes for the autoinducer proteins which are very important for carrying signals [51]. In that regard, environmental stress would have no effect on that gene since a change in the gene sequence would not serve to increase the rate of biofilm production and increase the overall amount of biofilm formed, but we can also see that there is a decent amount of amino acid change in the LsrC gene which is responsible for importing the autoinducer, and this makes sense because while the autoinducer itself does not need to be changed, the rate at which it is imported to carry information needs to be increased or reduced to accommodate for the change in the amount of biofilm produced. On the other hand, changes in the nucleotide sequence of the pgaA and pgaB genes, along with the LsrK gene, lead to high amino acid change. This could serve as a strong indication of these organisms trying to adjust to the environmental stress because the pgaA and pgaB are responsible for transporting the PGA essential in the movement of adhesin out of the periplasm to form the biofilm. Also, the LsrK is responsible for repressing the LsrR repressor, and increasing the function of all three genes will aid in increased signal for biofilm to be formed faster, as well as increase the rate of biofilm formation.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusion In summary, good quality bacterial and fungal MAGs were generated from ISS environmental samples, and functional properties were predicted. Furthermore, it was possible to describe novel microbial (two bacterial and one yeast) species via the “metagenome to phenome” approach. The monophyletic phylogeny exhibited by the ISS genomes (both isolates and MAGs) suggested that they shared a single common ancestor. The molecules pertaining to the cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were in high frequency in ISS genomes demonstrating evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution. The common gene-based resistance phenomenon noticed in this study suggests that SNP changes in MAGs and ISS genomes might be an adaptation strategy in AMR and biofilm formation in microbes. Similarly, variations found in the AMR and virulence genes enabled the prediction of the ecology and evolution of microorganisms in space. The maximum SNPs characterized for the ISS Pantoea/Kalamiella strains suggested that enterobacterial species are much more subjective to microgravity changes. However, fixation of environmental samples in space for RNAseq approach and/or in situ sequencing in space are warranted to confirm variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity. More studies are needed to unearth whether SNPs seen in ISS MAGs are due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.",

Copyright notice ID: 10233975 PMID: 37264385 Abstract Background Several investigations on the microbial diversity and functional properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics.Results In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii) and one novel bacterial species (Methylobacterium ajmalii). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.Conclusions Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth.

When a MAG is assembled, annotation and interpretation of genes are possible, allowing researchers to better understand the metabolic potential of the microbe, including its potential resistance to antibiotics, interactions with other microbes in the microbial community, and association with a host [3]. MAGs have been successfully used to discover uncultivated species [4], candidatus organisms like Candidatus Amarolinea aalborgensis gen. nov., sp. nov. [5], and novel genera like Spiribacter [6] and Kalamiella [7]. MAGs have also been used to recover genomic clusters of secondary metabolites [8], genetic mobility [4], metabolic pathways [9], and in situ replication [10]. Projects retrieving thousands of MAGs have also been documented to understand yet-to-be cultured microbiomes of cow rumens and other environmental samples [11]. In addition, MAGs have revealed new microbial phyla, which have expanded the tree of life [12]. Lowering sequencing cost, curated data availability in public database, and advances in computational biology have made assembling MAGs from complex and extreme environments easy. A higher number of reference genomes makes the binning easier and more reliable. Multiple best practices are available to construct accurate and complete genomes from metagenomes, but high-quality MAGs are still relatively rare. Most MAGs reported in many MAG-related papers have completeness levels between 50 and 60% [13]. Recently, MAGs generated from International Space Station (ISS) environmental metagenomes paved a way to describe a novel genus and species, Kalamiella piersonii [7]. We have retrieved four K. piersonii MAGs (100% genome sequence identity) from ISS environmental metagenomes that allowed us to identify a cultivated isolate archived from the same samples using gene-specific assays [7]. This “genome to phenome” approach enabled the differentiation of closely related genera Pantoea from Kalamiella and facilitated the isolation of several ISS strains (n = 7) that were archived and previously unidentified [7]. Furthermore, the use of MAGs and whole-genome sequences (WGS) of biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from three consecutive samplings of the ISS at eight defined locations made it possible to track the source of the original BSL-2 strain and understand the succession, persistence, and spread of this opportunistic pathogen detected in the ISS [14]. The objectives of this study were to retrieve near full-length genomes from metagenomes generated from ISS environmental samples and perform in-depth functional and phylogenetic analyses. Among 46 MAGs generated during this study, functional analyses such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), virulence characteristic, and metabolic traits/stress responses were carried out for 20 prokaryotic MAGs. In addition to the prokaryotic MAGs (~85% completeness), this is the first-time eukaryotic MAGs (~50% completeness) were also generated from ISS metagenomes using the co-assembly strategy.Material and methods Data source and sample description Data used for this study were acquired from the  () Short Read Archive under the bio-project number PRJNA438545. A detailed description of shotgun metagenome sequencing and ISS locations sampled were published elsewhere [14]. In this research communication, we utilized shotgun metagenome reads generated from the propidium monoazide (PMA)-treated samples only [15] to understand whether these MAGs were stemming from the viable and intact cells. However, for eukaryotic analysis, we used shotgun metagenome reads from both PMA and non-PMA-treated samples.Metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes Paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads were processed with Trimmomatic [16] to remove adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with a minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of the read used as a quality cutoff. Reads shorter than 80 bp were removed after trimming. The remaining high-quality reads were subsequently assembled using metaSPAdes [17]. Contigs were binned using Metabat2 [v. 2.11.3] [18]. Recovered genomes were evaluated with CheckM [19], and a recovered genome was considered good with ~85% completeness and at most 10% contamination. Each genome was subsequently annotated with the help of Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST), and taxonomic identifications and phylogenetic affiliations were predicted [20]. In addition to running the procedure above, we also ran the metaWRAP pipeline on the same datasets, using default parameters [21]. In order to test for assemblies suspected to be the same among the 20 metaSPAdes genomes and the set of genomes obtained using metaWRAP for the same set of reads (“meta-set”), we compared both assembly sets using Mash [22] distances. Then, we kept only the best MAG under a Mash distance < = 0.05 (corresponds to average nucleotide identity, ANI > = 95%). After gathering the relevant reference genomes and MAGs, Amphora2 [23] was employed to retrieve a protein set composed of 31 universal bacterial markers, which were then aligned by Muscle [24]. Finally, a phylogeny was inferred by maximum likelihood using the concatenated dataset under IQTREE [25] with a concomitant search for the best evolutionary protein model. For each sample, our final list of bacterial MAGs contains only those MAGs that were considered distinct from one another. When two MAGs were considered “the same” for a given sample, we chose the metaSPAdes version.Phylogenetic comparison of the ISS bacterial MAGs obtained by the two methods MAGs assembled from the ISS dataset by two methods (metaSPAdes metaWRAP) were tested for the phylogenetic clustering within the same species clade. All assemblies from both methods were positioned according to the most exclusive clade in the Bacteria Tree of Life to which individual Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) classifications matched (e.g., the most exclusive taxonomic group containing Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Paenibacillus would be Bacillales). After defining such taxonomic groups, a new phylogeny was estimated for each of them. Besides the reconstructed genomes themselves, for each supposed species, we also added three reference genomes from  of the same species (picked sparsely and randomly from its automatically generated species dendrogram tree) while also including two/three other species from the same genus (at least a close species and a not too distant one), each of them being represented by three sparse genomes in their respective species dendrograms. Such an analysis is liberal enough to indicate whether different assemblies from the same reads would indeed cluster together.Metagenome-assembled fungal genomes One of the main focus of this study was assembling eukaryotic genomes from the ISS metagenome. When tools to construct prokaryotic MAGs were used, eukaryotic MAGs were low quality, and results were not satisfactory to identify them as fungal genomes. Additionally, the availability of reference data falls short for eukaryotic genome assembly. To overcome this, we used a completely independent co-assembly-based strategy in the tool ANVIO [18] on the complete ISS dataset using PMA-treated and untreated samples. All the steps were followed as per the step-by-step metagenomic procedure available on the ANVIO website (http://merenlab.org/2016/06/22/anvio-tutorial-v2/). In short, quality filtering was carried out using the script iu-filter-quality-minoche. MEGAHIT [26]-based co-assembly was performed on the quality-filtered reads from the 42 samples. Names in the co-assembled fasta file were simplified using the script anvi-script-reformat-fasta. A contig database was generated using “anvi-gen-contigs-database.” The contig database was run through hidden Markov models (HMM) based HMMER [27].  – COG was used to identify the genes in the co-assembly fasta files. Individual profiles were generated for each sample using anvi-profile and anvi-merge to cluster all the profiles using Euclidean distance and Ward’s linkage algorithm. Final results of co-assembly bins in ANVIO tools were interactively visualized using anvi-interactive. All ANVIO results were exported in the summary format for further downstream processing. Each bin generated in ANVIO profiles was treated as an individual genome, and quality was assessed using CheckM. To establish the taxonomic identification of each bin, they were further subjected to GTDB-Tk (Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit) [28]. All the bins were compared with 24,706 genomes constituting 8792 validly published bacterial species (https://www.bacterio.net/). GTDB-Tk can only identify prokaryotic genomes; hence, all the bins not defined by the GTDB-Tk were considered as eukaryotic taxa and further manually curated for genomic identification. Determining the closest fungal species to each MAG was carried out in three steps. First, we used BLASTn to search GenBank, aimed at circumscribing the innermost taxonomic rank quickly (e.g., genus if multiple species within that genus were found across different BLAST hits or family if different genera within the family are found in the BLAST hits). For this search, five different BLASTn searches were performed per MAG. For each such BLASTn search, a random genomic segment of 2000 bp was chosen while also certifying that this segment is within a minimum of 1000 bp from its respective contig end (to minimize possible assembly issues that are more prevalent at contig edges). Secondly, for those MAGs whose BLAST results were not hitting a single species, phylogenomic analysis was employed with all assemblies/genomes within that innermost rank (as described above) found in either GenBank or Joint Genome Institute (JGI) MycoCosm (with at most three genomes per species). A set of 758 conserved proteins across fungi, available from the BUSCO pipeline [29] (database: fungi_odb10), were sought in every assembly. Because there can be differences in the number of BUSCO genes found per genome, due to variation in assembly completeness, we built a subset of the dataset where each protein is present in at least 1/3 of the MAGs, reference genomes, and two previously chosen outgroups (Ustilago maydis and Dacryopinax primogenitus) used for proper rooting of the phylogeny. Multiple alignments per gene were carried out using Mafft [30]. Two alternative species tree inference analyses were performed, one IQ, and another inference done by Astral [31], which is based on an amalgamation of quartet trees sampled from each individual gene tree (where each of the 758 gene trees had been previously estimated in IQ-TREE). Thirdly, Mash distances [22] were computed to confirm the species (either MAGs that went through phylogenomic analyses or MAGs assigned to a single species in the first BLASTn step). According to Gostinčar [32], a Mash distance below 0.04 is sufficient to assign any two fungal genomes to the same species for k-mer sizes between 16 and 22 bp [32].Comparative phylogenetic analysis In order to include a background of Earth-origin genomes to anchor ISS genomes, and therefore pinpoint where in the phylogeny of ISS microorganisms evolved from, we searched in GenBank for genomes of Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Kalamiella piersonii, and Pantoea brenneri. When available, two genomes of each species per year were retrieved and used in the analysis. Get_Homologues [33] was used to cluster protein-coding genes into gene families. Unicopy genes (i.e., genes with a single copy in every included genome of the species) were then retrieved to build the phylogenetic trees per species and to further assess amino acid changes. Mafft [30] with default parameters was used to obtain multiple alignments for each gene family. Alignments were then concatenated into a supermatrix using FASconCat [34]. IQ-TREE [25] was used to infer the phylogeny from this supermatrix, using a LG + I + G model and 1000 ultra-fast bootstraps to assess branch support. In-house python scripts were used to annotate amino acid substitutions and indels (i.e., events of either insertion or deletion of amino acids). Pannzer 2 [35] was used to gather GO information (minimum query and subject cover of 80%, minimum alignment length of 50 aa; other parameters as default) for all genes having amino acid point substitutions that changed hydrophobicity (i.e., from hydrophobic to hydrophilic or vice versa). Such substitutions are more susceptible of being under natural selection, because they have a higher probability of having an impact on the three-dimensional protein structure.Comparative functional analysis Genome assemblies and associated RefSeq annotations for each strain were downloaded from ’s RefSeq database. Due to their exclusion from the RefSeq database, the meta-genome-assembled genomes (MAGs) assemblies and associated annotations were downloaded from their original GenBank accessions. For each of the species of interest in this study, representative type strains were selected for comparison. To compare nucleotide-level identities for each of the analyzed genomes against their respective type strains, BLASTn (−evalue 1e-05) alignments were conducted and visualized with BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG), version 0.95 [36]. BLASTn identities were color coded according to the origin of the genome assembly for ISS isolates (purple) or MAGs (blue), with the intensity of their color corresponding to custom percent identity cutoffs (high: 90%, lower: 80%, minimum: 50%). To assess the completeness of each assembly, the open reading frames (ORFs) of 13 housekeeping genes were identified for each species reference genome using keyword searches of the feature_table.txt file included with each assembly: DNA gyrase subunit A (gyrA), DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB), 50S ribosomal protein L35 (rpmI), 50S ribosomal protein L20 (rplT), 30S ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL), 30S ribosomal protein S7 (rpsG), DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoB), DNA topoisomerase IV subunit A (parC), DNA topoisomerase IV subunit B (parE), translation initiation factor IF-3 (infC), elongation factor Tu (tuf), elongation factor G (fusA), and cation translocating P-type ATPase (mgtA, zntA, actP, cadA, copB). Of note, to render MAGs with multiple contigs, BRIG orders each contig into a contiguous assembly to be displayed as a single circular chromosome, causing contig-relative start and end coordinates provided in the assembly feature_table.txt file to not necessarily match the absolute coordinates generated by BRIG. Thus, a custom code was written to transpose the housekeeping genes’ contig-relative start and end coordinates into the absolute coordinates assigned by BRIG. These absolute ORF coordinates were then used as annotations to display on the reference genome on the outermost layer of each BRIG figure. The associated code used to identify these features and convert their coordinates can be found here: https://github.com/jlombo96/MAG_2023_Code.Gene-based AMR and biofilm study Selected genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation were studied. AMR genes were selected based on the abundance in various MAGs, while E. bugandensis MAG was chosen for biofilm formation based on the previously reported studies [37]. All AMR gene sequences found in the 20 annotated MAGs were tabulated for comparative analysis. Genes include DNA gyrase and LSU and SSU ribosomal protein units. All identified genes were put into  Nucleotide BLAST (RefSeq), and the top hits with ≥ 98% identity cutoff were compiled in a fasta text file for analysis using MEGA 7 [38]. The genes were aligned using ClusterW, and the Neighbor-Joining algorithm was used to make phylogenetic trees. Nosocomial (hospital/Earth) strains were used for comparison to the MAGs since AMR has been reported to increase under microgravity [14]. The  database was used to derive WGS of E. bugandensis. DSMZ and LPSN were used to determine the type strains. Identified strains of E. bugandensis were analyzed using the IMG JGI database and used to search for biofilm-forming genes (pgaA, pgaB, pgaC, pgaD) and quorum-sensing genes (LsrK, LsrA, AI-2 luxS, LsrF, LsrB, LsrC, LsrD, LsrG, LsrR). All gene sequences were downloaded as a fasta file per strain for downstream alignment analysis. All downloaded fasta sequences for the biofilm and quorum-sensing genes of all the E. bugandensis (n = 15 + 1MAG) of interest were used for phylogenetic analysis with the MEGA7 software package. The downloaded fasta sequence for each gene (n = 13) in the E. bugandensis strains was aligned, conserved sites within that specific gene were observed across all strains versus the ISS isolates, and the variable sites were also observed and quantified for that particular gene. All areas of interest in the aligned sequences were highlighted and observed for nucleotide differences in each of the 16 strains that are different from that of the EB-247T, which is the type strain of the genus. The position of the nucleotide change in the codon was observed to see if it is in the first, second, or third position to determine if it would lead to a synonymous mutation or a new amino acid formation. MEGA7 software using the aligned gene sequence was used to create a neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree for each gene with the bootstrap data set at 1000.Results and discussion Metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes Out of the 42 ISS metagenomes submitted at , only PMA-treated metagenomes (n = 21) representing the viable/intact cells were used for generating bacterial MAGs. Characteristics of MAGs (n = 46) such as genome size (2.6 to 6.6 Mb), completeness, contamination percentage, the average mean coverage, number of scaffolds, and N50 (5 to 670 Kb) were calculated using CheckM, and assembly statistics are summarized in Table 1. Sample collection date, location, relative humidity, radiation exposure, etc. are given in Table 1, and various other details such as materials of the location and partial pressure have already been published [14, 15]. A bacterial MAG was considered acceptable during this study if CheckM completeness was more than 85% and contamination was less than 10%. When metaSPAdes was used, 20 MAGs were recovered, and housekeeping genes were used to confirm the identity, contamination, and completeness of MAGs. In addition, when metaWRAP was used, 26 MAGs were assembled from the same 21 PMA-treated ISS environmental metagenomes. When metaSPAdes and metaWRAP pipelines generated MAGs were compared, a total of 16 one-to-one matches were detected between them, suggesting these two different assembly strategies identified the identical genomes. Among the metaWRAP-assembled genomes, 11 MAGs had smaller genome sizes, which may be due to the more conservative nature of the metaWRAP procedure. The correlation between metaSPAde (20 MAGs) and metaWRAP (26 MAGs) is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 (R2 was 0.85). Table 1.

[37] bTEPC US tissue equivalent proportional counter Species assignment analysis of ISS bacterial MAGs Phylogenetic analysis of 30 unique bacterial MAGs of 46 generated showed 18 species (Table 1). The bacterial species identity was based on the average nucleotide index (ANI; > 95%) of MAGs compared with the corresponding type strain. The majority of the MAGs (22 out of 46) belonged to the members of the order Enterobacterales and matched with six established enterobacterial species. In addition, MAGs from spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus 1 MAG; Paenibacillus 4 MAGs); human skin microbes, e.g., Staphylococcus (8 MAGs); and actinobacterial (4 MAGs) members were retrieved. However, 11 MAGs were not identified to any of the genomes of well-established bacterial species. Subsequently, the gyrB gene [39] sequences were pulled from the MAGs and screened with sequences of a large number of ISS isolates (n = 500 strains) archived in our culture collection. The ISS strains that exhibited the highest gyrB sequence similarity (> 95%) were further sequenced for the whole genome and compared with the above 11 MAGs. This “metagenome to phenome” approach has enabled the description of one novel genus/species combination (Kalamiella piersonii; 8 MAGs; Singh et al., [7]) and another novel bacterial species, Methylobacterium ajmalii (n = 3 MAGs; Bijlani et al., 2021). Interestingly, Sphingomonadaceae MAGs retrieved from F2-7P samples that matched with yet to be identified Sphingomonas sp. K11 strain genome (GenBank no. CP013916.1) also matched with the WGS of three ISS strains isolated from the same location (flight no. 2, location no. 7). These were identified as Sphingomonas sanguinis, and functional characteristics were established, and production of plant growth-promoting substances was identified [40].Metagenome-assembled fungal genomes Conventional tools for MAG assembly are historically not meant for eukaryotic MAG assembly (strategy 1). Additionally, the sequencing depth requirement for eukaryotic MAG assembly is much higher compared to the prokaryotic genomes. We used a co-assembly-based analysis (strategy 2), using the tool ANVIO [18] on the complete ISS dataset containing both the PMA-treated and untreated samples to increase the available data to accommodate eukaryotic MAG assembly. In an effort to make strategy 2 completely independent from strategy 1, the process was rerun using the ANVIO tool from the very initial step of read trimming and filtering. The minimum contig length considered to be included in the data was 1000 bp. The merged profile database that was generated with the minimum contig length of 1000 contained 40,455 contigs, which corresponded to 100% of all contigs, and 100% of all nucleotides found in the contigs database generated during the process. Out of the 84 bins, four bins were classified into the eukaryotic domain. As per the minimum requirement for MAG, completeness should be ≥ 50%, and contamination should be ≤ 10% [41]. Two out of four genomes did not have the required 50% completeness, while the other two were subjected to genome refinement to reduce the redundancy below 10%. After genome evaluation with BUSCO, only four genome bins met the minimal standard for draft MAG, i.e., bins 7, 12, 60, and 73 (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Local phylogeny showing placement of the Bin7 MAG, based on a larger phylogeny embracing 145 Tremellomycetes taxa (class where members of the genus Naganishia in nested within). Position (in red) relative to its closest clade (in blue) is shownThe four fungal MAGs (Bin7, Bin12, Bin60, and Bin73) could be assigned to the species level by BLASTn searches plus Mash distance comparisons. Bin12 had four (among five) random genomic segments of 2000 bp matching Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (ATCC 58901) > 99.9% hit identity, and the remaining segment corresponding Rhodotorula sp. (CCFEE 5036). Bin12 Mash distance against the most complete assembly of this species (R. mucilaginosa IF1SW-B1, an ISS strain; GCA_013036955.1) was 0.0049, well below the 0.04 Mash distance threshold for k-mer sizes between 16 and 22 bp [32], and therefore confirming it as R. mucilaginosa (Table 2). Regarding Bin60, the five BLASTn searches matched Penicillium chrysogenum (genome Wisconsin 54-1255; GCA_000710275.1) with percent similarity in the range 98.4–99.95% for the five segments. Mash confirmed the species, with a distance value of 0.007 (Table 2). Regarding Bin73, the five BLASTn searches matched Papiliotrema laurentii 5307AH v1.0 with a low Mash distance which confirmed the species as P. laurentii and also showed high relationship with the genome of an ISS isolate IF7SW-B5 (GCA_012922625.1; Table 2). Regarding Bin7, BLASTn searches resulted in close matches to members of the Naganishia genus. Mash distance calculation against the six closest genomes of this genus (four Naganishia tulchinskyi and two Naganishia liquefaciens) showed that Bin7 can be assigned to species N. tulchinskyi (Table 2); for this bin, a phylogenetic analysis was also carried out confirming the N. tulchinskyi classification (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that the “metagenome to phenome” approach applied for the bacterial MAGs also enabled the description of a novel yeast, N. tulchinskyi, from the ISS samples [42]. Table 2.

They are as follows: Acinetobacter pittii, E. bugandensis, K. piersonii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, M. ajmalii, and S. aureus. The BRIG analysis revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across genomes of the ISS isolates and MAGs, when compared against their type strain genomes (Fig. 2). Additionally, patterns of GC content for each bacterial species tested were highly similar to that of their respective type strain. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Comparisons of genome assemblies from isolates (purple) and MAGs (blue) against their respective type strains using BRIG. Innermost rings correspond to the pseudo-coordinates of the concatenated reference assemblies and their respective sliding GC content. Ordering of the blast comparisons of each of the assemblies is displayed for the isolates (purple, right) and MAGs (blue, left), ordered from innermost to outermost blast comparison ring. The outermost plot in each figure highlights annotations of relevant markers. Nucleotide identities generated by blastn are color coded for each assembly, with upper identity and lower identity cutoffs at 90% and 80%, respectively, and a minimum e-value of 1e-05.Comparative phylogenetic analysis reveals evolution The possible evolution in the ISS microorganisms was investigated with a careful species-by-species phylogenetic analysis. In this exercise, the following criteria were used: (i) ISS isolates, (ii) ISS MAGs, and (iii) at least one Earth-origin reference genome. The resulting candidate species genome data are shown in Supplementary Table S2, and they belong to K. piersonii, K. quasipneumoniae, P. brenneri, S. aureus, and S. saprophyticus. The phylogenetic analyses for those five species showed that ISS genomes (isolates and MAGs) are always monophyletic. This is already suggestive of ISS-specific evolution. For two of those trees (Kalamiella and Pantoea), there were not enough Earth-origin genomes available (Supplementary Fig. S2). With reference to the Staphylococcus aureus and K. quasipneumoniae phylogenetic analysis with core genes, the inferred tree contains two ISS clades (Fig. 3 A and C, respectively), suggesting in both cases at least two separate introductions from an Earth source. However, for S Staphylococcus saprophyticus, all ISS genomes were placed within a single clade (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of A S. aureus, B S. saprophyticus, and C Klebsiella quasipneumoniae. Clades in red contain only ISS genomesThe single-copy genes specific to either the ISS genomes or the Earth-origin genomes were checked and found none. Furthermore, mutation (indels and substitutions) analyses were carried out that were specific to the ISS clades. The amino acid substitutions that changed a hydrophobic amino acid into a hydrophilic one or vice versa were checked and found many changes. The genes affected by these changes were analyzed in terms of Gene Ontology classifications (Biological Process only; Supplementary Fig. S3). The two ISS-specific clades of the S. aureus tree allowed us to compare the two clades in terms of indels. There were 63 indels found to be shared by both clades of S. aureus, as opposed to 14 indels specific to clade 1 and 57 specific to clade 2. The GO analysis of the genes affected by the 63 shared indels resulted in 10 GO terms (Supplementary Fig. S4). Many of the GO terms with high frequency that resulted from these analyses are related to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape. This is consistent with previous reports regarding the effects of microgravity on cellular morphology, proliferation, and adhesion [43]. Taken together, the present results exhibit strong evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution.Gene-based functional analysis Variations in the AMR and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs have been summarized in Supplemental Table S1. Since multiple studies show that the microbial virulence increases in microgravity [44, 45], AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of type strains and ISS isolates [46, 47]. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the E. bugandensis F1-2P MAG, whereas these were not present in the other MAGs of BSL-2 microorganisms studied during this study. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in the ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Comparative analyses of MAG and WGS of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity. Among 20 MAGs processed, 13 AMR genes were found to be the most prominent among the bacteria (Table 3). These 13 genes were housekeeping genes and have a unique, specialized role determined by their protein type and function. For example, the LSU ribosomal unit is the primary site where protein synthesis occurs in the translation process. Other genes include copper translocating P-type ATPase, DNA gyrase subunits A and B, LSU ribosomal unit 20p and 35p, SSU ribosomal unit 7p, and 12p, DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta subunit, topoisomerase IV subunits A and B, translation initiation factor 3, translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and translation elongation factor G (EF-G). Functions of genes characterized during this study are given in Supplemental Table S2. Single-nucleotide variation (SNV) among these 13 housekeeping genes in MAGs of six different bacterial species are summarized below. Table 3.

The subsystem features include genes responsible for various metabolisms, in which genes responsible for carbohydrates and amino acids metabolism were high. Genes related to motility and chemotaxis were absent in the members of the genera Acinetobacter, Kocuria, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella. In contrast, genes associated with stress response were present in high numbers (90 to 167 genes) within members of family Enterobacteriaceae, whereas such genes were less abundant (19 to 75 genes) with Staphylococcus and actinobacterial species. Similarly, sporulation and dormancy genes were mainly present in Paenibacillus polymyxa, since they are the only spore-forming bacterium MAG found. Table 4.

Likewise, MAGs of Pseudomonas brenneri (F1-5P and F2-5P) and Pantoea dispersa (F3-4P) had positional variation compared to their type strains (LMG 24534T and DSM 30073T, respectively). In contrast, no sequence variation in the copper translocating P-type ATPase was noticed when analyzing the WGS of the S. aureus ATCC12600T type strain, a nosocomial isolate, and S. aureus MAGs (F1-4P and F2-8P). Similarly, K. pneumoniae MAG F3-3P had no SNVs compared to its type strain ATCC 13883T. Acinetobacter pittii F2-1P MAG had maximum similarity of copper translocating P-type ATPase sequence with not only its type strain DSM 25618T but also with Acinetobacter baumannii DSM 30007T which was isolated from human urine. WGS of the novel species K. piersonii, whose type strain IIIF1SW-P2T was also isolated from location no. 1 of the ISS [7], was compared with the MAGs (F3-1P, F3-5P, F3-7P, and F3-8P). This comparison exhibited the same genetic composition, which confirms that the MAGs might have originated from the living cells. In addition, the comparative genomic analysis of the uropathogenic strain of K. piersonii strain YU22, isolated from human urine [48], revealed no SNVs.DNA gyrase subunit A To observe positional sequence variation in the DNA gyrase subunit A, S. aureus MAG F2-8P was compared with the genomes of the type strain ATCC 12600T, isolated from pleural fluid, and most SNPs were found. However, S. aureus MAG F1-4P was highly homologous with the type strain ATCC 12600T. In addition, S. aureus MAG F2-8P and AR071, a nosocomial strain that is part of the FDA/CDC AMR bank, also showed mutations. Similarly, E. bugandensis F1-2P had SNPs found in its counterpart type strain EB-247T. A. pittii had alignment differences in strain A. pittii XJ88, which was found in human sputum which is a mixture of saliva and mucus. P. brenneri MAGs (F1-5P and F2-5P) as well as K. personii MAGs (F3-5P, F3-8P, and F3-7P) have SNPs with its type strain. The remainder of the Pantoea strains was found to have scattered SNPs among Earth homologs. In contrast, K. quasipneumoniae MAG F1-2P had no SNPs found with its type strain 01A030T, a human blood isolate. K. pneumoniae MAG F3-3P had nucleotide differences with NCTC 11357 sequences.DNA gyrase subunit B S. aureus MAGs (F1-4P and F2-8P) had SNPs in S. aureus ATCC12600T. E. bugandensis MAG F1-2P has SNPs found in E. quasihormaechei WCHes120003T which was isolated from a human sputum [49] and its type strain as well. A. pittii had many scattered SNPs among the Earth homolog. K. pneumoniae MAG F3-3P did not have distinct point mutations.DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta subunit S. aureus MAGs (F1-4P and F2-8P) have SNPs found in ATCC 12600, which has already been explained to be a nosocomial strain. E. bugandensis F1-2P and Earth homolog Enterobacter cloacae complex C45, isolated from a hospital, have point mutations. K. pneumoniae F3-3P had SNPs found in K. pneumoniae NCTC 9170. P. dispersa F3-4P was the only strain that had scattered SNPs in the Pantoea species. Acinetobacter alignment had SNPs found in Acinetobacter sp. genomospecies 3 ATCC 19004 which was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.LSU ribosomal protein L20p S. aureus F1-4P and F2-8P MAGs had no SNPs with the type strain. Strain S. aureus GD1108 which is a hospital strain is the same as that of ISS F1-4P and F2-8P MAGs. S. aureus F2-8P ISS strain was very dissimilar to the rest of the S. aureus MAG sequences. Both E. bugandensis and Klebsiella MAGs have no SNPs. The Pantoea MAGs have SNPs found in Plautia stali (insect) symbiont, P. vagans C9-1, and P. stewartii DC 283. One SNP was found in strain XJ88 in the Acinetobacter (F2-1P) alignment.LSU ribosomal protein L35p No SNPs were found in all S. aureus strains. SNPs were not found in both Enterobacter and Klebsiella MAGs. P. brenneri MAGs (F1A-5P and F2-5P) have no SNPs. Acinetobacter had no SNPs found.

A. pittii MAG was extremely different from the rest of the alignment. E. bugandensis F1-2P had scattered SNPs. K. pneumoniae F3-3P had SNPs found in strain ATCC 700603. P. brenneri F2-5P and K. piersonii F3-1P had SNPs found in P. agglomerans FDAARGOS 160 which was isolated from a human wound isolation source. P. dispersa F3-4P and K. piersonii F3-7P have no SNPs.Topoisomerase IV subunit B S. aureus F1-4P have no SNPs, but MAG F2-8P had SNPs found in strain AR071 and GD1696. E. bugandensis F1-2P MAG was extremely different compared to the rest of the type strain EB-247. P. brenneri MAGs (F1-5P and F2-5P) had SNPs found in LMG24199. Other Pantoea strains have SNPs primarily found with their respective type strains. K. piersonii MAGs (F3-7P and F3-8P) have SNPs found in Pantoea agglomerans TH81. A. pittii F2-1P had SNPs found in IEC338SC which was isolated from a trachea excretion.Translation initiation factor 3 S. aureus MAG F1-4P have had sequences that were very different from its Earth homologs, but there were no SNPs were found in S. aureus F2-8P MAG. K. piersonii F3-8P had scattered SNPs, whereas MAG F3-7P and P. dispersa F3-4P have SNPs in Plautia stali symbiont which was collected from the midgut of an insect. All other Pantoea MAGs do not have SNPs. The A. pittii alignment was found to have SNPs in the strain 201406 which was isolated from human. Both Enterobacter and Klebsiella species had no nucleotide differences.Translation elongation factor G S. aureus MAGs (F1-4P and F2-8P) have SNPs found in S. aureus AR 464. E. bugandensis F1-1P has SNPs in Enterobacter MBRL1077 which was isolated from a human wound. SNPs were not particular to one Klebsiella strain. K. piersonii MAGs (F3-1P, F3-5P, F3-7P, and F3-8P) and P. dispersa F3-4P have SNPs with their respective type strains. There were no SNPs found in K. pneumoniae F3-3P, but SNPs were found in A. pittii F2-1P with strain ST220 which was retrieved from sputum. P. brenneri F2-5P has no SNPs.Translation elongation factor Tu S. aureus F2-8P had SNPs found in strain AR071, and the rest of the S. aureus F1-4P MAG has SNPs in ATCC 12600. E. bugandensis F1-2P had scattered SNPs, but Klebsiella strains have no SNPs. P. brenneri F2-5P and K. piersonii MAGs (F3-1P and F3-7P) have SNPs when compared to the type strain. K. piersonii F3-5P had SNPs found in Pantoea stewartii strain DC283, whereas K. piersonii MAG F3-8P did not have any SNPs. P. dispersa MAG F3-4P has SNPs in Pantoea rwandensis strain ND04. A. pittii was extremely dissimilar to its type strain. Many SNPs found in these 333 alignments have been found in the Earth homologs. The Pantoea/Kalamiella strains have the most SNPs found within the ISS strain. This may suggest that Pantoea/Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. More epigenetic and chemical analyses are needed to understand why members of these species are particularly sensitive to these conditions. The difference may also lie in the low percent identity the Earth homologs had. In regards to the Staphylococcus strains, ATCC12600 and GD1108 are both nosocomial strains which seem to act differently in each gene. For example, in some genes, ATCC12600 exhibits SNPs, while GD1108 is the only Earth homolog that has the exact same sequence as the ISS strain. Strain GD1108 was isolated from a school child from a prevalence survey in 2011 in Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China [50]. Common SNPs were not found between the ISS and homolog strains within alignments. SNPs in Earth homologs symbolize differences in where the strain was found from. For example, Earth homologs that are found in soil exhibit very different sequences with the ISS strain, therefore explaining the SNPs. In addition, most SNPs have been found in human fluids as well as soil/plants with a few animal excretions. This demonstrates that the ISS strain has some nosocomial/soil background in relation to the rest of the alignment. Strains that are similar/dissimilar to the ISS strain show no common isolation source for the most part. Therefore, more biochemical analyses on the molecular level are needed. In MAG gene analysis (Supplemental Table S1), it was observed that similar genes were responsible for antibiotic resistance and virulence. This common gene-based resistant phenomenon suggests that changes are an adaptation strategy in microbes.Genes related to biofilm characteristics Biofilm forming and quorum-sensing (QS) genes analyzed in this study and their predicted functions are tabulated in Supplemental Table S2. Sequences of all four E. bungandensis ISS strains and the MAG (F1-2P) exhibited 100% sequence similarities among them for the genes responsible for biofilm (pgaABCD) and QS (LsrABCD, LsrR, LsrK, and AI-LuxS) functions. The variable residues (SNPs) of genes related to biofilm formation and QS-related genes in E. bungandensis MAG when compared to E. bugandensis strains (n = 11) isolated from clinical samples are given in Table 5. The comparative sequence analysis of E. bugandensis MAG shows that the biofilm and QS genes are highly conserved (< 1% SNPs variation) across most of the clinical strains of E. bugandensis (n = 10). This pattern is also consistent with the neighbor-joining tree of each one of these genes for all the strains tested and one MAG (data not shown). These analyses confirmed that E. bugandensis strains might have hitch-hiked with the healthy crew and landed on ISS surfaces. In contrast, the sequence variation of all biofilm and QS genes of E. bugandensis strain MBRL 1077 was highly variable (2.4 to 25%). The average nucleic acid index (ANI) of MBRL 1077 and the E. bugandensis type strain EB-247 were ~95%, whereas the ANI was > 99% for the other 10 clinical strains, four ISS isolates, and one MAG. The higher SNPs and lower ANI values of MBRL 1077 strain with all other 14 strains and one MAG suggested that MBRL 1077 might not belong to E. bugandensis. Table 5.

This result is interesting because this gene codes for the autoinducer proteins which are very important for carrying signals [51]. In that regard, environmental stress would have no effect on that gene since a change in the gene sequence would not serve to increase the rate of biofilm production and increase the overall amount of biofilm formed, but we can also see that there is a decent amount of amino acid change in the LsrC gene which is responsible for importing the autoinducer, and this makes sense because while the autoinducer itself does not need to be changed, the rate at which it is imported to carry information needs to be increased or reduced to accommodate for the change in the amount of biofilm produced. On the other hand, changes in the nucleotide sequence of the pgaA and pgaB genes, along with the LsrK gene, lead to high amino acid change. This could serve as a strong indication of these organisms trying to adjust to the environmental stress because the pgaA and pgaB are responsible for transporting the PGA essential in the movement of adhesin out of the periplasm to form the biofilm. Also, the LsrK is responsible for repressing the LsrR repressor, and increasing the function of all three genes will aid in increased signal for biofilm to be formed faster, as well as increase the rate of biofilm formation.Conclusion In summary, good quality bacterial and fungal MAGs were generated from ISS environmental samples, and functional properties were predicted. Furthermore, it was possible to describe novel microbial (two bacterial and one yeast) species via the “metagenome to phenome” approach. The monophyletic phylogeny exhibited by the ISS genomes (both isolates and MAGs) suggested that they shared a single common ancestor. The molecules pertaining to the cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were in high frequency in ISS genomes demonstrating evidence for ISS-specific bacterial evolution. The common gene-based resistance phenomenon noticed in this study suggests that SNP changes in MAGs and ISS genomes might be an adaptation strategy in AMR and biofilm formation in microbes. Similarly, variations found in the AMR and virulence genes enabled the prediction of the ecology and evolution of microorganisms in space. The maximum SNPs characterized for the ISS Pantoea/Kalamiella strains suggested that enterobacterial species are much more subjective to microgravity changes. However, fixation of environmental samples in space for RNAseq approach and/or in situ sequencing in space are warranted to confirm variation related to microbial evolution under microgravity. More studies are needed to unearth whether SNPs seen in ISS MAGs are due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Supplementary Information Additional file 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informed in vitro studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include using Bacillus-based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Keywords: indoor microbiome, biocontrol, probiotic cleaning, bacillus, antibiotic resistance, built environment, AMR, metabolic modelling",
    "introduction": "Introduction Cleaning and disinfection practices in homes and hospitals to combat bacteria, fungi, and viruses have a long history. Ancient civilizations used various disinfection methods to remove “pestilence,” from the rudimentary practices of boiling and sunlight exposure to the use of natural substances like vinegar and sulphur [1]. However, it was not until the 19th century that the age of modern infection control began to take shape with targeted cleaning practices. For example, Ignaz Semmelweis introduced hand disinfection in hospitals [2], and Florence Nightingale introduced best practices to decrease infection rates and improve patient healing [3]. In the following decades, the use of carbolic acid by Joseph Lister for surgical instrument sterilization, in conjunction with other antiseptic methods, further enhanced pathogen control in clinical settings [4]. By the early-to-mid 20th century, the discovery of antibiotics and the development of chemical disinfectants, such as phenol and bleach, provided a newfound defence against infectious agents [5]. Though antibiotics have been highly successful and saved many lives, the overuse of these drugs has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, making traditional antibiotics less effective [6]. Additionally, pathogens are evolving resistance to biocidal compounds used in traditional cleaning solutions [7]. However, chemical treatments such as phenol and bleach remain effective despite providing only temporary removal of pathogens on surfaces. To reduce the risks associated with various disinfection cleaning agents, hospitals now more frequently use a variety of cleaning strategies for disinfection, including advanced technologies like exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide vapour [8]. Despite these powerful treatments, outbreaks of Clostridioides difficile [9] and other antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms [10-14] have continued to rise within healthcare settings, highlighting the enduring challenge of simultaneously disinfecting an area while avoiding selection for traits that increase pathogenic potential. Reducing the spread of AMR pathogens is a crucial priority for global human health. In 2019, 1.27 million deaths were directly caused by AMR pathogens globally [15], and they are projected to cause an additional 10 million deaths annually by 2050 [16]. We must therefore bolster our defences against persistent and emerging pathogens, safeguarding global health and well-being amidst the evolving landscape of microbial threats [17]. The inability of current hospital disinfection methods to fully combat these challenges emphasizes the crucial need for continuous research, development, and adaptation of infection control methods. Although traditional cleaning methods have helped to reduce the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses in the built environment, using microbes sourced from different environments to inhibit pathogen survival and transmission is an intriguing new tool that is posed to further improve the health of people indoors. Reintroducing specific microbes into buildings can potentially revolutionize how we prevent the emergence and persistence of unwanted microbes. However, deploying what could be called a microbial biocontrol product is hampered by a lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of action for this ecological strategy to control disease. Despite this knowledge gap, cleaning products containing bacteria that demonstrate antimicrobial activity have been developed [18] and are already publicly available for purchase. Bacillus spores are often used because many species are generally recognized as safe, nonpathogenic, produce a wide variety of antimicrobial compounds [19], and remain viable over long periods of time [20]. Though it is unknown how effectively these spores germinate on dry, nutrient-depleted surfaces in built environments, it is important to determine why they are found to be associated with a reduction in the abundance of hospital-associated pathogens [21-24]. It is unclear whether there is an actual competitive exclusion or inhibition effect or if the spores occupy niches on surfaces, thereby denying this space to pathogens. Alternatively, the spores may mask any detectable signal of the pathogens, as determined via DNA sequencing methods. If the latter is true, this could mean that the pathogens remain viable and can cause infection. Answering this open question and moving the field towards improved public health objectives will require using a diverse suite of experimental and analytical approaches, including techniques that have been so far underutilized in built environment research. In the last decade, there have been critical innovations in the methods, study approaches, and experimental designs used to characterize diversity, survival, distribution, transmission, and health risk of microbes found in our buildings. A rapid explosion in observational studies over the last 15 years has provided a baseline analysis of the microbial diversity in built environments. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes has demonstrated that microbes colonize and spread throughout buildings in predictable ways [25-30]. In addition, shotgun metagenomic sequencing has been used to characterize the spread of AMR genes [31] and to quantify the relative abundance of microbial taxa across surfaces and on the skin of indoor environment occupants [32]. Also, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has been employed to determine the absolute abundance of specific AMR genes [33, 34] or species of interest [35] in a diverse set of environments such as soil, water, air, faeces, and sediments. Further, targeted and untargeted metabolomics have been employed to characterize the distribution of chemicals around built spaces and infer the metabolic ecology of species interactions in experimental systems and real-world environments [36-38]. These methods can be enhanced using specialized DNA extraction techniques and internal standards to compensate for the low biomass typically recovered in built environment samples [32, 39, 40]. Investigations in real-world built spaces have led to numerous new hypotheses regarding microbial survival and transmission, and the metabolic interactions that underpin these properties. Robustly testing these hypotheses has required innovations in experimental laboratory-based studies. Despite laboratories being built spaces themselves, recreating the inherent ecological dynamics that define the indoor microbiome has proven difficult and has required a reimagining of traditional microbiology techniques. Microbes in the built environment are generally assumed to be starving, dying, or dead [41]. We are, therefore, attempting to study life on the edge of survival. Many microorganisms are unable to survive on surfaces, but some pathogens have demonstrated the ability to survive on surfaces common to the built environment. For example, MRSA shows robust viability on surfaces such as vinyl and plastic over days [42]. Traditional microbiology cultivates microbes using media optimized over decades of experimentation to encourage their growth. Such conditions are unlikely to replicate microbial interactions in the built environment. So, it is necessary to use techniques that more closely reproduce the harsh conditions of most built environment surfaces to more accurately examine how microbes survive, grow, and interact in this environment. Observational studies and laboratory investigations inform intervention studies in ways that help determine the potential benefit of removing species of concern or introducing potentially beneficial microbes, both for the integrity of the building structure and the health of the occupants. Intervention studies have been performed in mock built environment microcosms, as well as in full-scale field trials, and are now elucidating the ecological dynamics of these environments. Unfortunately, due to the cost and added risk of conducting an intervention within buildings such as hospitals, only a few full-scale tests of these intervention techniques have been completed. This review will discuss recent advances in built environment microbiome research, with a focus on strategies related to the understanding and translation of biocontrol practices used to reduce antibiotic-resistant pathogens on surfaces in real-world clinical settings.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions and future directions Probiotic intervention studies in hospitals [22-24, 99, 100] have demonstrated the potential to revolutionize cleaning approaches in healthcare facilities. However, much is still unknown about their mechanism of action, as well as how additional factors could influence their efficaciousness in situ. Further investigation of how spores germinate and competitively exclude other microbes in these dry, nutrient-depleted environments is needed for the successful development and broad deployment of probiotic cleaners. To answer these questions, we must use a variety of experimental strategies, including varied application methods (i.e. how the cleaner is applied and at what concentration is the cleaner most effective), inclusion of taxonomically diverse pathogenic microbes at varied concentrations, and a characterization of whole community dynamics in response to cleaner application. These experiments will require highly controlled and easily manipulatable conditions, and therefore, laboratory testing will be essential for determining the relative importance of factors associated with method of use, humidity, nutrient availability, surface material type, and cleaning regimes. Further, simulating transmission events of microbes from surfaces to humans will be needed to more fully understand how probiotic cleaners influence transmission rates of taxa of interest. Differential use patterns of healthcare facilities might alter best practices for probiotic cleaner use. For example, it is unknown how the magnitude of response might vary between different wards or rooms. Patient rooms and bathrooms have been the primary focus of intervention studies; however, other shared spaces, such as hallways or visitor areas, also carry the potential for pathogen accumulation and transmission risk. Additionally, long-term monitoring is crucial to detect whether the pathogens in these environments begin to adapt to this new cleaning method and therefore become resistant to biocontrol. Such a situation could start an evolutionary “arms race” with unknown outcomes. It is crucial to consider the health and emotional impacts on the patients and staff. Sociological studies on healthcare workers and patients are necessary to understand the perception that patients, staff, and the public have about the use of these novel products and to involve their feedback in product design and application. The popularity of probiotics in popular foods and drinks could help alleviate concerns, but deploying them in hospitals, especially around high-risk patients, will likely be controversial. Understanding the perception of these products, and explaining how and why they work, will aid in successful widespread adoption across healthcare systems. As seen in studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, harsh cleaning treatments using bleach may inhibit the probiotic and phage cleaners, so it will be imperative that staff are trained in how to properly treat surfaces cleaned with probiotics. Beyond direct application to the engineering of probiotic materials [85], 3D printing is primed to be the future of microbial biocontrol in built environments. Recent advances in 3D printing have resulted in materials that can be printed at low enough temperatures that spores and even live bacteria are not harmed during the assembly process. Unlike previous efforts, which used hydrogels [85], these new approaches can enable the printing of ceramics or hard plastics with improved utility as building materials. Using genome-enabled metabolic modelling to select bacteria that are optimized for these printing processes presents unique opportunities for built environment-specific designs that could be used to manipulate the ecology of these environments in prescribed ways. If this trend continues, we may soon be able to print tiles, furniture, or even entire structures out of sustainably produced microbially active materials [97]. Establishing the efficacy of these products through well-designed field intervention studies that are informed by lab-based experiments is an exciting subfield of built environment microbiome research and will ultimately lead to better products, building materials, and design techniques in buildings to improve occupant health and well-being.",

Copyright notice ID: 10848226 PMID: 38365248 Abstract The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informed in vitro studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include using Bacillus-based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Keywords: indoor microbiome, biocontrol, probiotic cleaning, bacillus, antibiotic resistance, built environment, AMR, metabolic modellingIntroduction Cleaning and disinfection practices in homes and hospitals to combat bacteria, fungi, and viruses have a long history. Ancient civilizations used various disinfection methods to remove “pestilence,” from the rudimentary practices of boiling and sunlight exposure to the use of natural substances like vinegar and sulphur [1]. However, it was not until the 19th century that the age of modern infection control began to take shape with targeted cleaning practices. For example, Ignaz Semmelweis introduced hand disinfection in hospitals [2], and Florence Nightingale introduced best practices to decrease infection rates and improve patient healing [3]. In the following decades, the use of carbolic acid by Joseph Lister for surgical instrument sterilization, in conjunction with other antiseptic methods, further enhanced pathogen control in clinical settings [4]. By the early-to-mid 20th century, the discovery of antibiotics and the development of chemical disinfectants, such as phenol and bleach, provided a newfound defence against infectious agents [5]. Though antibiotics have been highly successful and saved many lives, the overuse of these drugs has led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, making traditional antibiotics less effective [6]. Additionally, pathogens are evolving resistance to biocidal compounds used in traditional cleaning solutions [7]. However, chemical treatments such as phenol and bleach remain effective despite providing only temporary removal of pathogens on surfaces. To reduce the risks associated with various disinfection cleaning agents, hospitals now more frequently use a variety of cleaning strategies for disinfection, including advanced technologies like exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide vapour [8]. Despite these powerful treatments, outbreaks of Clostridioides difficile [9] and other antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms [10-14] have continued to rise within healthcare settings, highlighting the enduring challenge of simultaneously disinfecting an area while avoiding selection for traits that increase pathogenic potential. Reducing the spread of AMR pathogens is a crucial priority for global human health. In 2019, 1.27 million deaths were directly caused by AMR pathogens globally [15], and they are projected to cause an additional 10 million deaths annually by 2050 [16]. We must therefore bolster our defences against persistent and emerging pathogens, safeguarding global health and well-being amidst the evolving landscape of microbial threats [17]. The inability of current hospital disinfection methods to fully combat these challenges emphasizes the crucial need for continuous research, development, and adaptation of infection control methods. Although traditional cleaning methods have helped to reduce the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses in the built environment, using microbes sourced from different environments to inhibit pathogen survival and transmission is an intriguing new tool that is posed to further improve the health of people indoors. Reintroducing specific microbes into buildings can potentially revolutionize how we prevent the emergence and persistence of unwanted microbes. However, deploying what could be called a microbial biocontrol product is hampered by a lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of action for this ecological strategy to control disease. Despite this knowledge gap, cleaning products containing bacteria that demonstrate antimicrobial activity have been developed [18] and are already publicly available for purchase. Bacillus spores are often used because many species are generally recognized as safe, nonpathogenic, produce a wide variety of antimicrobial compounds [19], and remain viable over long periods of time [20]. Though it is unknown how effectively these spores germinate on dry, nutrient-depleted surfaces in built environments, it is important to determine why they are found to be associated with a reduction in the abundance of hospital-associated pathogens [21-24]. It is unclear whether there is an actual competitive exclusion or inhibition effect or if the spores occupy niches on surfaces, thereby denying this space to pathogens. Alternatively, the spores may mask any detectable signal of the pathogens, as determined via DNA sequencing methods. If the latter is true, this could mean that the pathogens remain viable and can cause infection. Answering this open question and moving the field towards improved public health objectives will require using a diverse suite of experimental and analytical approaches, including techniques that have been so far underutilized in built environment research. In the last decade, there have been critical innovations in the methods, study approaches, and experimental designs used to characterize diversity, survival, distribution, transmission, and health risk of microbes found in our buildings. A rapid explosion in observational studies over the last 15 years has provided a baseline analysis of the microbial diversity in built environments. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes has demonstrated that microbes colonize and spread throughout buildings in predictable ways [25-30]. In addition, shotgun metagenomic sequencing has been used to characterize the spread of AMR genes [31] and to quantify the relative abundance of microbial taxa across surfaces and on the skin of indoor environment occupants [32]. Also, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has been employed to determine the absolute abundance of specific AMR genes [33, 34] or species of interest [35] in a diverse set of environments such as soil, water, air, faeces, and sediments. Further, targeted and untargeted metabolomics have been employed to characterize the distribution of chemicals around built spaces and infer the metabolic ecology of species interactions in experimental systems and real-world environments [36-38]. These methods can be enhanced using specialized DNA extraction techniques and internal standards to compensate for the low biomass typically recovered in built environment samples [32, 39, 40]. Investigations in real-world built spaces have led to numerous new hypotheses regarding microbial survival and transmission, and the metabolic interactions that underpin these properties. Robustly testing these hypotheses has required innovations in experimental laboratory-based studies. Despite laboratories being built spaces themselves, recreating the inherent ecological dynamics that define the indoor microbiome has proven difficult and has required a reimagining of traditional microbiology techniques. Microbes in the built environment are generally assumed to be starving, dying, or dead [41]. We are, therefore, attempting to study life on the edge of survival. Many microorganisms are unable to survive on surfaces, but some pathogens have demonstrated the ability to survive on surfaces common to the built environment. For example, MRSA shows robust viability on surfaces such as vinyl and plastic over days [42]. Traditional microbiology cultivates microbes using media optimized over decades of experimentation to encourage their growth. Such conditions are unlikely to replicate microbial interactions in the built environment. So, it is necessary to use techniques that more closely reproduce the harsh conditions of most built environment surfaces to more accurately examine how microbes survive, grow, and interact in this environment. Observational studies and laboratory investigations inform intervention studies in ways that help determine the potential benefit of removing species of concern or introducing potentially beneficial microbes, both for the integrity of the building structure and the health of the occupants. Intervention studies have been performed in mock built environment microcosms, as well as in full-scale field trials, and are now elucidating the ecological dynamics of these environments. Unfortunately, due to the cost and added risk of conducting an intervention within buildings such as hospitals, only a few full-scale tests of these intervention techniques have been completed. This review will discuss recent advances in built environment microbiome research, with a focus on strategies related to the understanding and translation of biocontrol practices used to reduce antibiotic-resistant pathogens on surfaces in real-world clinical settings.Techniques for investigating the microbiome of the built environment Observational studies have investigated microbial dynamics in the built environment, detecting broad trends in the microbial composition and indoor ecological dynamics. For example, these studies describe how the diversity, composition, and functional potential of communities change over time and how occupants and building operations influence these interactions. Many built environments have been explored in this way, including workplaces [43-45], homes [46-49], and public transportation [50, 51]. Of critical importance to understanding the interaction between surface-associated microbial ecology and pathogenic activity, hospital environments have been well characterized [25, 26, 52], providing some of the most compelling results to justify further intervention studies. For example, one investigation demonstrated that surfaces in a newly built hospital were inoculated with microbes that closely resembled the outside environment [25]. However, when that hospital became operational and therefore densely populated with patients and healthcare workers, the surface-associated microbiome began to resemble that of the occupants’ skin and respiratory tract. In addition, following the start of operational activity, hospital custodians cleaned surfaces with defined periodic frequency, which also influences microbial dynamics [25]. Similar trends have been observed in studies that focused on closed hospital wards that were renovated and reopened for use [27]. Using metagenomic reconstruction of bacterial genomes in hospitals over dense time series has demonstrated that bacteria in the hospital environment have increased selection pressure for the acquisition and accumulation of antimicrobial resistance genes [25]. Although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated, bacterial adaptation and resistance to disinfectants (such as those used to clean the hospital) is well known [53], and we hypothesize that genetic adaptation to survival against such disinfection may also be concomitant with other genetic survival strategies, such as antimicrobial resistance. However, further research is needed to uncover the explicit relationship between these phenomena. Over the last 15 years, observational studies have generally applied relatively affordable microbiome analysis techniques, such as 16S rRNA or ITS gene sequencing, to characterize the diversity and taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal communities, and qPCR of targeted genes to determine absolute abundances of microbial community members [54-58]. Although approaches such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and application of qPCR to quantify a variety of genes and microbial activity (e.g. the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes) can dramatically increase experimental costs, they can significantly improve our understanding of microbial interactions in these settings [59-61]. These methods can be implemented to identify patterns of microbial metabolism in complex systems [62], or when observed over time, these data can reveal temporal dynamics. However, the implementation of these other ‘omics approaches is challenging due to the low microbial biomass found on surfaces in buildings, especially where resources such as water, carbon, nitrogen, and other essential nutrients to sustain life are limited and there is frequent cleaning [41, 45]. Additionally, although observing spatial or temporal trends in microbiome composition or metabolism is useful, it is hard to identify the features that influence these dynamics due to our inability to control for every factor in a real-world environment. Targeted interventions or manipulations of the environment and the subsequent measurement of the magnitude of effect are needed to better understand how to optimize beneficial change. Even in an observational study such as the Hospital Microbiome Project [25], where we can observe a pseudo-intervention, in this case a change in occupancy status in real-time, it is not possible to explicitly track the movement of individual microbes or infer microbial metabolic interactions and competitive dynamics. However, it is possible to predict how microbes interact with each other and model their behaviour in these environments using metabolic models [63]. Modelling microbial metabolism To improve our understanding of microbial activity and ecology in these extreme environments, it is necessary to fundamentally understand their metabolic potential. Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) are mathematical models of metabolic networks reconstructed from the organism’s annotated genome [63, 64]. Genome-scale metabolic modelling can help facilitate a clear understanding of the mechanisms that microbes deploy to survive, germinate, and compete for resources. These models predict growth rates in a simulated medium and determine what reaction rates are needed to support growth. Pairs or larger groups of models can be connected to determine which metabolites are being readily exchanged (commensally or symbiotically) and which limited nutrients drive competition between the organisms [65, 66]. These models can make predictions for hundreds of conditions within seconds, allowing for the rapid identification of important nutrients, uptakes, and secretions, thereby rationally informing the design of subsequent experiments. In an iterative process, experimental data can be incorporated into GSMMs, contextualizing the data and further refining their predictions. Transcriptomics can also be used to detect reactions associated with low-transcription genes, increasing the specificity of the model to the environment of interest [67]. The refined model then yields insights into the biological relevance of transcriptional changes by identifying how they affect the expression of larger metabolic pathways. These models can also facilitate the analysis of multiomics data, by integrating them into an interpretable scaffold, which can then be used to predict how changes in the genome or to the environment influence survival or competitive outcomes. Using these modelling techniques on samples from the International Space Station, an extreme built environment revealed beneficial interactions between the pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae and bacterial species of the genus Pantoea and the family Enterobacteriaceae [68]. The model also predicted K. pneumoniae is parasitic towards the fungal genus Aspergillus, which was confirmed experimentally via co-culture [68]. Predicting microbial interactions in built environments via modelling is a powerful technique to inform efficacious biocontrol strategies by identifying novel species interactions and predicting their differential effect in a range of scenarios. This information can be generated based solely on ‘omics data and subsequently confirmed in laboratory studies.Interpreting metabolic ecology Studies in controlled laboratory settings typically, but not always [69], use microcosms that contain small pieces of construction materials relevant to the built environment of interest, and conditions (e.g. humidity and temperature) are varied to determine whether they have an effect on microbial activity and survival. To mimic realistic microbial community interactions and successional dynamics, studies have seeded surface materials with microbes by leaving them exposed within built environments prior to initiating challenge studies. In a study of microbial metabolic dynamics [60], coupons of oriented strand board, medium-density fibreboard, regular gypsum wallboard, and mould-resistant gypsum were naturally inoculated by passive colonization in homes and in a laboratory. Following this seeding, the coupons were either soaked in water to simulate a water leak or kept dry and then all coupons were incubated for an additional 30 days within a high humidity (~94%) chamber. Swabs of the coupons were collected every 5 days and analysed with 16S/ITS rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolomics to determine how these communities changed taxonomically and metabolically in response to wetting. Wetted coupons were dominated by the bacterial genera Bacillus, Erwinia, and Pseudomonas and the fungal genera Eurotium and Penicillium. When coupons had been wetted, Bacillus and Pseudomonas species were almost always negatively correlated in relative abundance, suggesting competitive exclusion. Even though Bacillus species are known to produce antifungal compounds [70-72], only the mould-resistant gypsum was dominated by Bacillus. The antibacterial compounds nigragillin and fumigaclavine C were found in high abundance. They were positively correlated with the presence of Aspergillus and negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacillus and Pseudomonas [60]. These results suggest that the presence of Bacillus is not sufficient to prevent fungal growth on built environment surfaces. Although they did not purposefully inoculate surfaces with Bacillus, this study suggests that this genus did proliferate when coupons were wetted, but it only dominated on mould-resistant gypsum, which inherently inhibits fungal growth, and as such, the naturally occurring Bacillus species may not have antifungal activity. Semi-in vitro investigations are effective at discovering novel microbial interactions, but ecological dynamics can also be inferred from applying multiomic techniques to controlled building environments. For example, one study characterized the chemical and microbial compositions of two frequently wet surfaces in a residential setting, specifically the kitchen sink and bathroom shower [73]. This study used a combination of culture-dependent and independent techniques, including transcriptional analysis of the 16S rRNA gene to determine which bacteria were active at the time of sampling, and assessment of both volatile and soluble chemicals to explore the links between the observed microbiota and chemical exudates. This study showed that microbes play a critical role in structuring the chemical profiles of surfaces in built environments, particularly in kitchen sinks and shower stalls. The microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) were predominantly associated with fatty acid processing, and the composition of these mVOCs appeared more stable than that of the microbial communities themselves, which showed variations in response to changing environmental conditions. A second example demonstrated microbial colonization, succession, and viability in a tightly controlled restroom environment [61]. This study focused on the ecological succession and viability of human-associated microbiota on restroom surfaces, including floors, toilet seats, and soap dispensers. The study demonstrated that a late-successional microbial community develops on restroom surfaces within 5 to 8 hours of decontamination. This community showed remarkable stability over weeks to months, indicating a quick establishment and persistence of specific microbial assemblages. The authors also showed that faecal taxa, particularly those able to enter a dormant phase, can persist for extended periods on restroom surfaces. This insight into microbial survival strategies in dry and nutrient-poor environments of built environments is crucial for understanding disease transmission, ecology, and environmental health. This study also found a significant positive correlation between bacterial and viral abundances, but with an unexpectedly low virus-to-bacterium ratio of nearly 1:1. This suggests that many bacteria on restroom surfaces are in a dormant state, influencing the dynamics of phages in these environments. Understanding microbial ecological dynamics in these systems is essential if we are able to control the survival, emergence, and persistence of pathogens. Next, we explore how biocontrol may be applied to manipulate these ecosystems to reduce the persistence of pathogens in the built environment.Biocontrol in the built environment In agriculture, biocontrol has been rigorously investigated as a replacement for pesticidal, antimicrobial, and antifungal compounds used to eliminate disease-causing organisms [74, 75]. As many plant-associated microbes are naturally antagonistic towards human-associated pathogens [76], the adaptation of this method in built environments has become an emerging area of research. The Bacillus species used in probiotic cleaning products are also often associated with plants and soil [77]. Additionally, Priestia megaterium (previously Bacillus megaterium) is often included in these formulations due to its biocontrol activity in agriculture [78]. Some Bacillus species are also part of the healthy human microbiome and can confer health benefits when administered as an oral probiotic. For example, consuming B. subtilis spores can decolonize S. aureus from the human gut [79]. Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen and present in approximately one-third of the human population [80-82], suggesting that decolonization can lower the overall risk of developing future S. aureus infections, although we also concede that removal of beneficial Staphylococcus species and strains may have negative health impacts. Bacillus species form spores when starved for nutrients, making them resistant to damage by heat, UV, chemicals, and desiccation. Spores remain in this dormant state until conditions improve and then germinate upon exposure to certain amino acids, such as l-alanine, l-valine, and l-asparagine [83]. This makes them ideal for inclusion in cleaning solutions because unlike probiotics that contains vegetative cells (which must be refrigerated), a spore-containing solution can be stored at room temperature indefinitely. Additionally, Bacillus spores will remain viable on built environment surfaces for at least 72 hours [84], can be incorporated into materials [85] where they can repair microfractures [86], and facilitate changes to a material’s shape in response to changes in humidity [87]. In the future, building materials might contain spores for the purpose of maintaining structural integrity and improving the health of occupants via biocontrol mechanisms and immune stimulation [88, 89], although research in this area is still in the very early stages. We posit that there are two potential mechanisms by which biocontrol bacteria, such as Bacillus spp., may regulate pathogen exposure in built environments: (A) competitive exclusion, either through competition for nutrients or through antibiotic production and (B) enhancing the ecological stability and pathogen exclusion potential of the native surface microbiome (Fig. 1). Additionally, as outlined below, studies have shown that Bacillus administration in hospitals leads to a significant reduction in the abundance of known pathogens on surfaces [22-24, 84, 90, 91]. This could be due to competitive exclusion or by influencing the ecological stability of the native community; another possibility is that the application of billions of Bacillus spores leads to overwhelming numerical dominance (iii) that results in a decrease in the ability to detect pathogens and maybe diminished likelihood of occupant exposure due to a reduction in the probability of encountering a pathogenic cell (Fig. 1). Below we explore specific examples that may help elucidate which mechanism or mechanisms is most likely. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Potential pathogens can be deposited on surfaces by infected occupants, but their survival and transmission capability are dependent on many environmental factors, including temperature, light, humidity, occupant density, air flow, cleaning methods, and surface material type [43, 101-105]. However, this rate of accumulation and transmission can also be altered through manipulation of surface ecology by introducing bacteria into the environment. Here, we propose three potential modes of action for how probiotics can decrease pathogen exposure and infection risk. (A) Bacterial spores germinate and exclude pathogenic bacteria through direct consumption of resources or by inhibiting pathogen growth via the production of inhibitory molecules, such as bacilysin [106]. (B) Germinated probiotic bacteria alter microbial community interactions through metabolic exchange, leading to the inhibition of pathogens [96]. (C) Cleaner-associated bacterial cells outnumber cells of potential pathogens, resulting in numerical dominance. We hypothesize this could then reduce the rate of occupant interaction, or it may reduce the detection of pathogens by sequencing techniques. Bacillus species can competitively exclude other organisms through the preferential uptake of nutrients from their surrounding environment. For example, iron, an important element for all life due to its frequent use as a cofactor in enzymes, can be sequestered by siderophores secreted by Bacillus species [92]. These molecules bind tightly to individual iron atoms and require specialized membrane transport proteins for uptake and utilization by a cell. Cells without the proper transportation proteins are unable to import and use the iron, thereby inhibiting their growth [93]. Competitive inhibition of pathogens can also occur via the direct production of antagonistic compounds by Bacillus species, including surfactin, iturin, fengycin/plipastatin, bacillomycin, and bacilysin (Fig. 2; [94]), although the effectiveness of these compounds has not specifically been demonstrated in the built environment. Several studies have demonstrated that Bacillus intervention enhances the pathogen exclusion properties of the extant surface microbiome [95, 96]. However, the lack of a defined mechanism of action behind such biocontrol suggests an urgent need to perform new studies aimed at elucidating these modalities. This is especially important due to the proliferation of commercial probiotic cleaners, whose efficacy should be validated against traditional cleaning methods and any impact on material integrity or human health assessed. However, studies that seek to demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention against pathogen reduction cannot introduce pathogens into the environment to start the experiment and instead must rely on already existing exposure events, such as those occurring in hospitals. Additionally, there is a lack of control for complex factors such as occupancy rates, sunlight, and seasonality, which makes these studies susceptible to misleading conclusions (Fig. 1). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The germination of Bacillus spores is triggered by either (A) L-alanine/L-valine or (B) a combination of L-asparagine, glucose, fructose, and potassium ions [107]. Vegetative Bacillus cells can generate different compounds that can exclude pathogens, including (C) the siderophore bacillibactin, which binds iron and is involved in competitive exclusion of nearby microbes [108]; (D) surfactin, which has antimicrobial properties and also aids in movement across surfaces [109]; (E) bacillomycin, which has potent antibacterial activity [110]; (F) bacilysin [106]; and (G) fengycin [111], which are both antifungal compounds.A recent study showed that it was possible to impregnate materials with a bacterial spore-containing medium, either through direct inoculation [97] or through embedding spores in 3D-printed materials [85]. Spores of genetically modified Bacillus have been printed into soft hydrogel materials, where they remain viable and become metabolically reactive in response to a pathogen (e.g. S. aureus), resulting in the biocidal activity of those agents [85]. Using sprays, materials can also be seeded with microbial spores. To test the activity of these spore sprays, a commercially available cleaner containing either Bacillus spp. spores or a spore-free version of the cleaner was applied to steel coupons; then, the coupons were inoculated with either Acinetobacter baumannii or K. pneumoniae [95]. The coupons were sampled at 3, 24, and 72 hours for colony-forming unit (CFU) enumeration to determine whether the presence of the cleaner, with or without Bacillus spores, decreased the survival rate of the pathogens compared to cleaner-free controls [95]. However, there was no significant difference in A. baumannii survival rates in the presence or absence of the cleaner, with or without Bacillus. Klebsiella pneumoniae survival was significantly reduced when exposed to any cleaner, and the presence of Bacillus did not enhance this effect. In partial explanation for this finding, metatranscriptomic sequencing data suggested a low (~1% of reads) recovery of Bacillus when in spore form, whereas samples with vegetative cells had ~40% of reads identified as Bacillus. The absence of any impact of Bacillus on pathogen survival, coupled with the lack of vegetative transcriptional activity, suggests that most of the spores failed to germinate and hence had no inhibitory effect on the pathogens. Another study tested the natural seeding of blocks of ceramic, linoleum, and stainless steel in both indoor and outdoor environments that were periodically cleaned over 8 months using either bleach, tap water, soap, or a Bacillus-containing probiotic cleaner [96]. Following this seeding period, clinical E. coli and S. aureus strains were deposited on the blocks and desiccated. Their survival was then assessed after 24 hours via CFU enumeration. Blocks cleaned with either soap or the probiotic cleaner had almost no viable pathogens after 24 hours; however, pathogen abundance on the tap water and bleach-cleaned blocks was significantly higher. Additional linoleum blocks were seeded and cleaned as before and then inoculated with a fluorescently labelled P. aeruginosa strain. Following a 48-hour incubation within a flow cell with tryptic soy broth, the blocks were imaged to assess the extent of surface colonization by P. aeruginosa. Almost no growth was observed for the blocks cleaned with tap water or soap, but there was extensive colonization by P. aeruginosa on the bleach and probiotic cleaner blocks. These lab-based studies shed light on how Bacillus, the primary biocontrol bacteria used in commercial probiotic cleaning products, behaves in different environments and varied microbial communities. However, some lab studies show that Bacillus mostly fails to germinate and has a limited impact on the survival of pathogens like A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae [95]. Conversely, using a probiotic cleaner appears to establish a microbial ecosystem that effectively kills or inhibits pathogens, but that cleaning with soap also leads to a microbial community that is just as effective at pathogen inhibition [96]. However, the Bacillus cleaner did not appear to prevent the accumulation of P. aeruginosa when inoculated in a rich media, suggesting that environmental conditions are important for metabolic ecology. Although each study used different methods and conditions, they together reveal that Bacillus species do not automatically thrive and effectively compete with other microbes on surfaces. There appear to be only specific situations where Bacillus can effectively compete against other microbes in the built environment, which highlights the need for detailed investigation of biocontrol microbes on varied surface types before wide-scale deployment. An important early study on the effectiveness of biocontrol cleaning methods used a solution containing B. subtilis, B. pumilus, and P. megaterium spores [21] over 24 weeks. These spores reduced the CFUs recovered from coliforms, S. aureus, C. difficile, and Candida albicans on surfaces by 50%–89% after 3–4 weeks of application as compared to surfaces cleaned using standard cleaning methods. The observed reduction remained steady throughout the remaining 4 months of the study, but pathogen abundance rebounded when traditional cleaning was reintroduced. A subsequent study focused on the resistance of the surface microbial community to antibiotics when a probiotic cleaning solution was used, as well as whether patients were colonized by the Bacillus species in the cleaner and if the Bacillus germinated on the surfaces [84]. Spores were found to germinate on the dry, relatively nutrient-deficient surfaces but were not found in samples of blood and urine from patients. Again, a decrease in pathogen abundance was observed on surfaces, as well as a reduction in the abundance of genes associated with antibiotic resistance. The study found no evidence that the Bacillus spp. were acquiring antibiotic resistance genes from the native microbial community. These results prompted a large multicentre study focused on investigating whether Bacillus-based cleaning products could reduce the resistome of hospital-associated pathogens [98]. A previous study demonstrated that healthcare-associated pathogens tended to acquire additional antibiotic resistance and virulence genes over time in the hospital [25]. The internal medicine wards of five Italian hospitals were enrolled and samples were collected for an initial 6-month period, during which traditional cleaning methods were continued. Following this baseline period, a 6-month intervention was carried out using a Probiotic Cleaning Hygiene System (PCHS) that consisted of B. subtilis, B. pumilus, and P. megaterium spores, after which there was a 6-month postintervention period. The use of PCHS was associated with an up to 99% reduction in AMR genes contained in the hospital microbiome, with a 33%–100% decrease in the presence of resistant strains. The use of PCHS was also associated with a 60% decrease in the consumption of antimicrobial drugs by patients, leading to a 75% reduction in the costs associated with treating AMR infections. The cumulative incidence of healthcare-associated infections decreased significantly in the post-PCHS treatment period compared to the conventional treatment phase, from 4.8% to 2.3% (p < .0001). These results are promising, but replication by other research teams is necessary to increase confidence in this approach, as well as further investigations into mechanisms of action. Lacking this knowledge severely limits our ability to refine the process and to understand the ecological dynamics that underpin the observations. Additional follow-up studies have confirmed the effectiveness of probiotic surface treatments in reducing the abundance of AMR genes and the potential pathogens that often harbour them. For example, bacteriophages are an attractive fast-acting alternative to spores. In a study using the PCHS combined with phage targeting Staphylococcus in hospital bathrooms, an 87% reduction in Staphylococcus species (including nonpathogenic strains) was observed after only 1 day of phage treatment [90]. After six additional days, there was a 97% reduction in Staphylococcus observed, but there was a return to preintervention levels after 4 days of treatment cessation. Resuming the treatment for 7 days resulted in a reduction similar to that observed in the first treatment period. A larger follow-up study at two hospitals using the combined PCHS+Phage treatment had mixed results. One hospital showed a significant reduction in Staphylococcus, but the other did not [24]. This study was performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the use of emergency applications of 3% NaClO disinfectant. One hospital used a greater number of NaClO applications, and this increase was correlated with an order of magnitude reduction in Bacillus and phage abundance, likely leading to a reduction in the effectiveness of the probiotic intervention [24]. These results support an earlier study, also performed during the COVID-19 pandemic, that found a reduction in pathogen load through the use of PCHS was reversed when emergency 5% NaClO was implemented [91]. These recent studies highlight the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of real-world applications, the limits of using phage as a treatment, and how probiotic cleaning methods might be rendered ineffective when harsh bleach cleaning agents are used in tandem.Conclusions and future directions Probiotic intervention studies in hospitals [22-24, 99, 100] have demonstrated the potential to revolutionize cleaning approaches in healthcare facilities. However, much is still unknown about their mechanism of action, as well as how additional factors could influence their efficaciousness in situ. Further investigation of how spores germinate and competitively exclude other microbes in these dry, nutrient-depleted environments is needed for the successful development and broad deployment of probiotic cleaners. To answer these questions, we must use a variety of experimental strategies, including varied application methods (i.e. how the cleaner is applied and at what concentration is the cleaner most effective), inclusion of taxonomically diverse pathogenic microbes at varied concentrations, and a characterization of whole community dynamics in response to cleaner application. These experiments will require highly controlled and easily manipulatable conditions, and therefore, laboratory testing will be essential for determining the relative importance of factors associated with method of use, humidity, nutrient availability, surface material type, and cleaning regimes. Further, simulating transmission events of microbes from surfaces to humans will be needed to more fully understand how probiotic cleaners influence transmission rates of taxa of interest. Differential use patterns of healthcare facilities might alter best practices for probiotic cleaner use. For example, it is unknown how the magnitude of response might vary between different wards or rooms. Patient rooms and bathrooms have been the primary focus of intervention studies; however, other shared spaces, such as hallways or visitor areas, also carry the potential for pathogen accumulation and transmission risk. Additionally, long-term monitoring is crucial to detect whether the pathogens in these environments begin to adapt to this new cleaning method and therefore become resistant to biocontrol. Such a situation could start an evolutionary “arms race” with unknown outcomes. It is crucial to consider the health and emotional impacts on the patients and staff. Sociological studies on healthcare workers and patients are necessary to understand the perception that patients, staff, and the public have about the use of these novel products and to involve their feedback in product design and application. The popularity of probiotics in popular foods and drinks could help alleviate concerns, but deploying them in hospitals, especially around high-risk patients, will likely be controversial. Understanding the perception of these products, and explaining how and why they work, will aid in successful widespread adoption across healthcare systems. As seen in studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, harsh cleaning treatments using bleach may inhibit the probiotic and phage cleaners, so it will be imperative that staff are trained in how to properly treat surfaces cleaned with probiotics. Beyond direct application to the engineering of probiotic materials [85], 3D printing is primed to be the future of microbial biocontrol in built environments. Recent advances in 3D printing have resulted in materials that can be printed at low enough temperatures that spores and even live bacteria are not harmed during the assembly process. Unlike previous efforts, which used hydrogels [85], these new approaches can enable the printing of ceramics or hard plastics with improved utility as building materials. Using genome-enabled metabolic modelling to select bacteria that are optimized for these printing processes presents unique opportunities for built environment-specific designs that could be used to manipulate the ecology of these environments in prescribed ways. If this trend continues, we may soon be able to print tiles, furniture, or even entire structures out of sustainably produced microbially active materials [97]. Establishing the efficacy of these products through well-designed field intervention studies that are informed by lab-based experiments is an exciting subfield of built environment microbiome research and will ultimately lead to better products, building materials, and design techniques in buildings to improve occupant health and well-being.Acknowledgements Figures created with BioRender.com.Contributor Information Neil R Gottel, Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92037, United States.

Abstract Extracellular purine nucleotides appear capable of regulating plant development, defence and stress responses by acting in part as agonists of plasma membrane calcium channels. Factors stimulating ATP release include wounding, osmotic stress and elicitors. Here we show that exogenous abscisic acid and L-glutamate can also cause ATP accumulation around Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant. This confirms that ADP could elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species. Keywords: abscisic acid, ADP, ATP, calcium, channel, glutamate, root Extracellular purine nucleotides can regulate plant cell growth, stress responses, immunity and symbiotic events.1,2 Their activity at the plasma membrane elicits increased production of nitric oxide (NO), activation of NADPH oxidases to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and transient elevations of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]cyt).3-9 Although there are no equivalents to animal ionotropic or metabotropic purinoreceptor genes apparent in higher plant genomes, plant responses to extracellular purine nucleotides are sensitive to antagonists of animal purinoceptors.1,10-12 Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane Ca2+ channel activity was recently found to be activated rapidly by extracellular ADP, consistent with the presence of an ionotropic receptor.13 Parallels with animal cells also extend to a conserved mechanism of ATP and ADP hydrolysis by extracellular apyrase,14 plus release of ATP by exocytosis15 and an ABC transporter.16 ATP is released at plant wound and growth points, in response to touch, elicitors and hyperosmotic stress imposed by salts.1,17,18 Here, wounding, hyperosmotic or sodicity stress resulted in distinct levels and time courses of ATP accumulation around excised roots of A. thaliana (Fig. 1). Recovery of ATP levels to control values was evident at the 30 min time point after wounding but remained significantly elevated in response to abiotic stresses (30 min time point; NaCl, p < 0.001; sorbitol, p < 0.036, Student’s t-test). The stress response hormone abscisic acid (ABA) at 1 and 10 μM also promoted ATP accumulation around excised roots (Fig. 2A), albeit to a lower level. Accumulation above the ethanol control was significant for both concentrations at 10 and 15 min. Application of 10 μM ABA inhibits A. thaliana primary root growth, a response involving a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase and plasma membrane proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK4).19,20 PERK4 directs the activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels.20 As extracellular ATP activates root epidermal plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels via activation of an NADPH oxidase, it becomes feasible that ABA inhibition involves ATP release and sensing upstream of NADPH oxidases and PERKs, resulting in an inhibitory Ca2+ influx. High [Ca2+]cyt can act as a “brake” to root hair elongation and perhaps this may also hold for elongation of primary roots.21 Production of ROS by NADPH oxidases also promotes root cell elongation by activating plasma membrane Ca2+ channels.22 Thus, the dose-dependent stimulation or inhibition of growth by extracellular ATP may be effected by the levels of ROS production and channel activation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Wounding and abiotic stress cause ATP accumulation around A. thaliana roots.A. thaliana (Col-0) was grown for seven days as described previously on MS medium with 1% (w/v) sucrose.13 Eight roots of similar lengths were placed in the well of a 96-well plate containing sterile liquid MS/1% (w/v) sucrose, with or without test substances. ATP content of samples was determined with a luciferin/luciferase assay (Molecular Probes), using a Fluostar Optima plate reading luminometer. Wounding was inflicted by moving a gloved finger up and down the roots to damage root hairs prior to immersion in assay medium. Results are mean ± SEM from 3 independent trials.Figure 2. Open in a new tab ABA and L-glutamate cause ATP accumulation around A. thaliana roots. Roots were exposed to (A) ABA with 0.025% (v/v) ethanol (EtOH) as the solvent carrier control and (B) L- or D-glutamate. Conditions as in Figure 1. Results are mean ± SEM from 3 independent trials.Extracellular glutamate can also elevate root [Ca2+]cyt by activating plasma membrane glutamate receptor-like (GLR) channels.23,24 As shown in Figure 2B, 1 μM L-glutamate caused transient ATP accumulation but equimolar D-glutamate did not, indicating stereospecificity of the response. Exposure to 10 μM L-glutamate was less effective than 1 μM, suggesting a biphasic response. At these concentrations, glutamate is unlikely to be transported into roots by the low affinity amino acid permease AAP1 or by H+-coupled symport25,26 and so should be acting extracellularly. L-glutamate at 10 μM and above inhibits A. thaliana primary root growth,27 and it will be interesting to see how this relates, if at all, to ATP functions. Perception of extracellular glutamate at the epidermis upstream of ATP release could be mediated by GLR2.1, 3.3, 3.5 and 5 as the most highly expressed of the gene family in this cell file. Across the meristematic region GLR2.4, 3.3, 3.6,5 are the most highly expressed while across the elongation zone, GLR 1.4, 2.1, 3.3, 3.5 and 3.6 predominate.28 Once purine nucleotides are released from roots, they can activate plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channels directly (ADP)13 or via production of extracellular ROS (ATP).11 Accordingly, ATP activation of root epidermal plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channels can be prevented by applying dithiothreitol (DTT) as a reductant.11 Here, ADP-induced [Ca2+]cyt elevation of A. thaliana root epidermal protoplasts (measured as in ref. 13) was unaffected by incubation in DTT (1 mM) (0.1 mM ADP; 0.45 ± 0.04 μM [Ca2+]cyt, n = 6: ADP + DTT; 0.52 ± 0.03 μM [Ca2+]cyt, n = 9), confirming that extracellular ROS are not involved in ADP activation of Ca2+ influx. Addition of purine nucleotides to A. thaliana root epidermis causes transient changes in net Ca2+ and K+ fluxes downstream of the initial sensing event.13 ADP promotes net Ca2+ influx but ATP and the weakly hydrolysable analog adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate (αßATP) only promote influx when applied up to 100 μM, above which Ca2+ efflux is promoted.13 Under control conditions used in ref. 13, there is a net K+ efflux from both elongation zone (-235 ± 16 nmol.m−2.s−1 ; n = 33) and mature epidermis (-44 ± 3 nmol.m−2.s-1; n = 25) detected by extracellular vibrating K+-selective microelectrodes. From the data presented in ref. 13, this indicates that in the elongation zone, ADP, ATP and αßATP up to approximately 10 μM would decrease net K+ efflux and promote Ca2+ influx. Above 10 μM, K+ efflux would be promoted. At the mature epidermis ADP up to 10 μM and ATP/αßATP up to approximately 100 μM would decrease K+ efflux while promoting Ca2+ influx. Above these levels, K+ efflux would be promoted. At present the contribution of underlying cells and the walls are unknown. If the origin were the epidermal plasma membrane, the results indicate involvement of K+ efflux pathways and it will be interesting to test whether the epidermal K+ efflux channel AtGORK is involved.29 How the cation fluxes are generated and what their consequences are now need to be elucidated.

    "abstract": "Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. Subject terms: Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones",
    "introduction": "Introduction The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21 and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.",
    "methods": "Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity. Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63 was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900) and OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900) in the Zhonghua11 background and OsEBF2, OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700), OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) in the crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) of each gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into the BsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCRW1::OsCRW1, proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06g0619600::Os06g0619600, we amplified the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1, 3 Kb of proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1, Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from the pUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generate pOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 promoter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we amplified the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1, 2500 bp of proOsEIL2) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the BamHI/SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) and proUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we amplified the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation64. Transformants were verified by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65, proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP14, or NES-YC3.665 were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 or oscrw1KO lines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant background by PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments. Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66 for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm) of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl3 (100 μM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponic experiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experiments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments. MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1 progenies. F1 progenies were selfed to generate F2 progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2 plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50× and 30× coverage for crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150-bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP-index method69 and candidate SNPs were identified. Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation. Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 or GFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82), we amplified the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 or OsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of the pSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI-PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nm and 360 nm for excitation, respectively. Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol’s solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol’s stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution. Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+ (NES-YC3.6, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively65. TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7-OsEIL1 or pGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) for growth. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221-P3P2, and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were transferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter of OsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-boxmut, ACCACC; G-boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 or OsERF82, and pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins were purified from E. coli by nickel affinity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence of OsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The protein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at 4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-linking, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP™ ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for each experiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde under vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and fragmented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of the yield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNA complex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime, P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028, China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform agent for DNA purification (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequences on the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and purified DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR. Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp-deficient SD medium and double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X-α-gal) for growth. RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html). RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA to 20 μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2–Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

    "results": "Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). Fig. 1. crw1 shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c–h), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i–n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic The coiling phenotype of crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placed horizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11. To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells in crw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VENUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). In Arabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT and crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost in crw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization. Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F1 plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F2 progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (χ2 = 0.002, P = 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identified Os06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KO lines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).

Significant difference from WT was determined by two-sided Student’s t-test. Scale bars are 1 cm in (e and c), 1 mm in (g), 200 μm in (h) and 20 μm in (i). The data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 11). In roots, OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h). Transient expression of p35S::GFP-OsCRW1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2i). Elevated ethylene response in crw1 when grown in hydroponic OsCRW1 encodes an F-box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (AtEBF1)27,28. Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF238, and loss of function of OsEBF1 or OsEBF2 led to a hypersensitivity of root and coleoptile to exogenous ethylene38, and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice39,40. To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1KO lines in water (Fig. 3c–f), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.The above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, like Arabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF141,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. 4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil-vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm−3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30 Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2KO/crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.

In (d, g), different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test). In (k, l), significant difference from WT at *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, respectively (Student’s t-test, one-sided). Scale bars, 1 cm. Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis43. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e). OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. 17d–f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water. The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved. OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS-responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS46 and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG)47 (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes. Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying amplified ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impaired gravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown in water-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm−3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue the crw1 phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar-solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3 – 1.2%, mass/volume). crw1 showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1 - 6 Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig. 2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19 Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8 – 1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34 – 77 Pa) (Fig. 6a–c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed when crw1 plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10° angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig. 22). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥ 34 Pa is sufficient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. Fig. 6.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip of crw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. The resistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to be approximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment of foam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin distribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribution and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhibition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling. Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49. To investigate whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. Fig. 7.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+ signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl3, a Ca2+ channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl3 suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl3 abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca2+ signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μM LaCl3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3 (Supplementary Fig. 28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism. The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30g).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. Open in a new tab The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html). The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212, aux113, eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53 and gravity signaling6,7 cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil.",

Copyright notice ID: 12008199 PMID: 40251159 Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. Subject terms: Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones This study demonstrated that amplified ethylene signaling impairs gravitropic growth of rice roots by affecting root cap stability and OsPIN2 polar localization, whereas mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to safeguard gravitropism.Introduction The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21 and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1). Fig. 1. crw1 shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil.

The direction of each root tip was measured as the absolute value toward the direction of gravity.

WT and crw1 expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP grew in water or soil for two days. Scale bars are 1 cm in (a, d), 100 μm in (b, c, f, g) and 20 μm in (h). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. 4c–h), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 4i–n). crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic The coiling phenotype of crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. 1b) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. 1c). When roots were placed horizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating impaired gravitropic response. Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism11. To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. 1g), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. 1g). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6b). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells in crw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. 7f, g). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VENUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). In Arabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT and crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost in crw1 (Fig. 1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed in crw1 root tips. When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. 1a–h and Supplementary Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization.Cloning the causative gene of crw1 To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F1 plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. 9a), and the F2 progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (χ2 = 0.002, P = 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. 9b), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). Complementation tests identified Os06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 9e, f). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig. 2a, b). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1KO) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. 2e, f and Supplementary Fig. 10a). The three oscrw1KO lines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 11). In roots, OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. 2g, h). Transient expression of p35S::GFP-OsCRW1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2i).Elevated ethylene response in crw1 when grown in hydroponic OsCRW1 encodes an F-box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (AtEBF1)27,28. Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF238, and loss of function of OsEBF1 or OsEBF2 led to a hypersensitivity of root and coleoptile to exogenous ethylene38, and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice39,40. To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). Knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. 12c, d), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism. We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. 3a, b). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 13). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1KO lines in water (Fig. 3c–f), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.The above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, like Arabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors27,28. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF141,42. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. 4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil-vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm−3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al.30 Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2KO/crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.

In (d, g), different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05 (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test).

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22- and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis43. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e).OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82 To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. 17d–f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water. The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved.OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS-responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots44. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways45. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS46 and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1KO/crw1 lines, oseil2KO/crw1 lines, and oserf82KO/crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG)47 (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes.Mechanical resistance on the root tip rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 After identifying amplified ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 leading to ROS overproduction as the cause of impaired gravitropism in crw1, we explored the mechanism underlying the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 when plants were grown in water-saturated paddy soil and other solid media (Supplementary Fig. 3). These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm−3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.30). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue the crw1 phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar-solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3 – 1.2%, mass/volume). crw1 showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1 - 6 Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig. 2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19 Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8 – 1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34 – 77 Pa) (Fig. 6a–c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed when crw1 plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10° angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig. 22). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of ≥ 34 Pa is sufficient to rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1. Fig. 6.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further examine the effect of mechanical resistance, we attached a polystyrene foam pellet (1-mm diameter) to the root tip of crw1 grown in water, which applied a mechanical stimulus to the root tip through the buoyance of water against the foam pellet (Fig. 6d). The pellet was open at the top to allow normal gas diffusion. The resistance of the foam pellet to the root tip was estimated to be approximately 104 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 23). The attachment of foam pellet did not affect the root cap size and symmetric auxin distribution in WT, but largely rescued the root cap size, auxin distribution and the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 24 and Fig. 6e, f), indicating that the root tip is the site for sensing mechanical stimulus which rescues the loss of gravitropism in crw1. Soil compaction may restrict ethylene diffusion away from plant roots, thus amplifying ethylene signaling and inhibiting root growth30. We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. 25). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1KO mutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. 25). The larger inhibition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling.Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca2+) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli48,49. To investigate whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.650, a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance. Fig. 7.

Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To investigate whether the enhanced Ca2+ signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1’s phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl3, a Ca2+ channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl3 suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps (Fig. 7c, d) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig. 7e, f). Importantly, the addition of LaCl3 abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism in crw1. The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. 4a, b) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca2+ signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μM LaCl3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3 (Supplementary Fig. 28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism.The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. 30a). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30g).Discussion Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8). Fig. 8. A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. Open in a new tab The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html).The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin212, aux113, eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53 and gravity signaling6,7 cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+ signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil.Methods Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity.Plasmid construction and plant transformation The CRISPR/Cas9 system63 was used to knock out OsCRW1 (Os06g0605900) and OsEBF2 (Os02g0200900) in the Zhonghua11 background and OsEBF2, OsEIL1 (Os03g0324200), OsEIL2 (Os07g0685700), OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000), and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) in the crw1 background. Two 20-bp target sequences were selected from the coding sequence (CDS) of each gene and cloned into two single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes of pYLgRNA-OsU6a and pYLgRNA-OsU6b by overlapping PCR, producing proU6a-T1-sgRNA and proU6b-T2-sgRNA fragments, respectively. The two fragments were sequentially cloned into the BsaI site of the pYLCRISPR-Cas9Pubi-H vector to generate the ultimate plasmids. To generate the complementation constructs of proOsCRW1::OsCRW1, proOs06g0604400:: Os06g0604400 and proOs06g0619600::Os06g0619600, we amplified the promoter (1739 bp of proOsCRW1, 3 Kb of proOs06g0604400 and 3 Kb of proOs06g0619600) and the open reading frame (ORF) of OsCRW1, Os06g0604400 and Os06g0619600 from the DNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and ORF were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the pCAMBIAL1301 vector. To generate proOsCRW1::GFP constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11and the GFP sequence from the pUN1301 vector with addition of the initiation codon. The promoter and GFP sequence were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the HindIII/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. To generate pOsCRW1::GUS constructs, we amplified the promoter of OsCRW1 (1739 bp) from the DNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced OsCRW1 promoter into the HindIII/BamHI site of the p1300 vector. To generate proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag and proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag constructs, we amplified the promoter (2588 bp of proOsEIL1, 2500 bp of proOsEIL2) and the full-length CDS (without the stop codon) of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the DNA and cDNA of Zhonghua11. The promoter and CDS were cloned together by overlapping PCR and introduced into the BamHI/SpeI site of the pTCK303 vector. To generate proUbi::OsEIL1 (OsEIL1-OX) and proUbi::OsEIL2 (OsEIL2-OX) constructs, we amplified the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 from the cDNA of cv. ZH11 and introduced the CDS segments into the BamHI/SacI site of the pUN1301 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the callus of Zhonghua11 or crw1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation64. Transformants were verified by PCR. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Zhonghua11 expressing DR5rev::VENUS65, proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP14, or NES-YC3.665 were obtained from previous studies. These genotypes and Zhonghua11 expressing proOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or proOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag were crossed with crw1 or oscrw1KO lines (maternal) to obtain the reporter or tag lines in the mutant background by PCR. The F3 seeds were used for experiments.Root growth experiments Germinated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66 for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of crw1 and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT and crw1 in agar-solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm) of WT and crw1 were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl3 (100 μM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponic experiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experiments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments.MutMap-based gene cloning To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype of crw1, we backcrossed crw1 to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1 progenies. F1 progenies were selfed to generate F2 progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2 plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA of crw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50× and 30× coverage for crw1 and WT, respectively), generating 150-bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP-index method69 and candidate SNPs were identified.Tissue expression pattern analysis of OsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GUS were grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressing proOsCRW1::GFP were grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation.Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs of GFP-OsCRW1 or GFP-OsERF82 driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82), we amplified the full-length CDS of OsCRW1 or OsERF82 from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of the pSAT6-GFP-C vector. The fragments of pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1 or pro35S::GFP-OsERF82 were isolated from the pSAT6-GFP-C vector by PI-PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of the pRCS2 vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nm and 360 nm for excitation, respectively.Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol’s solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol’s stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution.Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS Plants expressing proOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP or the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+ (NES-YC3.6, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively65.TUNEL assay The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively.Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDS of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pGADT7 to generate the pGADT7-OsEIL1 and pGADT7-EIL2 vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The pGBKT7-OsCRW1 plasmid and pGADT7-OsEIL1 or pGADT7-OsEIL2 plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs. pGBKT7-53 together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a positive control, and pGBKT7-lam together with pGADT7-T were transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) for growth.Bimolecular fluorescence complementation The full-length CDS of OsCRW1 was fused to the vector of pDONR221-P3P2, and the full-length CDS of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 were fused to the vector of pDONR221-P1P4 by gateway cloning, and then were transferred into pBiFCt-2in1-NN vector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively.Western blot For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT and crw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95 oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Yeast one-hybrid The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGADT7 vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter of OsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of the pAbAi vector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-boxmut, ACCACC; G-boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control. pAbAi carrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self-activation. pGADT7 carrying OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 or OsERF82, and pAbAi carrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The full-length CDS of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 were introduced into the NdeI/XhoI site of the pET29a vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 to express OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His or OsERF82-His fusion protein. OsEIL1-His, OsEIL2-His and OsERF82-His fusion proteins were purified from E. coli by nickel affinity columns. Primers were designed for the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter sequence of OsERF82 or designed for the ERF-binding sites including the GCC box, the G box and the DRE/CRT sequence on the promoter sequence of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes to synthesize biotin-labeled probes, unlabeled probes, and unlabeled mutation probes. The protein and probe were incubated with EMSA reaction solution (prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol, Beyotime, China) for 20 min at room temperature, separated on a 5% polyacrylamide native gel at 4 °C, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV light cross-linking, the DNA on the membrane was detected using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay The ChIP assay was performed using the BeyoChIP™ ChIP Assay Kit (Beyotime, P2080S, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plants of pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 were grown in water for two day, and 15-20 roots were collected as one biological replicate, with three biological replicates for each experiment. Root tissue was cross-linked in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde under vacuum. Chromatin was extracted from the samples and fragmented via ultrasound treatment to a size of 200-500 bp, and 2% of the yield was set aside as input template. The OsEIL1-DNA and OsEIL2-DNA complex were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and protein A/G beads (Beyotime, P2080S, China), or coimmunoprecipitated with IgG (Beyotime, A7028, China) with protein A/G beads. NaCl (0.2 M) was added to the solution of protein-DNA complex and heated at 65 °C for 4 hours to remove the cross-linking between protein and genomic DNA. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform agent for DNA purification (Solarbio, T0250, China). Primers (Supplementary Table 3) were designed near the three EBS sequences on the OsERF82 promoter. Primers and purified DNA were used for ChIP-qPCR.Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS of OsERF82 was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of the pGBKT7 vector to generate the pGBKT7-OsCRW1 vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The pGBKT7-OsERF82 plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain. pGBKT7 plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp-deficient SD medium and double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X-α-gal) for growth.RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on roots of crw1 and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html).RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke, Beijing, China). A HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA to 20 μL cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an RT-PCR detection system (CFX96, Bio-Rad) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). OsActin and OsHistone were used as the internal reference genes. The expression levels were calculated using the equation 2–Δ(ΔCt). Primers are shown in Supplementary Table 3.Statistics and reproducibility The experiments performed in this study were repeated independently at least three times with similar results. The data are presented as the mean ± SD and the microscope images presented are the most representative of the results.
