Here, we describe a protocol (cryosection muscle quantitative fluorescent in situhybridization) using skeletal muscle cryosections for assessments of telomere length in MuSCs, in their native environment. Using a free software, telomere length measurements are assessed on a single-cell level. We also provide methodology to perform data analyses in several ways.Before you begin Experimental design and considerations Reductions in telomere length in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) have been recently discovered in chronic muscle injury conditions, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Tichy et al., 2017, 2021), which results in a more severe disease phenotype (Sacco et al., 2010). Many common methods for conducting telomere length assessments in other cell and tissue types requires the isolation of primary cells, which may disrupt the tissue environment, requires large numbers of cells to obtain enough genomic DNA for appraisal [Telomere Restriction Fragment/TRF analysis (Mender and Shay, 2015)], or only provides the average telomere length over the entirety of the cell population [Telomere:single copy gene QPCR methodology (Cawthon, 2002)] . The quantitative fluorescent in-situ hybridization (Q-FISH) technique, which allows for assessment of telomere length based on the fluorescence intensity of a hybridized probe, coupled with semi-automated telomere length assessments using a free software (Telometer), provides robust information that can eliminate such limitations. Here, we provide a protocol where our previously established and validated muscle stem cell-specific Q-FISH protocol for measuring telomeres in FACS-isolated MuSCs [MuQ-FISH (Tichy et al., 2017)], has been altered and adapted for use on cryosections of murine skeletal muscle (CRYO MuQ-FISH), leaving the MuSC niche intact. This method can be beneficial for telomere length quantitation of archival samples and may also be adapted to examine telomere lengths in additional muscle-resident cell types, as well as cell types from other tissues. This protocol is also compatible with skeletal muscle cryosections derived from species other than mice but testing and optimization should be conducted by the end user. Note: This protocol utilizes skeletal muscle tissue from research animals and human cohorts. Ensure that the use of research animals has been approved by the appropriate institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) or equivalent oversight body. Additionally, procurement and use of tissues derived from human sources should follow the appropriate organizational rules regarding informed consent and be approved by the end user’s institutional review board. Sample collection for this protocol was done according to institutional guidelines and regulations of the University of Pennsylvania. Note: For telomere data extraction from images, the following software must be installed on the analysis computer: java se (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and the freeware Telometer (https://demarzolab.pathology.jhmi.edu/telometer/download.html). Install software according to instructions listed on the websites. This protocol includes the following steps: 1) Skeletal muscle preparation, embedding, sectioning, 2) CRYO MuQ-FISH, 3) image collection, 4) analysis and statisticsSkeletal muscle preparation, embedding, and sectioning Timing: 2 days 1.Humanely euthanize mice according to an approved IACUC protocol methodology and institutional guidelines. Note: This protocol uses male mice between 2 and 5 months of age. However, this protocol can be applied to samples derived from other ages and both sexes of mice. 2.Spray the lower half of mouse body with 70% ethanol. 3.Lay mouse on its back and completely remove skin from the back legs. 4.Dissect desired hindlimb skeletal muscles for assessment. Note: For downstream assessments, it is ideal to compare the same types of muscles, rather than mixing different anatomical groups. We routinely utilize either the Tibialis anterior or the gastrocnemius muscles for telomere length measurements. 5.Fix and process tissues for embedding. a.Place isolated muscles in 3–4 mL of cold (4°C) 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS per well in a 6-well plate. b.Incubate tissue on a rocker at 4°C for at least 2 h. Note: Tibialis anterior muscles up to 200 mg are fixed for 2 h, but larger muscles, such as the gastrocnemius, require a 3-h incubation for fixative to fully enter the tissue. c.Remove muscles and place in pre-chilled 30% sucrose in water (4°C) overnight (16 h) at 4°C. 6.Embed tissues in O.C.T. and freeze. a.Label 15 mm × 15 mm × 5 mm base molds with pertinent mouse information with an alcohol resistant marker and mark directionality of the muscle by labeling the terminal tendon location. b.Fill base mold with O.C.T. to the point where it almost overflows from the inset. Do not allow bubbles to form. If they do, use a 100 μL micropipettor and tip to remove the bubbles. c.Place fixed muscle tissue in the base mold and push it evenly to the bottom of the mold. The orientation should be as it was labeled previously. d.Chill 2-methylbutane with dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Immerse muscles in base molds in chilled 2-methylbutane for >30 s for TA muscles and >1 min for gastrocnemius muscles. e.Place chilled blocks on dry ice for 1 h to allow residual 2-methylbutane to evaporate. f.Wrap blocks in base molds with parafilm and store at −80°C for at least overnight (16 h). Pause point: Cryoblocks can be stored at −80°C indefinitely. 7.Sectioning of skeletal muscles. a.The evening before cryosectioning, remove cryoblocks from −80°C and place at −20°C. b.Label superfrost plus slides with pertinent mouse information. c.Remove block from base mold and section in a cryostat, cutting 10 μm slices. We try to keep the tissue orientation the same for all blocks. Both longitudinal, as well as cross sectional slices will work with this assay. Note: For optimal adherence of sections, we firmly press cut sections onto room temperature (25°C) superfrost plus slides. d.Store slides at −20°C until all samples have been collected and sectioned. Pause point: Slides can be stored at −20°C indefinitely.Key resources table REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey anti-goat IgG; 1/300 dilution Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# A11055; RRID:AB_2534102 Goat anti-mouse Vcam1; stock made at 1 mg/mL; 1/100 dilution Fisher Scientific Cat# PIPA547029; RRID:AB_2609027 Rat anti-CD11b-biotin, clone M1/70; 1/200 dilution BD Biosciences Cat# 553309; RRID:AB_394773 Rat anti-CD31-biotin; 1/200 dilution Fisher Scientific Cat# 13-0311-85; RRID:AB_466421 Rat anti-mouse CD34-BV421, CloneRAM34; 1/20 dilution BD Biosciences Cat# 562608; RRID:AB_11154576 Rat anti-CD45-biotin; 1/500 dilution BD Biosciences Cat# 553078; RRID:AB_394608 Rat anti-Ly-6A/E-biotin (Sca1), clone E13–161.7; 1/200 dilution BD Biosciences Cat# 553334; RRID:AB_394790 anti-Alpha 7 Integrin Alexa Fluor 647, cloneR2F2; 1/25 dilution Ablab.ca Cat# 67-0010-05;RRID: AB_2890939 Biotinylated mouse anti-human CD31; 1/50 dilution Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# 13-0319-82;RRID:AB_466423 Chemicals, peptides, and recombinant proteins 4% paraformaldehyde Thermo Scientific Cat# J19943-K2 Antigen unmasking solution (Commercial citrate buffer) Vector Labs Cat# H-3300 Bovine Serum Albumin (Fraction V) Gemini Bio-Products Cat# 700-100P Cenpb-Cy3 PNA Bio Cat# F3002 Dextran sulfate sodium salt Sigma-Aldrich Cat# D8906 EDTA Invitrogen Cat#15575-020 Ethanol, 200 proof Decon Labs Cat# 2701 Ethylene Carbonate Sigma-Aldrich Cat# E26258 Formamide Sigma-Aldrich Cat# 47670 Immersion oil, type A Nikon Cat# MXA20233 OCT Thermo Scientific Cat# 6502G Potassium chloride Sigma Aldrich Cat# P9541 Potassium phosphate, monobasic Sigma Aldrich Cat# P9791 Prolong gold plus DAPI Thermo Scientific Cat# P36935 RNAse A Fisher Scientific Cat# AM9780 Sodium Chloride Sigma Aldrich Cat# S6191 Sodium Phosphate, dibasic, dihydrate Sigma Aldrich Cat# S3264 SSC buffer, 20× Corning Cat# 46-020-CM Streptavidin PE-Cy7 BioLegend Cat# 405206 Streptavidin Cy3 Thermo Scientific Cat# SA1010 Sucrose Sigma-Aldrich Cat#S0389 TelC-Alexa Fluor 647 PNA Bio Cat# F1013 Tris-Cl Quality Biological Cat#351-006-131 Triton X-100 Fisher Scientific Cat# BP151 Tween 20 Fisher Scientific Cat# BP337 Experimental models: organisms/strains Mouse: C57Bl/6J, 2-5-month-old males Jackson Laboratory Stock# 000664; RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664 Mouse: IKK2CA: B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(Ikbkb)/Rsky/J, 2–5-month-old males Jackson Laboratory Stock# 008242; RRID:IMSR_JAX:008242 Mouse: Pax7ERT2Cre: B6.Cg-Pax7tm1(cre/ERT2)Gaka/J, 2–5-month-old males Jackson Laboratory Stock# 017763; RRID:IMSR_Jax:017763 Mouse: mdx/mTR: B6.Cg-Terctm1Rdp Dmdmdx-4Cv/BlauJ, 7-month-old males Jackson Laboratory Stock# 023535;RRID: IMSR_Jax:023535 Rat: Sprague Dawley, male, 14-month-old male Charles River Stock# 001;RRID: MGI:5651135 Biological samples Human skeletal muscle samples, 10–15-year-old male Obtained in house N/A Software and algorithms Graphpad Prism v. 9.1.2 Licensed Software https://www.graphpad.com Image J Open Source https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ Java SE 11 Open Source https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html Microsoft Excel Licensed Software https://www.office.com NIS-Elements Licensed Software https://www.nikon.com/products/microscope-solutions/lineup/img_soft/nis-elements/ Telometer ImageJ Plugin Open Source https://demarzolab.pathology.jhmi.edu/telometer/ Other Coplin Staining Jar Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# S17495A Slide Tray for Immuno-Staining with Black Cover RPI corp.

Common equipment such as freezers, refrigerators, rockers, water baths, steamers, and thermomixers are interchangeable with any other brand and model. Any widefield microscope equipped with the proper filter sets and a 100× objective can complete the imaging described in this protocol.Software The following software are instrumental in analysis of datasets generated using this protocol. •Java SE 11 or later •Telometer v3.0.5 •Microsoft Excel 365 or equivalent •Graphpad prism 9.1.2 or later Step-by-step method details Telomere, centromere, muscle stem cell, and nuclear staining Timing: 2 days 1.Remove one slide from each desired sample set from −20°C and warm to room temperature (25°C). 2.Permeabilize sections by immersing slides in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min in a coplin jar at room temperature (25°C). Note: The coplin jar used in this protocol holds approximately 50 mL of solution and 8 slides. If more slides must be stained, we recommend using a tissue-tek staining dish and 24-place slide holder. This alternative setup requires 200–250 mL of solution volume for adequate coverage of the slides. 3.Wash slides twice with PBS for 3 min each at room temperature (25°C). 4.Perform heat-mediated antigen retrieval with TET buffer. a.Heat buffer to boiling in a microwave first and then transfer buffer to a coplin jar placed in a preheated steamer (95°–100°C). b.Add slides to the coplin jar containing hot TET buffer (95°–100°C) and incubate for 10 min. Remove coplin jar containing the slides from the steamer and let it cool at room temperature (25°C) for 15 min. Note: Take care when handling hot solutions. CRITICAL: Do not let the slides dry at any time following antigen retrieval, as doing so greatly increases autofluorescence of the tissue and will make distinguishing MuSCs difficult. c.Wash slides with PBS twice for 3 min each in a coplin jar at room temperature (25°C). 5.RNAse A treatment a.Remove slides from coplin jar and mark tissue boundaries with a hydrophobic/PAP pen. b.Add sufficient RNase A (100 μg/mL) to cover tissue on the slide (100–200 μL) and cover the slide with a glass coverslip to prevent evaporation. CRITICAL: RNase should be DNase-free. We routinely prepare RNase stock concentrations of 10 mg/mL, heat at 100°C for 10 min to destroy DNAses and then dilute to 100ug/mL in water and store at −20°C. c.Incubate slides at 37°C in a slide warmer or alternative heating source for 20 min. d.Remove coverslip and transfer slides into coplin jars containing PBS. Wash slides twice for 3 min each at room temperature (25°C). 6.Telomere Staining a.Prepare hybridization buffer [adapted from (Matthiesen and Hansen, 2012)] as described in the materials and equipment section. Note: The hybridization buffer requires extensive vortexing and pipetting to get all components completely into solution. Heating or alteration of pH is unnecessary. When all components are properly dissolved, the solution will be viscous. b.Prepare TelC-Alexa Fluor 647 telomere probe and optional Cy3-CENPB centromere probe. i.Dilute 5 nmol probe pellet provided by the supplier with 100uL formamide. ii.Aliquot in 4 μL aliquots in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80°C. Note: Probe is light sensitive. All steps proceeding the addition of probe should be done in the dark or low-light conditions. Note: Probes stored at −80°C are stable for at least several months. Note: We recommend using the Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated telomere probe, as it provides the least background in skeletal muscle cryosections. c.Remove telomere probe from −80°C storage, thaw, and add probe at a 1/600 dilution to the hybridization buffer (1.67 μL/mL of buffer). Optional: Centromere probe staining and analysis is not required, unless problems arise with abnormal nuclear architecture or DAPI staining intensities between samples. If centromere probe staining is desired, use Cy3-CENPB probe at 1/600 dilution and add it at the same time as the telomere probe above. The CENPB probe is prepared identically to the telomere probe. d.Heat probe(s) in hybridization buffer for 10 min at 67°C in a thermomixer or alternative heating source in the dark. e.Add hybridization buffer containing probe to slides. We typically use 100 μL probe solution per slide. Cover slides with a glass coverslip to prevent evaporation during incubation. CRITICAL: It is crucial that bubbles are kept to a minimum, as areas that are not evenly covered will not stain properly. f.Incubate slides in a Thermobrite slide warmer or equivalent heating source, according to Table 1. g.Preheat wash buffers I, II, III, IV to 55°C in a water bath or equivalent heating source. h.Gently remove coverslips from slides after hybridization, place slides in coplin jars, and incubate with 50 mL prewarmed wash buffer I for 5 min. Keep coplin jar at 55°C during the wash process. Repeat wash once. i.Continue washing stepwise with 2 washes each (50 mL per wash) of wash buffer II, wash buffer III, and wash buffer IV, in that order, for 5 min each wash and at 55°C. j.Wash slides once with PBS for 5 min at room temperature (25°C). 7.Muscle Stem Cell Staining a.Block sections in 50 mL antibody blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature (25°C). b.Incubate slides in cold (4°C) blocking buffer with VCAM antibody (1/100 dilution); stock antibody concentration 1 mg/mL, in a dark, humidified staining chamber overnight (16 h) at 4°C. We use 100 μL of antibody solution per slide. Cover slides with a coverslip to ensure even coverage of antibody solution. c.Wash slides the following day in coplin jars with 50 mL PBS, twice, 5 min each at room temperature (25°C). d.Incubate sections for 1 h with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey anti-goat IgG; 1/300 dilution) in antibody blocking buffer at room temperature (25°C). We use 100 μL of antibody solution per slide. Cover slides with a coverslip to ensure even coverage of antibody solution. e.Wash slides three times for 5 min each with PBS at room temperature (25°C). PBS washes are carried out in coplin jars and using 50 mL of solution. f.Mount coverslips with Prolong gold with DAPI. g.Allow mounting media to solidify overnight (16 h) at room temperature (25°C) in the dark. Table 1. Telomere/centromere probe hybridization conditions Steps Temperature Time Initial Denaturation 67°C 10 min Hybridization 42°C 90 min Open in a new tabImage acquisition Timing: less than 3 days CRITICAL: The imaging must take place as soon as possible after staining, and imaging must be completed for all samples in as short a period of time as possible. Given the sensitivity of Q-FISH assays, minor changes in fluorescence intensities can result in skewed datasets. Even with antifade agents in the mounting medium, it is imperative to image cells of interest as quickly as possible, so we recommend completing imaging of all samples in 3 days or less. 8.Identify VCAM+ cells present in tissue sections using a Nikon Eclipse NiU widefield epifluorescence microscope. Note: Any widefield epifluorescence microscope with appropriate objectives, filters, and camera should be capable of completing this assay. Note: While VCAM1 is a good marker of MuSCs, it may also label other cells, such as endothelial cells. To prevent selecting the wrong cell types during image acquisition and analysis, we only image MuSCs in the satellite cell position (between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma). Additionally, staining with other non-muscle markers such as CD31 and CD45 (as described in Tichy et al., 2017) could be performed to exclude such populations from the analysis. a.Identify VCAM+ cells (Alexa Fluor 488+) with a low power air objective (i.e., Nikon plan fluor 10×/0.30 objective). b.Switch to a higher-powered 100× objective (i.e., Nikon plan apo100×/1.45 oil) for actual imaging and photographing cells of interest. 9.Identify the optimal exposure settings for DAPI, telomere Alexa Fluor 647 signal, and optional centromere Cy3 imaging. Troubleshooting 1, Troubleshooting 2 Note: Several slides should be examined before determining the optimal exposure settings. It is undesirable to have oversaturated or undersaturated pixels in any of the images. In either situation, fewer regions of interest are identified. CRITICAL: Once intensity settings are determined, the exposure settings should not be changed for the duration of the particular experiment. 10.Proceed with multichannel imaging of VCAM, DAPI, telomere, and optional centromere signals (Figure 1). a.Identify focal planes containing the most telomere signals for every cell of interest. b.A minimum of 35 VCAM+ cells should be imaged per biological sample. c.Save multichannel images in raw file formats to maintain metadata. For Nikon Elements software, this is a .nd2 file. d.Image as many cells as possible during scheduled equipment usage hours from the biological samples. Troubleshooting 3 Optional: Obtaining z-stacks and flattening with an extended depth of focus algorithm will provide more telomere and optional centromere foci per cell, but a single focal plane with many foci in focus is sufficient to yield useable data for analysis. Note: Imaging more VCAM+ cells will produce a better representation of the population of MuSCs throughout the muscle. Ensure that more than one muscle section is examined per slide. Note: If imaging of all desired cells from all samples cannot be completed in one day, stagger the genotypes/treatments during imaging to ensure fading that occurs between imaging sessions will be similar between the groups. Note: It is best to avoid imaging/assessing cells of interest that are positioned on top of or below other cells/nuclei, as telomere length quantitated from overlapping cells may confound the datasets. 11.Export raw image files in two groups. a.Each channel should be first exported as grayscale/monochrome 16-bit .tiff images for analysis. b.A merged 8-bit color .tiff image is also exported to identify cells of interest (VCAM+) for later analysis. Pause point: After all needed images are collected, downstream analysis can be conducted at the end user’s leisure. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Representative image of a skeletal muscle cryosection processed for telomere staining Blue: DAPI staining. Red: telomere probe. Green: VCAM muscle stem cell marker. White: optional centromere probe staining for alternative normalization. Yellow text: DAPI, VCAM, and telomere merged image (typical processing). Cyan text: DAPI, VCAM, telomere and centromere merged image. Use of centromere probe requires telomere length normalization to DAPI. Then centromere normalization to DAPI. Finally, a ratio of the two values is generated. Scale bar: 10 μm.Cryosection MuSC-fluorescent in situ hybridization (CRYO MuQ-FISH) telomere length data collection and analysis Timing: varies based on sample size. Several hours to several days. Telomere length is measured using a semi-automated ImageJ-based platform known as Telometer. Telometer provides step-by step instructions to analyze 16-bit monochrome images for telomere length. The premise involves creating a project that is saved on a local machine, identifying cells of interest, and measuring the intensity of telomeres, relative to the total DAPI intensity of that cell. The readout from Telometer produces both total sum intensity of telomeres, which can be normalized to DAPI intensity to account for differences in cell cycle position, as well as the mean intensity of telomeres, which can also be normalized to DAPI. Should nuclear architecture or staining be compromised, telomere measurements can instead be normalized to centromere intensities. In this fashion, Telometer steps are conducted twice. Once, where the telomere signal is assessed relative to DAPI, and then those same cells of interest are analyzed a second time, where the centromere intensities are measured instead of the telomere intensities. The ratio of these measurements would then be used for dataset readouts. 12.Open Telometer software and create a new project in the “Admin” tab (Figure 2A). 13.Click the “Score” tab and follow the on-screen instructions for each step. 14.Select the Project name for your analysis grouping and the Preset objective (in this case 100× telomere) and subtract Cy3 background. The scoring tag adds metadata to the analysis. We do not usually alter this. 15.Select the Telomere 16-bit monochrome exported tiff image when prompted for opening the first image. Note: Telometer defaults as the telomere signal being a Cy3 image. In this protocol, the telomere image is the Alexa Fluor 647 channel image, and it is this image that is opened first when prompted. 16.Next, open the DAPI 16-bit monochrome exported tiff image when prompted. 17.Normalize the Telomere image by clicking and forming a box of any size in an area absent of features and click “normalize” (Figure 2B). 18.Repeat normalization for the DAPI image when prompted (Figure 2C). 19.Continue following software prompts for creating masked images to narrow down regions in the image that contain telomere foci. 20.Threshold the masked image, if necessary, when prompted to obtain the greatest telomere foci in the image with the least background (Figure 2D). Note: The Telometer software typically does a decent job with auto-thresholding, so the investigator does not often need to further threshold. 21.Manually draw a circle encompassing a nucleus of interest when prompted. Refer to the color image to determine which nuclei are clearly VCAM+ and designate the nucleus of interest. Selection of VCAM nuclei should only occur for cells in the satellite cell position (between the basal lamina and sarcolemma). Name the nucleus as desired (Figure 2E). 22.Select the “+ Add Nucleus” button. Repeat for additional VCAM+ cells in the image, if any. Click the “next” button (Figure 2F). Optional: Telometer next gives the option to separate conjoined telomere foci (if counting telomere number) and manually remove halo artifacts from out of focus light. These functions are completely optional for the analysis. 23.Select “complete.” The data will be stored on your local machine. To view images at a later time that have been processed and analyzed, select the “View” option in the Telometer tab (Figure 2G). 24.Repeat step 15–23 for remaining images to analyze. Ensure that they are being saved in the proper project data file and appropriately named. 25.Export data to copy into excel (Figure 2H). a.In the “Export” tab of Telometer, select the project name for data export. b.Click the “Scoring” button that has an arrow. c.Select all data under “Scorings” and click the “Cells” button that has an arrow. d.Select all data under “Cells” and copy and paste into Excel or other spreadsheet software. Ensure that you also note the headings for each column. Troubleshooting 4 26.To analyze datasets using the Telomere sum option, refer to the last column of the dataset. It represents the telomere sum intensity divided by DAPI sum intensity formula∗100. Optional: If telomere mean intensities are desired per cell instead of total (sum) intensities, calculate this value by dividing the datasets in the Telomere Mean column by its respective DAPI Sum. Optional: If one desires to normalize to centromere intensity instead of DAPI intensity, the procedure for telomere analysis is repeated, but instead of using the Telomere images on prompt to open, the centromere images are opened instead. The nuclei should be named and selected similarly in the same order as the telomere analysis. Then the last column of data from the telomere analysis is divided by the last column of centromere data analysis. Troubleshooting 5 27.Graph datasets as desired in Graphpad prism. Data can be graphed as total intensity values, or data can be graphed as histograms to demonstrate minor shifts of telomere length within the populations (Figure 3). Troubleshooting 6 Note: The telomere and centromere probes are probes that recognize mammalian DNA sequences and are functional in other species, including samples from rat and human. We have found that this protocol is compatible with muscle tissues of human and rat skeletal muscle cryosections (Figures 4 and 5). We also examined the adaptability of this protocol to several other tissue types (spleen, liver, kidney, testicle, and colon) and found this protocol does appropriately label telomeres in all tissues examined (Figure 5), increasing the impact and usability of this method. However, in such tissues, it may be necessary to utilize thinner sections or more advanced microscopes (confocal microscopy), given the increased number of focal planes exhibiting telomere foci observed.

Note- background was left intentionally higher to demonstrate surrounding tissue architecture. Adult 17-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rat tissues were collected and processed identically as described in the CRYO MuQ-FISH protocol and imaged for telomere signal and DAPI. We found this protocol capable of staining telomeres in tissues of the tibialis anterior muscle, colon, liver, kidney, spleen, and testicle. Scale bar: 10 μm.Expected outcomes This protocol demonstrates the methodology to process cryosections of skeletal muscle for telomere analysis. We utilized VCAM as a muscle stem cell marker (Liu et al., 2015; Maesner et al., 2016); however, this protocol can likely be applied to additional resident skeletal muscle populations, once appropriate markers are identified and tested for compatibility. Here, we utilized data from two different genotypes of mice that underwent chronic, repetitive injuries, to demonstrate different ways to represent the data (Figure 3). Additionally, to confirm the validity of the CRYO MuQ-FISH method, we compared CRYO MuQ-FISH with our traditional MuQ-FISH method using isolated MuSCs. We found similar pattens of telomere shortening in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy coupled with a telomere defect (Figure 6). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Comparisons of CRYO MuQ-FISH with previously established telomere length assessments in isolated MuSCs demonstrates no differences in expected data outcomes (A) MuSCs were FACS-sorted (CD11b-/CD31-/CD45-/Sca1-/CD34+/α7Integrin+) from wildtype mice or dystrophic mice lacking the telomere component Terc (mdx/mTRG2). MuSCs were subjected to our previously established and validated MuQ-FISH method to assess telomere length. Depicted are mean ± SEM. Percent difference between the two groups is displayed.

Gastrocnemius muscles were processed for telomere length by the CRYO MuQ-FISH protocol. Note the similar percent difference in telomere length between the groups compared with what is shown in (A). (D) Histogram representation of data depicted in (C). Note the similarity in structure of the histograms between (C) and (D). For all graphs, N=3 male mice per genotype (5–7 months of age), with a minimum of 35 cells imaged per mouse. Depicted are mean ± SEM.Quantification and statistical analysis Comparisons of data between genotypes are conducted using unpaired student T-tests with Welch’s correction. Cells from at 3 mice or samples per experimental condition should be examined, with at least 35 cells imaged per mouse.Limitations This protocol utilizes the quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization method for measuring telomere length. Because measurements of telomere length are based on fluorescent intensities, it is critical to image the slides as soon as possible, since fading will occur over time. Samples should not be imaged between different experiments, but instead they should only be imaged in the same batch in as short a time window as possible, since fluorescent intensities will be variable between experiments. Normalization must be done to respective control samples to combine datasets. Since MuSCs comprise a rare population of cells and are very small in size, a 100× or equivalent high-powered objective is necessary to visualize the telomere foci to get meaningful datasets.Troubleshooting Problem 1 No Q-FISH telomere probe signal present following imaging (step 9).Potential solution Antigen retrieval time was insufficient or not completed with boiling buffer. Ensure that temperatures and times are completed as outlined in this protocol. Probe was bleached or stored improperly after being prepared. Always use a new aliquot of telomere/centromere probe from −80°C and ensure that it is protected from light throughout this protocol. Inappropriate dilution of probe was used, hybridization buffer was not correctly made, hybridization conditions were not followed. If probes are too dilute, increase the amount of the Q-FISH probes used in the protocol. Confirm that hybridization buffer is completely dissolved and that no air bubbles were present when hybridization occurred. Confirm the heating source during denaturation and hybridization is at the proper temperatures.Problem 2 High background staining (step 9).Potential solution Do not let the tissue dry out at any step following permeabilization. Avoid Cy3/Alexa fluor red/orange dyes except for centromeric region staining.Problem 3 Large numbers of samples that cannot be imaged in the required timeframe (step 10d).Potential solution While imaging samples in the same time window is optimal, if too many samples are present, a 3-day window may not be sufficient time to complete the acquisition, resulting in fading of the sample and alteration of the data. To overcome this caveat, it may be possible to normalize the intensity of a particular reference sample imaged on different days using fluorescent beads, such as those found in the InSpeck Microscopy Image Intensity Calibration Kit. These kits contain beads of varying but defined intensities from which a standard curve can be generated on each day within the same experiment.Problem 4 Telometer is not displaying recorded datasets (step 25d).Potential solution Ensure that you are trying to view data in the appropriate project file. It may be necessary to use the “refresh” button to repopulate the project file, particularly if one is trying to view data that was accumulated since Telometer was first opened.Problem 5 DAPI staining intensity is not consistent between experimental groups or nuclear architecture is dissimilar (step 26).Potential solution Conduct telomere analysis by normalizing to a centromeric probe. First do telomere analysis normalized to DAPI. Then repeat the Telometer analysis on the same cells using the centromere image instead of the telomere image. Ensure to label cells of interest in the same order between the telomere identification and the centromere identification. Finally, divide the Telomere sum/DAPI sum percent by the Centromere sum/DAPI sum. Utilize those values for graphing.Problem 6 Inconsistent data between experiments (step 27).Potential solution Given that Q-FISH is an intensity-based measurement, experimental samples are ideally measured at the same time with the same exposure settings. If too many samples are present, fading can occur between sample sets that would confound downstream analysis. Thus, it is optimal to image all experimental groups as soon as possible, and comparisons between different experiments are not possible. Additionally, telomere probe in hybridization buffer should completely cover the sample without any air bubbles. While the values themselves may be different, due to inherent differences between experimental preparations, calculations of percent difference between groups can be useful in confirming that datasets are similar.Resource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Foteini Mourkioti (fmour@pennmedicine.upenn.edu).Materials availability This study did not generate new materials or unique reagents.Acknowledgments We thank both Jim Morgan and Alan Meeker (Johns Hopkins) for the current version of Telometer.

The underlying mechanism of such stem cell dysfunction is not fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the distinct early telomere shortening of diseased MuSCs in both mice and young DMD patients is associated with aberrant NF-κB activation. We find that prolonged NF-κB activation in MuSCs in chronic injuries leads to shortened telomeres and Ku80 dysregulation and results in severe skeletal muscle defects. Our studies provide evidence of a role for NF-κB in regulating stem-cell-specific telomere length, independently of cell replication, and could be a congruent mechanism that is applicable to additional tissues and/or diseases characterized by systemic chronic inflammation.In brief Tichy et al. reveal a role for NF-κB signaling in regulating telomere length in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) after chronic injuries. Persistent activation of NF-κB leads to shortened telomeres, Ku80 dysregulation, and muscle defects. The findings link stem cell dysfunction and NF-κB-dependent telomere shortening in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Graphical Abstract INTRODUCTION The stages of skeletal muscle regeneration are well characterized following injury, starting with necrosis of damaged muscle tissue and the infiltration of immune cells (Frenette et al., 2000; Tidball, 2005). Inflammatory signals both directly and indirectly lead to activation of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs; also called satellite cells), which respond to muscle damage by population expansion, followed by selective differentiation into myogenic progeny (Chazaud et al., 2003; Tidball and Wehling-Henricks, 2015). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal X-linked degenerative muscle disease, and it is among the most common lethally inherited disorders in children (Emery, 2002). DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which codes for a cytoskeletal protein that acts as a crucial bridging protein between the sarcomere and extracellular matrix (Hoffman et al., 1987). The complete or partial loss of dystrophin in muscular dystrophies impairs the ability of the muscle to contract and causes the muscle to break down. This acts as constant injury to the muscle that progressively affects the MuSC pool (Morgan and Zammit, 2010; Sacco et al., 2010), presumably due to an autonomous dysfunction (Dumont et al., 2015). Thus, MuSC function is severely affected in DMD, and although the disease is initiated by dystrophin deficiency, it is ultimately a stem cell disease (Dumont et al., 2015; Sacco et al., 2010). Previous work showed that accelerated telomere shortening occurs in muscular dystrophy in both skeletal muscle and cardiomyopathy (Mourkioti et al., 2013; Sacco et al., 2010). Recent studies have also revealed that MuSCs derived either from dystrophic mice or young DMD patients exhibit critically shortened telomeres early on during disease progression (Tichy et al., 2017). These observations suggest that modulation or maintenance of MuSC function can prevent or diminish destructive muscle processes in chronic injury conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to MuSC-specific telomere shortening are currently unknown. Here, we show that persistent activation of nuclear factor kb (NF-κB) leads to telomere shortening in MuSCs under chronic injury conditions, and it is independent of proliferation. Instead, this mechanism involves Ku80 dysregulation and increased DNA damage, specifically on telomeres, that results in MuSC loss and, subsequently, skeletal muscle regenerative failure. Overall, our findings propose a previously unrecognized role of NF-κB in regulating MuSC dysfunction by affecting telomeres, a key event during the progression of DMD.RESULTS NF-κB is dysregulated in dystrophic MuSCs To understand the mechanisms that affect telomere length and function in diseased MuSCs, we assayed their internal signaling pathways by flow cytometry (Table S1). We found that a higher proportion of the MuSCs from dystrophic mice exhibited higher NF-κB activation (Figure 1A) and accumulation of p-p65 (Figures 1B and 1C). We expanded upon these observations by assessing the timing of NF-κB activation following a single intramuscular injury. Muscle injury rapidly increases NF-κB activation in MuSCs (Figure 1D). But in dystrophic mice, p-p65+ MuSCs are more numerous at all time points, including baseline conditions (Figure 1D). Hence, the inherent endogenous injuries observed in dystrophic mice induce a constant elevated NF-κB signaling response in MuSCs. Figure 1. NF-κB activation in dystrophic MuSCs. Open in a new tab (A) Higher NF-κB activation in FACS-isolated MuSCs from dystrophic mice, as shown by elevated phospho-p65 levels. n ≥ 3 mice (2–3 months old)/group. Percent of cells positive for p-p65 are displayed. (B) Freshly isolated, cytospun dystrophic MuSCs exhibit accumulation of phospho-p65 compared to control MuSCs. Note the lack of staining in the no primary Ab (technical control), highlighting the specificity of the staining. (C) Quantification shows higher levels of p-p65 in dystrophic MuSCs. n = 3 mice (2–3 months old) per genotype. n > 50 cells per condition. (D) MuSCs from notexin-injured muscles were isolated at the indicated times.

Displayed is mean ± SEM for all graphs. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction. *p ≤ 0.05.MuSC-specific NF-κB activation does not alter muscles in non-injured conditions To examine the in vivo impact of persistent NF-κB activation in regulating telomere length in MuSCs during chronic injury, we generated a mouse that allows expression of a constitutively active (CA) form of the IKK2 gene (Calado et al., 2010) specifically in MuSCs (Pax7ERT2Cre/IKK2CA or IKK2CAMuSC) (Figure S1A). To generate mice in which NF-κB signaling is abrogated in MuSCs, we crossed mice carrying a floxed allele of the NF-κB regulator NEMO (Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2000) with the same Pax7ERT2Cre mice (Murphy et al., 2011) to generate NEMO knockout (NEMOKOMuSC) mice. Characterization of these mice demonstrates that we obtained >90% Cre recombination efficiency after seven daily intraperitoneal tamoxifen injections, which resulted in significant upregulation of the IKK2 gene in IKK2CAMuSC mice and downregulation in NEMOKOMuSC mice (Figure S1B). The above genetic approaches allow for CA or inactivation of p65 in MuSCs, as shown by flow cytometry analysis (Figure 2A). Enforced expression of activated IKK2 alone or ablation of NEMO in MuSCs had no effect on muscle morphology (Figure S1C), muscle size (Figure S1D), function (Figure S1E), and/or telomere length (Figure S1F) under steady-state conditions. These data suggest that in the absence of injury, persistent activation of MuSC-specific NF-κB has minimal effects in skeletal muscles. Figure 2. Persistent NF-κB activation in MuSCs leads to rapid telomere shortening. Open in a new tab (A) p65 activation in uninjured (green plots) or injured (red plots) control MuSCs (first column), MuSCs with kinase CA of the IKK2 protein (IKK2CAMuSC, second column), or MuSCs with inactivation of the NEMO protein (NEMOKOMuSC, third column). Blue plots are technical controls with no primary antibody. Percent of cells positive for p-p65 is displayed. (B) Experimental scheme for weekly notexin injuries to mimic chronic injury. (C) IKK2CA-derived MuSCs had much shorter telomere lengths after 6× injury, while inhibition of NF-κB (NEMOKOMuSC) maintains telomere length even after 20× injuries. Telomere length in MuSCs was normalized to telomere length of contralateral legs. n = 3–5 mice/genotype. Percent difference was calculated between normalized means. (D–F) Distribution of telomere lengths of MuSCs following 3× (D), 6× (E), or 20× (F) injuries. Telomeres start to shorten after three injuries in IKK2CAMuSC cells (red bars), but this reduction becomes more severe with increasing number of injuries. n = 3 mice/condition. n > 100 cells. Mean ± SEM for each bin is displayed. (G–I) Progressive MuSC-specific telomere shortening is associated with worsened histology in IKK2CAMuSC muscles at 3× (G), 6× (H), or 20× (I) injuries. n = 3–6 mice/condition. Mice were 2 months old at the time of the first injury.Rapid telomere shortening in injured MuSCs with persistent NF-κB To investigate the importance of injury in NF-κB-dependent telomere length regulation and to mimic the rounds of degeneration/regeneration occurring in the dystrophic condition (Morgan and Zammit, 2010), we implemented a multiple injury model in control, IKK2CAMuSC, and NEMOKOMuSC mice (Figure 2B). Assessment of telomere lengths of MuSCs isolated from these mice by MuQ-FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) (Tichy et al., 2017) uncovered a propensity of telomere shortening in IKK2CAMuSC-derived MuSCs (Figure 2C). However, NEMOKOMuSC MuSCs have unaltered telomere lengths even after many injuries (Figure 2C), demonstrating that NF-kB inhibition maintains telomere length. These findings further suggest that NF-κB activation is required for telomere shortening in injured muscles, providing strong support that prolonged NF-κB activation drives telomere shortening under chronic injuries. Interestingly, telomeres start to shorten after three injuries in IKK2CAMuSC cells, but this reduction becomes more severe with an increasing number of injuries (Figures 2D–2F and S2A). Moreover, the progressive telomere shortening observed after an increased number of injuries correlates well with the worsening histology (Figures 2G–2I) and fibrosis (Figures S2B and S2C) in IKK2CAMuSC muscles with an increased number of injuries. These studies support the notion that NF-κB-dependent telomere shortening contributes to the histopathology in skeletal muscles under repetitive injuries. Altogether, these data demonstrate an unconventional role for unrestrained NF-κB signaling in MuSCs to promote telomere attrition and impairment of regeneration under chronic injury conditions.Telomere shortening in MuSCs is not caused by enhanced proliferation In proliferative cells, DNA polymerases fail to completely replicate telomeres following each cell division, which eventually leads to critical telomere shortening (Lee et al., 1998). To address whether the rapid MuSC-specific telomere shortening observed in injured IKK2CAMuSC mice was caused by MuSC proliferative changes, we injured control or IKK2CAMuSC mice repeatedly. At 3 days after the last injury, a timepoint considered the peak of MuSC proliferation (Morgan and Zammit, 2010), mice were pulsed in vivo with the nucleotide analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) to label cells undergoing DNA replication (Figure 3A). In uninjured muscles, only a small portion of MuSCs was EdU+ (Figures 3B and 3C), consistent with the notion that adult MuSCs with higher NF-kB activation are largely quiescent under steady-state conditions. Interestingly, upon injury, both control and IKK2CAMuSC MuSCs were proliferating at comparable rates (Figures 3B and 3C). Similarly, an equivalent level of the proliferation marker Ki67, in combination with the stem cell marker Pax7 was found in injured control and IKK2CAMuSC muscles (Figures 3D and 3E). To ensure that the window of optimal in vivo proliferation was not missed by our previous assessments, as well as to confirm a large enough window of EdU incorporation was included, EdU was administered daily, for a total of three times, and MuSCs were harvested 3 or 5 days after the last injury (Figure 3F). Similar to the previous data, no significant increases in proliferation were evident in IKK2CAMuSC MuSCs (Figure 3G). We conclude that in contrast to other cell types (Sasaki et al., 2006), the constant activation of NF-κB in MuSCs does not result in higher rates of proliferation even under injury conditions. Altogether, these data unequivocally demonstrate a proliferation-independent mechanism of NF-κB to drive MuSC-specific telomere shortening. Figure 3. Activation of NF-κB does not alter in vivo proliferation in MuSCs under injury conditions. Open in a new tab (A) Experimental scheme for in vivo 5-Ethynyl-2′deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay.

To delineate alternative mechanisms to rationalize the observed telomere shortening in IKK2CAMuSC MuSCs experiencing chronic injuries, we carried out in-silico analysis on promoters of genes, whose proteins are known to reside at telomeres. Given that Kus bind to telomeres, aid the localization of other shelterins, and regulate telomere length, we included them in our in-silico analysis (de Lange, 2005; Hsu et al., 1999). NF-κB functions by binding to promoter and enhancer regions containing kB sites to regulate gene expression (Dong et al., 2008; Hayden and Ghosh, 2004). We found that proteins bound to telomeric DNA contain kB sites in their promoters (Table S2), raising the intriguing possibility that NF-κB-dependent regulation of telomere binding proteins may have a significant impact on telomere length in MuSCs. We then performed qRT-PCR to validate the in-silico analysis and detected downregulation of telomeric XRCC5/Ku80 gene expression in MuSCs from injured muscles (Figure 4A), while all other telomeric genes had no significant differences (Figure 4A). Similarly, we found downregulation of Ku80 protein in MuSCs from IKK2CAMuSC muscles after 3× injury (Figures 4B and 4C), further demonstrating the NF-κB-dependent regulation of Ku80. In addition, we found undetectable tert levels in wild-type (WT) or IKK2CAMuSC MuSCs either in steady-state or upon injury conditions (Figure S3B). Since tert transcripts are detectable in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) within the same reaction (technical control), our data suggest that tert is either present at very low (undetectable) levels or expressed transiently in freshly isolated MuSCs, in contrast to what is known for cancer cell lines (Yin et al., 2000; Zuo et al., 2011). Importantly, Ku80 levels are unchanged in both IKK2CA uninjured MuSCs (Figure S3C; NF-κB activation alone without injury) and MuSCs from NEMOKOMuSC injured mice (Figure S3D; injury combined with NF-κB inactivation in MuSCs), demonstrating that NF-κB is required during injury to alter Ku80 levels (Figures 4B and 4C) and induce telomere shortening (Figures 2C–2F). Overall, these data indicate a previously unrecognized requirement of NF-κB in regulating Ku80 expression associated with telomere length in freshly isolated MuSCs from injured muscles. Figure 4. Activation of NF-κB in MuSCs in the context of repetitive injuries leads to Ku80 dysregulation. Open in a new tab (A) Isolated MuSCs from 3× injured control and IKK2CAMuSC mice subjected to qRT-PCR for genes associated with telomeric function.

Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction. *p ≤ 0.05; ***p ≤ 0.001.MuSC telomere shortening leads to increased DNA damage in telomeres and stem cell exhaustion over time In mammalian cells, DNA damage, in the form of double-stranded DNA breaks, is typically repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (Mao et al., 2008) and depends on the activity of Ku80 to recognize damaged DNA ends (Koike and Koike, 2008). Indeed, we observed a higher number of centralized nuclei in regenerating IKK2CAMuSC fibers that positively stained for the DNA damage marker 53BP1 (Figures S3E and S3F). Extensive telomere shortening can be recognized by DNA damage sensors as free DNA ends (Hsu et al., 2000). In fact, we did observe increased numbers of telomere-induced foci (TIFs) in chronically injured IKK2CAMuSC MuSCs (Figures 4D and 4E), as identified by the stem cell marker, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) (Figure S3G). These data are in agreement with the notion that telomere dysfunction is governed by proteins that also control DNA damage response (Takai et al., 2003). To further investigate the in vivo consequence of the early telomere shortening in MuSCs in chronic injury, we crossed the MuSC-specific IKK2CAMuSC mice with Pax7EGFP reporter mice, which express EGFP under the control of the Pax7 promoter (Tichy et al., 2018). The Pax7EGFP/IKK2CAMuSC mouse allows for direct visualization and evaluation of MuSCs in their native environment on all fibers within the same animal in a spatiotemporal manner. Utilizing this method, we assessed the number of MuSCs by two-photon microscopy following chronic injury and recovery. We found that the number of MuSCs decreases over time in Pax7EGFP/IKK2CAMuSC skeletal muscles (Figure 4F), indicative of an exhaustion of the stem cell pool under chronic injury.MuSC-specific NF-κB activation exacerbates the dystrophic muscle defects To explore whether MuSC-specific activation of NF-κB could exacerbate the progression of dystrophy, we crossed IKK 2CAMuSC mice with a dystrophin mutant mouse (Im et al., 1996). The resulting double mutants are designated herein as mdx/IKK2CAMuSC. These mice have higher muscle damage, shown by the levels of creatine kinase (Figure 5A), an established damage diagnostic indicator in DMD (Zatz et al., 1991). The severity of muscle defects in mdx/IKK2CAMuSC mice is consistent with reduced muscle weight (Figures S4A and S4B), worse muscle morphology (Figure S4C), and reduced area of fibers with centralized nuclei (Figure S4D). Interestingly, we observed substantial kyphosis (Figure 5B), a classical clinical manifestation of DMD due to weakness of trunk muscles (Oda et al., 1993; Wilkins and Gibson, 1976) and impaired muscle performance in mdx/IKK2CAMuSC mice compared to mdx controls (Figures 5C and 5D). Importantly, MuSCs isolated from mdx/IKK2CAMuSC mice exhibited higher levels of p65 (Figure 5E), demonstrated shortened telomeres (Figures 5F and S4E), exhibited increased numbers of TIFs (Figure 5G), and had a reduced number of MuSCs (Figure S4F). We conclude that the persistent activation of NF-κB in MuSCs in the context of repetitive injuries as caused by the lack of dystrophin leads to the aggravation of the mdx phenotype, imitating the human disease. Figure 5. Activation of NF-κB in MuSCs exacerbates the mdx phenotype. Open in a new tab To explore whether MuSC-specific activation of NF-κB could exacerbate the progression of dystrophy, mdx mice were bred to IKK2CAMuSC mice, and different metrics were assessed.

(G) Increased TIFs specifically in MuSCs. n = 3 mice (5 months old) per genotype. n > 70 cells per condition. All datasets are displayed as mean ± SEM. All statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction. *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.01.Downregulation of Ku80 alone or in the context of chronic injuries reduces telomere length in MuSCs To gain more insight into the involvement of Ku80 in telomere shortening in myogenic cells, we first investigated telomere length in the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line (Figure S5A). Using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors targeting XRCC5, which encodes the Ku80 protein, we observed significant knockdown at the protein level when compared to cells transfected with empty vector (Figure S5B). Upon performing MuQ-FISH, we uncovered that Ku80 downregulation is sufficient to induce telomere shortening in myogenic cells with two different shRNAs (Figures S5C and S5D). These data demonstrate that downregulation of Ku80 alone is sufficient to reduce telomere length in myogenic cells. Next, we extended our findings by investigating the effect of Ku80 manipulation on telomere length in vivo, utilizing a Ku80 heterozygous mouse line (Zhu et al., 1996). We found that MuSCs derived from this mouse exhibited only ~20% reduction of Ku80 protein expression compared to Ku80 WT littermates (Figure S5E). Nevertheless, we still observed a reduction in telomere lengths of these Ku80 heterozygous mice after 3× injury (Figure S5F), suggesting that even a mild reduction of Ku80 protein is sufficient to shorten telomeres in MuSCs. To further demonstrate the involvement of Ku80 in telomere length modulation in vivo in more severe chronic injuries, we bred mdx mice with Ku80+/− mice. Interestingly, MuSCs in the mdx/Ku80+/− muscles have a pronounced shift toward shorter telomeres (Figure S5G), increased muscle damage (Figure S5H), and impaired muscle performance (Figure S5I). These data suggest that the mdx/Ku80+/− mice exhibit similar muscle defects as the ones seen in mdx/IKK2CAMuSC mice (Figure 5). Altogether, these results demonstrate that Ku80 is a major regulator of telomere length in myogenic cells, both in vitro and in vivo, either alone or in the context of dystrophy.Ku80 dysregulation and telomere damage in human dystrophic MuSCs We next investigated whether our mouse findings recapitulate what happens in the human dystrophic condition. We found that human DMD MuSCs express significantly higher levels of p-p65 (Figures 6A and 6B), and a larger portion is localized in the nucleus (Figure 6C), further supporting the notion of persistent elevated NF-κB signaling in dystrophic human MuSCs. Interestingly, human DMD MuSCs have significantly decreased Ku80 levels (Figures 6D and 6E), as shown by immunohistochemistry analysis on human muscles from DMD patients. Furthermore, in corroboration with the mouse data, we found shortened telomeres (Figure 6F), higher levels of DNA damage (Figures S6A and S6B), and increased numbers of TIFs (Figures 6G and 6H) in human diseased MuSCs compared to aged-matched healthy controls. Altogether, these striking human findings, which are consistent with the mouse results, provide further evidence that persistent NF-κB activation specifically in MuSCs leads to Ku80 dysregulation and predisposes these cells to premature telomere shortening and an increased number of TIFs that ultimately contribute to the severe dystrophic skeletal muscle phenotype.

Here, we provide evidence of the in vivo molecular basis for telomere shortening of stem cells under chronic injury conditions. These findings provide insights into the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of MuSC-specific telomere shortening under chronic injuries. Indications of perturbation of NF-κB signaling exist in various muscle diseases, such as muscle atrophy conditions (Cai et al., 2004; Mourkioti et al., 2006; Mourkioti and Rosenthal, 2008), cancer cachexia (He et al., 2013), dystrophinopathies such as Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) (Baghdiguian et al., 1999), and DMD (Acharyya et al., 2007; Hammers et al., 2016; Messina et al., 2011). In addition to its role in regulating myogenesis (Mourkioti and Rosenthal, 2008), NF-κB is likely to modulate immune responses, muscle damage, and repair in DMD as well as in other muscle disorders. However, the survival effect of NF-κB in LGMD2A muscles, compared with its rather negative contribution in DMD, reflects the complexity of this pathway in chronic muscle diseases. Previous genetically modified animal models generated to interfere with NF-κB signaling only assessed NF-κB function regarding cancer cachexia (He et al., 2013) and aging (Oh et al., 2016; Proto et al., 2017). By targeting the MuSC compartment in adult mice, we demonstrate that the inherent endogenous injuries observed in dystrophic mice induce a constant elevated NF-κB signaling response in MuSCs in both mdx and, most importantly, in human DMD MuSCs. Furthermore, we showed that persistent MuSC-specific NF-κB activation in injured muscles leads to telomere shortening and impairment of regeneration, as shown by the worsened histopathology of skeletal muscles during the progression of the chronic injury. Additionally, we demonstrate that persistent MuSC-specific NF-κB activation in injured muscles drives telomere shortening via a mechanism that does not raise proliferation levels. Instead, we describe an NF-κB-dependent Ku80 dysregulation and increased DNA damage on telomeres in MuSCs from both dystrophic mice and human patients. While the effects of Ku80 in NHEJ are well documented (Fell and Schild-Poulter, 2015), its potential mechanistic involvement in telomere length alteration is less clear. Indeed, the absence of Ku80 has been associated with both telomere lengthening and shortening, depending on the cell line used; the organism (i.e., yeast, Drosophila, mouse, plant); or the context (embryonic development, cancer, or aging) (Boulton and Jackson, 1998; Chai et al., 2002; d’Adda di Fagagna et al., 2001; Didier et al., 2012; Espejel et al., 2004; Gallego et al., 2003; Indiviglio and Bertuch, 2009; Li et al., 2007; Melnikova et al., 2005). Furthermore, it is still unclear when Ku80 could function alone or as a heterodimer of both Ku80 and Ku70 subunits (Fell and Schild-Poulter, 2015). It was previously shown that loss of a single allele of Ku80 leads to dysfunction of muscle-derived cells and accelerated aging (Didier et al., 2012). In this study, we demonstrate that NF-κB regulates Ku80 expression in MuSCs in chronic muscle injuries and dystrophic muscles in both mouse and human. This NF-kB-dependent in vivo telomere regulatory mechanism is different from the modulation of telomeric proteins Tert or Rap1 that have been shown in cancer cells (Teo et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2000; Zuo et al., 2011). Additional work, to generate more targeted molecular tools for Kus and to investigate the exact role of Ku80 in the regulation of telomere integrity (Indiviglio and Bertuch, 2009), will be instrumental in order to identify other contributing molecular mechanisms and to develop concepts that could maintain MuSC telomere length under injured conditions. It has been suggested that MuSCs could not keep up with the high regeneration demand under chronic injury conditions (Sacco et al., 2010). However, other studies have shown that MuSC numbers are elevated in mdx muscles in mice or DMD patients (Boldrin et al., 2015; Dumont et al., 2015; Kottlors and Kirschner, 2010). All these studies were dependent on prospective cell isolation methods, which rely on enzymatic digestion efficiency, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on cell-surface markers (Tichy et al., 2017) or ex vivo methods to isolate single muscle fibers, in combination with Pax7 antibody staining (Sacco et al., 2010). Both methods result in cell loss due to either incomplete tissue digestion and/or cell death during these long procedures, and the cell loss is likely exacerbated in diseased muscles that are inherently more fibrotic and fragile. Additionally, only the intact/non-broken fibers are used for quantification and, therefore, single-fiber isolation selects for MuSC measurements in somewhat “healthier” fibers. To overcome these limitations and to evaluate the consequences of telomere shortening in MuSCs, we used the Pax7EGFP reporter mouse (Tichy et al., 2018) to study changes in the number of MuSCs during disease conditions. Our analysis revealed that there is a loss of MuSC over time in both the IKK2CAMuSC after repetitive injuries and the mdx/IKK2CAMuSC mice, which contributes to the muscle regeneration impairment seen in the context of chronic injuries as caused by the lack of dystrophin. In summary, this study establishes a link between stem cell functional exhaustion and NF-κB-dependent telomere shortening. Our data suggest that maintaining telomere length of MuSCs could boost the regenerative ability of MuSCs in disease-related chronic injuries such as DMD. It was recently proposed that chronic inflammation can accelerate aging via exacerbation of telomere dysfunction in multiple tissues (Jurk et al., 2014). Therefore, the molecular mechanism presented here for DMD could also be a more generalized mechanism that lowers regenerative potential in other tissues with systemic chronic inflammation and/or accelerates normal and pathological aging.STAR★METHODS RESOURCE AVAILABILITY Lead contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Dr. Foteini Mourkioti (fmour@pennmedicine.upenn.edu)Materials availability All unique/stable reagents generated in this study are available from the Lead Contact with a completed Materials Transfer Agreement.Data and code availability statement This study did not generate any unique datasets or code.EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND SUBJECT DETAILS Animals All animals were housed and bred in accordance with the University of Pennsylvania IACUC guidelines. Mice used in this study include C57BL/6 (Jackson Labs-JAX Stock #000664), IKK2 constitutively active mice (IKK2CA); breeding of JAX stock 008242 for Lox-stop-Lox IKK2CA and PaxERT2CRE (JAX Stock #017763) (Murphy et al., 2011), mdx4cv mice (JAX stock #002378), or mdx4cv bred to IKK2CA. NEMO floxed mice and genotyping protocols were a gift from Dr. Pasparakis. Ku80+/− mice were a gift from Dr. Hasty. For several experiments, Pax7EGFP mice were bred to the aforementioned mouse lines. Mice were genotyped according to established protocols using ear punches as starting material. To induce Cre expression, mice were injected with 250uL tamoxifen (Sigma; 20mg/mL in ethanol/corn oil in a 1/10 ratio) IP twice weekly for a total of 7 injections, starting at 6 to 8 weeks of age. For all experiments, mice of the same sex and similar age were compared. The age of mice for each experiment is reported in Figure Legends.Chronic induced injury Muscles were injured with 10 μg/mL notexin (Latoxan) weekly. The tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscles of one hind limb were injured with 10 μL (TA) or 20 μL (gastrocnemius and quadriceps) notexin. Muscles were collected post-injury at three days (for MuSC isolation) or at seven days (for staining with Hematoxylin and Eosin).Human samples Human samples were a gift from Dr. Sacco (Tichy et al., 2017). Human muscle biopsies from healthy and DMD patients were obtained from the lower extremity muscles during surgical procedures as part of the patient’s clinical care plan at Rady’s Children’s Hospital, San Diego. Written informed consent from patients, parent or guardian was obtained for all subjects. The protocol was approved by the University of California, San Diego Human Research Protectants Program and Institutional Review Board in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations on the Protection of Human Subjects. All materials were collected from de-identified males.METHOD DETAILS Muscle stem cell isolation MuSCs were FACS-isolated as previously described (Tichy et al., 2017). Briefly mice were sacrificed, and the tibialis anterior, quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles were dissected from both hind limbs. Muscle was finely minced and placed in a C tube (Miltenyi) containing 0.15% collagenase in 10 mL DMEM. Tubes were loaded into a MACS Dissociator (Miltenyi) and the manufacturer’s muscle-01 program was run. Tubes were incubated in at 37°C for 30 min, subjected to the muscle-01 program again, and incubated at 37°C for an additional 30min. Seventy-five microliters of 2% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 75 μL of 4.8 U/mL dispase (Roche) was added, and tubes were vortexed at maximum speed prior to a 30min incubation at 37°C. Cells were passed through a 21-gauge needle until all muscle was broken apart. The remaining cell slurry was filtered through a 40 μM cell strainer that was prewet with 10 mL of cold myoblast media (DMEM:F12; 15% FBS, 1X anti-anti) the strainer was rinsed with an additional 10 mL of cold myoblast media, and cells were pelleted at 300xg/4°C. Cells were incubated with 1mL 1X red cell lysis buffer (ThermoFisher) for 5 min at room temperature and 9 mL cold FACS buffer (2.5% goat serum, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 in 1X PBS) was added. Cells were spun and resuspended in 1mL of FACS buffer containing biotin-conjugated antibodies raised against antigens CD45, CD31, CD11b, and Sca1 prior to an incubation on ice for 45 min. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 100 μL of FACS buffer containing antibodies CD34, and α7-integrin, as well as streptavidin-PE-Cy7. Cells were incubated in the dark for 90 min on ice, with agitation occurring every 30 min. FACS buffer was added up to 1 mL final volume, and cells pelleted and resuspended in FACS buffer, and the viability dye 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) was added (final concentration 4 mg/mL). Cells were placed in falcon tubes with cell strainers before collection by FACS. Murine MuSCs were identified as CD11b−/CD31−/CD45−/Sca1−/α7-Integrin+/CD34+. Primary human MuSCs were provided as described (Tichy et al., 2017). Briefly, human calf muscle biopsies were enzymatically dissociated in 0.2% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.02 units/mL dispase (Roche) for 45 min at 37°C, minced under a dissection microscope and incubated for an additional 45 min at 37°C. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer and incubated with biotinylated anti-human CD45, CD11b and CD31. Samples were washed with FACS buffer and incubated with anti-NCAM/CD56 and Streptavidin APC-Cy7. Human MuSCs were CD11b−/CD31−/CD45−/NCAM+.Flow cytometry FACS-isolated MuSCs from age and sex-matched animals were fixed in 1.6% PFA/PBS for 10’ on ice, spun at 350xg at 4°C, and stored in cold 100% methanol (final concentration 90%) at −80°C until the staining commenced. MuSCs were further permeabilized in 1% Igepal CA-630/PBS, washed with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with phospho-p65 antibody (Abcam, 1/500), or phospho-JNK (1/100, Cell Signaling), phospho-p38 (1/100, BD Biosciences), phospho-S6K (1/100, Cell Signaling), phospho-AKT (1/100, Cell Signaling), or Bcl2 (1/100, BD Biosciences) in 1%BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C in V-bottom 96-well plates. MuSCs were washed in BSA buffer, stained with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Thermo, 1/500), and analyzed on an LSRII flow cytometer using the 488nm laser line 530/30 bandpass filter set. Data were analyzed with FlowJo. Unbiased analysis was performed with the investigators blinded to genotypes and/or conditions. Results were consistent and reproducible with different batches of Abs, using MuSC isolation from different experimental mice performed on different days. Antibody specificity was determined by several methods, including using unstained controls, no primary antibody-stained controls, and FMO controls.Muscle isolation and sectioning Tibialis Anterior muscles were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS and incubated overnight in 30% sucrose prior to being embedded in OCT medium (Richard Allen Scientific) and frozen in chilled 2-methylbutane. Cryosections were cut at a thickness of 10 μm and placed on Superfrost plus slides. Sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. More specifically, slides were stained with Hematoxylin for 1min, rinsed in water, and incubated with acidic alcohol (1% hydrochloric acid in 100% ethanol). After rinsing in water, slides were immersed in bluing, water, and 70% ethanol for 30sec each. Next, slides were exposed to eosin for 1min and gradually dehydrated with a graduated ethanol series. After a final incubation in xylene, coverslips were mounted with Cytoseal-xyl. Sections were imaged on a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope. Muscle fiber areas were manually determined using ImageJ/Fiji.Immunofluorescence staining Isolated cells or tissue cryosections were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 10min and washed with PBS. If Pax7 staining was required, sections were processed as in Tichy et al. (2018). Primary antibodies for phospho-p65 (1/100; Abcam), Ki67 (1/250; Abcam) and/or 53BP1 (1/1000; Novus Biologicals) were incubated overnight at 4°C in antibody dilution buffer (1% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100). Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit staining (1/300–500 in antibody dilution buffer) for 1hr in the dark at room temperature. For quantifications in Figure 1, p-p65 expression represent nuclear signal intensities normalized to DAPI intensities, to account for any possible differences in cell cycle position or nuclear size. A negative staining control (with no primary antibody) was included to further demonstrate the specificity of the p-p65 staining. For human sections, 10um formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skeletal muscle from young normal donors or DMD patients were deparaffinized and rehydrated by standard procedures. Samples were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X100/PBS, underwent heat-mediated antigen retrieval with acidic citrate, and were blocked first with the avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Labs), then with 3% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were stained with Ku80 antibody (Proteintech) and Pax7 (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4°C in 1% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Slides were washed with PBS and the Pax7 signal was amplified with a mouse-on mouse kit (Vector labs). Sections were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat anti-Rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated streptavidin for 1hr. All slides washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI. Sections were imaged with a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope under the same conditions and intensities of Ku80 in Pax7 cells were normalized to controls.Trichrome staining For Masson’s trichrome staining, tissue cryosections were fixed with Bouin’s solution overnight, rinsed with water, and incubated with Weigert’s Hematoxylin staining reagent (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 5 min. Slides were washed with water for 10 min and stained with a commercially available kit (Sigma Aldrich). Briefly, slides were first stained with Biebrich Scarlet-Acid Fuchsin Solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 min, rinsed in three changes of water, followed by staining with phosphotungstic/phosphomolybdic acid solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min. Slides were then stained with aniline blue solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 5min to stain collagen in blue, differentiated with 1% glacial acetic acid for 2min, and then dehydrated with an ascending series of ethyl alcohol followed by xylene before they were mounted. Sections were imaged under the same conditions and intensities using a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope with an objective lens magnification at 20×. Analysis of fibrotic area was conducted in Fiji software, using color deconvolution and thresholding function to define the areas of collagen and the muscle fiber. The fibrotic area percentage is calculated as (collagen area/muscle fiber area) × 100.Telomere length analysis of FACS isolated MuSCs (MuQ-FISH) Telomere length was measured using quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization of Cy3-conjugated PNA telomere probe (Tel-C, PNA probe). MuSCs were isolated and processed for telomere length measurements as previously described (Tichy et al., 2017). MuSCs were imaged using a Nikon eclipse 90i wide-field epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Prior Proscan III motorized stage, a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ2 14-bit digital camera and a Nikon 100x/1.40 Plan Apo VC objective. Initially, control samples are imaged to determine each channel’s exposure time in a way that situates the intensities for all samples in the mid-intensity range. This control prevents overexposure or loss of signal detection with the selected exposure times during sample imaging. Once an optimal exposure time is defined, image acquisition is utilized at the same exposure settings for the telomere and DAPI or centromeric signals for imaging of individual experiments. For each experiment, the intensity settings are not changed between sample groups. Images are taken without binning. Imaging must take place in the same time window for each experiment, and combination of multiple experiments performed at different days is not recommended, due to the inherent caveat of fluorescent intensity measurements differing between experiments. Telomere length was assessed as the total sum or mean telomeric probe intensity divided by the sum intensity of either the DAPI or the centromeric signal. Unbiased analysis with the investigators blinded to genotypes and/or conditions was conducted using the ImageJ plug-in Telometer.Telomere length analysis of tissues sections PFA-fixed cryosections were permeabilized for 10min with 0.5% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and underwent heat-mediated antigen retrieval with TET buffer (10mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20). Sections were incubated with Tel C-Alexa Fluor 647 and CENPB-Cy3 (PNA bio, 1/600) in QFISH cryo-buffer (15% ethylene carbonate, 20% dextran sulfate, 600mM NaCl, 0.1% citric acid-based antigen retrieval buffer). Probe in buffer was added to slides, covered with a coverslip, and QFISH was carried out using a Thermobrite programmable slide warmer (Leica): 10min prehybridization step at 67°C, followed by 90min hybridization at 42C. Afterward, slides were washed twice, 5min each in buffers with decreasing salt concentrations at 55°C (2X SSC/0.1% Tween 20, 1X SSC/0.1% Tween 20, 0.5X SSC/0.1% Tween 20, 0.25X SSC/0.1% Tween 20). Slides were rinsed with PBS, blocked with 1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100/1X PBS for 1hr at room temperature. Antibody to VCAM (ThermoFisher, 1/100) was added to the blocking buffer and slides were incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, slides were washed with PBS and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (ThermoFisher) in blocking buffer for 1hr at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with Prolong gold plus DAPI. Cryosections were imaged with a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100x Plan Apo objective and Nikon elements software. Analysis of telomere length was assessed with the investigators blinded to genotypes and/or conditions in VCAM+ cells using Telometer. At least 40 cells per mouse were analyzed.MuSC proliferation assays Mice were injected with EdU (100mg/kg) IP, following the experimental design shown in Figure 3. MuSCs were plated overnight following sorting on laminin-coated 8-well chamber slides (~2500 cells) in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 15% FBS, 1X antibiotic/antimycotic, 1X Glutamax, 1X NEAA. Cells were fixed the following day in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 15min and processed for EdU incorporation using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 594 Imaging kit (ThermoFisher), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Grip test Mice were inverted on a cross-hatched metal platform and the time required for mice to release themselves from the platform was quantified. Three repetition measurements were recorded per mouse, giving the mouse 1hr rest in between measurements.Creatine kinase assay Blood was collected from mice by cardiac puncture and allowed to clot. After centrifugation for 10min at 600 ×g, serum was diluted 1/10 with PBS and assayed and analyzed using a commercially available kit (Sekisui Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted MuSCs using a RNeasy Plus micro kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated with the Protoscript II First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs). qRT-PCR was carried out on a Quantstudio 6 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using Taqman primers and Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix. Reactions were carried out in triplicate with at least three mice analyzed per experiment. Gene expression was determined using the ΔΔCt method. Primers purchased from Applied Biosystems and included IKBKB-FAM (Gene assay ID: Mm01222247_m1), CHUK-FAM (Mm00432529_m1), IKBKG-FAM (Mm00494927_m1), XRCC5-FAM (Mm00550142_m1), XRCC6-FAM (Mm00487458_m1), TERF2-FAM (Mm01253555_m1), TERF1-FAM (Mm00436928_m1), TERF2IP-FAM (Mm01243676_m1), TPP1-FAM (Mm00487016_m1), TINF2-FAM (Mm00461166_g1), Pot1B-FAM (Mm01278790_m1), Tert-FAM (Mm00436931_m1), and GAPDH-VIC (4352339e). In silico analysis of putative p65 binding sites in promoters The potential of the p65 transcription factor to bind to selected murine gene promoters was analyzed using the Lasagna tool (https://biogrid.engr.uconn.edu/lasagna_search/) with the following conditions: using the transfac model, search range of −2000 to 0, p less than or equal to 0.001. Displayed are theTelomere-induced foci (TIF) assay For chronic injury assessment, mice were injured in the Tibialis Anterior muscle with 10uL of 10ug/mL notexin weekly, for three times and harvested 3 days after the last injury. For dystrophic models, mice were injured once and harvested 3 days post-injury. 10 μm cryosections were stained as described in “telomere length analysis in tissue sections” above using a Tel-C Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated probe (PNA bio). After staining and processing, slides were blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with 3% BSA in PBS, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with antibody to VCAM (1/100 of 1 μg/μL stock ThermoFisher) and 53BP1 (1/2000, Novus Biologicals). Slides were rinsed in PBS and incubated with donkey anti-goat Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/300) for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS three times before mounting coverslips with prolong gold with DAPI. For imaging, 1 μm slices were captured with a Zeiss Confocal 710 microscope with Zen software. TIFs were defined as 53BP1 foci overlapping or contacting telomere foci. For TIF assessment of human-derived MuSCs, cells were plated on collagen-coated chamber slides and stained with TelC-Alexa 647 PNA probe (according to Telomere Length Analysis of FACS Isolated MuSCs (MuQ-FISH) above). Slides were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hour and stained with 53BP1 antibody (1/2000) overnight at 4°C, followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with fluoromount G with DAPI (Southern Biotech). Cells were imaged on a Nikon widefield epifluorescence microscope and quantitated for TIFs.In-cell western Human-derived MuSCs were plated in collagen-coated 96-well optical bottom plates in equal numbers, fixed in 4% PFA/PBS, permeabilized with 1% IGEPAL CA-630, blocked in 10% goat serum/1% BSA/PBS and stained with antibody against phospho-p65 serine 536 (1/100; Abcam) overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed with PBS and stained with Dylight 800 goat anti-rabbit (1/1,000; Rockland) and DNA was stained with DRAQ5 (1/5,000; Biolegend). Signal intensities were measured on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, with Image Studio software. Antibody intensity to nuclear intensity ratios were analyzed to normalize for cell content/growth differences.Imaging using two-photon microscopy To define MuSC number in their endogenous environment, Control (Pax7EGFP) and genetically modified mice bred to Pax7EGFP mice were injured 3X with notexin, starting around 3 months of age, and allowed to recover for ~10 weeks. TA muscles were collected, fixed in 4% PFA/PBS and rinsed in PBS. Muscles were mounted on a custom-made chamber and high-resolution serial sections were collected from the middle of the muscle, using a Leica SP* Confocal/Multiphoton Microscope system equipped with a Chameleon Vision II Sapphire laser. A 910 nm laser was focused through a 20x HCX APO L Lens. Emission light was collected with a FITC (BP 525/50) filter, and muscle fibers were marked via second-generation harmonics. Serial optical sections were collected every 1.5 μm, flattened, and normalized to volume scanned.uCT imaging Each mouse was scanned in vivo using a preclinical μCT system (vivaCT 40, Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) at 38μm nominal voxel size. The scanner was used at 55kVp energy and 145μA intensity. Images were generated with an integration time of 200ms and 1 signal average. During the scans, mice were anesthetized using 1%–1.5% isoflurane in 1–1.5mL/min of oxygen. The mouse was immobilized using a customized holder to ensure minimal motion. Before each scan, a 2D scout view was used to select the scan region. The average scan time was approximately 50min.Myoblast culture and shRNA knockdown C2C12 myoblast cells were grown in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1X antibiotic/antimycotic, 1X Glutamax, and 1X nonessential amino acids. Equal numbers of cells were plated at low density (3×104 cells/well) into 24 well plates and transfected with shRNA vectors using lipofectamine 3000, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Vectors used were shEMPTY (pLKO1.puro empty; Addgene plasmid 8453), mouse XRCC5–1 (Sigma SHCLNG-NM_009533; TRCN000031295), mouse XRCC5–2 (Sigma SHCLNG-NM_009533; TRCN0000071044). Transfected cells were re-plated in 8 well chamber slides 24 hours post-transfection, cultured a further 24 hours, and either subjected to MuQ-FISH or stained with antibody to Ku80 (Santa Cruz, B4, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated) and imaged. Data were generated from 3 independently transfected wells which were stained, imaged and analyzed at the same end points. Analysis of nuclear Ku80 expression was determined using a semi-automated protocol in ImageJ.Functional measurements Muscle contractility was tested at the Penn Muscle Institute Muscle Physiology Assessment Core of the University of Pennsylvania. Eccentrics (ECCs) were assessed on freshly isolated EDL muscles using an Aurora Mouse 1200A System equipped with Dynamic Muscle Control v.5.5 software. EDL muscles were maintained in constantly oxygenated Ringer’s solution (100mM NaCl, 4.7mM KCl, 3.4mM CaCl2, 1.2mM KH2PO4, 1.2mM MgSO4, 25mM HEPES and 5.5mM D-glucose) at 24 C. Briefly, a series of two ECCs was applied using a tetanic stimulation of 80Hz and stretching the muscle by 10% of L0 over 200ms. The force drop was calculated as the percent of the force at the initial ECC.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Dataset values are described in the figure legends and are presented as mean ± SEM (standard error of the mean). n = number of mice per genotype. n = numbers of cells analyzed per mouse.

Copyright notice ID: 8932657 PMID: 35302846 Abstract Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are essential for tissue homeostasis and regeneration, but the potential contribution of MuSC morphology to in vivo function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that quiescent MuSCs are morphologically heterogeneous and exhibit different patterns of cellular protrusions. We classified quiescent MuSCs into three functionally distinct stem cell states: responsive, intermediate, and sensory. We demonstrate that the shift between different stem cell states promotes regeneration and is regulated by the sensing protein Piezo1. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 is sufficient to prime MuSCs toward more responsive cells. Piezo1 deletion in MuSCs shifts the distribution toward less responsive cells, mimicking the disease phenotype we find in dystrophic muscles. We further demonstrate that Piezo1 reactivation ameliorates the MuSC morphological and regenerative defects of dystrophic muscles. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of how stem cells respond to injury and identify Piezo1 as a key regulator for adjusting stem cell states essential for regeneration. Piezo1 regulates functional mechanoproperties of muscle stem cells during regeneration.INTRODUCTION The ability of cells to communicate with their microenvironment and coordinate their activity is fundamentally important in multicellular organisms both during tissue development and homeostasis. In addition, while we know more about interactions between ligands and receptors in a cell (1), we know less about how the right type of cells respond to the right type of signals in a more complex environment [discussed in (2)]. In recent years, mechanical stimuli, stiffness, and filopodia have emerged as a mean of influencing cell behavior either in vitro or among various organisms in vivo (2–6). Yet, we have a limited mechanistic understanding of how stem cells sense their local microenvironment to control maintenance, shape biological processes, and repair tissues. Skeletal muscles have a remarkable capacity to regenerate, due to the presence of adult progenitor cells, called muscle stem cells (MuSCs; also known as satellite cells), which have the ability to self-renew, restore, and repair damaged myofibers (7). Therefore, studying MuSCs has been an informative stem cell mammalian model system over the years to understand how stem cell behavior and plasticity can be altered in response to injury and other tissue signals (8). MuSCs lie in a quiescent state on the surface of the muscle fiber between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma (9). Pax7 is the most used marker of adult MuSCs (8), and Pax7+ cells are both necessary and sufficient for adult muscle repair (10). MuSC function is severely affected in chronic muscle diseases, such as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (11–14). Since their discovery 60 years ago (9), much has been learned regarding the role of MuSCs in homeostasis, regeneration, and disease. The potential function of MuSCs during development, and their proximity to capillaries in adult muscles (15), and the need for ghost fibers to promote differentiation of myogenic progenitors in mice (16) have provided further insights. However, with a few recent exceptions (15–17), the majority of MuSC studies use either histological analysis of skeletal muscle sections (3, 12, 17–20) or single-fiber isolation procedures ex vivo (21–23), both of which disrupt muscle integrity. As a result, the potential functional contribution of MuSC morphology to muscle homoeostasis and its regulation during regeneration and disease in intact adult muscles remain unknown. To assess MuSC structural complexity and performance within their natural environment, we generated a mouse model that permits their visualization in unperturbed mouse muscles at the single-cell level (17). We found that adult MuSCs in their endogenous position are a morphologically heterogeneous population and exhibit sophisticated, cellular axon-like protrusions that extend across and along the muscle fiber and differ in number and length, even under quiescence. We found that dynamic regulation of these protrusions coincides with a transition between the different functional phases of muscle regeneration, with cells with less protrusions being more adaptive and the first to respond to injury, while cells with more protrusions are more dormant and reduce their protrusion length at a later phase of regeneration. Our data reveal that differential protrusion number, length, and complexity are associated with distinct MuSC functional subtypes and that these protrusions are used to decipher the microenvironment and coordinate the function of MuSCs during muscle regeneration. The impact of microenvironmental stiffness on MuSC activation (5) as well as the importance of mechanoregulation of stem cells across different contexts from development to differentiation are becoming increasingly appreciated (3, 4, 24). Emerging evidence in other fields implicates an interplay between the mechanosensing pathway Piezo1 and the cytoskeleton to modulate physiological processes (25). Piezo1 is an important mediator of various aspects of mechanotransduction and mediates cell fate determination in mesenchymal stem cells (26) and osteoblasts (27). However, it is currently unknown whether Piezo1 can regulate MuSC morphology, remodeling, and function. Here, we explored these principles with regard to MuSCs, investigated the effects of pharmacological activation of Piezo1 on MuSC heterogeneity, and generated Piezo1 conditional MuSC knockout mice. We found that Piezo1 defines MuSC subtypes and coordinates the MuSC transition toward cells with less protrusions in homeostasis and regeneration. The physiological importance of our findings was further highlighted by our demonstration that, in muscular dystrophy, protrusion length is aberrantly regulated, Piezo1 levels are low, and the number of cells with few protrusions is reduced. Pharmacological reactivation of Piezo1 ameliorates the aberrant morphology of diseased MuSCs and boosts muscle regeneration in dystrophic mice. Therefore, MuSCs have protrusions that establish their stem cell state and Piezo1 is necessary for their transition toward more activated stem cell forms, such as the ones that are impaired in diseased conditions.RESULTS Quiescent MuSCs exhibit variability in protrusions within their natural environment While previous histological and single-fiber isolation data have been extensively used to study MuSCs, the full range of morphological properties of stem cell populations has not been directly characterized in vivo. We recently generated a Pax7EGFP reporter mouse that uses the endogenous Pax7 promoter to drive expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and demonstrated that Pax7-driven EGFP is a dynamic marker of MuSC stemness in vitro (17). To further characterize MuSCs in their endogenous location, the hindlimb tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were visualized by two-photon microscopy to identify EGFP+ quiescent MuSCs, while muscle fibers were assessed by second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging of sarcomeres (Fig. 1A). We found that quiescent MuSCs do not exist as round cells in vivo but instead exhibit elongated axon-like cytoplasmic extensions that we termed “protrusions,” which vary in number and length (Fig. 1B and movie S1). Most of the MuSCs have two protrusions (Fig. 1C); however, a significant number of cells have 0, 1, 3, 4, or ≥5 (Fig. 1, B and C). Notably, when MuSCs are isolated from the Pax7EGFP muscles, protrusions are no longer visible (fig. S1A), suggesting that these structures disassemble quickly in response to skeletal muscle disruption. Further characterization of EGFP-expressing Pax7 cells within skeletal muscles revealed that while 86% of these MuSCs have nonbranching protrusions, the remaining 14% have one, two, and sometimes three or more branches (Fig. 1, D and E). In addition, the total protrusion length is positively correlated with the increase in the number of protrusions per cell (Fig. 1F). Together, these data demonstrate that quiescent MuSCs are a morphologically heterogeneous population in vivo. To reveal the spatial placement of the “axon-like” MuSCs on muscle fibers, we quantified the orientation of cells and found that MuSCs with zero and one protrusions tend to align parallel across the muscle fiber. As the number of protrusions increases, cells change their orientation and tend to align more perpendicularly to the myofiber (Fig. 1G). These data provide direct evidence that quiescent MuSCs do not uniformly align across the fiber in their endogenous environment, adding another layer of topological heterogeneity to adult MuSCs.

Scale bars, 10 μm.Protrusions from other cell types are thought to mediate local communication between adjacent cells through physical contact (2, 15). To investigate whether MuSC protrusions extend to other nuclei on the fiber, we generated a mouse (Pax7EGFP; RosanTnG) in which muscles bear green MuSCs (EGFP) and red nuclei (tdTomato) (fig. S1B). Notably, we observed that the vast majority of cells with one and two protrusions are in close proximity to other nuclei on the fiber (fig. S1C). However, the cells with more than four protrusions rarely reside near nuclei, but instead, their protrusions extend across and along the sarcomeres of the muscle fiber. These data suggest that cells with fewer than three protrusions likely participate in cell-to-cell communication, while cells with four or more protrusions extend toward the muscle fiber, possibly “sensing” the muscle environment. We also found that MuSCs with an increased number of protrusions have a larger surface area (Fig. 1H), while MuSCs with zero protrusions are more circular (Fig. 1I). These data suggest that the increased number of protrusions is used by quiescent cells in uninjured conditions to probe the muscle environment. Similar MuSC distribution and protrusion metrics were observed whether we looked in the middle of TA (Fig. 1) or the muscle area close to the tendon (TA myotendinous area; fig. S2, A to F). Moreover, analysis of the Pax7EGFP soleus muscle showed similar MuSC and protrusion distribution (fig. S2, G to L), suggesting that these parameters do not vary considerably between fast-twitch and slow-twitch leg muscles under steady-state conditions. Overall, this comprehensive characterization of cells in quiescence (Fig. 1J) establishes an original framework to study the function of MuSCs in their native environment following injury of healthy muscles as well as in degenerating diseased muscles before and after therapeutic treatment.Cellular protrusions in adult uninjured muscles are not used to mobilize MuSCs Cellular protrusions in other cell types, including cancer cells undergoing metastasis, can promote cellular migration (28). While MuSCs can undergo migration in isolated myofibers in vitro (29), previous attempts to assess migration in vivo found that MuSCs do not migrate within an approximately 6-hour time frame (16). However, it remains unclear whether quiescent MuSCs in uninjured muscles are able to migrate over a longer time period. To assess their migratory behavior, we directly monitored MuSCs in a spatiotemporal manner within anesthetized Pax7EGFP animals (fig. S3A). A major challenge of imaging deep skeletal muscle of the lower leg is that it requires a skin incision to expose the deeper tissue layers, leading to both inflammatory and wound-healing responses (30). In contrast, the ear muscle is anatomically very close to the skin and provides a technical imaging advantage, as there is no need for a skin incision (fig. S3, B and C), thereby avoiding tissue disturbances or wound-induced chemoattractant signals (31) that could influence cell mobilization in the underlying muscle. Moreover, the intact skin has an anatomically characteristic pattern of hair follicles that can be used for orientation during imaging studies (32). By using the clusters of hair follicles as a landmark (fig. S3, D and E), we were able to pinpoint the exact region of interest in muscles and image it at different time points (fig. S3, F and G). This unique imaging method revealed that quiescent MuSCs remain in a relatively fixed position on the fibers under steady-state conditions over an 8-day duration (fig. S3, F and G). As the protrusion length in the majority of these quiescent adult MuSCs remains unaltered during this time period, we conclude that, in uninjured muscle fibers, protrusions do not promote MuSC migration.MuSC protrusions are dynamically regulated upon skeletal muscle injury Following injury, normally quiescent MuSCs are activated, proliferate, and either self-renew or differentiate, fuse, and ultimately reconstitute skeletal muscles (33). Because MuSCs play a pivotal role during muscle regeneration, we next sought to explore whether the MuSC subtypes we identified have distinct responses after injury. To this end, we induced muscle injury in the TA of Pax7EGFP mice with notexin and imaged their muscles at different times after injury (Fig. 2A). Analysis of MuSCs within the injury area (fig. S4A, white line) revealed that, after muscle damage, MuSC protrusions are reduced in length and that the MuSC population phenotype shifts toward cells with less protrusions at day 2 (d2) (Fig. 2C) and even more pronounced by d3 (Fig. 2D), a time point when proliferation peaks after injury (34), and results in a population of MuSCs that have predominantly zero to two, with very few remaining cells with more than 3. Analysis of muscle areas adjacent to the injury (fig. S4A, yellow line) revealed a similar shift of MuSC types toward cells with fewer protrusions (fig. S4B), suggesting that MuSC protrusions are dynamic and readjust their length in response to injury even from a distance. To gain insight into the cell cycle dynamics of MuSC subtypes within the injury, we used the Ki67–red fluorescent protein (RFP) line, which has been previously used to visualize actively proliferating cells in vivo (35). We first bred Ki67-RFP with Pax7EGFP mice to generate double Pax7EGFP/Ki67-RFP mice and then imaged their muscles at d3 after injury (fig. S5, A and B). Our analysis showed that predominantly cells with few protrusions are proliferative (fig. S5C), further indicating that cells with more protrusions represent putative quiescent stem cells, while cells with few protrusions are the more “active” MuSC population. Together, these data demonstrate that there is a distinct function of the different MuSC types, with cells with few protrusions primed to be the “first line” responders that are ready to proliferate immediately following injury. Coupled with data shown above, these results indicate that cells with few protrusions are initially dormant, and they become activated later during the regeneration process, shifting toward a morphological cell state with less protrusions. Fig. 2. MuSC protrusions are dynamically regulated during muscle regeneration.

(B) Distribution of different MuSC types before injury. (C) Distribution of different MuSC types 2 days (d2) after injury shows a shift toward cells with less protrusions. (D) Distribution of MuSC types 3 days (d3) after injury. Note the disappearance of cells with multiple protrusions and the increase shift toward more cells with fewer protrusions. (E) Twenty-one days (d21) after injury, there is a redistribution of MuSC types, suggesting that protrusions reappear at later stages of regeneration. (F) At day 30 (d30), the distribution of MuSC types has returned to preinjury conditions. (G) Proposed model of the behavior of MuSCs during regeneration. There is a dynamic retraction of MuSC protrusions, with cells with few protrusions being the adaptive subtype that predominantly respond first, while cells with multiple protrusions are more dormant, and they reduce their protrusion length at a later phase. As tissue healing continues at later stages of regeneration, cellular protrusions reappear and cells align across the injured fiber, contributing to muscle repair and restoring the homeostatic MuSC morphological heterogeneity upon stem cell self-renewal. n = 3 mice (2 months old) were analyzed, and N > 150 cells per animal for each time point in (B) to (F). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Data from each day after injury (C to F) were compared with the equivalent data from the quiescence state (B). Values are presented as means ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.As regeneration proceeds, MuSCs down-regulate Pax7, and either differentiate or self-renew and reexpress Pax7 (33, 36). By d21 after injury and as tissue restoration progresses, EGFP+ cells again exhibit a wide range of MuSC states, including cells with more protrusions (Fig. 2E), showing that protrusions reappear in self-renewing MuSCs of regenerated myofibers. By d30, the distribution of the different MuSCs types returned to that found in preinjured muscles (Fig. 2, F and B). These data demonstrate that the dynamic regulation of MuSC protrusions concurs with the transitions between different functional phases during skeletal muscle regeneration (Fig. 2G). Collectively, our analyses demonstrate a dynamic retraction of MuSC protrusions in regenerating muscle fibers, with cells with few protrusions predominantly responding first, while cells with more protrusions reduce their protrusion length progressively and get activated at a later phase. As tissue healing continues and stem cell self-renewal occurs at later stages of regeneration, cellular protrusions reappear and restore homeostatic MuSC morphological heterogeneity, after a single or after repeated injuries (fig. S4C). Thus, our data indicate that MuSC protrusions are not static structures but instead adapt to distinct regeneration phases, further supporting a coordinating role in muscle restoration.Cell protrusions in GAlert MuSCs adjust to a transitional state It was previously shown that systemic signals can influence MuSCs to adapt to a “primed” or GAlert state that enables them to quickly increase functional ability (37). On the basis of the morphological changes of MuSCs in response to injury, we hypothesized that MuSC protrusions are also regulated in GAlert cells. To test this hypothesis, we injured one leg of Pax7EGFP mice with notexin and imaged the contralateral uninjured TA muscle (fig. S6A). MuSCs at the distal site show a shift toward cells with few protrusions (fig. S6B), analogous to that observed in MuSCs adjacent to the injury (fig. S4B). These findings further demonstrate that damage increases the proportion of MuSCs with few protrusions even at sites distal to the injured areas, consistent with the notion that these cells are more “adaptive” cells. While the total number of cells per muscle volume, the number of branches, and the orientation of the GAlert cells remain unchanged (fig. S6, C to E), there is a notable reduction in the overall protrusion length (fig. S6F) and a shift toward a less elongated shape in the GAlert cells compared to quiescent cells (fig. S6G). These findings further suggest that reduction in protrusion length promotes a more circular shape, in accordance with the fact that GAlert cells are in an adaptive state ready to respond rapidly to a subsequent injury (37). Together, these data reveal that MuSC protrusions are delicate structures that respond to various levels and degrees of damage. Even after systemic injuries, MuSCs respond by shifting to a transitional, primed state characterized by an increased distribution of cells with few protrusions, further supporting our previous injury data (Fig. 2) that cells with zero to one protrusions are cells prepped to attain an active state.MuSCs can be classified into responsive, intermediate, and sensory cells On the basis of the various morphological and functional characteristics of the protrusions analyzed, we classified quiescent MuSCs into three different subtypes (table S1): (i) “Responsive” cells are smaller and rounder, with zero or one protrusion, that are aligned along the fiber. These are the primed, more active cells and the first ones to respond to an injury. (ii) “Sensory” cells, which are larger, less round cells that are not aligned along the fiber and have four or more protrusions, extended in all directions of the fiber and are more “dormant” cells that respond to injury at a later phase. (iii) “Intermediate” cells, which display intermediate sizes, are usually elongated, are not always aligned along the fiber and have two or three protrusions, and seem to be in between the above states. On the basis of our data, upon injury, sensory cells respond later, by losing their protrusions and transitioning toward intermediate and then responsive cells. This categorization of MuSCs’ properties establishes a more defined context to investigate sensing pathways that could affect the transition from one state to another in response to injury.Piezo1 regulates the morphological heterogeneity of MuSCs and is required for proper transition of MuSC subtypes during regeneration Piezo1 is an emerging mechanosensing protein that acts as an important mediator of various aspects of mechanical signaling and cell fate regulation in osteoblasts (27) and axon regeneration (38). Although Piezo1 is expressed in MuSCs (39), its role in MuSC regulation has never been studied. To examine the effect of Piezo1 in MuSC morphological heterogeneity, we treated Pax7EGFP mice with a widely studied activator of Piezo1, called Yoda1 (Fig. 3A) (40). First, we confirmed that injection of Yoda1 does not affect the overall organ metrics (fig. S7, A to D). Next, we analyzed MuSC subtypes between uninjected Pax7EGFP mice and Pax7EGFP mice injected with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (fig. S7E) and found that DMSO alone has no effect on MuSC states. However, comparison of Pax7EGFP mice injected with either DMSO or Yoda1 revealed that while the total number of cells per volume remained unchanged (fig. S7F), MuSCs from Yoda1-injected mice shift to a primed state characterized by an increased distribution of responsive cells and a reduction of intermediate cells (Fig. 3B), had a reduced protrusion length (Fig. 3C), and were more circular in shape (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that pharmacological activation of Piezo1 shifts MuSCs toward a transitional activated state similar to GAlert MuSCs (fig. S6), morphologically evident by the increased percentage of responsive cells, even in the absence of a regenerative signal. Fig. 3. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 primes responsive MuSCs. Open in a new tab (A) Experimental scheme for pharmacological activation of Piezo via injection of Yoda1. Two-month-old male Pax7EGFP mice were injected with either DMSO or Yoda1 five consecutive days per week for 2 weeks (d1 to d5 and d8 to d12), and their TA was imaged at d15. (B) MuSCs from mice injected with Yoda1 show a shift toward more responsive cells. (C) Total protrusion length is decreased in MuSCs from mice injected with Yoda1. (D) MuSCs from mice injected with Yoda1 are less elongated. n = 3 to 4 mice (2 to 3 months old) were analyzed, and N > 600 cells per animal. Two-way ANOVA was used for analyses, followed by Šídák’s multiple comparisons test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.To investigate whether Piezo1 is necessary and sufficient for the transition between functional MuSC subtypes, we generated mice in which Piezo1 is conditionally deleted in MuSCs. Specifically, mice carrying a floxed allele of Piezo1 (41) as well as the Ai9 allele (42) to track and image cells (tdTomato+) were crossed with Pax7ERT2Cre mice (43) to generate Piezo1 MuSC-specific knockout (Piezo1MuSC-KO) mice (fig. S8A). While ablation of Piezo1 in MuSCs had no effect on overall muscle morphology (fig. S8B) or total cell numbers per volume (fig. S8C) under steady-state conditions, the total length of MuSC protrusions was increased (Fig. 4A, fig. S8D, and movie S2) and cells were more elongated (Fig. 4B), consistent with an expansion of cell surface area that could potentially be used to explore their environment. Under uninjured conditions, quiescent and immotile MuSC populations were composed of significantly fewer responsive cells and more intermediate cells (Fig. 4C) with abnormal, spikey, and thick protrusions (Fig. 4D), indicative of alterations in the morphological shift of MuSCs. These data suggest that Piezo1 affects the morphological heterogeneity of cells at the progenitor level. Fig. 4. MuSC-specific deletion of Piezo1 blocks transition of MuSCs toward responsive cells.

(F) Significantly reduced number of responsive cells and excessive number of sensory cells (red columns) in Piezo1MuSC-KO muscles at d3 after injury, a time point that control muscles have negligible numbers of sensory cells (gray columns). n = 3 mice (3 months old) were analyzed, and N > 600 cells per animal. Two-way ANOVA was used for analyses, followed by Šídák’s multiple comparisons test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.To examine whether the changes we observed in protrusion complexity, length, and MuSC subtypes can influence the regeneration potential of Piezo1MuSC-KO muscles, we performed intramuscular notexin injury on young control and Piezo1MuSC-KO mice (Fig. 4E) and imaged their muscles by two-photon microscopy. Consistent with our previous data (Fig. 2D), the majority of control MuSCs are predominantly responsive by d3, with very few sensory cells (Fig. 4F). In contrast, in Piezo1MuSC-KO muscles, there are significantly more sensory and intermediate cells and fewer responsive cells at d3 after injury (Fig. 4F), demonstrating a clear impairment of Piezo1MuSC-KO MuSCs to transition toward more active responsive cells upon injury. To address whether the defect in MuSC subtype regulation in Piezo1MuSC-KO MuSCs is caused by MuSC proliferation changes, we injured control and Piezo1MuSC-KO mice with notexin and pulsed in vivo with the nucleotide analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) to label cells undergoing DNA replication (fig. S8E). While in uninjured muscles there were no proliferation differences, we observed significant reduction of the portion of MuSCs that were EdU+ in Piezo1MuSC-KO (fig. S8, F and G). These data demonstrate that the absence of Piezo1 in MuSCs leads to a lower rate of proliferation upon injury, which eventually contributes to an overall impairment of muscle regeneration over time (fig. S8H). Together, these data demonstrate that Piezo1 is sufficient to prime MuSCs toward more responsive, active cells and is necessary for the proper maintenance of the morphological heterogeneity of MuSC states and cell proliferation that tunes muscle homeostasis and regeneration.Dystrophic muscles exhibit dysregulated MuSC subtypes, with lower Piezo1 levels and longer, more complex protrusions In muscle diseases such as DMD, unrelenting, repetitive muscle damage elicits a constant need for regeneration (44). We and others have previously shown that although DMD is initiated by a structural genetic defect, it develops progressively into a stem cell disease due to improper MuSC activation (12, 45). To allow for visualization of dystrophic MuSCs at the single-cell level, we crossed mdx mice carrying the dystrophin mutation (46) with the Pax7EGFP reporter mice (17). To determine the morphology of the protrusions in dystrophic MuSCs, we imaged whole muscles of young mdx/Pax7EGFP mice and found an increased number of EGFP+ cells with more complex appearance (Fig. 5A; fig. S9, A and B; and movie S3), mirroring the complexity of Piezo1MuSC-KO MuSCs. To investigate whether Piezo1 levels might be affected in dystrophic cells, we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in isolated MuSCs. Dystrophic MuSCs exhibit markedly reduced Piezo1 levels compared to controls (Fig. 5B), indicating a severe defect of Piezo1 signaling in diseased MuSCs. Further analysis of the MuSC states revealed a significant decrease of responsive cells and an increase in sensory cells (Fig. 5C), suggesting a delay in the transition from sensory to intermediate to responsive cells, similar to what we observed in Piezo1MuSC-KO regenerating muscles. Furthermore, all dystrophic MuSC types have longer (Fig. 5, D and E), more branched, and thicker protrusions (fig. S9, D and E), indicative of a failure to properly regulate protrusions in chronic dystrophic conditions. As a result of the increased number and length of protrusions, dystrophic MuSCs also appear as more elongated (Fig. 5F) and slightly misoriented (fig. S9C) compared to quiescent MuSCs, similar to the expanded cell surface and elongated cells we observed in MuSCs from Piezo1MuSC-KO muscles. Together, these data demonstrate that the reduced levels of Piezo1 in diseased MuSCs coexist with an improper adjustment of protrusion length and fail to adequately regulate MuSC states in dystrophic muscles during repetitive injuries.

Values are presented as means ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ****P < 0.0001.Activation of Piezo1 restores MuSC subtype distribution in dystrophic muscles Because Piezo1 levels are reduced in dystrophic MuSCs, and MuSCs from Piezo1MuSC-KO and dystrophic mice display similar phenotypes (Figs. 4 and 5), we hypothesized that activation of Piezo1 pathway could alleviate the dystrophic MuSC morphology and function. To test this hypothesis, we used the known pharmacological activator of Piezo1, Yoda1 (38), which we previously demonstrated increases the percentage of responsive cells (Fig. 3B). mdx/Pax7EGFP mice were treated with either DMSO or Yoda1 (Fig. 6A), and their muscles were imaged by two-photon microscopy at d15 after treatment. First, we confirmed that DMSO alone had no effect on either the MuSC states (fig. S10A) or the complexity of the individual dystrophic MuSCs (fig. S10B). To determine the overall morphology of the protrusions, we imaged whole muscles of mdx/Pax7EGFP mice treated with either DMSO or Yoda1. We found that while the total number of EGFP+ cells remains unchanged (fig. S10D), the protrusions in the treated dystrophic muscles more closely resembled the morphology of a healthy muscle (Fig. 6B, fig. S10C, and movies S4 and S5). Analysis of MuSC states revealed a significant increase in responsive cells (Fig. 6C), suggesting a restoration in the transition from sensory to intermediate to responsive cells. Moreover, all MuSC types have shorter (Fig. 6D) and less complex protrusions (Fig. 6E) with reduced branches (fig. S10E), indicative of restoration of proper regulation of protrusions in chronic dystrophic conditions. As a result of the decreased number and length of protrusions, dystrophic MuSCs from Yoda1-treated animals also appear as less elongated (Fig. 6F) compared to dystrophic MuSCs from DMSO-treated dystrophic mice. When we examined the muscle cross sections of treated mice, we found evidence of improved regeneration in the Yoda1-treated dystrophic muscles, as shown by the increased fiber size as well as the number of fibers with centralized nuclei (fig. S10, F and G). Together, these data demonstrate that reactivation of Piezo1 in dystrophic muscles restores protrusion length, better regulates MuSC heterogeneity, and promotes proper function during repetitive injuries (fig. S10H). Fig. 6. Amelioration of dystrophic MuSC morphological defects after pharmacological activation of Piezo1.

Here, using a dynamic mouse line to follow stemness (17), we visualized quiescent MuSCs in their natural muscle environment by two-photon microscopy and found that MuSCs are morphologically heterogeneous, exhibiting a variety of axon-like protrusions. The majority of MuSCs display two protrusions, followed by cells with three and one protrusions, respectively. The lack of visible protrusions in isolated MuSCs suggests that they are very fragile and sensitive to environmental cues, consistent with previous observations (15) as well as with stem cell extensions in other organisms, which are visible only in vivo (47). One of the most well-characterized cellular extensions present on stem cells in many systems, including muscles, is the primary cilium, a single very short unbranched extension (48). However, the protrusions described here for adult MuSCs are long extensions that vary in both number and length, and a significant portion of MuSCs in adult uninjured muscles have branched protrusions, suggesting that protrusions and cilia are likely to be two distinct structures. On the basis of the morphology and behavior of the protrusions, we classified adult quiescent MuSCs into three categories with distinct morphological and functional properties: responsive, intermediate, and sensory cells. We found that responsive cells are round and more primed, with zero or one protrusion; sensory cells are larger cells, in a more genuine, stem cell–like state and have four or more longer protrusions that extend in all directions of the fiber; and intermediate cells have two or three protrusions and are in between the other two states. Although some indications of cellular extensions were previously introduced (15, 49, 50), the extensive and full-range characterization of the MuSC protrusions in uninjured and regenerating muscles we report here has never been performed before. While cellular protrusions have been described in stem cells of other organisms and in other mammalian tissues (15, 47, 51–53), there is little information regarding the exact function of such extensions in adult stem cells in this emerging field (2). Because of the loss of these fragile extensions upon isolation, conventional transplantation experiments or transcriptomic analysis in isolated cells cannot be used to gain insights into the molecular pathways and/or function of morphological distinct MuSC states. To further investigate whether changes in the protrusions correlate with altered MuSC function and to determine whether MuSC protrusions may contribute to skeletal muscle healing, we studied their behavior under injury conditions. We found that newly characterized primed cells with fewer protrusions, we designated as responsive cells, are the first MuSC type to respond and participate in regeneration, followed by the transformation of cells in a more genuine stem cell state with more protrusions, we designated as sensory cells. These alterations occur following both local and systemic injury, further demonstrating that MuSCs undergo a timely adaptive response following injury. It has been reported that MuSCs with higher Pax7 levels are less primed for myogenic commitment at the transcription level and take longer to enter the cell cycle (36). Our study provides evidence that sensory cells (with more protrusions) respond to injury later than responsive MuSCs (with fewer protrusions), presumably because it takes them longer to transition toward intermediate and responsive cells. The dynamic transition of MuSCs during early activation is consistent with a previous report showing changes in mechanoproperties and cytoskeleton signaling before cell cycle signaling (3). The differential timing of responsive and sensory cells during regeneration that we observe is consistent with the notion that not all quiescent MuSCs are functionally equivalent, with responsive cells (fewer protrusions) being more primed cells, as shown both in the injury and their response in the GAlert phase, while sensory cells (more and longer protrusions) are more dormant and intermediate cells are in between these states. These data suggest a hierarchical cascading quiescence model, in which the responsive cells facilitate a rapid response to injury, while sensory cells only participate in high-demand injury situations, where they lose protrusions and transition toward intermediate and responsive cells. Overall, contrary to the idea that quiescence is simply a passive and dormant state, our results reveal that quiescent MuSC populations represent a collection of morphological heterogeneous states with different functional capabilities. These findings provide a detailed morphological heterogeneity in MuSCs in their endogenous environment and lay the groundwork for future spatial molecular analysis of the different MuSC states using methods recently developed for other tissues (54, 55). Adult stem cells often reside in specialized microenvironments, called niches, that specify stem cell identity (56). While we found that MuSC protrusions do not mobilize cells under steady-state conditions, we suspect that they may play an important role in sensing both the niche environment and the surrounding muscle. In support, at a later stage of regeneration where self-renewal occurs and MuSCs return to their niche to preserve progenitors for response to future injuries (33), the protrusions reappear, and the morphological heterogeneity is restored as in preinjured muscles. Consistent with the notion that protrusions are important to specify stemness and proper identity at the niche, lack of protrusions in isolated MuSCs are associated with a reported loss of stemness and rapid differentiation in vitro (33), which hinders MuSC stem cell maintenance in cultures. Protrusions act as an effective and specific form of cell communication in a variety of cell types (2). Our analysis showed that responsive MuSCs are in close proximity to other nuclei on the myofibers. As such, the proximity between MuSC protrusions and endothelial cells could regulate stem cell quiescence via Notch signaling (15) or be used for communication with other progenitor cells within skeletal muscles, i.e., fibroadipogenic progenitors, which provide functional support to MuSCs (57). It is possible that disruption of such communication via improper regulation of MuSC protrusions could contribute to the incomplete regeneration seen in diseased muscles (58). Future investigation of additional intrinsic and extrinsic regulators or other sensors that could be responsible for preserving MuSC protrusions, in combination with extracellular matrices that mimic the living architectural muscle cues (59) and retain cell-matrix interactions, including nerve injuries that were recently shown to affect MuSC morphology (60), would allow direct assessment of the essential communication between MuSC states, the niche, and the surrounding environment, including the neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions. Pharmacological approaches to interfere with the generation of cytoskeletal protrusions in vivo are unlikely to be tenable as skeletal muscle fibers consist of the same cytoskeletal molecules and will also be affected. Instead, here, we found a critical role for the sensing protein PIEZO1 in regulating the morphological heterogeneity of MuSCs using both mouse genetic and pharmacological approaches. Since its original identification (41), the importance of Piezo1 has been revealed in various tissues (61–63). Yet, there is only a limited understanding of how Piezo1 acts in stem cells and how it shapes biological processes [discussed in (25)]. The work presented here demonstrated that Piezo1 is essential for maintaining MuSC states and regulating protrusion length and cell shape in both homeostatic and dystrophic muscles. We show that pharmacological activation of Piezo1, via Yoda1, is sufficient to shift MuSCs to a transitional, primed state that is characterized by an increased distribution of responsive cells and promotes an adaptive, more active MuSC state. Although detecting expression levels in whole muscles while preserving the morphological heterogeneity of MuSCs is still a challenge, we postulate that Piezo1 may be expressed at very low basal levels in sensory cells, which have long protrusions extending along and across the fiber, allowing them to sense the surrounding environment. However, upon ablation of Piezo1 in MuSCs, there is a clear shift in distribution toward fewer responsive cells that becomes more profound at d3 after injury, whereas the number of sensory cells is significantly increased and disproportional compared to d3 control MuSC states. These data further suggest that in the absence of Piezo1, MuSCs lengthen their protrusions to better perceive their injured immediate microenvironment and reduce their proliferation rate at the cost of delaying muscle regeneration, in agreement with previous reports (64, 65) and consistent with the idea that inactivation of proper cell channels impedes a transition from a resting state to an activated state (3, 25, 27). The importance of Piezo1 in muscle disease is further displayed by studying young dystrophic muscles in their endogenous environment. We propose that although dystrophic MuSCs perceive muscle damage, they do not properly “sense” it due to their lower Piezo1 levels. As a result, they expand their protrusions and elongate their shape to counterbalance this inability to transmit information. An alternative hypothesis might be that Piezo1 provides a feedback signal that “informs” these cells when they have stretched enough. In this case, a reduced feedback signal due to the lower levels of Piezo1 would lead to elongation and protrusion expansion. Either way, we suggest that under the high regenerative demands in the diseased muscles, dystrophic cells are unable to channel the information in a timely manner, leading to the reported improper MuSC activation in dystrophic muscles (12). To test this assertion, we next asked whether temporary pharmacological activation of Piezo1 was sufficient to reverse the defective morphology of dystrophic MuSCs. Our data revealed that administration of Yoda1 restores MuSC state distribution, shortens protrusion length, and alters stem cell shape to more closely resemble a healthy MuSC, while muscle regeneration is boosted. The duration of the effects of such a treatment on MuSCs and whether additional boosts or different doses might be necessary to maintain MuSC morphology and function in dystrophic muscles over a longer period of time remain to be tested. Moreover, Piezo1 is a bona fide mechanosensitive channel that mediates Ca2+ signaling in various cell types (25–27, 39, 60, 65). Thus, we cannot exclude that microenvironmental changes in other muscle cells and/or myofibers may also influence MuSC function and morphology. Nevertheless, the data presented here provide proof of principle of the therapeutic potential of Yoda1 in restoring MuSC heterogeneity in dystrophic muscles. In summary, we demonstrated a unique morphological heterogeneity of adult MuSCs and revealed that regulation of MuSC subtypes and protrusion length play a fundamental role in skeletal muscles in health and disease. This work constitutes a pioneering step in defining new structural and behavioral properties of MuSC progenitors and demonstrates that the underlying molecular mechanism involving the sensing pathway Piezo1 is critical for preserving a healthy morphological heterogeneity of the stem cell pool and maintaining the regeneration potential of skeletal muscles. Our study provides essential and fresh insights for addressing crucial questions regarding the biology and communication of stem cells with their environment in physiological and pathological conditions and presents a therapeutic target for treating muscular dystrophy. Given the emerging interest of protrusions on stem cells in other systems (47, 53, 66), the findings and molecular mechanism presented here for MuSCs are likely to be relevant for other adult stem cell populations with cellular extensions in different tissues and organisms.MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Adult Pax7EGFP (17) mice were bred with either mdx4cv mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 002378) to generate double mdx4cv; Pax7EGFP or RosanTnG mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 023035) to generate double Pax7EGFP; nTnG mice. Ki67-RFP mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 029802) were bred with the Pax7EGFP mice to generate the double Pax7EGFP;Ki67-RFP mice (fig. S4A). Piezo1Fl/Fl mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 029213) were crossed to Ai9Fl/Fl mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 007909) and Pax7ERT2Cre mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 017763) to create the triple Pax7ERT2Cre;Piezo1Fl/Fl;Ai9Fl/Fl mice (called Piezo1MuSC-KO). To induce Cre expression, mice were injected with 250 μl of tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich; 20 mg/ml in ethanol/corn oil in a 1:10 ratio) intraperitoneally every second day for a total of seven injections, starting at 6 or 8 weeks of age. Genotyping was performed by PCR as described in (17). For all experiments, mice of the same sex and similar age were compared. The age of mice for each experiment is reported in the figure legends. Animals were housed and bred in a local animal facility at a 12-hour dark/12-hour light cycle, and their use and care were approved by the University of Pennsylvania according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.Muscle injury To define MuSC number and protrusion status, the TA muscles of Pax7EGFP and genetically modified mice bred to Pax7EGFP mice were injured with notexin (10 μg/ml; Latoxan) at the ages indicated in each experiment. In the case of multiple injuries, a second injection of notexin was performed 1 week after the first injury and muscles were analyzed 10 days after the last injury. For GAlert MuSCs, the TA of one hindlimb was injured once with 10 μl of notexin, and 3 days after injury, the TA muscle of the contralateral leg was analyzed as described below (see the “Image analyses” section).Yoda1 injections Yoda1 (Tocris Bioscience) was dissolved in DMSO at 40 mM as stock, diluted in 5% ethanol, and injected at 5 μmol/kg of body weight. Control mice were injected with equal volume of vehicle (DMSO diluted in 5% ethanol). Yoda1 or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally for five consecutive days per week for 2 weeks (d1 to d5 and d8 to d12). At d5, mice were harvested, and tissues were collected for further evaluation. All investigators involved in data collection were blinded to both genotype and group of mice.Method details Muscle isolation Mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation. The TA muscles were freshly dissected. Samples were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 hours on a rocker mixer at 4°C and rinsed and stored in 1× PBS solution at 4°C in the dark. Muscle histology Muscles were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS and incubated overnight in 30% sucrose before being embedded in optimal cutting temperature embedding compound (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek USA) and frozen in chilled 2-methylbutane. Cryosections were cut at a thickness of 10 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and/or trichrome staining using standard procedures. Immunofluorescence staining Tissue cryosections were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, and incubated with blocking solution [1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100] for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibody for laminin (1:200; anti–laminin B2, clone A5, EMD Millipore Corp.) was incubated overnight at 4°C in antibody dilution buffer (1% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100). Slides were then incubated with secondary antibody [Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rat (1:300; Thermo Fisher Scientific)] in antibody dilution buffer for 1 hour in the dark. Slides washed with PBS, and coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sections were imaged with a Nikon Ni wide-field epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 20× Plan Apo objective and Nikon Elements software. Two-photon microscopy Fixed muscles were mounted on a custom-made glass chamber and immersed in 1× PBS, and a coverslip was lowered from the top to close the chamber. High-resolution serial optical sections were collected from the top of the muscle after the collagen deposition layer, using a Leica SP* Confocal/Multiphoton Microscope system equipped with a Chameleon Vision II Sapphire laser. A 910-nm laser was focused through a 20× HCX APO L Lens. The following acquisition settings were used for the collection channels: High Voltage (HV): 550/525 V, gain: 1/1, offset: 3/4%. Emission light was collected with a fluorescein isothiocyanate [Bandpass (BP) 525/50] filter, and muscle fibers were marked via SHG in blue channel. Serial optical sections were collected in 1.5-μm steps for a total range of 100- to 200-μm depth, flattened, and normalized to the volume scanned. For imaging of live animals, mice were anesthetized using a ketamine/xylazine mixture [ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg)], administrated by intraperitoneal injection, and the skin in the ear and head was depilated. The mouse was placed on a heated stage, and the head and the ear were supported by a custom-made stage. A glass coverslip was placed against the skin in the junction region between the head and the ear. Distinctive inherent landmarks in the skin were used to navigate back to the original field of view and visualize the same follicles in separate experiments. Anesthesia was maintained throughout the course of the experiment with vaporized isoflurane delivered by a nose cone. The setup for in vivo microscopy was centered on an AxioTech-Vario 100 microscope (Olympus), equipped with light-emitting diode (LED) excitation light for fluorescence epi-illumination. Microscopic images were obtained with a water-dipping objective (20×, numerical aperture of 0.5) and acquired with an AxioCam HSm camera and AxioVision 4.6 software. Serial optical sections were acquired in 2-μm steps to image a total depth of ∼150 μm of tissue. Image analyses Acquired optical sections from two-photon microscopy were analyzed in Fiji. To define MuSC number in the TA muscle, acquired optical sections were stacked in Fiji, and MuSCs were counted and normalized to the volume stacked. To quantify the length and number of the protrusions of MuSC, between 150 and 600 MuSCs per image were analyzed using the Simple Neurite Tracer (SNT) plugin in Fiji. MuSC circularity/aspect ratio, circularity, and orientation ratio were measured using set measurements and the angle tool in Fiji. N = number of cells analyzed per mouse can be found in the figure legends. At least two independent investigators blindly analyzed all data. Cells were defined as misaligned with myofiber if the angle between the cell body and myofiber is greater than a 15-degree angle, and the ratio is calculated as the number of cells misaligned divided by the total number of cells per cell type. MuSC isolation Pax7EGFP mice were sacrificed, and the TA, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles were dissected from both hindlimbs. Muscle was finely minced and placed in a C tube (Miltenyi) containing 0.15% collagenase in 10 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). Tubes were loaded into MACS Dissociator (Miltenyi), and the manufacturer’s muscle-01 program was run. Tubes were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, subjected to the muscle-01 program again, and incubated at 37°C for an additional 30 min. Seventy-five microliters of 2% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 75 μl of dispase (4.8 U/ml; Roche) were added, and tubes were vortexed at maximum speed before a 30-min incubation at 37°C. Cells were passed through a 21-gauge needle until all muscles were broken apart. The remaining cell slurry was filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer that was prewet with 10 ml of cold myoblast medium (DMEM:F12; 15% fetal bovine serum and 1× anti-anti), the strainer was rinsed with an additional 10 ml of cold myoblast medium, and cells were pelleted at 300g at 4°C. Cells were incubated with 1 ml of 1× red cell lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 min at room temperature, and 9 ml of cold fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer [1% BSA, 2.5% goat serum, and 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) in 1× PBS] was added. Cells were spun, and cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer. Before FACS, 1 μg of the viability dye DAPI was added to each sample. Live GFP-positive MuSCs were isolated using an Aria II sorter equipped with a 100-μm nozzle. DAPI was excited with a 405-nm laser, and dead cells were identified using a 450/40 bandpass filter. GFP was excited with a 488-nm laser, and Pax7EGFP MuSCs were identified with a 530/30 bandpass filter. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted MuSCs using an RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated with the ProtoScript II First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). qRT-PCR was carried out on a QuantStudio 6 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan primers and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix. Reactions were carried out in quadruplicate. The number of animals used per experiment is indicated in the figure legends. Gene expression was determined using the ΔΔCt method. Primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems and included Piezo1-FAM (Mm012415449_m1) and GAPDH-VIC (4352339e).

    "title": "Impacts of radiation exposure, hindlimb unloading, and recovery on murine skeletal muscle cell telomere length.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10504369/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Astronauts are exposed to harsh conditions, including cosmic radiation and microgravity. Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth. Subject terms: Stem cells, Cell biology",
    "introduction": "Introduction In the vacuum of space, astronauts are continuously bombarded by high energy cosmic radiation and must perform missions in microgravity1. A better understanding of the consequences of these two factors on body function and physiology are crucial for the planning of safe and successful long-duration future missions. A major detriment experienced by astronauts in flight is muscle atrophy, where a 1 month spaceflight can reduce muscle mass by 20% and muscle strength by 30%2. Even with currently implemented spaceflight countermeasures, involving rigorous exercise, the deleterious physiological effects of spaceflight in muscle atrophy and weakness induction are not completely abrogated3–5. In addition to microgravity, astronaut exposure to cosmic radiation can have effects on body systems that are still being elucidated. It is well established that the skeletal muscle atrophy due to exposure to both microgravity and radiation is problematic because of its rapid onset and severity6. Muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also called satellite cells, are necessary for muscle formation in embryogenesis and for muscle growth during childhood and adolescence7,8. In healthy adults, MuSCs from undamaged muscles remain quiescent. Following injury, such as that arising from strenuous exercise, MuSCs become activated, proliferate, and differentiate in a series of coordinated steps, to properly repair muscle damage9. In the context of muscle atrophy, MuSC properties are less clear. Atrophy caused by cancer cachexia is known to activate specific signaling pathways in skeletal muscles related to inflammation, protein synthesis, and autophagy10. In satellite cells, atrophy-induced signaling exerts effects on MuSC proliferative potential and differentiation capacities11,12. In terms of effects of radiation exposure to MuSCs, limited data are available. Exposure of cultured human muscle progenitor cells to ionizing radiation has negative effects on proliferative capacity and alters inflammatory signaling13. Studies using chronic, lower dose, whole-body irradiation of mice resulted in reduced MuSC numbers, reduced proliferative capacity, and increased quiescence, but it had little effect on differentiative capacity14. Higher dose leg-specific radiation exposures have demonstrated similar results on reduced proliferative capacities of juvenile mice; however, myofiber sizes and MuSC differentiation effects were present as well15, suggesting that level and duration of exposure could have different effects on MuSCs, depending on these factors. The length of telomeres is an important parameter of tissue proliferative potential16. Telomeres are repetitive sequences located at the ends of chromosomes, which can function as cellular proliferation clocks17. Telomere attrition leads to loss of cellular functionality and can lead to stem cell exhaustion in diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy18,19. Shortened telomeres are also correlated with atrophy of many organ compartments, including brain20, spleen, small intestine, and reproductive system, among others21. Additionally, it has been reported that telomeres in cultured mouse and human fibroblasts appear more susceptible than other regions of the genome to DNA damage, and they exhibit a persistent DNA damage response following X-ray irradiation22. Increased DNA damage found at telomeres has been associated with telomere attrition and/or uncapping and cellular senescence, leading to loss of proper cellular functionality23,24. Recently, the effects of spaceflight have been meticulously investigated in the NASA Twins Study, where effects of preflight, inflight, and postflight conditions on a monozygotic twin were measured by multiple metrics and compared with the grounded twin brother25. That study revealed telomere lengthening in T cells of the inflight astronaut, which rapidly shortened postflight25. Another study investigating different astronaut flight conditions found similar results26. However, despite the importance of maintaining skeletal muscles during spaceflight, telomere length metrics in astronaut muscles have not been assessed. The goal of this study was to measure telomere length in resident skeletal muscle cells of grounded, wild-type mice experiencing spaceflight-like conditions, using a whole-body irradiation (IR) and hindlimb suspension (HLS)/mechanical unloading approach. We found that a combination of IR and HLS resulted in telomere elongation, specifically in myogenic cell populations, which did not recover upon a short duration reloading of hindlimbs.",
    "methods": "Methods Mice Male C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (stock# 000664) and used between 2 and 4 months of age. Experimental procedures for this project were approved and overseen by the University of Pennsylvania IACUC committee (protocol #806800). Following receipt, mice were acclimated to University of Pennsylvania rodent housing for 1 week prior to commencing the experiments. All mice in this study were fed Dietgel boost food (ClearH2O) and provided hydrogel barrier hydration (ClearH2O) ad libitum (as the sole nutrition and hydration sources) for the duration of the experiment. Full body irradiation Cohorts of mice were irradiated with ionizing radiation from a 137Cs irradiator (Gammacell 40 exactor) at a dose-rate of 1.23 cGy/s. Room air was provided to the mice during the procedure via a vacuum pump. After 2 Gy exposure, mice were returned to conventional housing for 1-week, prior HLS. Hindlimb suspension Equipment used for hindlimb suspension can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with an isoflurane vaporizer (2.5% v/v isoflurane to oxygen), and mouse tails were wrapped with cloth surgical tape, beginning at the tail base. After wrapping ~half of the tail length, the tape was folded on itself to create a loop, and remaining tape was wrapped around the tail from the midpoint towards the tail base. Through this closed tape loop, plastic-coated wire was threaded and attached to a hanging apparatus. The hanging apparatus was placed in a rat cage with a wire mesh bottom. The hanging apparatus allows for movement of mice only through use of the forelimbs. Range of movement of HLS mice was approximately ½ of the rat cage surface area, but HLS mice were singly housed for the study. Mice were hung for a period of 3 weeks, with or without a 2-week recovery period where mice were placed in conventional housing. Tissue sample collection At the end point of the study, mice were humanely euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation. Organs of interest were collected by dissection and weighed. Tissue weights were normalized to endpoint mouse body weights. Gastrocnemius muscles were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo) for 2 h on a rocking platform at 4 °C. Muscles were then incubated overnight in 30% sucrose in water at 4 °C, prior to embedding in OCT (NEG-50; Epredia) and cryofreezing. Muscle cryosections were cut at 10 μm and placed on superfrost plus slides (Fisher). Slides were stored at −20 °C prior to staining. Muscle fiber cross-sectional area measurements Muscle cryosections were permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; GeminiBio) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; 1 μg/mL; Thermo) for one hour in the dark at room temperature, to outline muscle fibers. Slides were washed in PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI (Thermo). Slides were imaged on a Nikon Ni widefield microscope equipped with a Plan Fluor 10x/0.30 objective and Nikon DS-Qi1Mc 14-bit camera, and random fields per mouse were used for fiber area enumeration in Fiji. Muscle stem cell number quantification Muscle cryosections were permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS, and underwent heat-mediated antigen retrieval with EDTA buffer (1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 0.05% Tween 20). Slides were washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were stained with Pax7 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/100; Thermo #PA1–117) overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and stained with Alexa Fluor-647-conjugated Goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/300; Thermo) for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI (Thermo). Whole cryosections were imaged using an Axio Scan z1 slide scanner (Zeiss) and processed with Zen software. Two cryosections per mouse were used for quantification of the number of pax7 positive cells per 10μm section with Fiji. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity assay Cryosections from gastrocnemius muscles or mouse kidney were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde (Electron microscopy sciences). Slides were incubated with PBS, pH 6.0 for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with X-gal staining solution (4 mM potassium ferricyanide, 4 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM magnesium chloride, 0.02% Igepal CA-630, and 400 μg/mL X-gal; all from Sigma) for 48 h at 37 °C. Slides were washed with PBS, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Slides were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with Fluromount G (SouthernBiotech). Slides were imaged on a Nikon-Ni widefield microscope using a Nikon DS-F12 color camera. Telomere length assessments Telomere length was measured using the CRYO MuQ-FISH protocol35. Briefly, muscle cryosections were permeabilized in 0.5% triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, and underwent heat-mediated antigen retrieval with TET buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20) for 10 minutes. Slides were washed in PBS and incubated with RNase A (100 μg/mL) for 20 minutes at 37 °C. Slides were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated TelC telomere probe (1/600; PNA bio) in hybridization buffer [15% ethylene carbonate (Sigma), 20% dextran sulfate (Sigma), 600 mM sodium chloride (Sigma), 1X antigen retrieval citrate buffer (Vector labs)]. Hybridization occurred by a denaturation step of 67 °C for 10 min and a hybridization step of 42 °C for 90 min. A glass coverslip was used to prevent evaporation. Slides were washed in buffers with decreasing salt concentration (2X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20, 1X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20, 0.5X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20, 0.25X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20) twice each solution for 5 min each before a final rinse in PBS. Slides were then blocked with 3% BSA/PBS/0.1% triton X-100 for 1 hour. MuSCs were labeled by VCAM1 staining (1/100 of 1 mg/mL stock; Thermo # PA5–47029), endothelial cells were marked by CD31biotin (1/100; Thermo #13–0311–82) antibody staining overnight at 4 °C. Alexa fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (1/300; Thermo # A11055), or Cy3-streptavidin (1/100; Thermo) were used to label the cells of interest. After washing with PBS, glass coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI (Thermo). To image telomeres, MuSCs (VCAM1+ in the satellite cell position), myonuclei (based on position within the myofibers), or endothelial cells (CD31 + ) were imaged with a Nikon Plan Apo 100x/1.45 oil objective on a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope, equipped with a DS-Q1MC monochrome camera. Z stacks of 1 μm thickness from each channel (telomere, DAPI, cell type) were taken to encompass the entirety of the telomere fields. Images were processed using the extended depth of focus algorithm in the accompanying Nikon elements microscope software. Images were exported as 16-bit monochrome tiffs and analyzed using the free analysis software, Telometer 3.0.6 (https://demarzolab.pathology.jhmi.edu/telometer/download.html). This software allows cells of interest to be analyzed for telomere signal intensities, and normalizes these intensities to that of DAPI, to account for differences in cell cycle position and has been previously validated for use in muscle. Quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted from whole gastrocnemius muscles with Trizol. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Protoscript II first strand cDNA synthesis kit. (NEB). Multiplexed quantitative real-time PCR was completed using either FAM-labeled Tert (ThermoFisher; gene assay id: Mm00436931_m1), Atrx (ThermoFisher; gene assay id: Mm00494196_m1), or Daxx (ThermoFisher; gene assay id: Mm00492089_m1), with VIC-labeled Gapdh (ThermoFisher 4352339e). Reactions were run on a Quantstudio 6 with accompanying software. Relative gene expression was determined by the ΔΔCT method, using Gapdh as a normalizing control. Immunohistochemistry Gastrocnemius cryosections were permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; GeminiBio) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody to TERT (1/100; RayBiotech # 144–64552–50) was incubated in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed the following day with PBS and stained with Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 555 secondary antibody (1/300; Thermo #A21428) at room temperature for 1 hour. Slides were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI (Thermo). Slides were imaged on a Nikon-Ni widefield microscope using a Nikon DS-F12 color camera. Telomerase activity measurement by TRAP assay Relative telomerase activity was measured by Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) assay as previously described83. In brief, muscle tissue was lysed in 1X CHAPS buffer for 30 minutes on ice. Lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000×g for 20 min to pellet cell debris and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. One hundred twenty-five nanograms of protein lysate was incubated with a telomerase substrate at 30 °C for 30 minutes to allow for telomerase to catalyze the addition of telomere repeats to the substrate. The reactions were then PCR amplified, resolved on a 4–20% TBE polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 30 minutes and visualized by staining with SYBR Green nucleic acid gel stain. Relative telomerase activity was quantified using ImageJ software. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed statistically using GraphPad (La Jolla, CA, USA) Prism 9.5.1 software. Results are presented as the mean± or SEM for column graphs, with individual data points representative of a single mouse dataset, or as median with 25th and 75th quartiles for violin plots. Datasets were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA to determine significance, with Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means used to obtain adjusted p values. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Sample sizes are indicated for each data set in the figure legends.

    "results": "Results Effects of HLS and IR exposure on skeletal muscle properties To address the effects of muscle atrophy and/or irradiation (IR) on skeletal muscles, we utilized the widely accepted hindlimb suspension (HLS) ground-based model27, in combination with or in the absence of whole-body ionizing radiation exposure. In our experimental design, mice were divided into four different cohorts: control (without IR exposure, without hindlimb suspension (HLS)), HLS only (no IR), IR only (no HLS), and combined (HLS + IR); (Fig. 1). More specifically, wildtype mice were pre-exposed to 2 Gy whole-body irradiation or sham irradiated and further divided into groups experiencing HLS or not. Following a 3-week time course, mice were sacrificed, and various tissue weight metrics were obtained. We found that at the study endpoint, mouse whole-body weights were similar for all groups (Fig. 2a), demonstrating that HLS did not detrimentally affect mouse appetite. This finding is especially important, since hindlimb unloading has been used as method to study behavioral despair and depression, and appetite changes, if any, could have influenced our study results28.

Represented are mean ± SEM for column graphs and median with 25th and 75th quartiles marked for violin plots. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means. Adjusted p values are displayed.We next determined the effects of our experimental design on internal organs. We found IR exposure alone had no effects on kidney or spleen weights, but it did cause significant (p < 0.0001) reductions in testes weights, when compared to sham/control mice (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). These findings are in agreement with previous studies in mice and humans exposed to IR29,30. HLS also had deleterious effects on testes gross size and normalized weight (Supplementary Fig. 1a, d; p < 0.0001), consistent with a previous report31. Additionally, kidney weights in HLS and HLS + IR groups were slightly increased compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. 1a, c; p = 0.0452, 0.0705, respectively), a finding that was similarly reported in a rat HLS model32. No differences were found in spleen and kidney weights in combinatorial HLS + IR versus respective controls; however, the testes HLS + IR group displayed additive detrimental effects on testicular weight, relative to individual groups, consistent with prior literature on organ size changes from HLS and/or IR exposures29–31. To assess the effects of these experimental conditions on skeletal muscles, muscles were dissected post-trial and the level of atrophy was queried (Fig. 2b). We found little difference in tibialis anterior weights from mice that underwent HLS, and quadriceps weights were variable, compared to respective controls (Figs. 2b–d). However, gastrocnemius muscles did exhibit a significant muscle atrophy in HLS and HLS + IR groups (Fig. 2b, 2e; p = 0.0490, p = 0.0138, respectively), leading us to focus on this muscle for the duration of the study. To confirm that gastrocnemius weight reductions affected muscle fibers, muscles were cryosectioned and stained with fluorescently-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which labels extracellular matrix regions33. We observed significantly smaller fiber sizes in both HLS and HLS + IR groups, relative to control and IR groups (Fig. 2f, g; p < 0.0001, p = 0.0399, respectively), further validating the muscle atrophy effect. In aggregate, these data unequivocally demonstrate a positive correlation between HLS and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy that agrees with the muscle wasting seen in previous HLS models27 and which mimics that described in astronauts during spaceflights34. Telomere length dynamics in spaceflight mimicked muscles In the Twins Study, Garrett-Bakelman et al. demonstrated a significant lengthening of telomeres in circulating blood cells (T cells) in the astronaut twin while in space25. However, telomere lengths in muscle cells were not measured. Using a HLS + IR spaceflight-mimicking system, we wished to query the effects of telomere length on several skeletal muscle-resident cell types. First, we performed CRYO MuQ-FISH staining of telomeres on gastrocnemius cryosections35. With this method, relative telomere length was determined by intensity measurements of a fluorescently labeled telomeric peptide nucleic acid probe, normalized to the fluorescence intensity staining of the entire nucleus by DAPI staining. Cells of interest were identified by additional immunostaining to mark desired cells and/or the cellular positions within the muscle. We first queried telomere length in MuSCs, defined as VCAM+ cells that appear in the satellite cell position (Fig. 3a). Quantification of telomere length revealed no changes between control, HLS, or IR MuSCs (Fig. 3b). However, when HLS + IR MuSC telomeres were assessed, we found significant telomere lengthening, as compared to all other groups (Fig. 3b, p < 0.0001). To evaluate the cellular consequences of these alterations, we evaluated MuSC populations and properties. We first assessed whether there were changes in MuSC numbers in atrophied muscles, as had been suggested previously12. Gastrocnemius cryosections were stained with the MuSC marker, Pax78, and total number of positively stained cells per unit area was queried. We found no changes in MuSC numbers between control vs IR, and control vs HLS + IR treated groups, while a significant increase in MuSC numbers was observed in the control vs HLS only group (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b; p < 0.0001). While these findings are interesting and unexpected, they did not correlate with the observed changes in telomere length of the HLS + IR group. To exclude other cellular defects associated with telomere length17,36, we also investigated whether MuSCs were undergoing senescence in response to our experimental manipulations. To interrogate the level of senescence in skeletal muscles in our study, gastrocnemius cryosections were stained for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. We found no correlation between positively stained regions and cells within the satellite cell position (Supplementary Fig. 3). These findings make senescence unlikely as an influencing factor of telomere length modulation in HLS + IR MuSCs. Fig. 3. Telomere length assessments in gastrocnemius myogenic cells.

Scale bar: 10 μm. b Quantification of telomere length in MuSC populations of gastrocnemius muscles from control, HLS, IR, and HLS + IR mice. Telomere length was calculated as the total telomere signal intensities divided by the intensity of DAPI, to account for cell cycle positioning. c Myonuclei telomere length evaluation in gastrocnemius muscles. Three mice per experimental group were analyzed. Violin plots in this figure are depicting median with 25th and 75th quartiles. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means. Adjusted p values are displayed.It is known that skeletal muscle mass change during unloading is associated with altered myonuclei37. Therefore, we next evaluated whether telomere lengthening in HLS + IR gastrocnemius muscles was specific to only MuSCs or whether additional myogenic nuclei also exhibited this phenomenon. To this end, myonuclei, which were defined as localizing within muscle fibers and staining negative for the stem cell marker VCAM38, were examined for telomere length changes. Similar to what was found for MuSCs, myonuclei also displayed increased telomere length in HLS + IR gastrocnemius muscles, when compared with control, HLS, or IR gastrocnemius myofiber myonuclei (Fig. 3c; p < 0.0001). These data demonstrate that combinational HLS + IR of rodents on the ground affects gastrocnemius myogenic cell telomere length. Since mechanical forces, including changes in gravity, have been shown to affect endothelial cells39, we subsequently assessed whether telomere length increases in HLS + IR mice were also observed in endothelial cells residing in the gastrocnemius muscle of hindlimb unloaded mice with and without radiation exposure. CRYO MuQ-FISH was performed using the CD31+ (also known as PECAM-1) marker, previously shown to accurately label endothelial cells40. We observed telomere length dynamics to be quite variable between experimental groups in endothelial cells (Fig. 4a, b), demonstrating that effects of HLS + IR were most pronounced and reproducible in cells deriving from a myogenic lineage.

Open in a new tab a Representative image of endothelial cell (CD31 + ; green), telomere staining (PNA probe; red), and nuclei (DAPI; blue).

Violin plots are depicting median with 25th and 75th quartiles. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means. Adjusted p values are displayed.Altogether, these results demonstrated that telomere length is increasing synergistically in response to low gravity and irradiation only in muscle cells (MuSCs and myonuclei) but not in endothelial cells within skeletal muscles. Effects of muscle reloading on muscle telomere length In the NASA Twins Study, it was shown that while spaceflight caused telomere lengthening in some peripheral blood cell populations, return to earth caused rapid telomere shortening within 48 hours, and a return to near baseline levels within months25. Since our data demonstrated telomere lengthening in HLS + IR MuSCs, we next sought to determine whether telomere length in these cells also shortened following a recovery period, where mice were returned to conventional mobility. To assess this possibility, HLS + IR mice were allowed to recover for 2 weeks, with unrestricted movement and normal muscle loading. For this arm of the study, control, HLS + IR, and recovery groups were compared (Fig. 5a). First, we assessed normalized organ weights and found no significant changes to normalized spleen weights (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and kidney weights (Supplementary Fig. 4b) between the groups. Interestingly, testes weights also trended higher in recovered animals, but they remained significantly smaller when compared to control weights (Supplementary Fig. 4c; p < 0.0001). Together, these data confirm that the recovery did not interfere with general organ mass. In assessing the effects of recovery on skeletal muscles, we observed that gastrocnemius muscles of recovered mice were larger than HLS + IR mice and were of similar size to controls (Fig. 5b; p = 0.9927), demonstrating that 2 weeks post-unloading is sufficient to regain normal skeletal muscle size. To evaluate telomere length alterations in the recovered muscles, we performed CRYO MuQ-FISH in the gastrocnemius-derived MuSC populations and myonuclei between the experimental groups. Surprisingly, we did not observe telomere shortening in the recovery MuSCs, but instead they retained elongated telomere length and continued to increase even further, relative to the HLS + IR group (Fig. 5c; p = 0.0186). Similarly, telomere length in myonuclei also remained elongated following recovery (Fig. 5d), which also trended higher but was not significantly different compared with the HLS + IR group (p = 0.4288). To further delineate whether there were differential telomere length changes in muscle cell populations, which may have been buried by the averaging of telomere length analysis, we plotted this dataset as a distribution on a per cell basis (Supplementary Fig. 5). These data show, that unlike what was reported for T cells in the Twins Study, where a proportion of the return to Earth cells exhibited population of critically shortened telomeres25, we found few MuSCs with very short telomeres and many more MuSCs with long telomeres. The telomere length distribution of muscle cells is somewhat different from the distributions reported in a follow-up study of blood cells in populations of short and long telomeres26,41, suggesting that different cell types might have different mechanisms of managing telomere length under spaceflight or spaceflight-mimicking conditions. In aggregate, these data demonstrate that hindlimb reloading for the indicated recovery period was not sufficient to shorten telomere length to control levels. Fig. 5.

Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means. Adjusted p values are displayed. Telomere lengthening mechanisms in radiation-exposed unloaded muscles The most common mechanism of telomere elongation is through the action of the enzyme telomerase42. To query the role of telomerase in the observed telomere lengthening of HLS + IR gastrocnemius muscle cells, we first assayed for its expression. Tert, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, was undetectable in skeletal muscles from control, HLS + IR, or recovery groups by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Similarly, expression of TERT was absent at the protein level, by immunohistochemistry of cryosections (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Because telomerase expression in muscles may be transient and/or only expressed in a small population of cells, we interrogated telomerase activity by a telomerase repeated amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. We found low telomerase activity in experimental gastrocnemius muscles (Fig. 6a), with no significant changes between control muscles and HLS + IR (p = 0.3684), control and recovery (p = 0.9720), or between HLS + IR and recovery groups (p = 0.2812; Fig. 6b). Our findings are in agreement with a prior study that showed telomerase activity is lost in differentiated skeletal muscle cells43, and further suggest that telomerase might not have a substantial role in telomere elongation in this system. Fig. 6. Interrogation of telomere lengthening mechanisms in hindlimb unloading and recovery. Open in a new tab a TRAP assay to assess telomerase activity in control, HLS + IR, and recovery skeletal muscle lysates. RNase treatment served as a negative control and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lysate served as a positive control.

Gapdh served as a housekeeping gene for normalization. At least three mice were examined per group. Displayed is mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means. Adjusted p values are displayed.Since the observed telomere lengthening in muscles could not be explained by telomerase activity, we sought to identify other mechanisms by which telomere lengthening could be attributed. Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a recombination-based telomere maintenance mechanism utilized by 10–15% of human cancers44. It has been previously reported that the DNA damage responding proteins, ATRX and DAXX, must be downregulated for ALT to occur45–48. To this end, we quantified the expression of these genes in control, HLS + IR, and recovery muscles. Interestingly, we observed significant downregulation of both Atrx and Daxx transcripts in HLS + IR muscles, relative control (p = 0.0005, p = 0.0009, respectively; Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that ALT-related pathways are engaged in this model. When recovery groups were examined, both Atrx and Daxx were still downregulated, although they did trend higher in both cases, relative to HLS + IR groups (p = 0.5410, p = 0.4166, respectively; Fig. 6c, d). Taken together, these data raise the possibility of ALT-related mechanisms being employed in the observed telomere lengthening in irradiated, unloaded muscles, as well as during reloading.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Astronauts experience adverse health effects on long-duration missions, including headaches, dizziness, congestion, changes in blood cells, and fatigue, as well as severe bone and muscle loss49. A better understanding of the causes of such impediments to explorer health in an earthbound model could serve beneficial effects in the development of additional countermeasures or prophylactic treatments meant to reduce physical health burdens. Recently, a comprehensive NASA study, also commonly referred to as the Twins Study, investigated and compared a multitude of metrics, including physical changes, of an earthbound monozygotic twin astronaut, to his brother, experiencing spaceflight25. One reported aspect of this study was an observed effect of telomere lengthening in peripheral blood T cells during spaceflight, which was absent in the grounded twin25. Outside of space, telomere length changes have been reported in degenerative diseases, which often coincide with tissue atrophy50, including skeletal muscle18,19,51,52. However, telomere length alterations in skeletal muscle cells, both from mice18 and humans53,54, are not correlated with the effects of aging, where sarcopenia, a muscle wasting process, is a hallmark55. Although muscle deterioration is a serious problem in astronauts’ health, the effect of gravity changes on telomeres of muscle cells has not been studied. In addition, the impact of the effects of radiation on telomere length are still inconclusive. A study of Chernobyl radiation cleanup workers demonstrated that occupational exposure to ionizing radiation led to telomere lengthening in these workers in peripheral blood leukocytes56. Similar effects were reported for atomic bomb survivors, but only those who were exposed to lower doses of radiation, as higher dose radiation exposure led to telomere attrition in peripheral blood T cells57. However, studies on telomere length following radiation exposure, specifically focusing on the muscle compartment, are nonexistent. Most importantly, the combined effect of weightlessness-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and cosmic radiation exposure reported during spaceflight58 led us to query whether these factors can contribute to changes in telomere dynamics in myogenic cells in a ground-based mouse model. HLS in rodents is a common model used to study the effects of ground-based muscle atrophy, through mechanical unloading and skeletal muscle disuse59. Using this HLS strategy in mice, we observed ~20% reductions in gastrocnemius muscle, similar to what has been previously reported59. Despite this loss of muscle mass, no changes in telomere length in the HLS model alone were evident, suggesting that simulated weightless conditions alone are not sufficient to modify telomere length. To mimic cosmic radiation exposure in spaceflights, we exposed mice to whole-body ionizing radiation by itself or utilized a combined approach of HLS and irradiation. Under these conditions, we found telomere lengthening only in myogenic cell types in the HLS + IR group but IR exposure alone had minimal impact on telomeres. Intriguingly, endothelial cells present in the affected muscles do not exhibit significant telomere length changes in either group, suggesting that telomeres within skeletal muscle cells are more susceptible to telomere length changes in our experimental system. Overall, the telomeres in combined radiation exposure and simulated microgravity conditions demonstrated a synergistic telomere lengthening effect when applied together, specifically in myogenic cells but not in other cells with the muscle architecture. Although many detrimental health effects are associated with telomere shortening60,61, a growing body of evidence suggests that very long telomeres may be problematic in human cells, as these telomeres could develop instabilities and telomeric fragility62, supporting the notion that tight control of telomere length homeostasis is essential. In line with this statement, in the Twins Study, the return to ground astronaut demonstrated a rapid shortening of telomere length, within 48 h after landing, to levels below earthbound twin, and telomere length extended but still remained shorter than the earthbound twin, even after 9 months26. Similar findings were found in other astronaut studies as well26,41. To query whether telomere shortening occurred within skeletal muscle cells of our experimental design, we implemented a 2-week recovery period, where mechanical loading of hindlimb muscles was reestablished. The longer 2-week endpoint compared to the initial 48 h used in the Twins Study was also chosen due to the fact that skeletal muscles cannot significantly recover from atrophy conditions following 48 h of mechanical loading63. In contrast to the overall telomere shortening of T cells in astronaut studies26, we found that the telomere length of skeletal muscle cells failed to return to baseline levels, despite the recovery of muscle mass. The most common mechanism of telomere elongation is through the action of the enzyme telomerase42. A role for telomerase in spaceflight-induced telomere elongation has been suggested for peripheral T cells26. However, telomerase activity measurements in astronaut studies could not be measured midflight, as the activity of TERT in tissue samples was “lost in space”, likely hampered by the harsh conditions the samples experienced before returning to Earth25,26,41. In the mouse study presented here, TERT expression in skeletal muscles was low and coincided with low telomerase activity in our experimental groups. These findings are in agreement with a prior report that showed telomerase activity is lost in differentiated skeletal muscle cells43 and suggest that telomerase has minimal role in telomere elongation in this experimental paradigm. However, it cannot be ruled out that transient telomerase activity in small proportions of myogenic cells contributes to our observed telomere-lengthening phenotype. Our investigation into additional modes of telomere lengthening uncovered preliminary evidence of an alternative lengthening (ALT) mechanism engagement. ALT was originally discovered in immortalized cell lines and subsequently shown to occur in some human tumors64,65 While evidence is mounting that ALT can be regulated by environmental and genetic factors in rapidly proliferating tumor cells44, its modulation and engagement in quiescent non-cancerous cells has not been explored, particularly while maintaining tissue structure. In quiescent skeletal muscle myogenic cells, we found that there is a substantial downregulation of the chromatin remodeler Atrx and the histone chaperone Daxx in both the HLS + IR and the recovery muscles compared to controls. The biological underpinning of this downregulation in muscles remains unknown. Observed telomere lengthening, in conjunction with low telomerase activity and reduction of Atrx and Daxx expression, are suggestive of the engagement ALT-type mechanisms. In support of our findings, recent evidence has shown telomere lengthening in the blood cells of Mount Everest climbers during different points of peak ascent. Based on gene expression analyses, TERT was downregulated and RAD50 was upregulated, while ALT and telomere maintenance via recombination pathways were enriched as the climbers progressed upwards41. These high-altitude studies, in which radiation exposure is higher than sea level, add weight to the validity of our findings of ALT-related pathway engagement over a relatively short time frame. A conundrum of our findings relates to the fact that cells of undamaged adult skeletal muscles are quiescent, including the myogenic cells of our study. Since ALT utilizes some of the same players of homologous recombinational (HR) repair66, a DNA double-strand break repair mechanism that is most active during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle67, our findings are unexpected. However, there is substantial evidence that HR can occur in the G1 phase of the cell cycle68 and in postmitotic neurons69. In addition, HR in general occurs at similar frequencies in ALT proficient and ALT-deficient human cells70, which adds an additional level of complexity to the understanding of ALT processes. Thus, it is therefore possible that telomerase-independent lengthening may be occurring in our experimental system, and that reduced expression of Atrx and Daxx supports the plausibility of a mechanism with features of ALT contributing to our observations. Until more details emerge on how molecular signatures associated with ALT are governed in nondividing, non-cancerous tissues, the specific mechanisms controlling telomere lengthening in a cell type-specific manner in our experimental design, or in the environment of space, remain elusive. Overall, this study examined the relationship between skeletal muscle cells and telomere length dynamics following hindlimb suspension and irradiation. While these findings are not extendable to post-flight measurements of astronauts, the experimental design applied here can be of use for preassessments of space-determined factors that modulate telomere dynamics and skeletal muscle functionality. One limitation of our study is that we only use males. Recent studies have demonstrated no sex difference in adult telomere length in vertebrates71, thus including female mice in our study is unlikely to change the interpretation of the mouse results. Yet, studies in humans have revealed differences in telomere length between sexes, depending on the age examined and the methodology used72–74. Thus, subsequent studies should consider telomere differences between sexes, especially given the rise in the number of female astronauts participating in space missions, and other reported differences in additional metrics between the sexes in other spaceflight studies75,76. In any event, the data presented herein demonstrate that a ground-based model may be a useful starting point in elucidating the mechanisms governing telomere elongation dynamics in muscles of astronauts during spaceflight. Another limitation of this study is the type and dose/dose-rate of radiation exposure and how it relates to astronauts’ occupational exposure. The space radiation environment is comprised of high energy protons and galactic cosmic radiation, including but not limited to electrons, protons, and heavier densely ionizing charged particles77. Additionally, radiation sources in space are not constant, and the absorbed dose varies between mice and humans varies, at least for proton radiation78. Our experimental outcome in ground-based rodent muscle utilized a single exposure to a single ionizing radiation source, as it was not feasible to reload rodent hindlimbs for possible successive radiation exposures. To ensure radiation exposures were sufficient during our experimental window, we utilized a radiation dose of 2 Gy, which at current standards, is higher than NASA occupational exposures79. A major difference between mice and humans is telomere length, with many mouse strains having ∼8-fold longer telomeres than humans80, and they exhibit much faster rates of telomere shortening than humans81. This greater telomere reservoir could endow muscle cells in in-bred strains of laboratory mice with a protective effect in spaceflight, but it is equally as possible that telomere changes are more easily studied in rodent models because of their differences compared with humans. Skeletal muscle cell telomere length was not examined in astronaut studies25,26,65, and muscle biopsies of astronauts in space are rare, as the risk of complications to their health or possibly jeopardizing the missions is too great. Thus, future investigations using animal models in spaceflight would presumably mimic the muscle defects seen in astronauts and would be invaluable. Given the differences in telomere length between typically used research mouse strains and humans, future studies could be further strengthened by utilizing more humanized mice in regard to telomere length, such as the CAST/Ei J strain82. After being exposed to the same weightless and cosmic radiation conditions as humans, these mice may be useful to further investigate behavior and function of different cell types in relation to their telomere changes. In conclusion, the data presented here lay a foundation for future studies to explore telomere length regulation in skeletal muscles during spaceflight conditions, to investigate whether ALT drivers exert cell type-specific influences on telomere length, and how long these changes last and how they contribute to health risks in astronauts after they return to Earth. Identifying the cellular and molecular muscle changes associated with telomere lengthening, as well as how ALT-related processes affect spaceflight-exposed cells, may yield important clues for future prophylactic therapy of astronauts’ muscles, both during space flights and upon return to Earth.",

Copyright notice ID: 10504369 PMID: 37714858 Abstract Astronauts are exposed to harsh conditions, including cosmic radiation and microgravity. Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth. Subject terms: Stem cells, Cell biologyIntroduction In the vacuum of space, astronauts are continuously bombarded by high energy cosmic radiation and must perform missions in microgravity1. A better understanding of the consequences of these two factors on body function and physiology are crucial for the planning of safe and successful long-duration future missions. A major detriment experienced by astronauts in flight is muscle atrophy, where a 1 month spaceflight can reduce muscle mass by 20% and muscle strength by 30%2. Even with currently implemented spaceflight countermeasures, involving rigorous exercise, the deleterious physiological effects of spaceflight in muscle atrophy and weakness induction are not completely abrogated3–5. In addition to microgravity, astronaut exposure to cosmic radiation can have effects on body systems that are still being elucidated. It is well established that the skeletal muscle atrophy due to exposure to both microgravity and radiation is problematic because of its rapid onset and severity6. Muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also called satellite cells, are necessary for muscle formation in embryogenesis and for muscle growth during childhood and adolescence7,8. In healthy adults, MuSCs from undamaged muscles remain quiescent. Following injury, such as that arising from strenuous exercise, MuSCs become activated, proliferate, and differentiate in a series of coordinated steps, to properly repair muscle damage9. In the context of muscle atrophy, MuSC properties are less clear. Atrophy caused by cancer cachexia is known to activate specific signaling pathways in skeletal muscles related to inflammation, protein synthesis, and autophagy10. In satellite cells, atrophy-induced signaling exerts effects on MuSC proliferative potential and differentiation capacities11,12. In terms of effects of radiation exposure to MuSCs, limited data are available. Exposure of cultured human muscle progenitor cells to ionizing radiation has negative effects on proliferative capacity and alters inflammatory signaling13. Studies using chronic, lower dose, whole-body irradiation of mice resulted in reduced MuSC numbers, reduced proliferative capacity, and increased quiescence, but it had little effect on differentiative capacity14. Higher dose leg-specific radiation exposures have demonstrated similar results on reduced proliferative capacities of juvenile mice; however, myofiber sizes and MuSC differentiation effects were present as well15, suggesting that level and duration of exposure could have different effects on MuSCs, depending on these factors. The length of telomeres is an important parameter of tissue proliferative potential16. Telomeres are repetitive sequences located at the ends of chromosomes, which can function as cellular proliferation clocks17. Telomere attrition leads to loss of cellular functionality and can lead to stem cell exhaustion in diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy18,19. Shortened telomeres are also correlated with atrophy of many organ compartments, including brain20, spleen, small intestine, and reproductive system, among others21. Additionally, it has been reported that telomeres in cultured mouse and human fibroblasts appear more susceptible than other regions of the genome to DNA damage, and they exhibit a persistent DNA damage response following X-ray irradiation22. Increased DNA damage found at telomeres has been associated with telomere attrition and/or uncapping and cellular senescence, leading to loss of proper cellular functionality23,24. Recently, the effects of spaceflight have been meticulously investigated in the NASA Twins Study, where effects of preflight, inflight, and postflight conditions on a monozygotic twin were measured by multiple metrics and compared with the grounded twin brother25. That study revealed telomere lengthening in T cells of the inflight astronaut, which rapidly shortened postflight25. Another study investigating different astronaut flight conditions found similar results26. However, despite the importance of maintaining skeletal muscles during spaceflight, telomere length metrics in astronaut muscles have not been assessed. The goal of this study was to measure telomere length in resident skeletal muscle cells of grounded, wild-type mice experiencing spaceflight-like conditions, using a whole-body irradiation (IR) and hindlimb suspension (HLS)/mechanical unloading approach. We found that a combination of IR and HLS resulted in telomere elongation, specifically in myogenic cell populations, which did not recover upon a short duration reloading of hindlimbs.Results Effects of HLS and IR exposure on skeletal muscle properties To address the effects of muscle atrophy and/or irradiation (IR) on skeletal muscles, we utilized the widely accepted hindlimb suspension (HLS) ground-based model27, in combination with or in the absence of whole-body ionizing radiation exposure. In our experimental design, mice were divided into four different cohorts: control (without IR exposure, without hindlimb suspension (HLS)), HLS only (no IR), IR only (no HLS), and combined (HLS + IR); (Fig. 1). More specifically, wildtype mice were pre-exposed to 2 Gy whole-body irradiation or sham irradiated and further divided into groups experiencing HLS or not. Following a 3-week time course, mice were sacrificed, and various tissue weight metrics were obtained. We found that at the study endpoint, mouse whole-body weights were similar for all groups (Fig. 2a), demonstrating that HLS did not detrimentally affect mouse appetite. This finding is especially important, since hindlimb unloading has been used as method to study behavioral despair and depression, and appetite changes, if any, could have influenced our study results28.

Adjusted p values are displayed.We next determined the effects of our experimental design on internal organs. We found IR exposure alone had no effects on kidney or spleen weights, but it did cause significant (p < 0.0001) reductions in testes weights, when compared to sham/control mice (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). These findings are in agreement with previous studies in mice and humans exposed to IR29,30. HLS also had deleterious effects on testes gross size and normalized weight (Supplementary Fig. 1a, d; p < 0.0001), consistent with a previous report31. Additionally, kidney weights in HLS and HLS + IR groups were slightly increased compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. 1a, c; p = 0.0452, 0.0705, respectively), a finding that was similarly reported in a rat HLS model32. No differences were found in spleen and kidney weights in combinatorial HLS + IR versus respective controls; however, the testes HLS + IR group displayed additive detrimental effects on testicular weight, relative to individual groups, consistent with prior literature on organ size changes from HLS and/or IR exposures29–31. To assess the effects of these experimental conditions on skeletal muscles, muscles were dissected post-trial and the level of atrophy was queried (Fig. 2b). We found little difference in tibialis anterior weights from mice that underwent HLS, and quadriceps weights were variable, compared to respective controls (Figs. 2b–d). However, gastrocnemius muscles did exhibit a significant muscle atrophy in HLS and HLS + IR groups (Fig. 2b, 2e; p = 0.0490, p = 0.0138, respectively), leading us to focus on this muscle for the duration of the study. To confirm that gastrocnemius weight reductions affected muscle fibers, muscles were cryosectioned and stained with fluorescently-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which labels extracellular matrix regions33. We observed significantly smaller fiber sizes in both HLS and HLS + IR groups, relative to control and IR groups (Fig. 2f, g; p < 0.0001, p = 0.0399, respectively), further validating the muscle atrophy effect. In aggregate, these data unequivocally demonstrate a positive correlation between HLS and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy that agrees with the muscle wasting seen in previous HLS models27 and which mimics that described in astronauts during spaceflights34.Telomere length dynamics in spaceflight mimicked muscles In the Twins Study, Garrett-Bakelman et al. demonstrated a significant lengthening of telomeres in circulating blood cells (T cells) in the astronaut twin while in space25. However, telomere lengths in muscle cells were not measured. Using a HLS + IR spaceflight-mimicking system, we wished to query the effects of telomere length on several skeletal muscle-resident cell types. First, we performed CRYO MuQ-FISH staining of telomeres on gastrocnemius cryosections35. With this method, relative telomere length was determined by intensity measurements of a fluorescently labeled telomeric peptide nucleic acid probe, normalized to the fluorescence intensity staining of the entire nucleus by DAPI staining. Cells of interest were identified by additional immunostaining to mark desired cells and/or the cellular positions within the muscle. We first queried telomere length in MuSCs, defined as VCAM+ cells that appear in the satellite cell position (Fig. 3a). Quantification of telomere length revealed no changes between control, HLS, or IR MuSCs (Fig. 3b). However, when HLS + IR MuSC telomeres were assessed, we found significant telomere lengthening, as compared to all other groups (Fig. 3b, p < 0.0001). To evaluate the cellular consequences of these alterations, we evaluated MuSC populations and properties. We first assessed whether there were changes in MuSC numbers in atrophied muscles, as had been suggested previously12. Gastrocnemius cryosections were stained with the MuSC marker, Pax78, and total number of positively stained cells per unit area was queried. We found no changes in MuSC numbers between control vs IR, and control vs HLS + IR treated groups, while a significant increase in MuSC numbers was observed in the control vs HLS only group (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b; p < 0.0001). While these findings are interesting and unexpected, they did not correlate with the observed changes in telomere length of the HLS + IR group. To exclude other cellular defects associated with telomere length17,36, we also investigated whether MuSCs were undergoing senescence in response to our experimental manipulations. To interrogate the level of senescence in skeletal muscles in our study, gastrocnemius cryosections were stained for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. We found no correlation between positively stained regions and cells within the satellite cell position (Supplementary Fig. 3). These findings make senescence unlikely as an influencing factor of telomere length modulation in HLS + IR MuSCs. Fig. 3. Telomere length assessments in gastrocnemius myogenic cells. Open in a new tab a Representative images of MuSCs (VCAM + , in the satellite cell position; green), telomere staining (PNA probe; red) and nuclear staining (DAPI; blue).

Scale bar: 10 μm. b Quantification of telomere length in MuSC populations of gastrocnemius muscles from control, HLS, IR, and HLS + IR mice. Telomere length was calculated as the total telomere signal intensities divided by the intensity of DAPI, to account for cell cycle positioning. c Myonuclei telomere length evaluation in gastrocnemius muscles. Three mice per experimental group were analyzed. Violin plots in this figure are depicting median with 25th and 75th quartiles. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means. Adjusted p values are displayed.It is known that skeletal muscle mass change during unloading is associated with altered myonuclei37. Therefore, we next evaluated whether telomere lengthening in HLS + IR gastrocnemius muscles was specific to only MuSCs or whether additional myogenic nuclei also exhibited this phenomenon. To this end, myonuclei, which were defined as localizing within muscle fibers and staining negative for the stem cell marker VCAM38, were examined for telomere length changes. Similar to what was found for MuSCs, myonuclei also displayed increased telomere length in HLS + IR gastrocnemius muscles, when compared with control, HLS, or IR gastrocnemius myofiber myonuclei (Fig. 3c; p < 0.0001). These data demonstrate that combinational HLS + IR of rodents on the ground affects gastrocnemius myogenic cell telomere length. Since mechanical forces, including changes in gravity, have been shown to affect endothelial cells39, we subsequently assessed whether telomere length increases in HLS + IR mice were also observed in endothelial cells residing in the gastrocnemius muscle of hindlimb unloaded mice with and without radiation exposure. CRYO MuQ-FISH was performed using the CD31+ (also known as PECAM-1) marker, previously shown to accurately label endothelial cells40. We observed telomere length dynamics to be quite variable between experimental groups in endothelial cells (Fig. 4a, b), demonstrating that effects of HLS + IR were most pronounced and reproducible in cells deriving from a myogenic lineage. Fig. 4. Telomere length quantification of non-myogenic muscle-resident cells. Open in a new tab a Representative image of endothelial cell (CD31 + ; green), telomere staining (PNA probe; red), and nuclei (DAPI; blue). Scale bar: 10 μm. b Calculated telomere length of endothelial cells in gastrocnemius muscles from control, HLS, IR, and HLS + IR mice. Three mice per experimental group were analyzed. Violin plots are depicting median with 25th and 75th quartiles. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means. Adjusted p values are displayed.Altogether, these results demonstrated that telomere length is increasing synergistically in response to low gravity and irradiation only in muscle cells (MuSCs and myonuclei) but not in endothelial cells within skeletal muscles.Effects of muscle reloading on muscle telomere length In the NASA Twins Study, it was shown that while spaceflight caused telomere lengthening in some peripheral blood cell populations, return to earth caused rapid telomere shortening within 48 hours, and a return to near baseline levels within months25. Since our data demonstrated telomere lengthening in HLS + IR MuSCs, we next sought to determine whether telomere length in these cells also shortened following a recovery period, where mice were returned to conventional mobility. To assess this possibility, HLS + IR mice were allowed to recover for 2 weeks, with unrestricted movement and normal muscle loading. For this arm of the study, control, HLS + IR, and recovery groups were compared (Fig. 5a). First, we assessed normalized organ weights and found no significant changes to normalized spleen weights (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and kidney weights (Supplementary Fig. 4b) between the groups. Interestingly, testes weights also trended higher in recovered animals, but they remained significantly smaller when compared to control weights (Supplementary Fig. 4c; p < 0.0001). Together, these data confirm that the recovery did not interfere with general organ mass. In assessing the effects of recovery on skeletal muscles, we observed that gastrocnemius muscles of recovered mice were larger than HLS + IR mice and were of similar size to controls (Fig. 5b; p = 0.9927), demonstrating that 2 weeks post-unloading is sufficient to regain normal skeletal muscle size. To evaluate telomere length alterations in the recovered muscles, we performed CRYO MuQ-FISH in the gastrocnemius-derived MuSC populations and myonuclei between the experimental groups. Surprisingly, we did not observe telomere shortening in the recovery MuSCs, but instead they retained elongated telomere length and continued to increase even further, relative to the HLS + IR group (Fig. 5c; p = 0.0186). Similarly, telomere length in myonuclei also remained elongated following recovery (Fig. 5d), which also trended higher but was not significantly different compared with the HLS + IR group (p = 0.4288). To further delineate whether there were differential telomere length changes in muscle cell populations, which may have been buried by the averaging of telomere length analysis, we plotted this dataset as a distribution on a per cell basis (Supplementary Fig. 5). These data show, that unlike what was reported for T cells in the Twins Study, where a proportion of the return to Earth cells exhibited population of critically shortened telomeres25, we found few MuSCs with very short telomeres and many more MuSCs with long telomeres. The telomere length distribution of muscle cells is somewhat different from the distributions reported in a follow-up study of blood cells in populations of short and long telomeres26,41, suggesting that different cell types might have different mechanisms of managing telomere length under spaceflight or spaceflight-mimicking conditions. In aggregate, these data demonstrate that hindlimb reloading for the indicated recovery period was not sufficient to shorten telomere length to control levels. Fig. 5.

At least 3 mice per condition were analyzed. Represented are mean ± SEM for column graphs and median with 25th and 75th quartiles marked for violin plots. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means. Adjusted p values are displayed.Telomere lengthening mechanisms in radiation-exposed unloaded muscles The most common mechanism of telomere elongation is through the action of the enzyme telomerase42. To query the role of telomerase in the observed telomere lengthening of HLS + IR gastrocnemius muscle cells, we first assayed for its expression. Tert, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, was undetectable in skeletal muscles from control, HLS + IR, or recovery groups by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Similarly, expression of TERT was absent at the protein level, by immunohistochemistry of cryosections (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Because telomerase expression in muscles may be transient and/or only expressed in a small population of cells, we interrogated telomerase activity by a telomerase repeated amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. We found low telomerase activity in experimental gastrocnemius muscles (Fig. 6a), with no significant changes between control muscles and HLS + IR (p = 0.3684), control and recovery (p = 0.9720), or between HLS + IR and recovery groups (p = 0.2812; Fig. 6b). Our findings are in agreement with a prior study that showed telomerase activity is lost in differentiated skeletal muscle cells43, and further suggest that telomerase might not have a substantial role in telomere elongation in this system. Fig. 6. Interrogation of telomere lengthening mechanisms in hindlimb unloading and recovery. Open in a new tab a TRAP assay to assess telomerase activity in control, HLS + IR, and recovery skeletal muscle lysates. RNase treatment served as a negative control and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lysate served as a positive control. Each lane is from one gastrocnemius muscle lysate per mouse, with three biological replicates per group. b Quantification of telomere elongation via telomerase from a. Displayed are mean ± SEM. c, d Quantitative real-time PCR of ALT pathway regulators Atrx and Daxx from gastrocnemius muscles of control, HLS + IR, and recovery groups. Gapdh served as a housekeeping gene for normalization. At least three mice were examined per group. Displayed is mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means. Adjusted p values are displayed.Since the observed telomere lengthening in muscles could not be explained by telomerase activity, we sought to identify other mechanisms by which telomere lengthening could be attributed. Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a recombination-based telomere maintenance mechanism utilized by 10–15% of human cancers44. It has been previously reported that the DNA damage responding proteins, ATRX and DAXX, must be downregulated for ALT to occur45–48. To this end, we quantified the expression of these genes in control, HLS + IR, and recovery muscles. Interestingly, we observed significant downregulation of both Atrx and Daxx transcripts in HLS + IR muscles, relative control (p = 0.0005, p = 0.0009, respectively; Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that ALT-related pathways are engaged in this model. When recovery groups were examined, both Atrx and Daxx were still downregulated, although they did trend higher in both cases, relative to HLS + IR groups (p = 0.5410, p = 0.4166, respectively; Fig. 6c, d). Taken together, these data raise the possibility of ALT-related mechanisms being employed in the observed telomere lengthening in irradiated, unloaded muscles, as well as during reloading.Discussion Astronauts experience adverse health effects on long-duration missions, including headaches, dizziness, congestion, changes in blood cells, and fatigue, as well as severe bone and muscle loss49. A better understanding of the causes of such impediments to explorer health in an earthbound model could serve beneficial effects in the development of additional countermeasures or prophylactic treatments meant to reduce physical health burdens. Recently, a comprehensive NASA study, also commonly referred to as the Twins Study, investigated and compared a multitude of metrics, including physical changes, of an earthbound monozygotic twin astronaut, to his brother, experiencing spaceflight25. One reported aspect of this study was an observed effect of telomere lengthening in peripheral blood T cells during spaceflight, which was absent in the grounded twin25. Outside of space, telomere length changes have been reported in degenerative diseases, which often coincide with tissue atrophy50, including skeletal muscle18,19,51,52. However, telomere length alterations in skeletal muscle cells, both from mice18 and humans53,54, are not correlated with the effects of aging, where sarcopenia, a muscle wasting process, is a hallmark55. Although muscle deterioration is a serious problem in astronauts’ health, the effect of gravity changes on telomeres of muscle cells has not been studied. In addition, the impact of the effects of radiation on telomere length are still inconclusive. A study of Chernobyl radiation cleanup workers demonstrated that occupational exposure to ionizing radiation led to telomere lengthening in these workers in peripheral blood leukocytes56. Similar effects were reported for atomic bomb survivors, but only those who were exposed to lower doses of radiation, as higher dose radiation exposure led to telomere attrition in peripheral blood T cells57. However, studies on telomere length following radiation exposure, specifically focusing on the muscle compartment, are nonexistent. Most importantly, the combined effect of weightlessness-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and cosmic radiation exposure reported during spaceflight58 led us to query whether these factors can contribute to changes in telomere dynamics in myogenic cells in a ground-based mouse model. HLS in rodents is a common model used to study the effects of ground-based muscle atrophy, through mechanical unloading and skeletal muscle disuse59. Using this HLS strategy in mice, we observed ~20% reductions in gastrocnemius muscle, similar to what has been previously reported59. Despite this loss of muscle mass, no changes in telomere length in the HLS model alone were evident, suggesting that simulated weightless conditions alone are not sufficient to modify telomere length. To mimic cosmic radiation exposure in spaceflights, we exposed mice to whole-body ionizing radiation by itself or utilized a combined approach of HLS and irradiation. Under these conditions, we found telomere lengthening only in myogenic cell types in the HLS + IR group but IR exposure alone had minimal impact on telomeres. Intriguingly, endothelial cells present in the affected muscles do not exhibit significant telomere length changes in either group, suggesting that telomeres within skeletal muscle cells are more susceptible to telomere length changes in our experimental system. Overall, the telomeres in combined radiation exposure and simulated microgravity conditions demonstrated a synergistic telomere lengthening effect when applied together, specifically in myogenic cells but not in other cells with the muscle architecture. Although many detrimental health effects are associated with telomere shortening60,61, a growing body of evidence suggests that very long telomeres may be problematic in human cells, as these telomeres could develop instabilities and telomeric fragility62, supporting the notion that tight control of telomere length homeostasis is essential. In line with this statement, in the Twins Study, the return to ground astronaut demonstrated a rapid shortening of telomere length, within 48 h after landing, to levels below earthbound twin, and telomere length extended but still remained shorter than the earthbound twin, even after 9 months26. Similar findings were found in other astronaut studies as well26,41. To query whether telomere shortening occurred within skeletal muscle cells of our experimental design, we implemented a 2-week recovery period, where mechanical loading of hindlimb muscles was reestablished. The longer 2-week endpoint compared to the initial 48 h used in the Twins Study was also chosen due to the fact that skeletal muscles cannot significantly recover from atrophy conditions following 48 h of mechanical loading63. In contrast to the overall telomere shortening of T cells in astronaut studies26, we found that the telomere length of skeletal muscle cells failed to return to baseline levels, despite the recovery of muscle mass. The most common mechanism of telomere elongation is through the action of the enzyme telomerase42. A role for telomerase in spaceflight-induced telomere elongation has been suggested for peripheral T cells26. However, telomerase activity measurements in astronaut studies could not be measured midflight, as the activity of TERT in tissue samples was “lost in space”, likely hampered by the harsh conditions the samples experienced before returning to Earth25,26,41. In the mouse study presented here, TERT expression in skeletal muscles was low and coincided with low telomerase activity in our experimental groups. These findings are in agreement with a prior report that showed telomerase activity is lost in differentiated skeletal muscle cells43 and suggest that telomerase has minimal role in telomere elongation in this experimental paradigm. However, it cannot be ruled out that transient telomerase activity in small proportions of myogenic cells contributes to our observed telomere-lengthening phenotype. Our investigation into additional modes of telomere lengthening uncovered preliminary evidence of an alternative lengthening (ALT) mechanism engagement. ALT was originally discovered in immortalized cell lines and subsequently shown to occur in some human tumors64,65 While evidence is mounting that ALT can be regulated by environmental and genetic factors in rapidly proliferating tumor cells44, its modulation and engagement in quiescent non-cancerous cells has not been explored, particularly while maintaining tissue structure. In quiescent skeletal muscle myogenic cells, we found that there is a substantial downregulation of the chromatin remodeler Atrx and the histone chaperone Daxx in both the HLS + IR and the recovery muscles compared to controls. The biological underpinning of this downregulation in muscles remains unknown. Observed telomere lengthening, in conjunction with low telomerase activity and reduction of Atrx and Daxx expression, are suggestive of the engagement ALT-type mechanisms. In support of our findings, recent evidence has shown telomere lengthening in the blood cells of Mount Everest climbers during different points of peak ascent. Based on gene expression analyses, TERT was downregulated and RAD50 was upregulated, while ALT and telomere maintenance via recombination pathways were enriched as the climbers progressed upwards41. These high-altitude studies, in which radiation exposure is higher than sea level, add weight to the validity of our findings of ALT-related pathway engagement over a relatively short time frame. A conundrum of our findings relates to the fact that cells of undamaged adult skeletal muscles are quiescent, including the myogenic cells of our study. Since ALT utilizes some of the same players of homologous recombinational (HR) repair66, a DNA double-strand break repair mechanism that is most active during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle67, our findings are unexpected. However, there is substantial evidence that HR can occur in the G1 phase of the cell cycle68 and in postmitotic neurons69. In addition, HR in general occurs at similar frequencies in ALT proficient and ALT-deficient human cells70, which adds an additional level of complexity to the understanding of ALT processes. Thus, it is therefore possible that telomerase-independent lengthening may be occurring in our experimental system, and that reduced expression of Atrx and Daxx supports the plausibility of a mechanism with features of ALT contributing to our observations. Until more details emerge on how molecular signatures associated with ALT are governed in nondividing, non-cancerous tissues, the specific mechanisms controlling telomere lengthening in a cell type-specific manner in our experimental design, or in the environment of space, remain elusive. Overall, this study examined the relationship between skeletal muscle cells and telomere length dynamics following hindlimb suspension and irradiation. While these findings are not extendable to post-flight measurements of astronauts, the experimental design applied here can be of use for preassessments of space-determined factors that modulate telomere dynamics and skeletal muscle functionality. One limitation of our study is that we only use males. Recent studies have demonstrated no sex difference in adult telomere length in vertebrates71, thus including female mice in our study is unlikely to change the interpretation of the mouse results. Yet, studies in humans have revealed differences in telomere length between sexes, depending on the age examined and the methodology used72–74. Thus, subsequent studies should consider telomere differences between sexes, especially given the rise in the number of female astronauts participating in space missions, and other reported differences in additional metrics between the sexes in other spaceflight studies75,76. In any event, the data presented herein demonstrate that a ground-based model may be a useful starting point in elucidating the mechanisms governing telomere elongation dynamics in muscles of astronauts during spaceflight. Another limitation of this study is the type and dose/dose-rate of radiation exposure and how it relates to astronauts’ occupational exposure. The space radiation environment is comprised of high energy protons and galactic cosmic radiation, including but not limited to electrons, protons, and heavier densely ionizing charged particles77. Additionally, radiation sources in space are not constant, and the absorbed dose varies between mice and humans varies, at least for proton radiation78. Our experimental outcome in ground-based rodent muscle utilized a single exposure to a single ionizing radiation source, as it was not feasible to reload rodent hindlimbs for possible successive radiation exposures. To ensure radiation exposures were sufficient during our experimental window, we utilized a radiation dose of 2 Gy, which at current standards, is higher than NASA occupational exposures79. A major difference between mice and humans is telomere length, with many mouse strains having ∼8-fold longer telomeres than humans80, and they exhibit much faster rates of telomere shortening than humans81. This greater telomere reservoir could endow muscle cells in in-bred strains of laboratory mice with a protective effect in spaceflight, but it is equally as possible that telomere changes are more easily studied in rodent models because of their differences compared with humans. Skeletal muscle cell telomere length was not examined in astronaut studies25,26,65, and muscle biopsies of astronauts in space are rare, as the risk of complications to their health or possibly jeopardizing the missions is too great. Thus, future investigations using animal models in spaceflight would presumably mimic the muscle defects seen in astronauts and would be invaluable. Given the differences in telomere length between typically used research mouse strains and humans, future studies could be further strengthened by utilizing more humanized mice in regard to telomere length, such as the CAST/Ei J strain82. After being exposed to the same weightless and cosmic radiation conditions as humans, these mice may be useful to further investigate behavior and function of different cell types in relation to their telomere changes. In conclusion, the data presented here lay a foundation for future studies to explore telomere length regulation in skeletal muscles during spaceflight conditions, to investigate whether ALT drivers exert cell type-specific influences on telomere length, and how long these changes last and how they contribute to health risks in astronauts after they return to Earth. Identifying the cellular and molecular muscle changes associated with telomere lengthening, as well as how ALT-related processes affect spaceflight-exposed cells, may yield important clues for future prophylactic therapy of astronauts’ muscles, both during space flights and upon return to Earth.Methods Mice Male C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (stock# 000664) and used between 2 and 4 months of age. Experimental procedures for this project were approved and overseen by the University of Pennsylvania IACUC committee (protocol #806800). Following receipt, mice were acclimated to University of Pennsylvania rodent housing for 1 week prior to commencing the experiments. All mice in this study were fed Dietgel boost food (ClearH2O) and provided hydrogel barrier hydration (ClearH2O) ad libitum (as the sole nutrition and hydration sources) for the duration of the experiment.Full body irradiation Cohorts of mice were irradiated with ionizing radiation from a 137Cs irradiator (Gammacell 40 exactor) at a dose-rate of 1.23 cGy/s. Room air was provided to the mice during the procedure via a vacuum pump. After 2 Gy exposure, mice were returned to conventional housing for 1-week, prior HLS.Hindlimb suspension Equipment used for hindlimb suspension can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with an isoflurane vaporizer (2.5% v/v isoflurane to oxygen), and mouse tails were wrapped with cloth surgical tape, beginning at the tail base. After wrapping ~half of the tail length, the tape was folded on itself to create a loop, and remaining tape was wrapped around the tail from the midpoint towards the tail base. Through this closed tape loop, plastic-coated wire was threaded and attached to a hanging apparatus. The hanging apparatus was placed in a rat cage with a wire mesh bottom. The hanging apparatus allows for movement of mice only through use of the forelimbs. Range of movement of HLS mice was approximately ½ of the rat cage surface area, but HLS mice were singly housed for the study. Mice were hung for a period of 3 weeks, with or without a 2-week recovery period where mice were placed in conventional housing.Tissue sample collection At the end point of the study, mice were humanely euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation. Organs of interest were collected by dissection and weighed. Tissue weights were normalized to endpoint mouse body weights. Gastrocnemius muscles were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo) for 2 h on a rocking platform at 4 °C. Muscles were then incubated overnight in 30% sucrose in water at 4 °C, prior to embedding in OCT (NEG-50; Epredia) and cryofreezing. Muscle cryosections were cut at 10 μm and placed on superfrost plus slides (Fisher). Slides were stored at −20 °C prior to staining.Muscle fiber cross-sectional area measurements Muscle cryosections were permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; GeminiBio) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; 1 μg/mL; Thermo) for one hour in the dark at room temperature, to outline muscle fibers. Slides were washed in PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI (Thermo). Slides were imaged on a Nikon Ni widefield microscope equipped with a Plan Fluor 10x/0.30 objective and Nikon DS-Qi1Mc 14-bit camera, and random fields per mouse were used for fiber area enumeration in Fiji.Muscle stem cell number quantification Muscle cryosections were permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS, and underwent heat-mediated antigen retrieval with EDTA buffer (1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 0.05% Tween 20). Slides were washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were stained with Pax7 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/100; Thermo #PA1–117) overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and stained with Alexa Fluor-647-conjugated Goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/300; Thermo) for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI (Thermo). Whole cryosections were imaged using an Axio Scan z1 slide scanner (Zeiss) and processed with Zen software. Two cryosections per mouse were used for quantification of the number of pax7 positive cells per 10μm section with Fiji.Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity assay Cryosections from gastrocnemius muscles or mouse kidney were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde (Electron microscopy sciences). Slides were incubated with PBS, pH 6.0 for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with X-gal staining solution (4 mM potassium ferricyanide, 4 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM magnesium chloride, 0.02% Igepal CA-630, and 400 μg/mL X-gal; all from Sigma) for 48 h at 37 °C. Slides were washed with PBS, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Slides were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with Fluromount G (SouthernBiotech). Slides were imaged on a Nikon-Ni widefield microscope using a Nikon DS-F12 color camera.Telomere length assessments Telomere length was measured using the CRYO MuQ-FISH protocol35. Briefly, muscle cryosections were permeabilized in 0.5% triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, and underwent heat-mediated antigen retrieval with TET buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20) for 10 minutes. Slides were washed in PBS and incubated with RNase A (100 μg/mL) for 20 minutes at 37 °C. Slides were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated TelC telomere probe (1/600; PNA bio) in hybridization buffer [15% ethylene carbonate (Sigma), 20% dextran sulfate (Sigma), 600 mM sodium chloride (Sigma), 1X antigen retrieval citrate buffer (Vector labs)]. Hybridization occurred by a denaturation step of 67 °C for 10 min and a hybridization step of 42 °C for 90 min. A glass coverslip was used to prevent evaporation. Slides were washed in buffers with decreasing salt concentration (2X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20, 1X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20, 0.5X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20, 0.25X SSC; 0.1% Tween-20) twice each solution for 5 min each before a final rinse in PBS. Slides were then blocked with 3% BSA/PBS/0.1% triton X-100 for 1 hour. MuSCs were labeled by VCAM1 staining (1/100 of 1 mg/mL stock; Thermo # PA5–47029), endothelial cells were marked by CD31biotin (1/100; Thermo #13–0311–82) antibody staining overnight at 4 °C. Alexa fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (1/300; Thermo # A11055), or Cy3-streptavidin (1/100; Thermo) were used to label the cells of interest. After washing with PBS, glass coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI (Thermo). To image telomeres, MuSCs (VCAM1+ in the satellite cell position), myonuclei (based on position within the myofibers), or endothelial cells (CD31 + ) were imaged with a Nikon Plan Apo 100x/1.45 oil objective on a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope, equipped with a DS-Q1MC monochrome camera. Z stacks of 1 μm thickness from each channel (telomere, DAPI, cell type) were taken to encompass the entirety of the telomere fields. Images were processed using the extended depth of focus algorithm in the accompanying Nikon elements microscope software. Images were exported as 16-bit monochrome tiffs and analyzed using the free analysis software, Telometer 3.0.6 (https://demarzolab.pathology.jhmi.edu/telometer/download.html). This software allows cells of interest to be analyzed for telomere signal intensities, and normalizes these intensities to that of DAPI, to account for differences in cell cycle position and has been previously validated for use in muscle.Quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted from whole gastrocnemius muscles with Trizol. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Protoscript II first strand cDNA synthesis kit. (NEB). Multiplexed quantitative real-time PCR was completed using either FAM-labeled Tert (ThermoFisher; gene assay id: Mm00436931_m1), Atrx (ThermoFisher; gene assay id: Mm00494196_m1), or Daxx (ThermoFisher; gene assay id: Mm00492089_m1), with VIC-labeled Gapdh (ThermoFisher 4352339e). Reactions were run on a Quantstudio 6 with accompanying software. Relative gene expression was determined by the ΔΔCT method, using Gapdh as a normalizing control.Immunohistochemistry Gastrocnemius cryosections were permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; GeminiBio) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody to TERT (1/100; RayBiotech # 144–64552–50) was incubated in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed the following day with PBS and stained with Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 555 secondary antibody (1/300; Thermo #A21428) at room temperature for 1 hour. Slides were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI (Thermo). Slides were imaged on a Nikon-Ni widefield microscope using a Nikon DS-F12 color camera.Telomerase activity measurement by TRAP assay Relative telomerase activity was measured by Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) assay as previously described83. In brief, muscle tissue was lysed in 1X CHAPS buffer for 30 minutes on ice. Lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000×g for 20 min to pellet cell debris and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. One hundred twenty-five nanograms of protein lysate was incubated with a telomerase substrate at 30 °C for 30 minutes to allow for telomerase to catalyze the addition of telomere repeats to the substrate. The reactions were then PCR amplified, resolved on a 4–20% TBE polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 30 minutes and visualized by staining with SYBR Green nucleic acid gel stain. Relative telomerase activity was quantified using ImageJ software.Statistical analysis Data were analyzed statistically using GraphPad (La Jolla, CA, USA) Prism 9.5.1 software. Results are presented as the mean± or SEM for column graphs, with individual data points representative of a single mouse dataset, or as median with 25th and 75th quartiles for violin plots. Datasets were analyzed with 1-way ANOVA to determine significance, with Tukey’s multiple comparison test of means used to obtain adjusted p values. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Sample sizes are indicated for each data set in the figure legends.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplemental Material (2.9MB, pdf) Reporting Summary (71.1KB, pdf) Acknowledgements We thank Drs.

Copyright notice ID: 3982735 PMID: 24596331 In the epidermis of Arabidopsis leaves, flavonols specifically accumulate in guard cells with enhanced synthesis in the presence of ethylene, where they lower the levels of reactive oxygen species and reduce the rate of stomatal closure.Abstract Guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas exchange and water loss from leaves. The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure through synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS accumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations from reaching damaging levels within the cell. Flavonols are plant metabolites that have been implicated as antioxidants; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated. Flavonols accumulate in guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, but not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a flavonol-specific dye. The expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of CHALCONE SYNTHASE, a gene encoding a flavonol biosynthetic enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, suggests guard cell-specific flavonoid synthesis. Increased levels of ROS were detected using a fluorescent ROS sensor in guard cells of transparent testa4-2, which has a null mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE and therefore synthesizes no flavonol antioxidants. Guard cells of transparent testa4-2 show more rapid ABA-induced closure than the wild type, suggesting that flavonols may dampen the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closing. The levels of flavonols are positively regulated in guard cells by ethylene treatment in the wild type, but not in the ethylene-insensitive2-5 mutant. In addition, in both ethylene-overproducing1 and ethylene-treated wild-type plants, elevated flavonols lead to decreasing ROS and slower ABA-mediated stomatal closure. These results are consistent with flavonols suppressing ROS accumulation and decreasing the rate of ABA-dependent stomatal closure, with ethylene-induced increases in guard cell flavonols modulating these responses. Guard cells use an extensive signal transduction pathway to regulate the aperture of stomata, pores on the surface of leaves that facilitate gas exchange and water loss (Roelfsema and Hedrich, 2005; Joshi-Saha et al., 2011). CO2, a necessary reactant for photosynthesis, enters leaves through stomata, whereas water can leave through these same pores via transpiration. Excess water loss can lead to dehydration of the plant when there is excess heat or drought. Guard cells therefore must modulate the stomatal aperture in response to the changing environment (Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2007). In response to stimuli that close stomata, such as drought stress, the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is increased in the cytosol of guard cells (Zeevaart, 1980; Hirayama and Shinozaki (2007)). ABA induces ion movements across the cell membrane expelling K+ and Cl− ions through ion efflux channels. The decreased internal solute concentration drives water out of the cell via osmosis (Vahisalu et al., 2008). The loss of water from guard cells decreases the volume of the cell, with the resulting loss of turgor closing the stoma (Joshi-Saha et al., 2011). Additional understanding of this elegant signaling pathway will provide insight into how plant growth and development is modulated by changes in soil moisture, temperature, and light levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are one important class of signaling molecules that has been implicated in guard cell signaling (Guan et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Jiang and Zhang, 2002, 2003). The well-documented role of ROS in causing oxidative stress is now joined with growing evidence that ROS may play integral roles as secondary messengers in signal transduction pathways (Wood et al., 2003; Rhee, 2006; Mittler et al., 2011; Munné-Bosch et al., 2013). At high concentrations, ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can cause oxidative damage to DNA and proteins that are integral to normal cellular processes (Asada, 2006; Van Breusegem and Dat, 2006); however, at low levels, H2O2 is an effective signaling molecule in guard cells that can induce stomatal closure (Pei et al., 2000; Murata et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001; Kwak et al., 2003). Elevated ABA in guard cells triggers H2O2 production through activation of NADPH or respiratory burst oxidase enzymes located on the plasma membrane (Mustilli et al., 2002; Yoshida et al., 2002) and mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana respiratory burst oxidase D (AtrbohD) and AtrbohF, show impaired ABA-regulated stomatal closure (Kwak et al., 2003). The ability of signaling-regulated synthesis of H2O2 to alter the activity of specific target proteins has been shown in mammalian systems (Rhee, 2006). This oxidant, generated from superoxide O2.− molecules, can modulate the activity of phosphatases and kinases, causing dynamic changes in signal transduction pathways (Poole et al., 2004). Specifically, H2O2 can interact with specific Cys residues, transforming the functional group of the Cys into sulfenic acid, altering formation of disulfide bonds between two separate proteins or between nearby Cys residues of the same protein, in a transient, reversible fashion (Poole et al., 2004; Poole and Nelson, 2008). In guard cells, this ROS burst is believed to target calcium channels to promote the influx of calcium across the plasma membrane and the release of calcium from internal stores (McAinsh et al., 1996; Allen et al., 2000; Cho et al., 2009). Increased cytosolic calcium levels induce activation of anion efflux channels located on the plasma membrane (Hedrich et al., 1990; Schroeder and Hagiwara, 1990; Chen et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013), triggering stomatal closure. The mechanism behind ROS activation of Ca2+ channels in mammalian systems has been well studied (Poole and Nelson, 2008); however, less is known about this mechanism in plants. When maintained at manageable levels, ROS are efficient and reversible signaling molecules employed by cells to regulate the activity of enzymes and transcription factors; however, if levels of these molecules become excessively elevated, they can cause oxidative stress (Hernández et al., 2009; Pollastri and Tattini, 2011). Therefore, mechanisms that keep their levels from becoming too high and allow their accumulation to be transient are important features of ROS signaling. ROS homeostasis is tightly regulated in plants through the production of a variety of enzymatic and small molecule antioxidants (Mittler et al., 2004). Flavonols are plant metabolites that may function as antioxidants in plants and in animals that consume them (Hernández et al., 2009). Although their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated, previous studies have shown that the antioxidant capacity for flavonols in vitro is greater than that of vitamin C or E, two well-documented in planta antioxidants (Rice-Evans et al., 1997). Guard cells provide an elegant system to test the antioxidant ability of flavonols, owing to the well-documented function of ROS as a second messenger in this cell type (Pei et al., 2000; Murata et al., 2001; Kwak et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2009). This study examined the accumulation of flavonols in guard cells and the role of flavonol accumulation in controlling the levels of ROS. A flavonol-specific dye and a reporter construct driven by a promoter from a gene encoding a flavonol biosynthetic enzyme revealed the localized accumulation of flavonols and the expression of this gene that drives their synthesis in guard cells, but not in surrounding pavement cells. Mutants that make no flavonols are used to demonstrate the specificity of the flavonol-specific dye, and to show the effect of flavonols on ROS status and stomatal aperture. Finally, the induction of flavonol synthesis in guard cells in response to ethylene was examined, as well as the effect of these regulated changes in flavonol concentration on stomatal aperture. These results indicate that flavonols suppress ROS levels within guard cell modulating stomatal aperture and with changing environmental conditions modulating flavonol synthesis and guard cell signaling. RESULTS Flavonols and Their Biosynthetic Machinery Are Found in Guard Cells To determine whether flavonols accumulate in guard cells, we used diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethyl ester (DPBA) dye to detect flavonols. The specificity of DPBA fluorescence was demonstrated in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots using mutants in flavonol synthesis, with no signal observed in the transparent testa4-2 (tt4-2) mutant that makes no flavonoids (Lewis et al., 2011) because of a mutation in the gene that encodes chalcone synthase (CHS), the first step in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. The DPBA fluorescence of the surface of an Arabidopsis leaf, with and without a differential interference contrast (DIC) overlay of pavement cells, illustrated localized accumulation of flavonols in guard cells with no signal in surrounding pavement cells (Fig. 1, A and B). This pattern was observed in more than 50 leaves. We also asked whether the flavonol localization was restricted to guard cells as a result of flavonol biosynthesis in those cells. Epidermal leaf peels of transgenic plants with a CHS promoter driving a GUS reporter were visualized by bright-field microscopy. GUS product accumulated in the epidermal guard cells (Fig. 1C), with no GUS product accumulation in surrounding pavement cells. This reporter is expressed in additional cell layers in cross sections of whole leaves (Chory and Peto, 1990). These results were consistent with tissue-specific signals, including transcriptional controls of flavonol synthesis, restricting flavonol accumulation to guard cells. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Flavonols accumulate in guard cells. A, Confocal micrograph showed yellow DPBA fluorescence in guard cells, but not pavement cells. B, DIC image overlaid on a confocal micrograph of wild-type leaves showing the location of yellow DPBA fluorescence. C, Bright-field image shows CHS:GUS expression in guard cells, but not pavement cells of wild-type plants. Bar = 15 μm.To more quantitatively and precisely image DPBA in leaf tissue, we optimized laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) settings in order to spectrally separate total flavonol fluorescence from chlorophyll autofluorescence. Using the basal surface of a whole Arabidopsis leaf, confocal micrographs showed autofluorescence of chlorophyll in the blue channel and DPBA staining in the yellow channel (Fig. 2). The absence of the DPBA signal in tt4-2 guard cells confirmed the specificity of this staining in leaf tissues, complementing the previous studies in roots (Buer and Muday, 2004; Lewis et al., 2011). This image indicated that we can resolve these two fluorescent signals and that flavonols accumulated in the cytosol, but not the chloroplasts of guard cells. It was also evident that DPBA fluorescence was greater in the regions of the guard cell that appeared to be nuclei, a cellular location that exhibited flavonoid accumulation in other plant cells types (Feucht et al., 2004; Saslowsky et al., 2005; Lewis et al., 2011). Verification of nuclear flavonol accumulation was completed by simultaneously imaging DPBA and Hoechst 33258, a nucleic acid stain (Supplemental Fig. S1). After imaging DPBA with spectral separation, we imaged the same guard cells using single-channel microscopy to visualize Hoechst fluorescence and consistently observed that the region of bright DPBA staining in the center of each guard cell also had nucleic acids, as detected by Hoechst, consistent with a nuclear accumulation of flavonols. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Flavonol accumulation is absent in tt4 guard cells and enhanced in eto1 guard cells. DPBA bound to flavonols is shown in yellow and chlorophyll autofluorescence is shown in blue. Bar = 15 μm.The levels of DPBA fluorescence in the cytosol and nucleus of the wild type and tt4-2 were quantified in 90 guard cells and are reported relative to the levels in the cytosol of ecotype Columbia 0 of Arabidopsis (Col-0; Fig. 3A). DPBA fluorescence was at background levels in tt4-2, whereas wild-type plants had a robust DPBA fluorescent signal, with approximately 2-fold higher intensity in the nucleus than in the cytosol. Figure 3. Open in a new tab A, Subcellular flavonol accumulation in wild-type guard cells compared with eto1 and tt4. Flavonol accumulation was measured using guard cell DPBA fluorescence intensity values and the average ± se is reported relative to the levels in the cytosol of Col-0 for n = 90 stomata. Asterisks indicate significant differences (P < 0.005) between the mutant and the wild type within cellular location. Number signs indicate significant differences (P < 0.02) between cytosol and nucleus within genotype. B, LC-MS analysis of flavonol levels in whole leaves showed enhanced accumulation of quercetin and kaempferol in eto1 leaves compared with the control (P < 0.003 and P < 0.06, respectively). No flavonols were detected in tt4. Data represent results from three separate experiments each with n = 6. ND, Not detected because compound is either absent or below the level of threshold detection.Flavonol Accumulation in Guard Cells Affects ABA-Induced Stomatal Closure To analyze the functional significance of flavonol accumulation in guard cells, we compared ABA-dependent stomatal closure in wild-type and tt4-2 guard cells. Because ABA triggers a ROS burst in guard cells and flavonols reduce ROS concentrations, we expected flavonol concentrations in guard cells to be inversely proportional to the rates of ABA-induced stomatal closure. Leaves were excised and incubated with 20 μm ABA for 0, 45, 90, or 180 min. At the indicated times after treatment, epidermal peels were generated and DIC images were captured and used for measurement of stomatal aperture. Apertures were quantified in 30 stomata for three separate experiments (Fig. 4). Although tt4 and the wild type showed similar aperture in opening solution, the initial ABA-induced stomatal closure response was greater in tt4 guard cells than the control, with all aperture values significantly different than the wild type (P < 0.05). The apertures of stomata were also quantified in the absence of ABA under identical conditions over the same time course in these two genotypes. The guard cells remained open under these conditions and there were no detectable differences between the wild type and tt4-2 (Supplemental Fig. S2). We also examined the effect of 3 h of ABA treatment on DPBA fluorescence in guard cells, mirroring the time course of ABA in the stomatal closure assays to ask if ABA altered flavonol synthesis. The DPBA signal was not altered by ABA during this 3-h treatment (Supplemental Fig. S3). These results were consistent with the absence of an antioxidant in tt4-2 guard cells that leads to an increase in signaling via ROS. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Stomatal aperture of Col-0 and tt4 in response to ABA. ABA sensitivity is indirectly proportional to relative flavonol concentration. Guard cells were incubated under white light in a 20-μM ABA solution for 0, 45, 90, and 180 min. The average ± se of 90 stomata from three biological replicates are reported. Asterisks indicate significant differences (P < 0.05) between the mutant and Col-0 at each time point as determined by the Student’s t test.Elevated Ethylene Levels through Exogenous Treatment or in the ethylene-overproducing1 Mutant Increase Flavonol Accumulation Because elevated ethylene levels were previously shown to increase flavonol accumulation in Arabidopsis roots (Lewis et al., 2011), we asked whether there is similar regulation in guard cells. DPBA fluorescence was examined in the ethylene-overproducing1 (eto1) mutant (Chae et al., 2003) and enhanced flavonol accumulation was observed in the guard cells (Fig. 2). The DPBA fluorescence intensity was quantified in 90 stomata and average fluorescence is reported relative to the values in the cytosol of Col-0 (Fig. 3). There is a >1.6-fold increase in DPBA fluorescence in the cytosol and a >1.5-fold increase in the nuclei of eto1 guard cells compared with the wild type (Fig. 3; P < 0.001). To further examine the effect of ethylene on flavonol synthesis in guard cells, we treated plants with exogenous ethylene. The wild type and the ethylene-insensitive2-5 (ein2-5) mutant, an ethylene signaling mutant with nearly complete ethylene insensitivity (Alonso et al., 1999), were treated with 5 μL/L ethylene gas for 24 h, and then DPBA fluorescence in the guard cells was imaged (Fig. 5). The DPBA fluorescence was quantified in both the nucleus and cytosol, as described above, for 30 stomata per treatment in three separate experiments, and the average signal relative to the signal in the cytosol of untreated Col-0 was calculated (Fig. 5). Similar to eto1, the guard cells of ethylene-treated wild-type plants had enhanced DPBA fluorescence in the cytosol and nuclei compared with an untreated control (P < 0.01). A similar magnitude increase in DPBA fluorescence was also evident after 3 h of ethylene treatment, as shown in Supplemental Figure S3A. Guard cells of ein2-5 had significantly lower DPBA fluorescence than Col-0 in both the cytosol and nucleus in the absence of treatment (P < 0.02) and showed no increase in DPBA fluorescence after ethylene treatment (Fig. 5). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Subcellular flavonol accumulation in Col-0 and ein2-5 guard cells with and without ethylene treatment. Intact soil grown plants were incubated in ethylene gas at 5 μL/L concentration for 24 h. DPBA fluorescence intensity values were quantified and are reported relative to the untreated Col-0 cytosol fluorescence intensity. Asterisks indicate significant differences (P < 0.02) between the mutant and the wild type within treatment. Number signs indicate significant differences between treated and untreated controls within a genotype as determined by the Student’s t test (P < 0.02). The average ± se of 90 stomata from three biological replicates are reported.We employed HPLC together with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) to directly quantify concentrations of kaempferol and quercetin in whole leaves to examine the effect of elevated ethylene levels on flavonol concentration. Hydrolyzed flavonol samples extracted from 18 leaves of 4-week-old Col-0, tt4-2, and eto1 plants were analyzed to examine the total flavonol pools of each compound. The concentrations of flavonols were detected in three separate experiments, with a representative graph shown in Figure 3. Flavonol extractions from whole leaves showed 1.3- and 5-fold increased levels of accumulation of kaempferol and quercetin, respectively, in eto1 compared with the wild type. This experimental approach could not demonstrate that ethylene-dependent increases in flavonols were localized specifically to guard cells, but it did illustrate that the increases in total flavonol concentrations mirror the fluorescence increases in guard cells observed with DPBA staining. ROS Accumulate in Guard Cells and Are Affected by Flavonol Concentrations The concentrations of ROS are highly regulated in guard cells and are an essential feature of rapid stomatal closure in response to ABA (Pei et al., 2000; Kwak et al., 2003). ROS concentration within guard cells was examined to determine whether flavonols are acting as antioxidants in vivo. To visualize ROS accumulation in Arabidopsis leaf tissue, we used 2',7' dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), a general ROS fluorescent sensor (Halliwell and Whiteman, 2004). In the past, this fluorescent probe has been imaged with UV light to visualize ROS in guard cells (Kwak et al., 2003); however, we excited with a 488-nm laser, a wavelength that is more frequently used when imaging this probe (Halliwell and Whiteman, 2004). H2DCF-DA is taken up by cells, in which internal cellular esterases cleave off the diacetate functional group, preventing 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) from diffusing outside of the cell. Upon oxidation by ROS, DCF becomes fluorescent. To minimize any dye uptake difference or light-induced fluorescence increases that can occur with this dye (Murata et al., 2001), all incubation and imaging times and settings were carefully maintained within each experimental comparison. We used spectral separation through confocal microscopy to separate out chlorophyll autofluorescence from DCF fluorescence in guard cells in epidermal leaf peels of the wild type, tt4-2, and eto1 (Fig. 6). In all three genotypes, DCF fluorescence was at very low levels in pavement cells, but accumulated in guard cells in both nuclei and the cytosol, with greater fluorescence in the nuclei, mirroring the tissue and subcellular accumulation of flavonols. The levels of DCF fluorescence in the cytosol and nucleus of the wild type, tt4, and eto1 were quantified in 90 guard cells and values were normalized relative to the levels in the cytosol of Col-0 (Fig. 6B). In the tt4 mutant, which does not synthesize flavonols, DCF fluorescence intensity was greater in both the cytosol and the nucleus of guard cells compared with the wild type. Quantification of DCF fluorescence indicated that there is a 2- and 2.5-fold increase in tt4-2 in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively, compared with wild-type guard cells. Figure 6. Open in a new tab A, Confocal micrographs of H2DCF-DA-stained guard cells of 4-week-old Col-0, tt4, and eto1 plants. DCF fluorescence is shown in green, and chlorophyll autofluorescence is shown in blue in separate channels and merged images captured under identical confocal settings. B, Quantification of subcellular DCF fluorescence in guard cells. Leaf peels of 3- to 4-week-old plants were stained with 2.5 μM H2DCF-DA for 30 min and imaged using confocal microscopy. DCF intensity values in the cytosol and nucleus of guard cells were determined and are reported relative to the levels in the cytosol of Col-0. The average ± se of 90 stomata from three biological replicates are reported. C, Quantification of subcellular DCF fluorescence in guard cells. Data from two experiments are combined and the average ± se of 60 stomata are reported. Asterisks indicate significant differences (P < 0.005) between the mutant and the wild type within treatment. Number signs indicate significant differences (P < 0.05) between treated and untreated controls within a genotype as determined by the Student’s t test. Bar = 15 µm.There were also lower levels of DCF fluorescence in eto1 than in the wild type with reduction to 60% of the values in the untreated wild type, consistent with the higher levels of antioxidants in the presence of elevated ethylene. Ethylene treatment for 24 h showed decreased ROS accumulation in the wild type (Fig. 6), with similar ROS decreases observed after 3 h of ethylene treatment compared with untreated controls (Supplemental Fig, S2B). In tt4, there were increased levels of ROS detected at 24 h, but not after 3 h of ethylene treatment compared with untreated tt4 (Fig. 6). The 24-h ethylene treatment results mirrored a previous report that ethylene induced ROS accumulation in guard cells through activation of NADPH oxidase AtRBOHF (Desikan et al., 2006). Together these images suggested an antioxidant activity of flavonols in guard cells, by illustrating an inverse relationship between flavonol concentration and ROS levels using both mutants to block flavonol synthesis and treatments and mutants to elevate ethylene levels and flavonol accumulation.Stomatal Closure Is Modulated by Ethylene Levels The effect of 24 h of ethylene treatment of the wild type and tt4 and in the untreated eto1 mutant was examined using the same above-described stomatal closure assay. The closure at time 0, 45, and 90 min after ABA treatment for 90 stomata from three experiments were quantified in these three genotypes (Fig. 7). After incubation in the opening solution for 3 h, all stomata were equivalently open and in the absence of added ABA, remained equivalently open (Supplemental Fig. S2). Ethylene-treated wild-type and eto1 guard cells showed decreased closure in response to ABA, whereas untreated tt4 shows the most stomatal closure at each time point. When wild-type plants were treated with ethylene for 3 h (Supplemental Fig. S3C), similar results were observed. We expected that tt4 would show no response to ethylene treatment, if the only effect of ethylene is on flavonoid synthesis; however, we found that it does show a reduced stomatal closure in the presence of 24 h of ethylene treatment, but not 3 h. The stomatal aperture is still smaller in tt4-2 with ethylene treatment than in Col-0 with ethylene, consistent with a role for ethylene-mediated flavonol synthesis in reducing the rate of stomatal closure through modulation of ROS signals. The difference in stomatal aperture in tt4 in the absence and presence of 24 h of ethylene treatment suggests the presence of a separate flavonol-independent pathway by which ethylene treatment facilitates stomatal closure. The absence of this effect at 3 h suggests that this may well be a secondary effect of extended ethylene treatments. Figure 7. Open in a new tab Stomatal aperture widths in response to ABA. ABA sensitivity is indirectly proportional to relative flavonol concentration. Guard cells were incubated under white light in a 20-μM ABA solution for 0, 45, and 90 min. The average ± se of 90 stomata from three biological replicates are reported. Asterisks indicate significant differences between samples and untreated Col-0 using a Student’s t test (P < 0.05).DISCUSSION Guard cells control the aperture of stomatal pores in response to environmental fluctuations, including variations in light intensity, moisture, and carbon dioxide levels (Hetherington and Woodward, 2003). In response to environmental stress, the plant hormone ABA signals stomatal closure (Zeevaart, 1980; Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2007; Cho et al., 2009; Joshi-Saha et al., 2011). This signaling pathway employs H2O2 as a ROS second messenger (McAinsh et al., 1996; Murata et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001; Kwak et al., 2003). During signaling of stomatal closure, ROS must reach a certain threshold to oxidize their targets (Kwak et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2009), but must not reach levels that will cause oxidative damage (Munné-Bosch et al., 2013). To prevent oxidative damage, ROS signaling must be tightly regulated by small molecule and/or protein antioxidants (Conklin et al., 1996; Apel and Hirt, 2004), with antioxidants including glutathione and flavonoids. Recent reports demonstrated the altered redox state and altered stomatal aperture in mutants defective in glutathione synthesis (Okuma et al., 2011; Munemasa et al., 2013). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that flavonols act as antioxidants that reduce ROS concentrations in guard cells, thus modulating stomatal closure. We examined where and how flavonols accumulated in the epidermal layers of leaves in order to better understand their role in cell signaling. Flavonol accumulation was visualized through confocal microscopy, using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye, DPBA. In the wild type, DPBA fluorescence was localized to guard cells but was absent in surrounding pavement cells, whereas it was not detected in any cell types in the flavonoid-deficient tt4-2 mutant. Localized flavonol accumulation in guard cells could be a result of localized synthesis or selective import of these molecules into the cells. To examine whether flavonol biosynthetic enzymes are synthesized in guard cells in planta, a CHS:GUS transgenic line was utilized. CHS promoter-driven GUS product accumulated specifically in guard cells and not in surrounding epidermal pavement cells, which suggests that production of CHS, a key flavonol biosynthesis enzyme, is localized to Arabidopsis guard cells. This result is consistent with previous research that shows the presence of transcripts encoding enzymes of flavonol biosynthesis in guard cell protoplasts, including chalcone isomerase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, flavonol synthase1, and flavonoid 3′hydroxylase (Pandey et al., 2010). This result extends previous study in two ways. First, it minimized the damage to cells that is the result of creating protoplasts, which may increase the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes in cells where they are not normally produced (Dixon and Paiva, 1995; Winkel-Shirley, 2002). Second, the available microarray data do not have a pavement cell transcriptome for comparison (Pandey et al., 2010). Using very different experimental methods in Vicia faba, flavonols were previously reported to accumulate in guard cells and surrounding epidermal cells (Schnabl et al., 1986; Takahama, 1988). Both reports used spectrophotometric imaging of epidermal peels, which limits the resolution of flavonols accumulation in individual cells. Using the highly localized accumulation of DPBA fluorescence, our results demonstrate that there is a guard cell-specific flavonol accumulation profile in Arabidopsis. Because flavonols accumulate specifically in guard cells, we asked whether these molecules function as antioxidants to reduce ROS concentrations. Flavonols have been shown to have antioxidant activity in vitro; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated (Rice-Evans et al., 1997; Hernández et al., 2009; Pollastri and Tattini, 2011). Because ROS has been implicated as a second messenger in guard cell signaling (McAinsh et al., 1996; Murata et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001; Kwak et al., 2003), we asked whether the presence of flavonols affected the ROS accumulation in guard cells. To visualize ROS accumulation, we used DCFH-DA, a general ROS sensor, and utilized spectral separation to remove chlorophyll autofluorescence. DCF fluorescence was localized to guard cells, similar to the DPBA fluorescence pattern, indicating that both flavonols and ROS accumulate specifically in this cell type, but not in surrounding pavement cells. In addition, we saw increased DCF fluorescence in tt4-2 mutants that synthesize no flavonols, consistent with the absence of flavonols resulting in increased ROS concentrations, which is also consistent with an antioxidant activity for flavonols in vitro. DPBA fluorescence were at higher levels in the nuclei than the cytosol in all genotypes and treatments. This observation is consistent with characteristics of other plant species that showed flavonoid and ROS accumulation in the nuclei (Feucht et al., 2004; Mazars et al., 2010; Lewis et al., 2011). Immunolocalization with antibodies against CHS and chalcone isomerase suggests that the enzymes of flavonoid synthesis are localized to the nucleus in Arabidopsis roots (Saslowsky et al., 2005). The nuclear localization of flavonols is consistent with the notion that ROS can regulate gene expression through interaction with redox-sensitive transcription factors (TFs) in plants (Wu et al., 2012), such as the well-established redox-sensitive TF described in bacteria and mammals (Aslund et al., 1999; Biswas et al., 2006). Flavonols are a likely candidate to modulate the activity of redox-sensitive TFs, because of their increased accumulation in the nuclei; however, it is unlikely that they are the only antioxidant present in this organelle. Flavonols have been shown to chelate metal ions, such as Fe3+, which catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 (Hernández et al., 2009). Thus, flavonol accumulation in the nucleus would contribute to a decreased redox potential in the nucleus, potentially decreasing the number of TF oxidation events. Combined with our data suggesting an in planta antioxidant ability of flavonols, we hypothesize that flavonol accumulation in the nuclei may modulate the activity of redox-sensitive TFs that affect gene expression in addition to preventing oxidative damage to DNA, although the time scale of transcriptional effects may be beyond the rapid regulation of guard cell aperture. Because stomatal apertures are environmentally regulated, we hypothesized that regulation of flavonol synthesis may be a way for plants to modulate the physiology of guard cells. Previous studies have shown that ethylene increases flavonol accumulation in Arabidopsis roots (Buer et al., 2007; Lewis et al., 2011), and we asked whether this hormone may also increase flavonol accumulation in guard cells. Elevated levels of ethylene through endogenous overproduction in the eto1 mutant and exogenous application of ethylene to wild-type leaves increased flavonol accumulation in this cell type, as visualized by localized DPBA fluorescence. We observed robust increases in DPBA fluorescence at both 3 and 24 h after treatment with ethylene gas. This ethylene-enhanced flavonol accumulation pattern requires a functional ethylene signaling pathway, because the ethylene-induced DPBA fluorescence increases were lost in the ein2 mutant. A previous study showed that ethylene-induced flavonoid increases detected by DPBA can also be detected by LC-MS (Lewis et al., 2011). We therefore verified these flavonols increases in leaves using LC-MS and detected approximately 5-fold increases in quercetin and a smaller, but still statistically significant, increase in kaempferol in whole leaves treated with ethylene under similar conditions. We also observed decreased DCF fluorescence in the wild type and tt4 treated with ethylene for 3 or 24 h as well as in eto1 guard cells compared with the wild type, suggesting that the increase in flavonols decreases ROS concentrations. In addition, ethylene-treated wild-type guard cells and eto1 exhibited a decreased rate of ABA-induced stomatal closure, a result that is consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants reducing the H2O2 burst that drives stomatal closure. Ethylene has been shown to promote both stomatal closure in Arachis hypogaea and Arabidopsis (Pallas and Kays, 1982; Desikan et al., 2006) and stomatal opening in Dianthus caryophyllus, Solanum lycopersicum, V. faba, and Arabidopsis (Madhavan et al., 1983; Levitt et al., 1987; Tanaka et al., 2005). Applied ethylene gas or its precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, was shown to induce stomatal closure through elevated ROS production generated by AtRBOHF, an NADPH oxidase (Desikan et al., 2006). In our study, a previously reported ROS burst that was observed upon ethylene treatment of wild-type guard cells (Desikan et al., 2006) was masked by increased flavonol accumulation, but we observed that a 24-h ethylene treatment of tt4 led to elevated ROS (although this increase was not detected after 3 h of treatment), consistent with the absence of antioxidants. Other researchers report that treatment of wild-type plants with ethylene or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid or endogenous ethylene overproduction in eto1 inhibit stomatal closure in the presence of ABA in Arabidopsis (Tanaka et al., 2005) and in wheat (Triticum durum; Chen et al., 2013). These findings are mirrored in our results, with decreased ROS and stomatal closure in response to ethylene treatment or the eto1 mutation. We predicted that ethylene-treated tt4 might be insensitive to the effect of ethylene on stomatal aperture, because there will be no change in flavonoid antioxidants. We found that in both the wild type and tt4, ethylene reduced the rate of stomatal closure, consistent with a flavonoid- and ROS-independent ethylene regulation of this process, although the tt4 mutant has a greater rate in both cases consistent with a second ROS-dependent mechanism. A ROS-independent pathway for ABA-induced stomatal closure was previously suggested (Kwak et al., 2003). ABA treatment of atrbohD/F double mutant guard cells resulted in no change in ROS concentrations, although cytosolic Ca2+ elevations were observed in nearly one-half of all guard cells (Kwak et al., 2003). We hypothesize that a 24-h ethylene treatment may inhibit ROS-independent stomatal closure in the absence of flavonols, which would explain the delayed closure that is observed in ethylene-treated tt4. Our results suggest that ethylene induces flavonol accumulation, which reduces both the concentration of ROS and the rate of ABA-induced stomatal closure. We have constructed a model to synthesize these data, which is shown in Figure 8. This model outlines the ABA signaling pathway in which ABA activates respiratory burst oxidases increasing the levels of ROS, which act as signaling molecules to induce stomatal closure. Flavonoids act as antioxidants reducing the levels of ROS, which decrease the rate of stomatal closure. Elevated levels of ethylene, both through elevated synthesis in eto1 or by treatment with exogenous ethylene, increase flavonol accumulation and decrease ROS, resulting in a reduced rate of stomatal closure. When a flavonoid-deficient mutant is treated with ethylene, we find that ROS levels increase after 24 h of treatment, but not after 3 h of treatment. These findings suggest that extended ethylene elevated ROS accumulation (Fig. 8, dotted line), but that the elevated ethylene after ROS treatment in the wild type more than compensates by increasing levels of flavonol antioxidants. We predicted that tt4 would be insensitive to the effect of ethylene on stomatal closure, whereas we found that this treatment leads to a reduced rate of closure, which is evident at 24 h, but not 3 h of ethylene treatment (Fig. 8, dotted line). We hypothesize that ethylene may enhance the synthesis of a second signaling molecule that may act to alter stomatal closure through a separate mechanism in the presence of extended ethylene treatment. Yet the absence of ethylene effects on ROS and stomatal aperture after 3-h treatments suggests that the primary effects of ethylene are on synthesis of flavonol antioxidants that suppress ROS levels. Figure 8. Open in a new tab A proposed model of the effects of ethylene and flavonols on stomatal closure. ABA is released into the cytosol where it triggers respiratory burst oxidases, which induce a burst of ROS, which act as secondary messengers to signal stomatal closure. Ethylene induces flavonols accumulation in guard cells through EIN2. Flavonols act as antioxidants to scavenge ROS and thereby inhibits stomatal closure. In the absence of flavonols, ethylene induced ROS accumulation after 24 h, but not after 3 h of treatment. Similarly, 24 h of ethylene treatment affected stomatal aperture in tt4, whereas 3 h of ethylene treatment did not. The effects of ethylene observed at 24 h are indicated with dashed lines. Arrows represent positive effects and bars represent negative effects.CONCLUSION Guard cell function is integral to plant adaptation to a changing environment. Much is known about the role of ROS as a second messenger in this cell type (Wang and Song, 2008); however, the role of antioxidants in guard cells to modulate ROS concentrations has not been well studied. We observed flavonol and ROS accumulation in guard cells and showed that the concentrations of flavonols in planta are inversely proportional to ROS levels, consistent with in vitro studies of flavonols acting as antioxidants (Rice-Evans et al., 1997; Hernández et al., 2009). This study showed that flavonol levels are ethylene regulated in guard cells. Elevated levels of ethylene in response to exogenous treatment of the wild type and endogenous synthesis in the eto1 mutant increase flavonol accumulation in guard cells, resulting in decreased ROS levels and decreased rate of stomatal closure. Together these results indicate that flavonols suppress ROS levels in guard cells and thereby modulate the dynamics of stomatal aperture.MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Growth and Ethylene Treatment Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were germinated on 1× Murashige and Skoog medium, pH 5.6, Murashige and Skoog vitamins, and 0.8% (w/v) agar, buffered with 0.05% (w/v) MES and supplemented with 1% (w/v) Suc. After vernalization at 4°C for 48 h, plates were placed in a 12-h day growth chamber under 100 µmol m−2 s−2 cool-white light. Seedlings were transferred to Metromix 360 soil 7 d after germination. All experiments were conducted on leaves of plants that were 3 to 4 weeks after germination. This study utilized ecotype Columbia 0 of Arabidopsis (Col-0), tt4-2 (Lewis et al., 2011), eto1 (Chae et al., 2013), ein2-5 (Alonso et al., 1999), and a CHS:GUS reporter (Chory and Peto, 1990). For ethylene treatments, 4-week-old wild-type, tt4-2, and ein2-5 plants were placed in a clear plastic container that was sealed with vacuum grease. Ethylene gas was added to achieve a 5 μL/L concentration of ethylene within the chamber. Control plants were placed in identical sealed containers without ethylene. After either 3 h or 24 h of incubation, leaves were excised and used for imaging DPBA or DCF fluorescence, or in stomatal closure assays.Flavonol Accumulation Using DPBA Individual leaves were excised and submerged in an aqueous solution containing 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2.52 mg/mL−1 DPBA for 2.5 h. Whole leaves were then washed in deionized water for 1 min and mounted in deionized water between two coverslips. A Zeiss 710 LSCM was used to excite the leaf surfaces with 100% maximum laser power at 488 nm and a pinhole yielding a 4-μm cross section. We optimized LSCM settings to spectrally separate the fluorescence of flavonol-DPBA and chlorophyll by capturing the emission spectrum for each compound in which there is no overlap. DPBA fluorescence emission was collected between 475 and 619 nm (Lewis et al., 2011). The gain settings were selected to maximize the total flavonol signal while preventing oversaturation. All micrographs within each figure were acquired using identical offset, gain, and pinhole settings using the same detectors. Postimage quantification of DPBA fluorescence intensities was done by placing a region of interest (ROI) around the nuclei of each guard cell and around an area in the cytosol with no chloroplasts present. The average intensity values within each ROI were recorded and averaged.Histochemical Staining and Imaging of CHS:GUS Activity Whole leaves from the CHS:GUS transgenic line were excised and submerged in a GUS staining solution (80 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 0.4 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.04 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 0.05% [v/v] Triton X-100, 0.8 mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide, pH 7) at 37°C for 18 h. Leaves were removed from staining solution and washed with 75% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min. Epidermal strips were prepared by spraying a microscope slide with a silicone-based medical adhesive (Hollister stock #7730). After 5 min, the basal epidermis of the leaf was gently pressed into the dried adhesive coat, and the leaf was gently scraped with a pipette tip until only the fixed epidermis remained (Young et al., 2006). Epidermal peels were imaged using DIC imaging with a Zeiss Auxio Observer D1 microscope with an AxioCam HRc color camera.Quantification of Flavonols by LC-MS Samples were run on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL with an electrospray ionization source, coupled to a Thermo Accela 1250 pump and autosampler (Thermo Fisher), using a Security Guard column in line with a Luna 150 × 3 C18 column, both from Phenomenex. For flavonol analysis, 10 µl of each sample was injected with a solvent of water:acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in the following gradients: 95% to 40% (v/v) water from 0 to 5 min, 40% to 20% (v/v) water from 5 to 20 min, and 20% to 95% (v/v) water from 20 to 23 min to recondition the column. MS2 fragmentation spectra of flavonols were induced using 30-kV collision-induced dissociation. Spectra of samples were compared to those of standards and those listed on the MassBank database (www.massbank.jp). Data were analyzed by quantifying peak areas using Thermo Xcalibur software, and with normalization to the internal standard formononetin (Indofine Chemicals). Absolute quantities of metabolites were found by comparing peak area data to standard curves created using pure standards of quercetin and kaempferol (Indofine Chemicals).DCF and Hoechst Staining and Quantification H2DCF-DA was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to yield a 50-μm stock. This was diluted in deionized water to yield a final concentration of 2.5 µM with 2% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The epidermis was stained for 15 min with two drops of H2DCF-DA stain and washed with deionized water. A Zeiss 710 LSCM was used to excite the leaf surfaces with 1% maximum laser power at 488 nm with a 3.5 digital gain. Settings were optimized to spectrally separate the fluorescence of DCF -ROS and chlorophyll by capturing the emission spectrum for each compound in which there is no overlap. The DCF signal was collected between 495 to 527 nm with a pinhole yielding a 4-μm cross section, making sure to limit excess exposure to the laser that induces ROS. The gain settings were selected to maximize the total DCF signal while preventing oversaturation. All micrographs within each figure were acquired using identical offset, gain, and pinhole settings using the same detectors. DCF fluorescence intensities were measured by placing an ROI around the nuclei of each guard cell and around an area in the cytosol with no chloroplasts present. The average intensity values within each ROI was recorded and averaged. Hoechst imaging was performed on whole leaves that were previously stained with DPBA. After 2.5 h of DPBA staining, leaves were washed in deionized water for 1 min and transferred to an aqueous solution containing Hoechst at a 1 µg/mL concentration. The leaf surface was excited with 10% laser power at 405 nm and a pinhole yielding a 4 μm cross section. We optimized LSCM settings to spectrally separate the fluorescence of the Hoechst stain with cell wall autofluorescence by capturing the emission spectrum for each compound in which there is no overlap. Hoechst fluorescence emission was collected between 420 to 546 nm. The gain settings were selected to maximize the total Hoechst signal while preventing oversaturation.Stomatal Closure Assay ABA-induced stomatal closure assays were performed with plants 3 to 4 weeks after germination. Leaves from untreated plants or plants treated with ethylene gas for 24 h were excised and submerged in an aqueous opening solution (5 mM KCl, 50 µM CaCl2, 10 mM MES buffer, pH 5.6) and incubated under cool-white light for 3 h. To induce stomatal closure, leaves were transferred to a similar opening solution with 20 µM ABA added to induce closure (Jammes et al., 2009). After incubation in the ABA solution under white light (100 µmol m−2 s−2) for 0, 45, 90, and 180 min, leaf peels were prepared and imaged using DIC imaging with a Zeiss Axio Observer D1 microscope with a Hamamatsu 1394 ORCA-ERA monochromatic camera (Jammes et al., 2009). Apertures were measured using ImageJ software. Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers.

Copyright notice ID: 4682325 PMID: 26410302 Fundamental mechanisms associated with gravitropism in woody stems of Populus involve relocalization of the PIN3 auxin transporter and interacting roles for auxin, gibberellic acid, and the ARBORKNOX2 transcription factor in regulating fiber development and gravibending.Abstract Angiosperm trees reorient their woody stems by asymmetrically producing a specialized xylem tissue, tension wood, which exerts a strong contractile force resulting in negative gravitropism of the stem. Here, we show, in Populus trees, that initial gravity perception and response occurs in specialized cells through sedimentation of starch-filled amyloplasts and relocalization of the auxin transport protein, PIN3. Gibberellic acid treatment stimulates the rate of tension wood formation and gravibending and enhances tissue-specific expression of an auxin-responsive reporter. Gravibending, maturation of contractile fibers, and gibberellic acid (GA) stimulation of tension wood formation are all sensitive to transcript levels of the Class I KNOX homeodomain transcription factor-encoding gene ARBORKNOX2 (ARK2). We generated genome-wide transcriptomes for trees in which gene expression was perturbed by gravistimulation, GA treatment, and modulation of ARK2 expression. These data were employed in computational analyses to model the transcriptional networks underlying wood formation, including identification and dissection of gene coexpression modules associated with wood phenotypes, GA response, and ARK2 binding to genes within modules. We propose a model for gravitropism in the woody stem in which the peripheral location of PIN3-expressing cells relative to the cambium results in auxin transport toward the cambium in the top of the stem, triggering tension wood formation, while transport away from the cambium in the bottom of the stem triggers opposite wood formation.INTRODUCTION Gravity is a universal input that modulates plant growth and development, and various plant lineages and organs have evolved mechanisms to regulate growth and orientation relative to the force of gravity. Much of what is known about plant responses to gravity comes from studies of herbaceous annual plants wherein gravitropic responses rely on differential elongation. By contrast, lignified woody stems can no longer undergo elongation, necessitating a different solution. Instead, gravistimulated woody branches and stems undergo asymmetric radial growth to produce “reaction wood” (Sinnott, 1952; Wilson and Archer, 1977; Ruelle, 2014). In gymnosperms, reaction wood is termed compression wood and forms on the bottom side of the stem where it generates compressive force to push the stem upward (Timell, 1986; Ruelle, 2014). In angiosperms, reaction wood is termed tension wood and forms on the upper side of gravistimulated stems where it generates a tensile force that pulls the stem upward (Mellerowicz and Gorshkova, 2012). Tension wood is produced via an increased rate of cell division in the vascular cambium and is characterized by a reduced number of water conducting vessel elements and specialized tension wood fibers containing a gelatinous cell wall layer (G-layer), which is believed to be central to force generation (Mellerowicz and Gorshkova, 2012). Tension wood fibers are capable of generating a strong contractile force, which results in negative gravitropism of the stem. The term “opposite wood” describes the wood that forms on the lower side of gravistimulated stems, but, because it is anatomically similar to “normal wood” formed by upright stems, opposite wood has received little research attention. To comprehensively describe the gravitropism of woody angiosperm stems, four questions must be addressed: (1) What are the cells responsible for sensing gravity (i.e., graviperception), (2) what are the signals produced by gravity-sensing cells and how are they perceived by wood-forming and cambial cells, (3) how is force generated by tension wood fibers, and (4) how are the developmental processes leading to tension wood production regulated? Currently, which cells are responsible for gravity perception in woody stems is unclear. One possibility is that graviperception occurs in the shoot apex of the stem, and a signal is propagated down the stem. Alternatively, graviperception could occur within the woody stem itself. In Populus, starch-filled plastids that could serve as statoliths were observed in some cells of the cortex of young stems (Leach and Wareing, 1967), but no function could be ascribed to these cells in graviperception. Likewise, the mechanisms responsible for the initial graviresponse of woody stems have not been established. Similar to the graviresponses of roots and herbaceous shoots, auxin has been implicated in the graviresponse of woody stems, but conflicting conclusions from experimental ectopic application of auxin versus measurements of auxin concentrations within stems are difficult to reconcile (Hellgren et al., 2004). Other hormones, including gibberellic acid (GA) (Israelsson et al., 2005) and ethylene (Andersson-Gunnerås et al., 2003), have also been implicated in tension wood formation and are potentially involved in initial graviresponse signaling, but a comprehensive understanding of how these hormones interact and affect development of secondary vascular tissues is still incomplete. Several competing hypotheses for force generation by tension wood formation have been proposed (Clair et al., 2006; Goswami et al., 2008; Mellerowicz and Gorshkova, 2012) but all involve the development of fibers with specialized wall properties. Notably, the G-layer is a tertiary cell wall layer in tension wood fibers characterized by low lignin, high cellulose, and a low cellulose microfibril angle (Norberg and Meier, 1996; Clair et al., 2011) that may be fundamental to force generation. Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan-encoding genes (FLAs) are highly upregulated during tension wood formation (Lafarguette et al., 2004; Andersson-Gunneras et al., 2006; Azri et al., 2014), and the FLA protein products have been shown to affect stem biomechanics through changes in cellulose deposition and/or cell wall structural properties (MacMillan et al., 2010). Thus, in addition to serving as molecular markers of tension wood development, FLA proteins could be directly involved in contributing to the altered mechanical properties of tension wood. Additionally, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET)-dependent linkages between the G-layer and secondary cell walls have been identified and have been implicated in the transmission of tensile stress between the G-layer and adjacent cell wall layers (Mellerowicz et al., 2008; Mellerowicz and Gorshkova, 2012). At the regulatory level, large numbers of genes are differentially expressed in tension wood, including large suites of cell wall- and hormone-related genes (Déjardin et al., 2004; Andersson-Gunneras et al., 2006). Individual transcription factors have been characterized that affect wood development (Zhong and Ye, 2013), including the Populus Class I KNOX homeodomain protein ARBORKNOX2 (ARK2; Potri.002G113300), which is orthologous to Arabidopsis thaliana BREVIPEDECELLUS/KNAT1 (At4g08150) (Chuck et al., 1996; Venglat et al., 2002). ARK2 is expressed broadly in the cambial zone and lignifying cells and affects cell differentiation and expression of tension wood-related genes (Du et al., 2009). However, to date there are no transcription factors identified that specifically affect tension wood development, and the transcriptional networks underlying tension wood development remain poorly defined. Here, we present experiments in Populus that identify the cells responsible for graviperception, describe changes in radial auxin transport during graviresponse, and describe the ARK2 and GA-sensitive transcriptional networks underlying tension wood development. We suggest that the early graviresponse of auxin transport toward the cambium on the tension wood side of the stem and toward the outer cortex on the lower side of the stem sets in place a developmental switch leading to the different transcriptional and developmental outcomes of these tissues.RESULTS ARK2 Transcript Levels Influence Fiber Development and Gravibending To develop a comprehensive model of tension wood formation, we first focused on characterizing tension wood formation and gravitropism in Populus with altered ARK2 expression. Using previously characterized genotypes (Du et al., 2009), we assayed gravibending using time-lapse videos for wild-type, ARK2-downregulated (miRNA-ARK2), and ARK2-overexpressing (OE-ARK2) Populus trees for a 2-week period after the trees were subjected to 90° gravistimulation (Supplemental Movies 1 to 3). miRNA-ARK2 plants had a reduced gravibending response in comparison to the wild type, whereas OE-ARK2 plants displayed dramatically enhanced gravibending (Figures 1A to 1C; quantified in Supplemental Figures 1A to 1C and Supplemental Movies 1 to 3). Measurement of elongation growth in upright versus gravistimulated plants revealed an additional difference among the genotypes in response to gravistimulation. The wild type and OE-ARK2 both reduced elongation growth during gravistimulation, while miRNA-ARK2 plants did not. Surprisingly, histological comparison of stem sections showed that after 2 weeks of gravibending miRNA-ARK2 stems had produced more tension wood fibers in comparison to the wild type, whereas the exceptional gravibending response of OE-ARK2 was associated with fewer tension wood fibers formed (Figures 1D to 1F; Supplemental Figure 2 shows matched opposite wood sections). This difference was also reflected in stem diameters, with miRNA-ARK2 and the wild type having similar diameters nearly twice that of OE-ARK2 (Supplemental Figure 1E). Figure 1.

Bars = 10 cm in (A) to (C) and 500 µm in (D) to (F).The negative correlation between number of tension wood fibers produced and gravibending among ARK2 genotypes could reflect differences in the competency of tension wood fibers to generate force in the different genotypes. To test the hypothesis that ARK2 might also influence the production of functional cell walls capable of generating force, each genotype was assayed for two markers that are known to be associated with maturation of functional tension wood fibers and G-layers, FLAs (Lafarguette et al., 2004; Andersson-Gunneras et al., 2006; Azri et al., 2014), and XET (Mellerowicz et al., 2008; Mellerowicz and Gorshkova, 2012). Immunolocalizations using an antibody (JIM14) recognizing arabinogalactan protein epitopes (Knox et al., 1991) (presumably including FLAs) strongly labeled the developing G-layer of tension wood fibers (Figure 2) as well as rays in all wood types (Supplemental Figure 3). JIM14 labeling revealed distinct differences in the maturation schedule of tension wood fibers among the genotypes. OE-ARK2 trees displayed a distinct G-layer with JIM14 labeling within a few cell divisions of the cambium, while JIM14-labeled G-layers appeared much later and more erratically in miRNA-ARK2 tension wood (Figures 2A to 2C). For each genotype, the average number of tension wood fibers produced per day and the average number of tension wood fibers between the cambium and the first JIM14-labeled G-layer fiber was determined and used to calculate the average number of days required for G-layers to mature. As shown in Table 1, G-layer maturation required an average of 6.6, 4.9, and 3.6 d for miRNA-ARK2, the wild type, and OE-ARK2, respectively. Thus, faster maturation of G-layers was associated with enhanced gravibending. Figure 2.

Similarly, in situ imaging of XET activity using the fluorescent substrate XXXG-SR (Nishikubo et al., 2007) labeled cells of the cortex and secondary phloem in all wood types and specifically labeled G-layers in developing tension wood (Figure 3; Supplemental Figure 4). Similar to JIM14 labeling, OE-ARK2 G-layers were labeled within a few cells of the cambium, while miRNA-ARK2 showed variable and significantly greater numbers of cells between the cambium and fibers with labeled G-layers (Figure 3). Thus, altering ARK2 expression manifests in dramatic differences in fiber production, fiber maturation, and stem gravibending, with gravibending performance positively correlated with the rate of G-layer maturation.

Bars = 100 µm.Graviperception and Response Involves Changes in Auxin Transport We next asked whether changes in tension wood and gravibending associated with altered ARK2 transcript abundance could reflect differences in auxin transport. While the interpretations have varied (Hellgren et al., 2004), application of exogenous auxin to the upper surface of a Populus branch typically inhibits tension wood formation (Wilson and Archer, 1977; Little and Savidge, 1987), raising the possibility that changes in auxin transport down and/or around the stem could influence developmental outcomes. We first measured polar (longitudinal) auxin transport from the shoot apex toward the base (basipetal) in woody stems. The greatest amount of transport was found for miRNA-ARK2 trees, while OE-ARK2 trees transported less auxin than wild-type controls (Figure 4A). Figure 4.

Bars = 500 µm in (B) and (C) and 50 µm in (D) to (I).To understand how the lateral transport of auxin might be changed during graviresponse, antibodies were raised against Populus orthologs of the auxin polar transport protein Arabidopsis PIN-FORMED3, tested for specificity in immunoblots and control immunolocalizations (see Methods; Supplemental Figure 5), and used in immunolocalization experiments to visualize PIN3 protein. In younger, upright stems that had recently initiated secondary growth, PIN3 showed a distinct uniform localization to the plasma membranes of endodermal cells in the inner cortex (Figure 4B), consistent with previous description of this gene’s expression in the cortex in hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × tremuloides) (Schrader et al., 2003). The endodermal cells contained starch-filled amyloplasts (Figure 4C), which sediment in response to gravity, strongly suggesting these are gravity-perceiving cells. In older stems with more extensive secondary growth, PIN3 expression could be found both in the endodermis as well as cells within the secondary phloem (Figures 4D to 4I). Importantly, acquisition of PIN3 expression by cells in secondary phloem identifies a mechanism by which the woody stems can continue to perceive and respond to gravity after the loss of the endodermal layer during long-term secondary growth. Following 4 d of gravistimulation, PIN3 preferentially localized toward the ground in both the tension wood (Figures 4D to 4F; quantified for all genotypes in Supplemental Figure 6) and opposite wood sides of stems (Figures 4G to 4I). Because the PIN3-expressing cells are peripheral to the cambium in the radial organization of the stem, auxin would thus be predicted to be transported toward the cambial zone on the tension wood side of the stem, but toward the cortex (away from the cambium) on the opposite wood side of the stem. Thus, lateral auxin transport toward the ground by PIN3-expressing cells could elicit differential growth responses of the cambium to gravistimulation on the upper (tension wood) versus lower (opposite wood) sides of the stem. GA Potentiates Auxin Response and ARK2-Dependent Fiber Production Previous reports have identified GA metabolism genes as direct targets of KNOX transcription factors (Bolduc and Hake, 2009; Hay and Tsiantis, 2010), and GA has been shown to affect the differentiation of fibers during wood development (Eriksson et al., 2000; Mauriat and Moritz, 2009). The effect of GA treatment on auxin responses during graviresponse and tension wood formation was assayed through expression of a DR5:GUS construct that reports auxin response (Spicer et al., 2013) in trees subjected to a soil drench GA treatment (29 µm in soil; see Methods). In upright trees, DR5:GUS expression was detected in the cambial zone of trees after GA treatment but not in control trees (Supplemental Figure 7). In untreated trees gravistimulated for 4 d, the GUS reporter staining was weakly apparent in the cambial zone of the tension wood side of the stem, while stronger staining was apparent in the cortex in the opposite wood side of the stem (Figures 5A and 5C). This staining pattern was enhanced in response to GA treatment (Figures 5B and 5D). Notably, the endodermis appeared to be a boundary for GUS staining in the opposite wood side of the stem (Figure 5E), consistent with endodermal PIN3 directing auxin flow toward the cambium on the tension wood side and toward the cortex on the opposite wood side of the stem after gravistimulation. These results also show that increased GA levels potentiate the auxin responsiveness of these same tissues and are reminiscent of GA regulation of PIN protein stability and localization that has been described for root gravitropism in Arabidopsis (Willige et al., 2011; Löfke et al., 2013).

(E) DR5:GUS expression in the endodermis of opposite wood for a water control tree.The effect of GA on tension wood fiber development was tested by treating wild-type, OE-ARK2, and miRNA-ARK2 trees with a soil drench of either water (control) or 29 μM GA. Trees treated with GA showed an increase in gravibending response in comparison to controls (Supplemental Figure 7C). GA modestly increased the number of tension wood fibers formed after 2 weeks gravibending for wild-type and OE-ARK2 trees (Supplemental Figure 7D). By contrast, the number of fibers produced by control and GA-treated miRNA-ARK2 trees did not vary and was similar to that found in GA-treated wild-type trees (Supplemental Figure 7D). The maturation of G layers as assayed by JIM14 labeling (Supplemental Figure 8) and XET labeling (Supplemental Figure 9) showed similar trends, with GA treatment modestly increasing the rate of maturation in the wild type and OE-ARK2 but having no significant effect in miRNA-ARK2. Together, these observations suggest that GA stimulates tension wood fiber production and that this effect is sensitive to ARK2 levels, consistent with negative regulation of GA levels by ARK2 and elevated endogenous levels of GA in miRNA-ARK2.Transcriptional Networks Associate Gene Expression with Wood Development In a final set of experiments, computational approaches were used to model the transcriptional regulation of tension wood development using genome-wide transcriptome data from trees in which gene expression had been perturbed by gravistimulation, GA treatment, and modulation of ARK2 expression. A full factorial experiment was performed with trees of wild-type, miRNA-ARK2, and OE-ARK2 genotypes subjected to either GA or a control (mock) treatment and then either gravistimulated or allowed to remain upright. After 2 d, developing xylem was lightly scraped from both tension wood and opposite wood from gravistimulated trees after debarking or from two opposing sides of the upright trees and subjected to RNA sequencing (see Methods). Differential transcript abundance was calculated for comparisons of wood types, genotypes, and GA treatment, with relatively large numbers of genes showing differential expression in each comparison (Supplemental Figure 10). Notably, comparison of transcript levels across wood types revealed a massive reprogramming of gene expression in opposite wood, with the majority of differentially expressed genes being upregulated in that tissue (Supplemental Figure 10). Next, weighted gene correlation network analyses (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008) were performed to define modules (clusters) of coexpressed genes whose transcript levels covaried across samples. Modules were initially characterized for robustness by repeated random sampling and recalculation of modules (Supplemental Figure 11A) and by calculating coexpression relationships among all combinations of modules (Supplemental Figure 11B). Modules were next annotated to describe the expression and functional properties of genes within modules and their correlations to traits of interest (Supplemental Data Set 1). As visualized by eigengene values (the first principal component of transcript profiles) for each module (Figure 6A), variation in transcript levels across wood types was the primary factor in defining gene coexpression modules, followed by GA treatment and to a lesser extent ARK2 genotype. Coexpression relationships across modules (Supplemental Figure 11B) were evident based on eigengene values; for example, the sister brown, black, pink, and yellow modules were characterized by tension wood expression, while the sister magenta, blue, green-yellow, purple, and red modules were characterized by opposite wood expression (Figure 6A). Correlations were calculated between each gene module and phenotypic traits, including ARK2 genotype, wood type, GA treatment, and wood phenotypes (microfibril angle, cellulose crystallinity, fiber morphology, lignin, and carbohydrates; Supplemental Figure 12). Interestingly, significant correlations were found between each trait and at least one gene module (Figure 6A). All five gene modules with significant correlations to GA treatment (brown, yellow, magenta, blue, and red) were also correlated with ARK2 genotype, and four were also correlated with wood type. However, of the three modules (brown, black, and pink) showing significant correlations with microfibril angle and cellulose crystallinity traits associated with functional tension wood fibers, only brown showed significant correlation with GA, suggesting that the role of GA may be more closely tied to stimulation of tension wood fiber production than regulation of cell wall properties. Modules were also identified that had significant enrichment for specific Gene Ontology (GO) categories (Supplemental Figure 11C and Supplemental Data Set 2), allowing further insight into the functional properties of modules. For example, each of the modules characterized by tension wood expression had distinct GO enrichment profiles, with the brown module characterized by enrichment for “localization,” the black module enrichment for replication, the pink module for hormone, auxin, and cell wall, and yellow module for cell wall, meristem, and localization GO terms. Together, these annotations can be used to develop and test new hypotheses regarding the function of ARK2, response to GA, or tension wood development through the identification and further dissection of gene modules of interest, as illustrated below.

(A) Dendrogram showing relationships of gene modules (colors), correlations of individual gene modules with phenotypes, and module eigengene expression across ARK2 genotypes (miRNA, miRNA-ARK2; OE, OE-ARK2) and wood types (NW, normal wood; OW, opposite wood; TW, tension wood) in response to GA treatment.

(C) Line graphs showing the average (bold line) and individual transcript levels (gray lines) of the 19 FLA genes in the pink module across ARK2 genotypes and wood types in response to GA treatment.ARK2 was placed in the blue module and showed modest connectivity within that as well as several other modules (Supplemental Data Set 1). ARK2 binding was recently evaluated, genome-wide, using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Liu et al., 2015). Here, four modules (brown, black, yellow, and magenta) showed enrichment for genes bound by ARK2 (Figure 6A). All of the ARK2 binding enriched modules also showed correlations with wood type and three showed correlations with GA treatment (brown, yellow, and magenta) and/or genotype (brown, yellow, and magenta), reflecting our experimental data indicating that ARK2 and GA interact and have major effects on wood development. Together, the modest connectivity of ARK2 and binding to large numbers of genes of diverse function suggest that this transcription factor does not act as a “master regulator.” Instead, these data are more consistent with ARK2 acting as a transcription factor that influences and potentially integrates multiple development-related processes, including cell wall development and hormone-related functions. As an example of how coexpression modules can be further dissected to understand tension wood development, we focused on the pink module, which is characterized by expression in tension wood across all genotypes (Figure 6A) and has correlations with cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle that are correlated with tension wood development and function (Figure 6A; Supplemental Figure 12). When genes within this module were plotted relative to their correlation with wood type and module membership (a measure of connectivity within the module), several FLA-like genes that are markers of tension wood development (Lafarguette et al., 2004; Andersson-Gunneras et al., 2006; Azri et al., 2014) and reflected in our JIM14 labeling of tension wood G-layers (Figure 2) were identified in the upper quartile of both traits (black data points in Figure 6B; Supplemental Data Set 1), suggesting this module contains genes directly relevant to differentiating tension wood. Strikingly, the transcription factors within the module (red data points in Figure 6B) include 11 MYB, 6 NAC, and 2 KNOX transcription factors incorporating orthologs of characterized genes known to regulate meristematic growth (Zhou et al., 2009), fiber development, and/or secondary cell wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (e.g., MYB52 and MYB85, KNAT6 and KNAT7, BLH4 and VND1; Belles-Boix et al., 2006; Ragni et al., 2008; Zhong et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2014; Taylor-Teeples et al., 2015). These serve as excellent candidates for regulating the expression of other genes within the module (Supplemental Data Set 1), which include genes central to graviresponse and tension wood formation, including auxin (e.g., PIN1 and PIN3 orthologs), GA biosynthesis (GA20-Oxidase), and cell wall biosynthesis (e.g., IRREGULAR XYLEM genes and 19 FLAs). Finally, potential radial signaling-related genes with high wood type and module membership also reside in the pink module, including CLE13-like and SCARECROW-like 8. FLA Expression Reveals Differential GA Response across Wood Types and ARK Genotypes Looking in detail at the expression of the FLAs within the pink module, three trends are apparent (Figure 6C): (1) FLA transcript levels are highest in tension wood and lowest in opposite wood in all genotypes (t = 15.304, df = 18, P value = 4.603e-12), (2) FLA transcript levels are lower in the tension wood of miRNA-ARK2 than the wild type or OE-ARK2 (t = −12.764, df = 18, P value = 9.284e-11), and (3) FLA transcript levels show ARK2-dependent differential expression in response to GA treatment in tension wood and opposite wood (P values < 0.001). Specifically, FLA levels are induced by GA treatment in tension wood for OE-ARK2 and the wild type, but miRNA-ARK2 shows repression of FLA transcript levels by GA. These results are reminiscent of the responses of these same genotypes to GA treatment with regards to maturation of G-layers as assayed by JIM14 immunolocalization (Supplemental Figure 8). Additionally, FLA levels are repressed by GA in opposite wood of wild-type and miRNA-ARK2 trees, but increased by GA in opposite wood of OE-ARK2. Thus, the response to GA is different across both wood types and ARK2 genotypes, potentially revealing a developmental switch set in place by the initial graviresponse and radial auxin transport that is sensitive to ARK2 transcript levels.DISCUSSION The negative gravitropism of woody angiosperm stems is fundamentally different from that of herbaceous stems. The herbaceous stem achieves negative gravitropism through differential growth on the bottom of the stem that pushes the stem upward. By contrast, the woody stem undergoes differential growth on the top of the stem to produce tension wood that pulls the stem upward with contractile forces (Sinnott, 1952; Wilson and Archer, 1977; Ruelle, 2014). In this study, we identified key regulatory mechanisms involved in negative gravitropic responses in woody Populus stems, including the cells responsible for graviperception, the initial graviresponse via relocalization of the PIN3 auxin transporter, and interacting roles for auxin, GA, and the ARK2 transcription factor in regulating fiber development and gravibending. Using Populus as a model species, we found that graviperception likely occurs directly in the woody stem in specialized cells containing starch-filled amyloplasts that sediment toward the ground. These cells are further defined by expression of the auxin transport protein, PIN3, which relocalizes toward the ground during gravistimulation. The PIN3-expressing cells are initially found in the endodermis, similar to what has been found in Arabidopsis (Friml et al., 2002) and other herbaceous stems, but later in development cells within the secondary phloem acquire PIN3 expression and possess amyloplasts. Thus, even though the endodermis is eventually lost during the outward expansion of the cortex during secondary growth, older woody stems can continue to sense gravity as new cells within the secondary phloem acquire PIN3 expression. Importantly, the reorientation of PIN3 toward the ground in gravistimulated woody stems would be predicted to have different outcomes on auxin transport in the top versus bottom of the stem. Because of the radial organization of the stem, on the top (tension wood side) of a gravistimulated stem PIN3 orientation is toward the cambium and center of the stem, whereas in the bottom (opposite wood side) of the stem PIN3 orientation is toward the cortex and periphery of the stem. These orientations are reflected in expression of a DR5:GUS reporter in our experiments, which shows preferential cambial expression on the top and cortical expression in the bottom of gravistimulated stems. This lateral auxin transport and response represents the earliest known graviresponse of woody stems and provides an obvious initial mechanism triggering the different developmental fates of xylem tissues that develop on the top (tension wood) versus bottom (opposite wood) of the gravistimulated stem. Our results concerning the location of graviperceptive cells and radial auxin transport in the tension wood versus opposite wood side of gravistimulated stems may also help in understanding previous, apparently conflicting, research results. Exogenous application of auxin to the upper surface of a leaning stem resulted in inhibition of tension wood formation (Cronshaw and Morey, 1968), while application of antiauxins induces tension wood (Cronshaw and Morey, 1965). These results led to the proposition that low auxin levels in the cambium induce tension wood development. However, direct measurement of auxin in gravistimulated Populus stems did not detect lower levels in cambia producing tension wood in comparison to cambia in upright trees; in fact, significantly lower auxin levels were found for cambia producing opposite wood (Hellgren et al., 2004). Our results would suggest that exogenous auxin application could likely mimic the conditions in the opposite wood side of the stem, where auxin transport would result in higher auxin and auxin response in the cortex than the cambial zone. The lower levels of auxin reported for the cambial region on the bottom of the stem (producing opposite wood) are consistent with auxin transport away from the cambium, as suggested by PIN3 localization and the DR5:GUS reporter in our experiments. However, the previous observation that levels of auxin in cambia producing tension wood are not higher than those for cambia producing normal wood (Hellgren et al., 2004) may indicate that it is not necessarily the absolute concentration of auxin in the cambial zone that determines the type of wood produced by the cambium. Instead, the relative amounts of auxin across the radially arranged secondary vascular tissues or differential sensitivity of auxin across these tissues may be more important. It is also possible that auxin itself is not directly inducing the different developmental outcomes at the cambial zone, but rather is involved in generating the signals that more directly elicit the developmental changes. Auxin is not the only hormone influencing wood development, and we found GA to be an important hormonal regulator of tension wood, capable of stimulating fiber production and gravibending. Interestingly, previous authors have also attributed positive regulation of tension wood development to GA and speculated, based on gene expression and direct measurement of GA, that GA precursors may be synthesized in the phloem and transported to the xylem, potentially though rays (Israelsson et al., 2005). The rays interconnect the secondary xylem (wood), cambium, and secondary phloem (Lev-Yudan and Aloni, 1995) and, although their role in development is poorly understood, could be important in radial signaling in woody stems. For example, radial movement of auxin from the primary vascular bundles to the cambial zone has been demonstrated in Populus and likely involves the rays (Spicer et al., 2013). Strikingly, ectopic application of GA can induce tension wood formation (Nakamura et al., 1994), making it a good candidate for a more direct signal controlling differentiation downstream of auxin. We found that transcriptional responses to GA treatment were sensitive to ARK2 transcript levels and that, in contrast with wild-type or ARK2 overexpressing trees, trees with reduced ARK2 transcript abundance failed to produce additional tension wood fibers in response to GA treatment. These results would be consistent with the idea that decreased levels of ARK2 transcript are associated with elevated GA levels, similar to previous work in herbaceous species that have demonstrated a direct positive regulation of GA catabolism-related and negative regulation of GA biosynthesis-related genes by Class I KNOX transcription factors (Sakamoto et al., 2001; Jasinski et al., 2005; Bolduc and Hake, 2009). In addition, we found that GA potentiated the expression of the auxin-responsive DR5:GUS reporter in gravistimulated stems. This result is reminiscent of previous studies in trees showing GA stimulation of polar auxin transport during wood development (Bjorklund et al., 2007) and of reports of GA regulation of PIN protein stability and localization during root gravitropism in Arabidopsis (Willige et al., 2011; Löfke et al., 2013). Additionally, we found evidence that fiber production can be genetically decoupled from the maturation of cell walls competent of generating contractile force. We imaged two molecular markers of functional tension wood G-layers: JIM14 immunolocalization of arabinogalactan proteins (including FLAs) and XET in gravistimulated stems of wild-type trees and trees with increased or decreased ARK2 transcripts. Stems with decreased ARK2 transcript abundance produce more fibers but are delayed in fiber maturation (as assayed by Jim14 and XET labeling) and display reduced gravibending. Stems with increased ARK2 transcripts produce fewer fibers, but fiber maturation and gravibending are enhanced. Thus, force generation and gravibending can be genetically decoupled from fiber differentiation, per se. While we expect that the dramatic differences in fiber maturation among ARK2 genotypes is a primary factor, undoubtedly other differences such as stem stiffness also contribute to the observed differences in gravibending among these genotypes. We used GA treatment, ARK2 transcript levels, and gravistimulation as perturbations of gene expression to model gene coexpression networks underlying tension wood formation. An unexpected finding using comparisons of differentially expressed gene transcripts across all treatments was that opposite wood undergoes a massive reprogramming of gene expression. While typically assumed to play a passive role in gravibending, these results suggest the possibility of an active role, perhaps through production of signals or metabolic contributions to gravitropism. To more fully extract information from the transcriptome data, gene modules were defined based on gene coexpression across wood types, genotypes, and GA treatments. Each module was annotated and characterized based on correlations with wood phenotypes, GA response, ARK2 binding to genes within specific modules, correlations with wood properties, and enrichment of member genes in specific gene ontology categories. These annotations allowed us to not only identify gene modules of interest for further study, but also define relationships among modules and make inferences about mechanisms regulating xylem development. For example, of the three modules showing significant correlations with microfibril angle and cellulose crystallinity (traits strongly associated with tension wood), only two were correlated with GA treatment, potentially reflecting our experimental data showing the primary effect of GA was in promoting fiber development but not cell wall development. We were also able to dissect modules based on annotations, module membership (a measure of connectivity of a gene with other genes in the module), and differential expression across treatments. For example, ARK2 showed only modest connectivity and differential expression across wood types. Along with the observation that ARK2 binds to large numbers of genes of diverse function, these properties suggest that ARK2 is not a “master regulator” but rather influences the expression of genes of different function, potentially to integrate different developmental processes. This would be consistent with reports of KNOX genes regulating both hormone-related as well as cell wall-related genes in other model species (Sakamoto et al., 2001; Mele et al., 2003; Jasinski et al., 2005; Bolduc and Hake, 2009; Bolduc et al., 2012). The interaction of GA and ARK2 in regulating tension wood development was evident not only in experimental data, but also in coexpression analyses. A coexpression module was selected for dissection that showed significant correlations with tension wood properties and contained a large number of FLAs implicated in the tension wood development and function (Lafarguette et al., 2004; Andersson-Gunneras et al., 2006; Azri et al., 2014). Interestingly, the expression of these FLA genes was differential across both wood types and ARK2 genotypes in response to GA, similar to what we observed in response to GA treatment of fiber production and maturation across ARK2 genotypes. Taken together, these results are consistent with ARK2 negatively regulating GA levels, as has been reported in other species (Sakamoto et al., 2001; Hay et al., 2002; Bolduc and Hake, 2009), but also having an additional role in regulating cell differentiation and cell wall biosynthesis. In conclusion, the results from these studies not only provide insights into the regulation of gravitropism and wood formation in angiosperm trees, but also demonstrate that the combination of experimental and computational approaches can be used to dissect complex developmental traits in these long-lived organisms. Challenges for future studies include determining the evolutionary relationships of graviperception and graviresponse mechanisms in woody versus herbaceous stems and roots and whether the mechanisms described here for Populus also function across the amazing diversity of angiosperm tree species.METHODS Replication In all experiments, a minimum of three biological replicates were included for each treatment.Plant Growth The genetic background of all trees utilized is hybrid aspen (Populus alba × Populus tremula) clone INRA 717-IB4. Representative ARK2 transgenic genotypes were selected from those previously described and characterized (Du et al., 2009). The creation and characterization of the DR5:GUS reporter line was characterized and reported previously (Spicer et al., 2013). Plants were grown at ∼22°C under continuous light provided by Philips TL830 and TL850 fluorescent bulbs. Plants used for time-lapse movies, immunolocalizations, XET labeling, GUS expression assays, and histology were transferred to soil (Sunshine Mix 4; SunGro Horticulture) in 0.5-liter pots, covered by a transparent lid (Super Sprouter), and adjusted to ambient humidity over the course of 2 weeks. Plants were used for experiments after 2 months growth in soil with water supplemented with Miracle Grow fertilizer using the concentration recommended by the manufacturer. For GA soil drench treatments, 50 mL of 0.01% GA (Sigma-Aldrich G-7645) in water was added to each pot to give an approximate concentration of 29 µmol GA in the soil. Plants were grown for four additional days after GA treatment prior to gravistimulation.Histology, Imaging, and Auxin Transport Measurement Time-lapse movies were captured using Wingscape time-lapse digital cameras (Wingscapes; EBSCO Industries). Plants were positioned horizontally and imaged once every 10 min on the first day and then once per hour for 2 weeks. Quantification of stem lift and curvature was analyzed using custom R scripts, using data derived from digitized tracings of stems from individual frames taken from time-lapse movies. Tracings analyzed were from the base of the stem to the apex of curvature (defined as the basal point of tropism of the primary, herbaceous portion of the stem). Stems were sectioned for histology using a Vibratome Series 1000 (Heath Company) to a thickness of 50 to 100 µm. Sections for anatomical assays were stained with astra blue and phloroglucinol (Ruzin, 1999) and visualized with a Leica DMB compound microscope using a Leica DFC450C digital camera with live image stitching using Leica Live Image Builder software. For XET activity visualization, XXXG-SR was synthesized as previously described (Nishikubo et al., 2007). The previously described labeling protocol (Nishikubo et al., 2007) was modified by utilizing Vibratome sections rather than hand-sections and by blocking sections (25 mM MES, pH 5.5, 1% BSA, and 2% fish gelatin) prior to incubation with 4 µg/mL XXXG-SR in block. For estimation of background signal, sections were boiled for 10 min prior to blocking and incubation with XXXG-SR. After overnight incubation at room temperature, sections were rinsed four times with 25 mM MES and then stepped gradually into a wash solution of 15:1:4 ethanol:formic acid:water. After multiple changes of wash solutions, sections were stepped back to 25 mM MES prior to imaging on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. The Pt-PIN3 antibody was raised against a conjugated peptide (DQREKEGPTGLNKLGSS-C) unique to paralogous Populus PIN3-like proteins Potri.008G129400 and Potri.010G112800 in rabbits and used at a dilution of 1:250. To assay specificity of the antibody, membrane proteins were extracted from both leaf and stem tissues of P. alba × P. tremula clone INRA 717-IB4. Tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen and suspended in an extraction buffer before extraction as previously described (Abas and Luschnig, 2010). Resulting pellets were frozen at −80°C and then thawed and subjected to a second extraction using transmembrane protein extraction reagent (FIVEphoton Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Immunolocalizations were performed using Vibratome stem sections that were fixed at room temperature in formalin, acetic acid, and alcohol for 45 min under vacuum. Sections were then stepped to PBT (1× PBS with 0.2% Tween 20) and washed four times 15 min each. Sections were then blocked (1× PBS, 2% fish gelatin, 1% BSA, and 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h prior to addition of the primary antibody. The JIM14 antibody was obtained from the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (University of Georgia, Athens, GA) and used at a dilution of 1:500. After overnight incubation at 4°C, sections were washed four times in 1× PBT, blocked for 1 h, and probed with biotin-labeled antibodies (for JIM14, biotin-xx-goat-anti-rat IgG, Life Technologies A10517; for Pt-PIN3 biotin-xx-goat-anti-rabbit IgG, Life Technologies B2770) at 1:400 dilution. After overnight incubation at 4°C, sections were washed four times with PBT, blocked for 1 h, and 4 μL Streptavidin Alexa Flour-488 (Life Technologies S11223) added per milliliter of block. After 0.5 h incubation at room temperature, sections were washed four times with PBT prior to visualization on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. GUS staining was performed on 100- to 150-µm thick sections by vacuum infiltration of staining solution (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/mL X-glucuronide, and 100 µg/mL chloramphenicol) followed by overnight incubation at 37°. Sections were cleared in 70% ethanol prior to imaging on a Leica DMLB compound microscope with Leica DFC450C digital camera and live image stitching using Leica Live Image Builder software. Basipetal (toward the root) auxin transport was measured in stems of poplar seedlings in tissue culture (Groover et al., 2006) using a radio-tracer auxin transport assay adapted from Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescences (Lewis and Muday, 2009). Developmentally matched seedlings with consistent stem thickness were stripped of leaves and cut 20 and 40 mm from the shoot apex, forming a 20-mm section. These samples were inverted and placed into an open 0.5-mL microcentrifuge tube containing 200 μL 100 nM 3H-IAA (24 Ci/mmol; American Radiochemical) such that the apical cut end was submerged. Assay tubes were placed in a sealed box filled with water to prevent evaporation. After 18 h, the seedlings were removed and the apical 10 mm from the site of auxin application was removed and discarded. The next remaining 10-mm basal section was then divided into 2-mm segments and assayed for radioactivity in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. The average and se of 3H-IAA in each sample is reported relative to the distance to the apical end.RNA-seq and ChIP-seq Plants grown as described previously were transferred to 8-liter pots in Sunshine Mix 4 (SunGro Horticulture) and grown in a greenhouse in Placerville, CA without supplemental light for 3 months. For GA soil drench treatments, 0.01% GA in water was added to each pot to give an approximate concentration of 29 µm GA in the soil. Trees subjected to gravistimulation were placed horizontally 4 d after GA treatments were applied, and differentiating xylem for RNA-seq was harvested from all plants 2 d after gravistimulation commenced. For gravistimulated trees, bark was removed from the top (for tension wood) or bottom (for opposite wood) quarter of the stem and differentiating xylem harvested by light scraping with a sterile double-edged razor blade. For upright trees, the stem was randomly divided in half, and two xylem samples were independently harvested from opposing sides. For all trees, xylem was harvested from the twentieth leaf to the midpoint of the total length of the stem and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated by grinding the tissue to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen, followed by extraction using Trizol (Life Technologies) using the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. RNA samples were then treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) prior to secondary isolation using the Qiagen RNeasy kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. Quality and quantity of RNA was assessed using Qubit (Life Technologies) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), respectively, prior to generation of RNA-seq libraries using the Illumina TruSeq Library Preparation Kit V2. Six samples were multiplexed into each lane of an Illumina HiSeq run to produce 50-bp single-end reads. ARK2 ChIP-seq data were produced and analyzed as previously described (Liu et al., 2015) and are available as  SRI accession SRP0533 or through popGENIE (http://popgenie.org/).Bioinformatics For each RNA-seq library, contamination from adaptor sequences was removed using scythe V0.95 (https://github.com/vsbuffalo/scythe), and sequenced reads were trimmed using sickle (Joshi and Fass, 2011) with default settings. Sequenced reads were then mapped to the Populus genome assembly V3.0 (http://www.phytozome.net/poplar.php) using TopHat v2.0.6 (Trapnell et al., 2009), and reads for Populus V3.0 gene models were counted using HTseq (Trapnell et al., 2009) version 0.5.4p1. Gene expression levels were calculated as reads per kilobase per million reads using the TMM normalization method in the package edgeR V3.6.8 (Robinson et al., 2010). All statistical analyses were implemented in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) unless stated otherwise. Coexpression and module analyses were performed using functions from the R package WGCNA V1.41-1 (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008) and publically available scripts (http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/). Briefly, coexpression relationships between genes were summarized as an adjacency matrix and raised to the soft threshold power of eight. The soft threshold power was determined based on a greater 80% model fit to scale-free topology and low mean connectivity. Coexpression modules were defined as clusters of highly interconnected genes and calculated using hierarchical clustering of dissimilarity of the topological overlap measure. Hierarchical clustering was performed using dynamic tree cutting with a minimum module size of 500 and a cut height of 0.998, and closely related modules (0.3) based on module eigengene values were collapsed. Module stability was assessed by resampling 75% of the RNA-seq libraries and rerunning the coexpression analysis 20 times (Langfelder and Horvath, 2012). Traits were related to modules using module eigengene values. Module correlations for experimental treatments such as ARK2 genotype, wood type, and GA treatments were tested using ANOVA, and wood chemistry phenotypes were tested using Fisher’s exact tests. Enrichment of ARK2 ChIP-seq binding in coexpression modules was determined based on a one-tailed hypergeometric distribution. Hub genes in the pink module were identified as genes that had high gene significance with wood type and high module membership in the pink module. Gene significance was calculated as the correlation between gene expression (reads per kilobase per million reads) and wood type. Module membership was calculated as the correlation between gene expression and module eigengene values for the pink module. Functional enrichment of coexpression modules was based on GO enrichment and calculated using Arabidopsis best BLAST hit of Populus gene models. GO analysis was performed using Arabidopsis GO annotations because categories related to relevant categories (including meristem, shoot development, hormones, cell wall and cellulose) have limited annotation in Populus. Analyses were performed using the Bioconductor package GOstats V2.30.0 (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007) with P < 0.01.Wood Chemistry and Cell Wall Phenotyping A micro-Klason method was applied to quantify lignin and cell wall carbohydrates (Coleman et al., 2007). Approximately 200 mg of extracted, oven-dried wood was reacted in a 125-mL serum bottle with 3 mL of 20°C 72% (w/w) sulfuric acid (H2SO4), with thorough mixing with a glass rod for 1 min every 10 min, followed by mixing for 15 s every 10 min thereafter. After 2 h, 112 mL deionized water was added to the reaction. The serum bottles were then sealed and immediately autoclaved at 121°C for 60 min. Sugar standards were subjected to the same treatment. Samples were allowed to cool and settle at 4°C and were vacuum-filtered through preweighed medium coarseness (M) sintered-glass crucibles. Each sample was washed (and the serum bottle also rinsed) with 200 mL warm (∼50°C) deionized water to remove residual acid and sugars and dried overnight at 105°C. The dry crucibles were reweighed to determine Klason lignin (acid-insoluble lignin) gravimetrically. The filtrate was then analyzed for acid-soluble lignin by absorbance at 205 nm using a UV/Vis spectrometer. Samples had to be diluted with 4% H2SO4 to reach an absorbance value between 0.2 and 0.7. The concentrations for neutral cell wall-associated carbohydrates (glucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, rhamnose, and arabinose) in the hydrolyzate were determined using HPLC. Prior to injection, samples were filtered through 0.45-μm HV filters (Millipore). The samples for HPLC runs were prepared by exact weights of ∼950 mg hydrolyzate + 50 mg fucose as the internal standard. The concentrations of sugar monosaccharides were determined using a Dionex HPLC system (DX-600) equipped with an ion exchange PA1 column (Dionex), a pulsed amperometric detector with a gold electrode, and a SpectraAS3500 auto injector (Spectra-Physics). The column was equilibrated with 250 mM NaOH and eluted with deionized water at flow rate of 1 mL/min. Total lignin content was calculated as the sum of the Klason lignin and soluble lignin fractions. Lignin and cell wall sugar content was determined as a percentage of dry wood, based on the initial weight of the extract-free wood sample analyzed. Microfibril angle and cell wall crystallinity were determined by x-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8 Discover x-ray diffraction unit equipped with an area array detector (GADDS) on the radial face of the wood section precision cut (1.68 mm) from the growing stem isolated from the tension wood and opposite wood sections isolated from 10 cm above the root collar. Wide-angle diffraction was used in transmission mode, and the measurements were performed with CuKα1 radiation (λ = 1.54 Å), the x-ray source fit with a 0.5-mm collimator, and the scattered photon collected by a GADDS detector. Both the x-ray source and the detector were set to θ = 0° for microfibril angle determination, while the 2 θ (source) was set to 17° for wood crystallinity determination. The average T-value of the two 002 diffraction arc peaks was used for microfibril angle calculations, as per the method of Ukrainetz et al. (2008), while crystallinity was determined by mathematically fitting the data using the method of Coleman et al. (2007). Crystallinity measures were precalibrated by capturing diffractograms of pure Acetobacter xylinum bacterial cellulose (known to be 87% crystalline). Fiber length was analyzed using the woody material isolated from the tension wood and opposite wood side of each specimen, according to Park et al. (2008). In brief, each sample was macerated in a solution consisting of 30% hydrogen peroxide and glacial acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio (Franklin solution) at 70°C for 48 h. Following the reaction, the remaining fibrous material was washed with deionized water until the samples were neutralized.

    "title": "Endosidin2 targets conserved exocyst complex subunit EXO70 to inhibit exocytosis",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10264680/",
    "abstract": "Abstract To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake. Additionally, we quantified the effect of ES2 on the spatial distribution of EXO70A1 with live-cell imaging. Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex mediates constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth. Keywords: plasma membrane protein enrichment, exocytosis, proteomics, small molecule inhibitors, exocyst",
    "introduction": "Introduction The plant plasma membrane serves as a selective physical barrier between intracellular contents and the environment as well as a signaling platform for transmitting information from the exterior to induce cellular responses. Plasma membrane proteins can be classified as integral, lipid-anchored, and peripheral, based on the mode of association with the plasma membrane (Stillwell, 2016). Integral membrane proteins possess one to several transmembrane domains; lipid-anchored proteins associate with the plasma membrane through covalently attached fatty acids; peripheral membrane proteins associate with the plasma membrane through interactions with other membrane proteins, polar head groups of the lipid bilayer, or both. Several well-characterized plasma membrane-localized nutrient transporters, hormone receptors and transporters, and cell wall biosynthetic enzymes are known to undergo constitutive delivery and turnover (Li et al., 2002; Friml, 2010; Takano et al., 2010; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2011; Irani et al., 2012; Bashline et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2018; Vellosillo et al., 2021). Proteomic analyses of plasma membrane proteins reveal that the composition is altered in response to biotic and abiotic stresses (Nohzadeh Malakshah et al., 2007; Nouri and Komatsu, 2010; Elmore et al., 2012; Takahashi et al., 2013; Nie et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Voothuluru et al., 2016); however, the mechanisms for delivery of most of these plasma membrane proteins are not well characterized. Investigating how plants maintain the variety, abundance, and dynamics of plasma membrane proteins is essential for understanding cell growth, development, and response to stresses. The conventional plant secretory pathway involves trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles to deliver lipids and proteins to the plasma membrane or extracellular space (Denecke et al., 2012; Drakakaki and Dandekar, 2013; Zhu et al., 2020; Aniento et al., 2022). The exocyst complex is a conserved octameric protein complex that primarily functions to mediate the tethering of secretory vesicles to the site of membrane fusion during the last step of exocytic trafficking (Elias et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2010; Žárský et al., 2013; Wu and Guo, 2015; Synek et al., 2021; Žárský, 2022). In addition, the exocyst complex also associates with the endocytic and autophagy machinery to modulate membrane recycling and autophagy (Prigent et al., 2003; Kulich et al., 2013; Žárský et al., 2013; Ortega et al., 2022; Žárský, 2022). One plant exocyst subunit, EXO70A1, was recently characterized as a landmark for exocyst complex recruitment to the plasma membrane, through its interactions with anionic phospholipids (Synek et al., 2021). Loss of EXO70A1 function disrupts the recruitment of other exocyst subunits to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells (Synek et al., 2021). Some known cargo proteins for plant exocyst complex-mediated trafficking include PIN auxin transporters (Drdová et al., 2013), brassinosteroid receptor (Zhang et al., 2016), and cellulose synthase complexes (Zhu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). However, it is not known what other plasma membrane proteins are delivered to the plasma membrane through the exocyst complex. Whereas the half-life for turnover of plasma membrane proteins in mammalian cells varies from a few hours to a few days (Tweto and Doyle, 1976; Doyle and Baumann, 1979; Chu and Doyle, 1985), we know much less about the mechanisms and dynamics of protein delivery to the plasma membrane in plants. Previously, the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) was shown to target the EXO70A1 subunit of Arabidopsis exocyst complex and to inhibit exocytosis in plant and mammalian cells (Zhang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019). Short-term ES2 treatment inhibits the transport of PIN-FORMED (PIN) family auxin transporter, PIN2, and the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1, to the plasma membrane (Zhang et al., 2016), and also impairs the recycling of PIN2 (Lešková et al., 2020). In mammalian cells, ES2 treatment reduces the cell surface abundance of a membrane-anchored metalloproteinase MT2-MMP (Gómez-Escudero et al., 2017). In addition, given the role of the exocyst complex in autophagy, a recent study examined the consequences of ES2 treatment in autophagy events in mammalian cells, and found that a 24-h ES2 treatment resulted in decreased autophagy (Ortega et al., 2022). To characterize changes in plasma membrane protein composition after short-term inhibition of the exocyst complex, and to identify additional proteins that are transported through the exocyst complex, we used ES2 to inhibit the exocyst complex. We enriched plasma membrane from roots of Arabidopsis seedlings treated with ES2 and DMSO solvent control and identified proteins using mass spectrometry analysis. We then performed quantitative and comparative proteomic analyses to identify plasma membrane proteins with altered abundance in ES2-treated samples and considered proteins with reduced abundance as candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking in plants. We identified a subset of proteins with significantly reduced abundance at the plasma membrane after two hours of 40 μM ES2 treatment. Gene Ontology analysis of proteins with reduced abundance demonstrated enrichment for functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, membrane transport, hormone signaling, and stress responses. The abundance of many protein kinases and several uncharacterized proteins was reduced by ES2 treatment as well. Our results show that the exocyst complex mediates dynamic transport of a diverse set of proteins essential for plant growth and environmental adaptation.",

    "results": "Results Plasma membrane enrichment We chose to use a transgenic line expressing PIP2A-GFP as the plant material for our experiments because PIP2A-GFP is localized predominantly at the plasma membrane by microscopy and its cellular localization is not affected by 2 h of 40 μM ES2 treatment (Cutler et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2016). The GFP tag also allowed the use of anti-GFP antibody to examine the quality of enriched plasma membrane fractions. Six-day-old PIP2A-GFP seedlings were treated with either 40 μM ES2 or 0.5% DMSO for 2 h, a condition in which plant exocytosis is reduced but not completely inhibited (Zhang et al., 2016). After treatment, roots were excised and used for plasma membrane enrichment ( Figure 1A ). We adapted a protocol that allows quick enrichment of plasma membrane and does not require large amounts of plant tissue (Zhang and Peck, 2011; Collins et al., 2017). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Characterization of enriched plasma membrane fractions shows the high quality of the sample preparation. (A) Flowchart of sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis. (B) Western blot characterization of enriched plasma membrane fractions. Protein amount of 12.5 μg from total protein (total), soluble protein (sup.), crude membrane fraction (crude M.) and enriched plasma membrane fraction (e.PM) was separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The same membrane was blotted with anti-GFP, anti-Sec12 and anti-SYP41 antibodies. (C) The Venn diagram comparing the proteins that were identified from different proteomics experiments.Enrichment was evaluated by detecting the presence of proteins known to localize to the plasma membrane (PIP2A-GFP) (Cutler et al., 2000), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Sec12) (Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997), and Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) (SYP41) (Bassham et al., 2000) in different fractions using Western blots with anti-GFP, anti-Sec12, and anti-SYP41 antibodies, respectively ( Figure 1B ). PIP2A-GFP was enriched in the plasma membrane fraction when compared to the crude membrane fraction ( Figure 1B , anti-GFP). The ER membrane protein, Sec12, was detected in both crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions; however, the abundance of Sec12 in the plasma membrane fraction was markedly lower than the crude membrane fraction ( Figure 1B , anti-Sec12). The Golgi/TGN protein, SYP41, was detected in the crude membrane fraction but not in the enriched plasma membrane fraction ( Figure 1B , anti-SYP41). Immunoblots demonstrated that although proteins from other organelles were present in the enriched plasma membrane fraction, their abundance was substantially reduced in comparison with plasma membrane proteins. We prepared four independent biological replicates of enriched plasma membrane fractions for the mass spectrometry proteomics analysis. Mass spectrometry analyses of enriched plasma membrane proteins From each enriched plasma membrane fraction, 25 μg of protein was digested with Lys-C and trypsin. Resulting peptides from ES2-treated plant samples were dimethyl labeled with 12CH2O (light, L) and peptides from DMSO-treated samples were dimethyl labeled with 13CD2O (heavy, H). Dimethyl-labeled peptides from ES2-treatment and control samples were combined and fractionated before LC-MS/MS analysis. The peptides that were detected by LC-MS/MS were assigned to proteins and the abundance of each protein was calculated through a MaxQuant database search. The ratio of each protein’s abundance in differentially labeled samples was calculated using the same process. The data were processed further with the Perseus platform by filtering out rows with invalid values (potential contaminants, the reverse peptides, and peptides only identified by site) from the MaxQuant database search. We further filtered the data by removing proteins with less than three detected values in the four replicates. To compare the data from different replicates, the ratio of protein abundance between differentially labeled proteins was transformed to log2 phase and further normalized by median subtraction and then analyzed by histogram ( Supplemental Figure S1 ). The normal distribution of log2 phase of ratios centered by zero between differentially labeled proteins indicates that the majority of proteins that we detected were not altered by ES2 treatment. We detected 3675 proteins from four independent replicate experiments ( Supplementary Table S1 ). To further evaluate the plasma membrane preparation, we compared our protein list with those published from different Arabidopsis tissues using another plasma membrane preparation method ( Figure 1C ). First, we compared our plasma membrane protein list with one generated from two-week-old liquid cultured Arabidopsis seedlings using a two-phase partition of microsomes and Trypsin-catalyzed 18O labeling (Nelson et al., 2006). We found 295 overlapping proteins, accounting for 95% of the proteins detected in Nelson et al.’s experiments (309 proteins in total) ( Figure 1C ). Elmore et al. used an aqueous two-phase partitioning approach for leaves of four-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown in soil condition and consistently identified more than 1300 proteins in replicate experiments (Elmore et al., 2012). We found 960 overlapping proteins, accounting for more than 70% of the proteins detected in Elmore et al.’s experiments ( Figure 1C ). Li et al. isolated plasma membrane fractions from Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells using a two-phase partition method and identified over 600 proteins by proteomic analysis (Li et al., 2012). About 60% of the proteins that were detected from cultured cells were consistently identified in our experiments ( Figure 1C ). Substantial overlap between our plasma membrane protein list and others that use a different method or tissue indicates that our proteomic data can be used to compare the effects of ES2 on the abundance of plasma membrane proteins. To examine whether the enriched plasma membrane fraction was free from contaminants from other large membrane-bound compartments, we checked our proteomics list for the presence of proteins residing in the nuclear envelope and vacuole. The nuclear envelope protein SAD1/UNC-84 DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 (SUN1, AT5G04990; Oda and Fukuda, 2011) was detected, but its abundance was unchanged following ES2 treatment, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.00. Another nuclear envelope protein SAD1/UNC-84 DOMAIN PROTEIN 2 (SUN2, AT3G10730; Oda and Fukuda, 2011) was not detected. The vacuole membrane protein TONOPLAST INTRINSIC PROTEIN 1;1 (γ-TIP or TIP1;1, AT2G36830; Nelson et al., 2006) was not detected. These results indicate that the enriched plasma membrane fraction was relatively free from contamination of nuclear envelope or vacuolar membranes. To investigate whether ES2 treatment altered the membrane identity of the plasma membrane fraction, we checked our proteomics list for the presence of several markers of membrane-bound organelles. The autophagosome markers ATG8e (AT2G45170) and ATG8f (AT4G16520) were not detected. The early endosome marker ARA6 (AT3G54840; Ebine et al., 2011), ER marker SEC12 (AT2G04170; Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997), and Golgi marker SYP32 (AT3G24350) and ALPHA-MANNOSIDASE 1 (ManI, AT1G51590; Kajiura et al., 2010) were all present but unchanged following ES2 treatment, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.06 for ARA6, 0.05 for SEC12, 0.00 for SYP32, and -0.01 for ManI ( Supplementary Table S1 ). These results indicate that the membrane identify of the plasma membrane was not altered following ES2 treatment. To identify proteins with altered abundance after ES2 treatment, we performed a moderated t-test (Smyth, 2004) for each protein using the limma package in R. The moderated t-test uses a hierarchical empirical Bayesian model to shrink the sample standard deviation estimates for each protein towards a pooled value. This stabilizes the t-statistics and increases the power of the test to detect true differences in protein abundance. Since multiple significance tests were performed, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to bound the expected false-discovery rate at 10%. After the correction, 330 proteins had adjusted p-values less than 0.10. Thus, we can estimate that roughly 300 of the 330 proteins have log2 ratios significantly different from 0. Among these 330 proteins, 145 had reduced abundance ( Supplementary Tables S2 , S3 ) and 185 had increased abundance ( Supplementary Table S4 ) in the plasma membrane fraction of ES2-treated samples. To highlight the proteins with the most dramatic changes, the top twenty proteins with decreased and increased abundance were listed in Tables 1 , 2 , respectively. Because ES2 binds to the EXO70A1 subunit of the exocyst complex and inhibits its function (Zhang et al., 2016), and because EXO70A1 serves as a landmark for exocyst complex recruitment to the plasma membrane (Synek et al., 2021), we expect that proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane are candidate cargos of exocyst-mediated trafficking.

Confocal imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins following ES2 treatment To confirm the identification of proteins with reduced abundance after ES2 treatment, we performed live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells using laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Figure 2 ). We selected three protein candidates: the auxin efflux carrier protein PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN2), the leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinase of brassinosteroid signaling BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1), and the receptor kinase FERONIA (FER), each of which had reduced plasma membrane abundance after ES2 treatment in our proteomics analysis. PIN2 had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.27, BRI1 had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.31, and FER had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.38. ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We quantified GFP-tagged protein fluorescence intensity on the plasma membrane and normalized by subtracting the mean background fluorescence intensity from a cytoplasmic compartment-free region ( Figure 2C ). The abundance of all three proteins at the plasma membrane region were significantly decreased after a 2-h ES2 treatment ( Figure 2D ). To further evaluate the change of abundance between the plasma membrane and entire cytoplasmic region, we also quantified the plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratio as another indicator of plasma membrane protein abundance ( Figure 2E ). The plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratios for all three proteins were significantly reduced after a 2-h ES2 treatment compared to mock treatment ( Figure 2E ). Our analysis showed for the first time that the plasma membrane abundance of FER was decreased following ES2 treatment. As a negative control, we measured the abundance of PLASMA MEMBRANE INTRINSIC PROTEIN 2A (PIP2A), which was shown to have unaltered plasma membrane abundance after ES2 treatment in the proteomics analyses, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.05 ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The plasma membrane abundance and plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratio of PIP2A-GFP were not altered by ES2 treatment ( Figures 2D, E ). Figure 2.

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of candidate cargos for ES2-targeted trafficking To better understand the biological functions of the candidate cargo proteins for ES2-targeted trafficking, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the biological processes category on the 145 proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane using the PANTHER classification system (Mi et al., 2013; Mi et al., 2017). We found that 49 proteins could be classified into protein families that were enriched in abundance on our list when compared to their abundance in the reference list of Arabidopsis thaliana genome ( Figure 3 ). The fold enrichment for different biological processes ranged from 3.7 to 200. The 49 candidate exocytosis cargo proteins belong to gene families that function in plant cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, response to stresses and membrane transport ( Figure 3 ; Supplementary Table S2 ). The proteins for the regulation of DNA-templated transcription (GO:0006355), nucleic acid metabolic process (GO:0090304) and gene expression (GO:0010467) were much lower than the numbers that were expected from the Arabidopsis genome ( Figure 3 ), indicating the trafficking of these proteins was not mediated by the exocyst complex. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Gene Ontology terms of biological processes category that are enriched in our protein list with significantly reduced abundance after ES2 treatment. Numbers on each row represent: fold enrichment (total number of proteins in the category/number of proteins identified in the reduced protein list/number of proteins expected in reduced protein list). Fold enrichment represents the ratio of the number of proteins identified divided by the number of proteins expected in the list.We further examined the annotated functions of proteins with significantly reduced abundance in ES2-treated samples. We found the abundance of three primary cell wall cellulose synthases (CESA1, CESA3, and CESA6), CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-INTERACTIVE PROTEIN 1 (CSI1), and KORRIGAN (KOR) was significantly reduced in ES2-treated samples ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Proteins involved in lignin metabolism were also reduced, as were multiple proteins involved in brassinosteroid and auxin signaling. The abundance of some proteins that respond to cold and phosphate deficiency was significantly reduced in ES2-treated samples. Another group of proteins that was affected by ES2 treatment are transporters responsible for the movement of phosphate, sulphate, potassium, and oligopeptides across the plasma membrane. The abundance of two annexins involved in phloem sucrose unloading (Wang et al., 2018) was also significantly reduced ( Supplementary Table S2 ). In addition to the proteins mentioned above, there are other proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane, but they were not enriched in functional groups in the GO enrichment analysis. These include multiple receptor-like protein kinases, transporters, enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism and protein glycosylation, as well as proteins with uncharacterized functions. Although these proteins were not enriched in our list, they may have diverse functions and cellular localization patterns among different members of the family. Collectively, our GO term enrichment analysis indicates that the exocyst complex mediates constitutive transport of numerous proteins that function in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, and membrane transport. Bioinformatic analysis of potential cargo proteins for plant exocyst complex Plants use both conventional and unconventional trafficking pathways to deliver proteins to the plasma membrane and extracellular space (Drakakaki and Dandekar, 2013; Ding et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2016; Aniento et al., 2022). In the conserved conventional trafficking pathway, proteins with a signal peptide are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum during translation and are then transported to Golgi through vesicles and further secreted through post-Golgi vesicles (Novick et al., 1981; Rothman, 2002; Schekman, 2010). However, increasing evidence from proteomic analysis shows that many proteins that are secreted out of the cell or targeted to the plasma membrane do not have signal peptides, indicating the existence of unconventional trafficking pathways for these proteins (Oh et al., 2005; Soares et al., 2007; Wen et al., 2007; Han et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2016). Plant exocyst complex has been shown to regulate cargo proteins through both conventional and unconventional pathways (Wang et al., 2010; Drdová et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015; Mayers et al., 2017). To test whether the candidate cargo proteins contain signal peptides that allow them to traffic through the conventional pathway, we analyzed the presence of signal peptides in proteins that had reduced abundance in ES2-treated samples using the DeepTMHMM package, a deep-learning method for signal peptide and transmembrane domain prediction (Hallgren et al., 2022). DeepTMHMM predicted that 36 of the 145 proteins with reduced abundance contained signal peptides ( Supplementary Table S5 ). The existence of a signal peptide in a small percentage of proteins indicates that consistent with previous findings, plant exocyst complex mediates the transport of proteins in both conventional and unconventional trafficking pathways. To understand how these candidate cargo proteins are associated to the plasma membrane, we analyzed the presence of potential transmembrane domains in these 145 proteins using the DeepTMHMM package. We found 64 of the 145 proteins were predicted to have at least one transmembrane domain ( Supplementary Table S5 ). The behavior of the exocyst complex and its regulators is different than candidate cargo proteins All eight subunits of the exocyst complex were detected in the enriched plasma membrane fractions ( Supplementary Table S1 ). However, we did not find a statistically significant reduction in their abundance in ES2-treated samples ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Among the eight exocyst subunits, only SEC3 showed a 13% reduction in the mean value after ES2 treatment but was not statistically different ( Supplementary Table S1 ). STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS-DEFECTIVE 1 (SCD1), a component of the candidate activator of plant RabE GTPase that regulates the exocyst complex (Mayers et al., 2017), was detected in plasma membrane fractions but its abundance was not altered by ES2 treatment ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We identified 12 Syntaxins of Plants (SYP), SYP111, SYP121, SYP122, SYP132, SYP21, SYP22, SYP32, SYP43, SYP51, SYP52, SYP61, and SYP71, but none of these were statistically significantly reduced ( Supplementary Table S1 ). In summary, our proteomics results indicate that the abundance of candidate tSNARE proteins, together with the exocyst complex and the SCD complex, were not significantly affected by a 2-h, 40 μM ES2 treatment. Confocal imaging of GFP-EXO70A1 following ES2 treatment To investigate whether ES2 affects the spatial distribution or abundance at the plasma membrane of its target, EXO70A1, we performed live imaging of root epidermal cells from GFP-EXO70A1 seedlings using laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Figure 4 ). Consistent with previous findings (Zhang et al., 2016; Larson et al., 2020; Synek et al., 2021), EXO70A1 in mock-treated epidermal cells showed a polarized distribution with highest abundance at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face, but was present at all six faces of the cell ( Figure 4A ). A 2-h, 40 µM ES2 treatment significantly reduced the abundance of EXO70A1 at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face ( Figures 4B, D ), and disrupted the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 at the outer periclinal face when fluorescence intensity was expressed as a ratio with the cytosolic region ( Figure 4E ) or as a ratio with the other faces of the same cell ( Figure 4F ). However, when EXO70A1 at the other three faces of the plasma membrane visible in medial optical sections, including the inner periclinal face and the two anticlinal faces (green line in Figure 4C ), was examined, the apparent abundance expressed as a ratio with cytosol was not affected by ES2 treatment ( Figure 4G ). When all four faces of the plasma membrane were combined and averaged, there was a modest decrease in the abundance of EXO70A1, but this was not statistically significant ( Figure 4H ). In total, a 2-h ES2 treatment had greatest effect on the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 and its association with the plasma membrane at the outer periclinal face of root epidermal cells, but a rather modest reduction in overall abundance at the plasma membrane on all faces of the cell. Figure 4. Open in a new tab The abundance of EXO70A1 at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face is decreased following ES2 treatment.

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of proteins with increased abundance after ES2 treatment Our statistical analysis identified 185 proteins with increased abundance in enriched plasma membrane fractions of ES2-treated samples ( Supplementary Table S4 ). To better understand the function of these proteins, we performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the biological function category. We found that this list of proteins is enriched in biological functions of COPII-coated vesicle cargo loading, mRNA catabolic process, negative regulation of translation, proton membrane transport, aerobic respiration, leaf senescence, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, and amide biosynthesis process ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). The functional relationship between exocyst complex and these proteins has not been well characterized. We speculate that some of these proteins might be involved in cellular responses to the inhibition of exocytosis.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Exocyst complex mediates constitutive transport of proteins with diverse functions during plant growth and development Using quantitative and comparative proteomics analysis, we identified 145 proteins with significantly reduced abundance at the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis roots following ES2 treatment. Some of these proteins possess transmembrane domains and are likely integral membrane proteins delivered to the plasma membrane by secretion. The candidate proteins without a predicted transmembrane domain could be associated with the plasma membrane through lipid anchors, through interaction with other membrane proteins, or by association with polar head groups of the lipid bilayer. These candidates of exocyst-mediated trafficking perform functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress responses, membrane transport, nutrient transport, and protein phosphorylation. The dynamics of many hormone-signaling proteins are well characterized; however, the role of exocyst complex in regulating their trafficking awaits further study. The functional diversity of proteins that are transported through the exocyst complex is consistent with the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in plants deficient for the exocyst complex (Cole et al., 2005; Synek et al., 2006; Hála et al., 2008; Fendrych et al., 2010; Kulich et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Pečenková et al., 2011; Drdová et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Kulich et al., 2015; Drdová et al., 2019; Ogura et al., 2019; Synek et al., 2021; Hématy et al., 2022). Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex plays essential roles for growth and adaptation by mediating constitutive transport of proteins with diverse functions to the plasma membrane. Some other important plasma membrane proteins, such as Rho family small GTPases (ROPs), multidrug resistance-like ABC transporter family proteins, and aquaporin plasma membrane intrinsic proteins were not affected by ES2 treatment in this proteomics study ( Supplementary Table S1 ), which is consistent with the previous live-cell imaging results (Zhang et al., 2016). Our current results indicate that these important plasma membrane proteins could have slow turnover rates or are not delivered to the plasma membrane through the ES2-targeted exocyst complex. Cargo protein exocytosis and exocyst complex membrane association Time-lapse imaging revealed that the plant exocyst complex colocalizes with its cargo protein (Cellulose Synthase Complex or CSC) during the tethering process and then separates from the cargo after successful fusion (Zhu et al., 2018; Zhang and Staiger, 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). In our proteomics study, we detected a significant reduction in the abundance of cargo proteins, such as cellulose synthases, but did not detect a statistically significant reduction in the abundance of the exocyst complex subunits. The abundance of SCD complex components and candidate tSNAREs on the plasma membrane was also not affected by ES2 treatment. Previous live-cell imaging data reveal that exocyst subunits are polarized to the outer periclinal face of root epidermal cells (Zhang et al., 2016; Larson et al., 2020; Synek et al., 2021) and are disrupted by ES2 treatment (Zhang et al., 2016) or genetic disruption of EXO70A1 (Synek et al., 2021), but not by genetic disruption of some SNARE proteins that physically interact with the exocyst complex (Larson et al., 2020). The plasma membrane enrichment reflects the overall abundance of each plasma membrane protein, but not their polarized distribution on a specific face of the plasma membrane. Results from live-cell imaging and our proteomics analyses indicated that ES2 treatment affected the polarized distribution of the exocyst complex in root epidermal cells but did not markedly affect its association with the plasma membrane. The lifetime of exocyst foci on the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells is around 10 s; however, inhibition of exocytosis by a 2-h Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment did not affect membrane localization of the exocyst complex (Fendrych et al., 2013). Thus, exocyst complex association with the plasma membrane may not depend on the other components of the exocytosis machinery. Previous studies demonstrate that exocyst subunits physically interact and associate with the SCD1/2 complex (Mayers et al., 2017), and EXO70 physically interacts with several SNAREs (Larson et al., 2020). Although ES2 disrupts the polarized localization of EXO70A1, our current data do not directly reflect whether ES2 disrupts the physical interaction of exocyst subunits with SCD1/2 complex or SNARE proteins, and/or affects the localization pattern of SCD1/2 and SNAREs. One future direction would be to quantify the localization of fluorescent-tagged SCD1/2 and SNAREs following ES2 treatment. Further, it would be interesting to quantify the association of exocyst subunits with other components of the exocytosis machinery through high spatial-temporal resolution live-cell imaging of double marker lines. Future directions in understanding plant plasma membrane protein dynamics Due to the importance of plant plasma membrane proteins, multiple comparative proteomic studies have been conducted to investigate the profiles of plasma membrane proteins in response to environmental stresses and cell growth status. The composition of plasma membrane proteins changes upon salt stress, cold treatment, osmotic stress, immune signaling, nutrient deficiency and different growth stages of cultured cells (Nohzadeh Malakshah et al., 2007; Nouri and Komatsu, 2010; Elmore et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018). These proteomic studies show that the plasma membrane serves as a hub for cells to respond to environmental and growth cues. These studies further indicate that the vesicle trafficking machinery that facilitates the transport of these proteins is essential for plants to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous findings on the essential functions of plant exocyst complex in plant growth and immune responses (Synek et al., 2006; Fendrych et al., 2010; Kulich et al., 2010; Kulich et al., 2015; Cole et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018; Žárský, 2022) support the hypothesis that the exocyst complex choreographs the dynamic change of specific proteins at the plasma membrane in response to different environmental stimuli and growth cues. In comparison with yeast and mammalian cells, we understand less about the mechanisms of plasma membrane protein delivery and turnover in plants. In this study, using very stringent filtering and cutoff, we found 145 proteins that have significantly (at 10% FDR) reduced abundance at the plasma membrane after a 2-h, 40 μM ES2 treatment, a condition that inhibits but does not completely arrest exocytosis and plant growth. We found that the abundance of some plant plasma membrane proteins was reduced by more than 50%, indicating that the half-time of turnover of these proteins is less than 2 h. We speculate that these proteins undergo fast delivery to the plasma membrane mediated by the exocyst complex and have a rapid turnover at the plasma membrane. There are other proteins that have lower abundance in ES2-treated samples but did not pass the statistical test. We believe these proteins have slower delivery and/or turnover rates at the plasma membrane. It is not well understood how plants control precise delivery of cargo proteins with different dynamics.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion Using a 2-h treatment with the exocyst subunit EXO70A1 inhibitor ES2 in combination with plasma membrane enrichment, quantitative proteomic analyses, and live-cell imaging, we identified subsets of plasma membrane proteins that require the ES2-targeted exocyst complex for constitutive trafficking to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root cells. Our dataset provides new insights for the identification of novel cargo proteins of the exocyst complex.",

Copyright notice ID: 10264680 PMID: 37324680 Abstract To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake. Additionally, we quantified the effect of ES2 on the spatial distribution of EXO70A1 with live-cell imaging. Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex mediates constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth. Keywords: plasma membrane protein enrichment, exocytosis, proteomics, small molecule inhibitors, exocystHighlights • The proteomics profile of Arabidopsis plasma membrane proteins changes following 2-h treatment with the EXO70A1 inhibitor, ES2.Introduction The plant plasma membrane serves as a selective physical barrier between intracellular contents and the environment as well as a signaling platform for transmitting information from the exterior to induce cellular responses. Plasma membrane proteins can be classified as integral, lipid-anchored, and peripheral, based on the mode of association with the plasma membrane (Stillwell, 2016). Integral membrane proteins possess one to several transmembrane domains; lipid-anchored proteins associate with the plasma membrane through covalently attached fatty acids; peripheral membrane proteins associate with the plasma membrane through interactions with other membrane proteins, polar head groups of the lipid bilayer, or both. Several well-characterized plasma membrane-localized nutrient transporters, hormone receptors and transporters, and cell wall biosynthetic enzymes are known to undergo constitutive delivery and turnover (Li et al., 2002; Friml, 2010; Takano et al., 2010; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2011; Irani et al., 2012; Bashline et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2018; Vellosillo et al., 2021). Proteomic analyses of plasma membrane proteins reveal that the composition is altered in response to biotic and abiotic stresses (Nohzadeh Malakshah et al., 2007; Nouri and Komatsu, 2010; Elmore et al., 2012; Takahashi et al., 2013; Nie et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Voothuluru et al., 2016); however, the mechanisms for delivery of most of these plasma membrane proteins are not well characterized. Investigating how plants maintain the variety, abundance, and dynamics of plasma membrane proteins is essential for understanding cell growth, development, and response to stresses. The conventional plant secretory pathway involves trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles to deliver lipids and proteins to the plasma membrane or extracellular space (Denecke et al., 2012; Drakakaki and Dandekar, 2013; Zhu et al., 2020; Aniento et al., 2022). The exocyst complex is a conserved octameric protein complex that primarily functions to mediate the tethering of secretory vesicles to the site of membrane fusion during the last step of exocytic trafficking (Elias et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2010; Žárský et al., 2013; Wu and Guo, 2015; Synek et al., 2021; Žárský, 2022). In addition, the exocyst complex also associates with the endocytic and autophagy machinery to modulate membrane recycling and autophagy (Prigent et al., 2003; Kulich et al., 2013; Žárský et al., 2013; Ortega et al., 2022; Žárský, 2022). One plant exocyst subunit, EXO70A1, was recently characterized as a landmark for exocyst complex recruitment to the plasma membrane, through its interactions with anionic phospholipids (Synek et al., 2021). Loss of EXO70A1 function disrupts the recruitment of other exocyst subunits to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells (Synek et al., 2021). Some known cargo proteins for plant exocyst complex-mediated trafficking include PIN auxin transporters (Drdová et al., 2013), brassinosteroid receptor (Zhang et al., 2016), and cellulose synthase complexes (Zhu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). However, it is not known what other plasma membrane proteins are delivered to the plasma membrane through the exocyst complex. Whereas the half-life for turnover of plasma membrane proteins in mammalian cells varies from a few hours to a few days (Tweto and Doyle, 1976; Doyle and Baumann, 1979; Chu and Doyle, 1985), we know much less about the mechanisms and dynamics of protein delivery to the plasma membrane in plants. Previously, the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) was shown to target the EXO70A1 subunit of Arabidopsis exocyst complex and to inhibit exocytosis in plant and mammalian cells (Zhang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019). Short-term ES2 treatment inhibits the transport of PIN-FORMED (PIN) family auxin transporter, PIN2, and the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1, to the plasma membrane (Zhang et al., 2016), and also impairs the recycling of PIN2 (Lešková et al., 2020). In mammalian cells, ES2 treatment reduces the cell surface abundance of a membrane-anchored metalloproteinase MT2-MMP (Gómez-Escudero et al., 2017). In addition, given the role of the exocyst complex in autophagy, a recent study examined the consequences of ES2 treatment in autophagy events in mammalian cells, and found that a 24-h ES2 treatment resulted in decreased autophagy (Ortega et al., 2022). To characterize changes in plasma membrane protein composition after short-term inhibition of the exocyst complex, and to identify additional proteins that are transported through the exocyst complex, we used ES2 to inhibit the exocyst complex. We enriched plasma membrane from roots of Arabidopsis seedlings treated with ES2 and DMSO solvent control and identified proteins using mass spectrometry analysis. We then performed quantitative and comparative proteomic analyses to identify plasma membrane proteins with altered abundance in ES2-treated samples and considered proteins with reduced abundance as candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking in plants. We identified a subset of proteins with significantly reduced abundance at the plasma membrane after two hours of 40 μM ES2 treatment. Gene Ontology analysis of proteins with reduced abundance demonstrated enrichment for functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, membrane transport, hormone signaling, and stress responses. The abundance of many protein kinases and several uncharacterized proteins was reduced by ES2 treatment as well. Our results show that the exocyst complex mediates dynamic transport of a diverse set of proteins essential for plant growth and environmental adaptation.Materials and methods Plasma membrane enrichment Arabidopsis PIP2A-GFP seeds (Cutler et al., 2000) were sterilized and sowed on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (½ MS) media with vitamins (Caisson Labs, Smithfield, UT, USA), 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.8% (w/v) agar (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The seeds were well separated from each other in both horizontal and vertical orientations on 10 cm x 10 cm square petri plates. Plates were placed in vertical orientation so that the seedings grew on the surface of the agar media. The plants were grown in a growth chamber (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, USA) under continuous light of 130 μmol m-2s-1 at 23°C. Six-day-old seedlings were removed from the agar plates and transferred to liquid ½ MS media with 1% (w/v) sucrose and 40 μM ES2 or 0.5% DMSO (mock). After two hours of treatment under light, the roots of the seedlings were quickly excised and transferred to the plasma membrane enrichment buffer. The process of plasma membrane enrichment followed exactly the published protocol (Collins et al., 2017). To evaluate the enrichment of plasma membrane proteins by Western blot assay, 12 μg of protein from each fraction was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and the presence of PIP2A-GFP, Sec12, and SYP41 was detected after transfer to PVDF membrane. The anti-GFP antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution (Takara Bio USA, catalog # 632381, San Jose, CA, USA); anti-Sec12 antibody (Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997) was used at 1:5000 dilution; and anti-SYP41 antibody (Bassham et al., 2000) was used at 1:500 dilution. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used at 1:10,000 dilution. The plasma membrane enrichment experiments were repeated four times under identical conditions.Methanol-chloroform precipitation The mass spectrometry sample preparation procedure was based on previous literature (Hsu et al., 2018). Protein concentrations from enriched plasma membrane fractions were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid method. For each sample, 250 μg of enriched plasma membrane protein was processed for mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins from each sample were reduced and alkylated with 10 mM tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TECP) and 40 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) at 95°C for 5 min. Methanol, chloroform, and ddH2O were added to each 100 µl sample in a volume ratio of 4:1:3, respectively (Wessel and Flügge, 1984). The solution was mixed and centrifuged at 16,000x g for 3 min to obtain aqueous and organic phases. Four volumes of methanol were added to the sample after removing the upper aqueous layer carefully without disturbing the intermediate protein disk. The solution was mixed and centrifuged again at the same settings. The supernatant was removed, the precipitated protein pellet was washed with 400 µL methanol, and the sample was air-dried.Protein digestion The precipitated protein pellet was dissolved with 100 µl of 12 mM sodium deoxycholate (SDC) and 12 mM sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (SLS) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Protein amount was quantified by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Dissolved protein extract was diluted 5-fold with 50 mM triethylammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer (TEAB) and digested with Lys-C (Wako Chemicals USA Inc., Richmond, VA, USA) in a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) enzyme-to-protein ratio for 3 h at 37°C, and trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a ratio of 1:50 (w/w) enzyme-to-protein ratio for overnight at 37°C. SDC and SLS were removed by adding 100% acetyl acetate in a ratio of 1:1 (vol/vol) sample to acetyl acetate volume ratio. The digests were desalted by homemade stage tip with styrene divinyl benzene (SDB-XC) membrane (3M) after the digests were acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a pH ~3.Dimethyl labeling Every 50–100 µg of tryptic peptides was dissolved in 100 µl of 100 mM TEAB and mixed with 4 µl of 4% 13CD2O or 12CH2O, and then 4 µl of freshly prepared 0.6 M sodium cyanoborohydride was immediately added (Boersema et al., 2009). The mixture was agitated for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by adding 16 µl of ice-cold 1% ammonium hydroxide and agitated for 1 min. Heavy and light dimethyl-labeled peptides were mixed after the labeled peptides were acidified with 20 µl of 10% formic acid and then fractionated by basic pH reverse-phase stage tips.Basic pH reverse-phase fractionation Two mg of the Magic C18-AQ beads (5 µm particles) were suspended in 200 µL of methanol and loaded into a 200 µL StageTip with a 20 µm polypropylene frit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (Dimayacyac-Esleta et al., 2015). The C18 StageTip was activated with 50 µL of 100% acetonitrile (ACN) and washed with 50 µL of 200 mM ammonium formate, pH 10. After the StageTip was activated and washed, 25–50 µg of dimethyl-labeled peptides were fractionated from the StageTip with 50 µL of 6 different ACN concentrations: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% and 80% of ACN in 200 mM ammonium formate, pH 10. The eluted peptides were dried and stored at -20°C.LC-MS/MS analysis Twenty-five µg of dimethyl-labeled peptides used in fractionations were dissolved in 5 µL of 0.3% formic acid (FA) with 3% ACN and 4 µL of each fraction injected into an EasynLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 45 cm in-house packed column (360 µm OD × 75 µm ID) containing C18 resin (2.2 µm, 100Å, Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) with a 30 cm column heater (Analytical Sales and Services, Flanders, NJ, USA) set at 60°C. The mobile phase buffer for 25 µg peptide fractions consisted of 0.1% FA in ultrapure water (buffer A) with an eluting buffer of 0.1% FA in 80% ACN (buffer B) run with a 150 min gradient of 5–30% buffer B at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The Easy-nLC 1000 was coupled online with a Velos Pro LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode in which a full MS scan (from m/z 350–1500 with a resolution of 30,000 at m/z 400) was followed by MS/MS of the 10 most intense ions being subjected to collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation (normalized collision energy–30%, automatic gain control–3E4, max injection time–100 ms).Proteomics data analyses The raw files were searched directly against the Arabidopsis thaliana protein database (TAIR10) with no redundant entries using MaxQuant software (version 1.6.1.0) (Tyanova et al., 2016a) with 1% false-discovery rate (FDR) cutoff for protein and peptide. The first peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. Search criteria included a static carbamidomethylation of cysteines and variable modifications of oxidation on methionine residues and acetylation at N-terminus of proteins. The search was performed with full tryptic digestion and allowed a maximum of two missed cleavages on the peptides analyzed from the sequence database. Dimethyl-labeling quantitation was performed by setting the multiplicity as 2 (DimethLys0 and DimethNter0; DimethLys6 and DimethNter6). Re-quantify and match between runs function were enabled. After database searches, the Perseus software platform (Version 1.6.1.3) (Tyanova et al., 2016b) was used to further analyze the MaxQuant-derived protein groups file. First, the rows marked to be “only identified by site”, “reverse” and “potential contaminants” were filtered out. The Heavy/Light ratio was transformed to Light/Heavy (L/H) ratio for convenience, and then to log2L/H ratio. Normalization was performed by median subtraction. Proteins with less than 3 valid values among the 4 replicates were filtered out. One sample t-test was performed with both side and p-value threshold of 0.05. Proteins that passed t-test and with a mean log2L/H ratio ≤ -0.32193 were considered to be 20% reduction candidates. Histogram and multi-scatter plots were generated by Perseus software. The reduced abundance candidate list was uploaded to PANTHER platform for Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, including functional classification and statistical overrepresentation (Mi et al., 2013; Mi et al., 2017). The Venn diagram was generated using the online tool provided by Van de Peer Lab at the Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics Core of Ghent University, Belgium (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/). The presence of signal peptide and transmembrane domains in candidate proteins was predicted using the DeepTMHMM package (v1.0.24) provided by Department of Bio and Health Informatics, Technical University of Denmark (https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM) (Hallgren et al., 2022).Confocal microscopy For imaging of fluorescence-tagged protein marker lines, 6-d-old light-grown seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP (Xu and Scheres, 2005), BRI1-GFP (Wang et al., 2001), FER-GFP (Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007), PIP2A-GFP (Cutler et al., 2000), or GFP-EXO70A1 (Fendrych et al., 2010) were treated in liquid ½ MS medium containing 0.5% DMSO (mock) or 40 μM ES2 for 2 h. Live imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 710 Axio Imager laser-scanning confocal microscope operated with Zeiss ZEN software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC, White Plains, NY, USA). The PIN2-GFP, BRI1-GFP, FER-GFP and PIP2A-GFP lines were imaged with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 100x/NA1.40 DIC Oil immersion objective at 2048×2048 pixel scanning resolution. The GFP-EXO70A1 line was imaged with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63x/NA1.40 Oil immersion objective at 4096×4096 pixel scanning resolution. The GFP-EXO70A1 seedlings were stained with 10 μg/mL Propidium Iodide (PI) (Biotium Inc., Fremont, CA, USA; Cat # 40016) in ½ liquid MS medium containing DMSO or ES2 in the dark for 10 min, and quickly rinsed in PI-free medium before imaging. GFP was excited with a 488-nm laser line, and PI was excited with a 543-nm laser line. Images were collected from root epidermal cells at the transition zone. Quantitative image analysis of GFP fluorescence intensity was performed using the FIJI distribution of ImageJ (Ver 1.54b). The regions of interest (ROI) were selected for plasma membrane, cytoplasmic background in the compartment-free region, and the entire cytoplasmic region. The mean fluorescence intensity of the GFP signal for each ROI was measured. The average PM fluorescence intensity was normalized by subtracting the mean fluorescence intensity of the cytoplasmic background. The plasma membrane / cytoplasm ratio was calculated by first subtracting the mean fluorescence intensity of the region outside of the root and then dividing the PM mean fluorescence intensity by the mean fluorescence intensity of the entire cytoplasmic region. Values for individual cells from each seedling were averaged and considered as one data point. Normalization and averaging were performed in Microsoft Excel. Statistical analyses using a Student’s t-test were conducted, and box plots were generated with GraphPad Prism software.Results Plasma membrane enrichment We chose to use a transgenic line expressing PIP2A-GFP as the plant material for our experiments because PIP2A-GFP is localized predominantly at the plasma membrane by microscopy and its cellular localization is not affected by 2 h of 40 μM ES2 treatment (Cutler et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2016). The GFP tag also allowed the use of anti-GFP antibody to examine the quality of enriched plasma membrane fractions. Six-day-old PIP2A-GFP seedlings were treated with either 40 μM ES2 or 0.5% DMSO for 2 h, a condition in which plant exocytosis is reduced but not completely inhibited (Zhang et al., 2016). After treatment, roots were excised and used for plasma membrane enrichment ( Figure 1A ). We adapted a protocol that allows quick enrichment of plasma membrane and does not require large amounts of plant tissue (Zhang and Peck, 2011; Collins et al., 2017). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Characterization of enriched plasma membrane fractions shows the high quality of the sample preparation. (A) Flowchart of sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis. (B) Western blot characterization of enriched plasma membrane fractions. Protein amount of 12.5 μg from total protein (total), soluble protein (sup.), crude membrane fraction (crude M.) and enriched plasma membrane fraction (e.PM) was separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The same membrane was blotted with anti-GFP, anti-Sec12 and anti-SYP41 antibodies. (C) The Venn diagram comparing the proteins that were identified from different proteomics experiments.Enrichment was evaluated by detecting the presence of proteins known to localize to the plasma membrane (PIP2A-GFP) (Cutler et al., 2000), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Sec12) (Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997), and Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) (SYP41) (Bassham et al., 2000) in different fractions using Western blots with anti-GFP, anti-Sec12, and anti-SYP41 antibodies, respectively ( Figure 1B ). PIP2A-GFP was enriched in the plasma membrane fraction when compared to the crude membrane fraction ( Figure 1B , anti-GFP). The ER membrane protein, Sec12, was detected in both crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions; however, the abundance of Sec12 in the plasma membrane fraction was markedly lower than the crude membrane fraction ( Figure 1B , anti-Sec12). The Golgi/TGN protein, SYP41, was detected in the crude membrane fraction but not in the enriched plasma membrane fraction ( Figure 1B , anti-SYP41). Immunoblots demonstrated that although proteins from other organelles were present in the enriched plasma membrane fraction, their abundance was substantially reduced in comparison with plasma membrane proteins. We prepared four independent biological replicates of enriched plasma membrane fractions for the mass spectrometry proteomics analysis.Mass spectrometry analyses of enriched plasma membrane proteins From each enriched plasma membrane fraction, 25 μg of protein was digested with Lys-C and trypsin. Resulting peptides from ES2-treated plant samples were dimethyl labeled with 12CH2O (light, L) and peptides from DMSO-treated samples were dimethyl labeled with 13CD2O (heavy, H). Dimethyl-labeled peptides from ES2-treatment and control samples were combined and fractionated before LC-MS/MS analysis. The peptides that were detected by LC-MS/MS were assigned to proteins and the abundance of each protein was calculated through a MaxQuant database search. The ratio of each protein’s abundance in differentially labeled samples was calculated using the same process. The data were processed further with the Perseus platform by filtering out rows with invalid values (potential contaminants, the reverse peptides, and peptides only identified by site) from the MaxQuant database search. We further filtered the data by removing proteins with less than three detected values in the four replicates. To compare the data from different replicates, the ratio of protein abundance between differentially labeled proteins was transformed to log2 phase and further normalized by median subtraction and then analyzed by histogram ( Supplemental Figure S1 ). The normal distribution of log2 phase of ratios centered by zero between differentially labeled proteins indicates that the majority of proteins that we detected were not altered by ES2 treatment. We detected 3675 proteins from four independent replicate experiments ( Supplementary Table S1 ). To further evaluate the plasma membrane preparation, we compared our protein list with those published from different Arabidopsis tissues using another plasma membrane preparation method ( Figure 1C ). First, we compared our plasma membrane protein list with one generated from two-week-old liquid cultured Arabidopsis seedlings using a two-phase partition of microsomes and Trypsin-catalyzed 18O labeling (Nelson et al., 2006). We found 295 overlapping proteins, accounting for 95% of the proteins detected in Nelson et al.’s experiments (309 proteins in total) ( Figure 1C ). Elmore et al. used an aqueous two-phase partitioning approach for leaves of four-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown in soil condition and consistently identified more than 1300 proteins in replicate experiments (Elmore et al., 2012). We found 960 overlapping proteins, accounting for more than 70% of the proteins detected in Elmore et al.’s experiments ( Figure 1C ). Li et al. isolated plasma membrane fractions from Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells using a two-phase partition method and identified over 600 proteins by proteomic analysis (Li et al., 2012). About 60% of the proteins that were detected from cultured cells were consistently identified in our experiments ( Figure 1C ). Substantial overlap between our plasma membrane protein list and others that use a different method or tissue indicates that our proteomic data can be used to compare the effects of ES2 on the abundance of plasma membrane proteins. To examine whether the enriched plasma membrane fraction was free from contaminants from other large membrane-bound compartments, we checked our proteomics list for the presence of proteins residing in the nuclear envelope and vacuole. The nuclear envelope protein SAD1/UNC-84 DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 (SUN1, AT5G04990; Oda and Fukuda, 2011) was detected, but its abundance was unchanged following ES2 treatment, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.00. Another nuclear envelope protein SAD1/UNC-84 DOMAIN PROTEIN 2 (SUN2, AT3G10730; Oda and Fukuda, 2011) was not detected. The vacuole membrane protein TONOPLAST INTRINSIC PROTEIN 1;1 (γ-TIP or TIP1;1, AT2G36830; Nelson et al., 2006) was not detected. These results indicate that the enriched plasma membrane fraction was relatively free from contamination of nuclear envelope or vacuolar membranes. To investigate whether ES2 treatment altered the membrane identity of the plasma membrane fraction, we checked our proteomics list for the presence of several markers of membrane-bound organelles. The autophagosome markers ATG8e (AT2G45170) and ATG8f (AT4G16520) were not detected. The early endosome marker ARA6 (AT3G54840; Ebine et al., 2011), ER marker SEC12 (AT2G04170; Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997), and Golgi marker SYP32 (AT3G24350) and ALPHA-MANNOSIDASE 1 (ManI, AT1G51590; Kajiura et al., 2010) were all present but unchanged following ES2 treatment, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.06 for ARA6, 0.05 for SEC12, 0.00 for SYP32, and -0.01 for ManI ( Supplementary Table S1 ). These results indicate that the membrane identify of the plasma membrane was not altered following ES2 treatment. To identify proteins with altered abundance after ES2 treatment, we performed a moderated t-test (Smyth, 2004) for each protein using the limma package in R. The moderated t-test uses a hierarchical empirical Bayesian model to shrink the sample standard deviation estimates for each protein towards a pooled value. This stabilizes the t-statistics and increases the power of the test to detect true differences in protein abundance. Since multiple significance tests were performed, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to bound the expected false-discovery rate at 10%. After the correction, 330 proteins had adjusted p-values less than 0.10. Thus, we can estimate that roughly 300 of the 330 proteins have log2 ratios significantly different from 0. Among these 330 proteins, 145 had reduced abundance ( Supplementary Tables S2 , S3 ) and 185 had increased abundance ( Supplementary Table S4 ) in the plasma membrane fraction of ES2-treated samples. To highlight the proteins with the most dramatic changes, the top twenty proteins with decreased and increased abundance were listed in Tables 1 , 2 , respectively. Because ES2 binds to the EXO70A1 subunit of the exocyst complex and inhibits its function (Zhang et al., 2016), and because EXO70A1 serves as a landmark for exocyst complex recruitment to the plasma membrane (Synek et al., 2021), we expect that proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane are candidate cargos of exocyst-mediated trafficking.

We selected three protein candidates: the auxin efflux carrier protein PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN2), the leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinase of brassinosteroid signaling BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1), and the receptor kinase FERONIA (FER), each of which had reduced plasma membrane abundance after ES2 treatment in our proteomics analysis. PIN2 had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.27, BRI1 had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.31, and FER had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.38. ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We quantified GFP-tagged protein fluorescence intensity on the plasma membrane and normalized by subtracting the mean background fluorescence intensity from a cytoplasmic compartment-free region ( Figure 2C ). The abundance of all three proteins at the plasma membrane region were significantly decreased after a 2-h ES2 treatment ( Figure 2D ). To further evaluate the change of abundance between the plasma membrane and entire cytoplasmic region, we also quantified the plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratio as another indicator of plasma membrane protein abundance ( Figure 2E ). The plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratios for all three proteins were significantly reduced after a 2-h ES2 treatment compared to mock treatment ( Figure 2E ). Our analysis showed for the first time that the plasma membrane abundance of FER was decreased following ES2 treatment. As a negative control, we measured the abundance of PLASMA MEMBRANE INTRINSIC PROTEIN 2A (PIP2A), which was shown to have unaltered plasma membrane abundance after ES2 treatment in the proteomics analyses, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.05 ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The plasma membrane abundance and plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratio of PIP2A-GFP were not altered by ES2 treatment ( Figures 2D, E ). Figure 2. Open in a new tab The abundance of several proteins at the plasma membrane is reduced following ES2 treatment.

In the box plot, whiskers indicate the maximum and minimum values of the dataset, whereas individual data points represent the average value from each seedling.Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of candidate cargos for ES2-targeted trafficking To better understand the biological functions of the candidate cargo proteins for ES2-targeted trafficking, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the biological processes category on the 145 proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane using the PANTHER classification system (Mi et al., 2013; Mi et al., 2017). We found that 49 proteins could be classified into protein families that were enriched in abundance on our list when compared to their abundance in the reference list of Arabidopsis thaliana genome ( Figure 3 ). The fold enrichment for different biological processes ranged from 3.7 to 200. The 49 candidate exocytosis cargo proteins belong to gene families that function in plant cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, response to stresses and membrane transport ( Figure 3 ; Supplementary Table S2 ). The proteins for the regulation of DNA-templated transcription (GO:0006355), nucleic acid metabolic process (GO:0090304) and gene expression (GO:0010467) were much lower than the numbers that were expected from the Arabidopsis genome ( Figure 3 ), indicating the trafficking of these proteins was not mediated by the exocyst complex. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Gene Ontology terms of biological processes category that are enriched in our protein list with significantly reduced abundance after ES2 treatment. Numbers on each row represent: fold enrichment (total number of proteins in the category/number of proteins identified in the reduced protein list/number of proteins expected in reduced protein list). Fold enrichment represents the ratio of the number of proteins identified divided by the number of proteins expected in the list.We further examined the annotated functions of proteins with significantly reduced abundance in ES2-treated samples. We found the abundance of three primary cell wall cellulose synthases (CESA1, CESA3, and CESA6), CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-INTERACTIVE PROTEIN 1 (CSI1), and KORRIGAN (KOR) was significantly reduced in ES2-treated samples ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Proteins involved in lignin metabolism were also reduced, as were multiple proteins involved in brassinosteroid and auxin signaling. The abundance of some proteins that respond to cold and phosphate deficiency was significantly reduced in ES2-treated samples. Another group of proteins that was affected by ES2 treatment are transporters responsible for the movement of phosphate, sulphate, potassium, and oligopeptides across the plasma membrane. The abundance of two annexins involved in phloem sucrose unloading (Wang et al., 2018) was also significantly reduced ( Supplementary Table S2 ). In addition to the proteins mentioned above, there are other proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane, but they were not enriched in functional groups in the GO enrichment analysis. These include multiple receptor-like protein kinases, transporters, enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism and protein glycosylation, as well as proteins with uncharacterized functions. Although these proteins were not enriched in our list, they may have diverse functions and cellular localization patterns among different members of the family. Collectively, our GO term enrichment analysis indicates that the exocyst complex mediates constitutive transport of numerous proteins that function in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, and membrane transport.Bioinformatic analysis of potential cargo proteins for plant exocyst complex Plants use both conventional and unconventional trafficking pathways to deliver proteins to the plasma membrane and extracellular space (Drakakaki and Dandekar, 2013; Ding et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2016; Aniento et al., 2022). In the conserved conventional trafficking pathway, proteins with a signal peptide are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum during translation and are then transported to Golgi through vesicles and further secreted through post-Golgi vesicles (Novick et al., 1981; Rothman, 2002; Schekman, 2010). However, increasing evidence from proteomic analysis shows that many proteins that are secreted out of the cell or targeted to the plasma membrane do not have signal peptides, indicating the existence of unconventional trafficking pathways for these proteins (Oh et al., 2005; Soares et al., 2007; Wen et al., 2007; Han et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2016). Plant exocyst complex has been shown to regulate cargo proteins through both conventional and unconventional pathways (Wang et al., 2010; Drdová et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015; Mayers et al., 2017). To test whether the candidate cargo proteins contain signal peptides that allow them to traffic through the conventional pathway, we analyzed the presence of signal peptides in proteins that had reduced abundance in ES2-treated samples using the DeepTMHMM package, a deep-learning method for signal peptide and transmembrane domain prediction (Hallgren et al., 2022). DeepTMHMM predicted that 36 of the 145 proteins with reduced abundance contained signal peptides ( Supplementary Table S5 ). The existence of a signal peptide in a small percentage of proteins indicates that consistent with previous findings, plant exocyst complex mediates the transport of proteins in both conventional and unconventional trafficking pathways. To understand how these candidate cargo proteins are associated to the plasma membrane, we analyzed the presence of potential transmembrane domains in these 145 proteins using the DeepTMHMM package. We found 64 of the 145 proteins were predicted to have at least one transmembrane domain ( Supplementary Table S5 ).The behavior of the exocyst complex and its regulators is different than candidate cargo proteins All eight subunits of the exocyst complex were detected in the enriched plasma membrane fractions ( Supplementary Table S1 ). However, we did not find a statistically significant reduction in their abundance in ES2-treated samples ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Among the eight exocyst subunits, only SEC3 showed a 13% reduction in the mean value after ES2 treatment but was not statistically different ( Supplementary Table S1 ). STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS-DEFECTIVE 1 (SCD1), a component of the candidate activator of plant RabE GTPase that regulates the exocyst complex (Mayers et al., 2017), was detected in plasma membrane fractions but its abundance was not altered by ES2 treatment ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We identified 12 Syntaxins of Plants (SYP), SYP111, SYP121, SYP122, SYP132, SYP21, SYP22, SYP32, SYP43, SYP51, SYP52, SYP61, and SYP71, but none of these were statistically significantly reduced ( Supplementary Table S1 ). In summary, our proteomics results indicate that the abundance of candidate tSNARE proteins, together with the exocyst complex and the SCD complex, were not significantly affected by a 2-h, 40 μM ES2 treatment.Confocal imaging of GFP-EXO70A1 following ES2 treatment To investigate whether ES2 affects the spatial distribution or abundance at the plasma membrane of its target, EXO70A1, we performed live imaging of root epidermal cells from GFP-EXO70A1 seedlings using laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Figure 4 ). Consistent with previous findings (Zhang et al., 2016; Larson et al., 2020; Synek et al., 2021), EXO70A1 in mock-treated epidermal cells showed a polarized distribution with highest abundance at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face, but was present at all six faces of the cell ( Figure 4A ). A 2-h, 40 µM ES2 treatment significantly reduced the abundance of EXO70A1 at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face ( Figures 4B, D ), and disrupted the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 at the outer periclinal face when fluorescence intensity was expressed as a ratio with the cytosolic region ( Figure 4E ) or as a ratio with the other faces of the same cell ( Figure 4F ). However, when EXO70A1 at the other three faces of the plasma membrane visible in medial optical sections, including the inner periclinal face and the two anticlinal faces (green line in Figure 4C ), was examined, the apparent abundance expressed as a ratio with cytosol was not affected by ES2 treatment ( Figure 4G ). When all four faces of the plasma membrane were combined and averaged, there was a modest decrease in the abundance of EXO70A1, but this was not statistically significant ( Figure 4H ). In total, a 2-h ES2 treatment had greatest effect on the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 and its association with the plasma membrane at the outer periclinal face of root epidermal cells, but a rather modest reduction in overall abundance at the plasma membrane on all faces of the cell. Figure 4. Open in a new tab The abundance of EXO70A1 at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face is decreased following ES2 treatment.

Statistical analysis was performed with an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, * denotes P value < 0.05, ns denotes not significant. In the box plot, whiskers indicate the maximum and minimum values of the dataset, whereas individual data points represent the average value from each seedling.Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of proteins with increased abundance after ES2 treatment Our statistical analysis identified 185 proteins with increased abundance in enriched plasma membrane fractions of ES2-treated samples ( Supplementary Table S4 ). To better understand the function of these proteins, we performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the biological function category. We found that this list of proteins is enriched in biological functions of COPII-coated vesicle cargo loading, mRNA catabolic process, negative regulation of translation, proton membrane transport, aerobic respiration, leaf senescence, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, and amide biosynthesis process ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). The functional relationship between exocyst complex and these proteins has not been well characterized. We speculate that some of these proteins might be involved in cellular responses to the inhibition of exocytosis.Discussion Exocyst complex mediates constitutive transport of proteins with diverse functions during plant growth and development Using quantitative and comparative proteomics analysis, we identified 145 proteins with significantly reduced abundance at the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis roots following ES2 treatment. Some of these proteins possess transmembrane domains and are likely integral membrane proteins delivered to the plasma membrane by secretion. The candidate proteins without a predicted transmembrane domain could be associated with the plasma membrane through lipid anchors, through interaction with other membrane proteins, or by association with polar head groups of the lipid bilayer. These candidates of exocyst-mediated trafficking perform functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress responses, membrane transport, nutrient transport, and protein phosphorylation. The dynamics of many hormone-signaling proteins are well characterized; however, the role of exocyst complex in regulating their trafficking awaits further study. The functional diversity of proteins that are transported through the exocyst complex is consistent with the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in plants deficient for the exocyst complex (Cole et al., 2005; Synek et al., 2006; Hála et al., 2008; Fendrych et al., 2010; Kulich et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Pečenková et al., 2011; Drdová et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Kulich et al., 2015; Drdová et al., 2019; Ogura et al., 2019; Synek et al., 2021; Hématy et al., 2022). Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex plays essential roles for growth and adaptation by mediating constitutive transport of proteins with diverse functions to the plasma membrane. Some other important plasma membrane proteins, such as Rho family small GTPases (ROPs), multidrug resistance-like ABC transporter family proteins, and aquaporin plasma membrane intrinsic proteins were not affected by ES2 treatment in this proteomics study ( Supplementary Table S1 ), which is consistent with the previous live-cell imaging results (Zhang et al., 2016). Our current results indicate that these important plasma membrane proteins could have slow turnover rates or are not delivered to the plasma membrane through the ES2-targeted exocyst complex.Cargo protein exocytosis and exocyst complex membrane association Time-lapse imaging revealed that the plant exocyst complex colocalizes with its cargo protein (Cellulose Synthase Complex or CSC) during the tethering process and then separates from the cargo after successful fusion (Zhu et al., 2018; Zhang and Staiger, 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). In our proteomics study, we detected a significant reduction in the abundance of cargo proteins, such as cellulose synthases, but did not detect a statistically significant reduction in the abundance of the exocyst complex subunits. The abundance of SCD complex components and candidate tSNAREs on the plasma membrane was also not affected by ES2 treatment. Previous live-cell imaging data reveal that exocyst subunits are polarized to the outer periclinal face of root epidermal cells (Zhang et al., 2016; Larson et al., 2020; Synek et al., 2021) and are disrupted by ES2 treatment (Zhang et al., 2016) or genetic disruption of EXO70A1 (Synek et al., 2021), but not by genetic disruption of some SNARE proteins that physically interact with the exocyst complex (Larson et al., 2020). The plasma membrane enrichment reflects the overall abundance of each plasma membrane protein, but not their polarized distribution on a specific face of the plasma membrane. Results from live-cell imaging and our proteomics analyses indicated that ES2 treatment affected the polarized distribution of the exocyst complex in root epidermal cells but did not markedly affect its association with the plasma membrane. The lifetime of exocyst foci on the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells is around 10 s; however, inhibition of exocytosis by a 2-h Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment did not affect membrane localization of the exocyst complex (Fendrych et al., 2013). Thus, exocyst complex association with the plasma membrane may not depend on the other components of the exocytosis machinery. Previous studies demonstrate that exocyst subunits physically interact and associate with the SCD1/2 complex (Mayers et al., 2017), and EXO70 physically interacts with several SNAREs (Larson et al., 2020). Although ES2 disrupts the polarized localization of EXO70A1, our current data do not directly reflect whether ES2 disrupts the physical interaction of exocyst subunits with SCD1/2 complex or SNARE proteins, and/or affects the localization pattern of SCD1/2 and SNAREs. One future direction would be to quantify the localization of fluorescent-tagged SCD1/2 and SNAREs following ES2 treatment. Further, it would be interesting to quantify the association of exocyst subunits with other components of the exocytosis machinery through high spatial-temporal resolution live-cell imaging of double marker lines.Future directions in understanding plant plasma membrane protein dynamics Due to the importance of plant plasma membrane proteins, multiple comparative proteomic studies have been conducted to investigate the profiles of plasma membrane proteins in response to environmental stresses and cell growth status. The composition of plasma membrane proteins changes upon salt stress, cold treatment, osmotic stress, immune signaling, nutrient deficiency and different growth stages of cultured cells (Nohzadeh Malakshah et al., 2007; Nouri and Komatsu, 2010; Elmore et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018). These proteomic studies show that the plasma membrane serves as a hub for cells to respond to environmental and growth cues. These studies further indicate that the vesicle trafficking machinery that facilitates the transport of these proteins is essential for plants to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous findings on the essential functions of plant exocyst complex in plant growth and immune responses (Synek et al., 2006; Fendrych et al., 2010; Kulich et al., 2010; Kulich et al., 2015; Cole et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018; Žárský, 2022) support the hypothesis that the exocyst complex choreographs the dynamic change of specific proteins at the plasma membrane in response to different environmental stimuli and growth cues. In comparison with yeast and mammalian cells, we understand less about the mechanisms of plasma membrane protein delivery and turnover in plants. In this study, using very stringent filtering and cutoff, we found 145 proteins that have significantly (at 10% FDR) reduced abundance at the plasma membrane after a 2-h, 40 μM ES2 treatment, a condition that inhibits but does not completely arrest exocytosis and plant growth. We found that the abundance of some plant plasma membrane proteins was reduced by more than 50%, indicating that the half-time of turnover of these proteins is less than 2 h. We speculate that these proteins undergo fast delivery to the plasma membrane mediated by the exocyst complex and have a rapid turnover at the plasma membrane. There are other proteins that have lower abundance in ES2-treated samples but did not pass the statistical test. We believe these proteins have slower delivery and/or turnover rates at the plasma membrane. It is not well understood how plants control precise delivery of cargo proteins with different dynamics.Conclusion Using a 2-h treatment with the exocyst subunit EXO70A1 inhibitor ES2 in combination with plasma membrane enrichment, quantitative proteomic analyses, and live-cell imaging, we identified subsets of plasma membrane proteins that require the ES2-targeted exocyst complex for constitutive trafficking to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root cells. Our dataset provides new insights for the identification of novel cargo proteins of the exocyst complex.Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

    "abstract": "Abstract Auxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport proteins of the PIN-formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele of Arabidopsis thaliana SCD1 (stomatal cytokinesis defective1) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. In scd1-1 at 25°C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 exhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature. Keywords: SCD1, gravitropism, lateral root, auxin transport, PIN2, Arabidopsis thaliana",
    "introduction": "Introduction The process of auxin transport drives many aspects of plant development, including primary root elongation, lateral root development, and asymmetric growth in response to gravity and light gradients (Muday and DeLong, 2001; Vieten et al., 2007; Zazimalova et al., 2010). Auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) is transported long distances in two polarities in two root cell layers (Muday and DeLong, 2001). Cell to cell IAA transport is mediated by AUX/LAX influx carriers and by efflux carriers of the PIN and ABCB families (Zazimalova et al., 2010). Directionality is controlled by asymmetric localization of PIN proteins at the plasma membrane (Wisniewska et al., 2006; Adamowski and Friml, 2015). In Arabidopsis roots, PIN1 is localized to the stele and implicated in auxin transport toward the root apex (Galweiler et al., 1998), which is now called rootward transport and this auxin flow is required for lateral root development (Reed et al., 1998; Lavenus et al., 2013). In contrast, PIN2 is localized to the epidermal and cortical cell layers of roots and mediates shootward transport from the root apex (Muller et al., 1998), which is integral to root elongation and gravitropism (Rashotte et al., 2000). PIN3 is localized to the columella cells at the root tip, where the angle of the gravity vector is perceived, and in the vascular cylinder, consistent with functions in gravitropism and root development, respectively (Friml et al., 2002; Harrison and Masson, 2007). The polar distribution of the PIN proteins is dynamic (Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014; Weller et al., 2017). Targeting of PIN proteins to the membrane in response to stimuli may be an important mechanism to allow changes in auxin transport and dependent growth processes (Paciorek et al., 2005; Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014). PIN proteins travel through the endosome to the plasma membrane after de novo synthesis through a highly regulated process (Jasik et al., 2013, 2016) involving the RAB and ARF families of small G proteins. GNOM, a well-studied ARF-GEF and target of the drug Brefeldin A, is critical in targeting of PIN1 and PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane (Geldner et al., 2001, 2004, 2003). Although genetic approaches have identified pathways for targeting PIN proteins (Adamowski and Friml, 2015), non-conditional mutants with impaired auxin transport, such as gnom, have profound developmental phenotypes (Geldner et al., 2003). This complicates determination of whether altered auxin transport causes developmental phenotypes or the converse. This study used a conditional scd1-1 mutant to test whether auxin transport trafficking defects precede growth or developmental phenotypes. The SCD1 protein has a DENN domain, found exclusively in RAB-GEFs (Yoshimura et al., 2010; Marat et al., 2011). SCD1 and an associated protein, SCD2, have been shown to complex with a RabE1 at the exocyst in Arabidopsis roots (Mayers et al., 2017), where it plays a role in exocytosis and recycling of membrane proteins. Three scd1 mutant alleles have been described: scd1-1, scd1-2, and scd1-3 (Falbel et al., 2003). scd1-2 and scd1-3 are loss of function mutants with altered guard cell development, and profound root growth and developmental phenotypes. However, the temperature sensitive scd1-1 allele, displays these phenotypes only at the restrictive temperature of 25°C (Falbel et al., 2003). This study utilizes the unique features of a temperature sensitive scd1-1 mutant allele to demonstrate that the growth and developmental effects in Arabidopsis roots at the restrictive temperature are tied to altered auxin transport protein targeting. The developmental and auxin transport defects can be induced by transition to the restrictive temperature and reversed by return to the permissive temperature. We report the effects of these treatments on polar auxin transport and dependent physiological processes including lateral root development, gravity response, and root elongation. At the restrictive temperature, PIN2 fused to GFP accumulates in endomembrane vesicles in scd1-1, which is consistent with a role of SCD1 in controlling PIN endomembrane targeting. Auxin transport and endomembrane accumulation of a PIN2 reporter were examined both in scd1-1 grown continuously at the restrictive temperature or in seedlings transitioned briefly to this temperature. The endomembrane bodies in which the PIN2 fusion protein is localized also accumulate other proteins that are linked to the late multivesicular endosome and the endosome dye FM4-64 after an extended incubation. These results provide support for the hypothesis that SCD1 protein functions to regulate the movement of PIN2 to and from the plasma membrane and that these transient changes in localization occur more rapidly than changes in auxin transport and dependent developmental processes.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Growth of Mutant and Transgenic Seedlings Seeds were sterilized (75% ethanol, 0.01% Triton X-100) for 2 min, followed by a 95% ethanol rinse. The culture medium was 0.8% (w/v) agar (MP Biomedical), 1X MS nutrients (macro and micro salts: MSP01-50LT, Caisson Labs, Inc.), vitamins (1 μg/mL–1 thiamine, 1 μg/mL–1 pyridoxine HCL, and 0.5 μg/mL–1 nicotinic acid), 1.5% sucrose (w/v), and 0.05% MES (w/v); pH adjusted to 6.0 with 1M KOH. The seeds were placed in the dark at 4°C for 48 h before being moved to the permissive (18°C) or the restrictive (25°C) temperatures. The seedlings were grown vertically under continuous light at an intensity of 100 μmol m–2s–1 for 5 or 7 days at the specified temperature. The Arabidopsis scd1-1 mutant (Falbel et al., 2003) was crossed with a number of fluorescent protein fusions all driven by their endogenous promoters: PIN2-GFP (Xu and Scheres, 2005), PIN1-GFP (Heisler et al., 2005), PIN3-GFP (Laskowski et al., 2008), MDR1(ABCB19)-GFP (Wu et al., 2007), AUX1-YFP (Swarup et al., 2008), and the auxin responsive promoter driven GFP reporter, DR5-GFP (Ottenschläger et al., 2003; Lewis et al., 2011). The F2 generation was screened for lines homozygous for mutant phenotype and for reporter GFP expression. scd1-1 containing PIN2-GFP was also crossed with reporters that localize to specific endomembrane compartments, with these organelle specific reporters listed in Supplementary Table S1. Characterization of scd1-1 Root Length and Lateral Root Development Seedlings of similar size were placed on fresh agar plates on the 5th day after growth at 18 or 25°C. Lateral roots initiation events corresponding to stages VI and VII of primordia (Malamy and Benfey, 1997) and emerged lateral roots (defined as any root that broke through the epidermis of the primary root) were quantified using a dissecting microscope. To examine lateral root formation in seedlings that were moved between temperature conditions, Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18 or 25°C continuously or transferred from 18 to 25°C at 2, 4, or 6 days. Parallel experiments were performed where seedlings were grown at 25°C continuously or transferred from 25 to 18°C at the indicated times. The number of lateral root initiation events and the number of emerged lateral roots were quantified by DIC microscopy using the Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope with a Plan Apochromatic 40x objective and the reported data is from 20 seedlings. IAA Transport Assays Pulse-chase rootward (acropetal) IAA transport assays were performed using a previously published method (Lewis and Muday, 2009) in Col(g) seedlings at 9 and 6 days at 18 and 25° C, respectively. scd1-1 seedlings were assayed at 10 days for both 18°C and 25°C to more closely match the length of scd1-1 and Col(g). An agar droplet (1.25% agar w/v) containing 1 μM tritiated IAA was placed at the root shoot junction and incubated at 18 or 25°C for 10 min. The seedlings were transferred to a new agar plate and exposed to a “chase” droplet of unlabeled 1 μM IAA. After 50 min, 2 mm sections were excised beginning at the base of the droplet toward the root tip. Three to six segments were recovered from all plants, and each segment was counted separately, and IAA levels quantitated using a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. The average and SE of 19–25 seedlings is reported in all transport assays. Shootward IAA transport was measured by applying 500 nM tritiated IAA (3H-IAA) to root tips (Lewis and Muday, 2009) of 5 day seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C. For temperature switch experiments, seedlings were transferred to the appropriate temperature 4, 8, and 24 h before assay. Agar droplets containing 500 nM 3H-IAA were applied to the root tips, and seedlings were placed into the indicated temperatures under yellow filters to prevent auxin degradation (Stasinopoulos and Hangarter, 1990). After 2 h, the droplets were removed from the root tip. A 5 mm segment was excised 2 mm from the site of 3H-IAA application, and radioactivity was measured. Shootward IAA transport was also measured indirectly using the artificial DR5 promoter driving expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Ottenschläger et al., 2003). Droplets containing 1 μM unlabeled IAA in 1.25% agar were applied to the root tips of 5-day old seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C for the designated times. GFP fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss 710 LSCM (Jena, Germany) using the argon laser with excitation at 488 nm. Images of root tips were captured using 80% laser power with 40x magnification, a pinhole of 2.64 airy units (AU), 560 gain and an emission spectrum of 493-656 nm. Images were exported to Adobe Photoshop, and the distance of GFP fluorescence in the epidermal layers was measured using the line tool. Gravitropic Response Assays Five-day old Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C were placed in diffuse light at 20–22 μmol m–2 s–1 and re-oriented 90°. Images were captured for low temporal resolution analysis at time 0 and at 2 h intervals until 8 h after re-orientation, with a final image 24 h after re-orientation. Images were captured using an Epson Perfection 3200 Photo Perfection flatbed scanner (Nagano, Japan) with 16-bit grayscale and 800 dpi resolution. Images were exported to ImageJ to measure degree of curvature. The gravitropic root response was also observed using high temporal resolution imaging using an AVT Marlin camera (Stadtroda, Germany). Root curvature after gravity stimulation was measured by a MATLAB based custom image analysis software (Lewis et al., 2007) and is the average and standard error of 12 seedlings of each genotype. Asymmetric Auxin Induced Gene Expression After Gravitropic Reorientation Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings crossed with the proDR5-GFP construct were imaged after roots were reoriented 90° relative to the gravity vector. Seedlings were placed on agar plates on the 5th day after growth at 18 or 25°C. After 1 h, seedlings were placed in diffuse light at 20–22 μmol m–2s–1 and reoriented 90°. Images were captured at time 0 and at 2 h intervals until 8 h after re-orientation. Seedlings were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to visualize root structure and mounted in dH20 on slides. The root tips were visualized with the 40x objective of a Zeiss 710 LSCM using the argon laser at an excitation wavelength of 488nm and a pinhole of 1.0 AU. GFP emission was collected between 492 and 547 nm, while PI was collected at 567–735. All images were collected at identical gain and laser power and exported to Adobe Photoshop for analysis. Representative images of more than 5 roots at each time point and from each genotype were shown. Localization of Auxin Transport Protein-Fluorescent Protein Fusions Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings containing PIN2-GFP, PIN1-GFP, PIN3-GFP, ABCB19-GFP, and AUX1-YFP (protein fusions driven by endogenous promoters) were grown for 7 days at a constant 18 or 25°C. Seedlings were mounted in dH2O and maintained at the indicated temperatures using a Julabo F25 temperature stage (Seelbach, Germany). Images were captured using a 63x water objective with or without a 1.5x optical zoom on a Zeiss 710 LSCM, using the argon laser for excitation at 488 nm with a pinhole of 1.0AU. PIN2-GFP, PIN1-GFP, PIN3-GFP, and MDR1-GFP were imaged with an emission spectrum of 500–525 nm, while AUX1-YFP was imaged with an emission spectrum of 519–621 nm. For temperature shift experiments, wild-type and scd1-1 were grown at 18°C for 7 days. Seedlings were transferred to microscope slides and then placed on the temperature-controlled stage at 25°C. Samples were imaged as described above at various times after transfer. For each reporter construct more than 5 roots were analyzed at each treatment, with representative images shown. PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 Analysis Seedlings grown at 25°C were incubated in 5 μM FM4-64 to visualize endosomes (Bolte et al., 2004) for either 5 or 20 min, as indicated. The roots were rinsed in dH2O and imaged at various times after staining. The GFP and FM4-64 signals were visualized using a multi-track setting, as described above. No FM4-64 fluorescence was detected in the GFP channel. The FM4-64 signal was imaged using 80% laser power, a pinhole of 1.0 AU, 510 gain, and an emission spectrum of 632–759 nm. No GFP signal was detected in the FM4-64 channel. Individual images for each fluorophore and an overlay are shown with magenta for FM4-64, green for PIN2-GFP, and white for any pixels with both FM4-64 and PIN2. The red signal in these images was converted to magenta in Photoshop, changing the hue saturation. To better identify spatial colocalization independent of intensity, a thresholding function was applied to individual channels in Photoshop or in the Zeiss Zen colocalization module. We then prepared a thresholded overlay in which pixels are indicated as magenta for FM4-64, green for PIN2-GFP, and white for any pixels with both FM4-64 and GFP. To examine the change in colocalization of PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 over time, the number of PIN2-GFP, FM4-64, or both, signals in each cell with a PIN2-GFP labeled endomembrane compartment was quantified, and the percentage was determined for 740 cells from 20 roots. In the temperature shift experiments, scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C for 7 days were transferred to 5 mM FM4-64 for 5 min, rinsed briefly, and then imaged at intervals of 2 min on a temperature-controlled stage at 25°C. Colocalization of PIN2 and Endosomal Markers Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings containing PIN2-GFP were crossed with fluorescently labeled endomembrane marker lines. These constructs and their localization patterns are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The seedlings were grown for 7 days at 25°C. Seedling roots were visualized using the Zeiss 710 laser scanning confocal microscope. GFP and RFP signals were resolved in dual channel mode with excitation at 488 and 594 nm, and emission wavelengths of 493–582 and 599–754 nm, respectively. For all samples, we verified the absence of RFP signal in the GFP channel and vice versa, using single-labeled samples. For colocalization analysis, samples were examined using Zeiss Zen software. The threshold for RFP or GFP was determined within each image, using regions that had only signal from one fluorophore. We selected regions of interest (ROI) of consistent size, focusing on individual endomembrane compartments (French et al., 2008) from at least 4 roots each of Ara6 and Ara7 reporters, measuring 21 and 17 endomembranes, respectively. Colocalization was quantified using both Pearson’s coefficients (weighted colocalization coefficients) and Manders’ overlap coefficients (Manders et al., 1993; Dunn et al., 2011). Lines containing both PIN2-GFP and other RFP reporters were examined in dual channel mode as described above. PIN2-GFP SYP61-CFP transgenics were imaged using spectral imaging and linear unmixing at an excitation wavelength of 458 nm and a 464–648 nm filter.",
    "results": "Results Root Elongation and Lateral Root Development Are Temperature-Sensitive in scd1-1 If scd1-1 has a defect in targeting of auxin transport proteins, then alterations in auxin transport-dependent root responses, including primary root elongation, gravitropism, and lateral root development, would be expected. Root growth and development of scd1-1 were compared to its parental line, Columbia glabrous-1 [(Col(g)], at 18°C and at 25°C. At 18°C, Col(g) and scd1-1 had similar primary root elongation rates and lateral root numbers (Figure 1). At 25°C scd1-1 primary roots were substantially shorter than Col(g) (Figure 1B), and the number of lateral roots were dramatically reduced (Figures 1B,C). We performed a two-way ANOVA to determine which of these differences were statistically significant across this time course. In both root elongation and lateral root development, scd1-1 was significantly impaired relative to Col(g) at both temperatures with p < 0.01 for all comparisons. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Root growth and lateral root formation in scd1-1 are reduced at the restrictive temperature. (A) Col(g) and scd1-1 roots 12 days after sowing grown under continuous light at 18°C or 25°C. (B,C) Primary root length (B) and lateral root number (C) were measured daily for Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings maintained at 25 or 18°C. The average and SE (n = 20) are reported, although some errors are smaller than the symbols. (D,E) For these experiments, the total number of lateral roots was determined at 10 days after germination, but seedlings were grown at the indicated temperatures prior to this quantification with the average and standard error reported for 20 seedlings. (D) Seedlings were grown continuously at 25°C, or at 18°C for the indicated number of days before transfer to 25°C, or continuously at 18°C, as indicated in the left-hand panel. In the right-hand panel, the number of lateral root primordia are reported. The red box indicates treatment when SCD1 function is sufficient for root formation. (E) The parallel experiment was performed where seedlings were grown continuously at either 18°C, or at 18°C and transferred to 25°C on the indicated day, or continuously at 25°C. The red box indicates treatment when SCD1 function is sufficient for root formation. aIndicates significant differences in genotype between 18°C control and indicated treatment determined by Student’s T-test with p < 0.05. bIndicates significant differences in genotype between 25°C control and indicated treatment as determined by Student’s T-test with p < 0.05.The temperature sensitive phenotype of the scd1-1 mutant allowed us to ask if shorter-term growth at 25°C could induce this lateral root phenotype and whether the impaired root development at this restrictive temperature could be rescued by transition back to the permissive temperature. Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at constant 18°C, or constant 25°C, or grown at 18°C and then transferred to 25°C after 2, 4, or 6 days (Figures 1D,E). For all these treatments, the number of lateral roots was quantified on the 10th day after sowing, there was a significant difference in the number of lateral root initiation events between 18 and 25°C for both Col(g) and scd1-1. Growth at 25°C increased lateral root formation in Col(g) and decreased lateral root formation in scd1-1. When scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18°C for 2 days before transfer to 25°C, significantly fewer lateral roots formed than in plants grown continuously at 18°C, while roots grown at 18°C for 4 or 6 days before transfer to 25°C formed an equivalent number of lateral roots to the continuous 18°C scd1-1 control (red box, Figure 1D), consistent with SCD1 function at 18°C allowing lateral root development. In a parallel experiment, Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 25°C and transferred to 18°C after 2, 4, and 6 days (Figure 1E) to determine if the ability to form roots could be restored upon transition to the permissive temperature. There were significantly more lateral root primordia formed on scd1-1 seedlings switched from 25 to 18°C at days 2 and 4 than seedlings grown at a constant 25°C or transitioned after 6 days. These two experiments indicate that there is a developmental window between 2 and 6 days in which SCD1 function is required for lateral root formation. Gravitropic Curvature Is Delayed in scd1-1 We examined the gravity response in wild type and scd1-1 seedling roots. Wild type and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C for 5 days were rotated 90° (Figure 2). At 18°C, scd1-1 and wild type had identical gravitropic responses. However, at 25°C, Col(g) showed a more rapid response than at 18°C, with root curvature reaching 80° and 50° by 8 h at 25° and 18°C, respectively. In contrast, scd1-1 at 25°C showed a 50% reduction in the gravitropic response relative to Col(g), with root curvature reaching a mean angle of only 40°. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Gravitropic response of scd1-1 at 25°C is impaired relative to wildtype. (A,C) Five day wildtype and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at (A) 18°C or (C) 25°C then rotated 90° relative to the gravity vector, with images taken at up to 8 h after reorientation. The root tips of seedlings at 8 h after reorientation are overlaid on the image of the root before curvature and the arrow shows the position of the root tip at the time of reorientation. (B,D) Root curvature as a function of time after reorientation was quantified after reorientation for (B) roots grown at 18°C and (D) roots grown at 25°C. Error bars = ± SEM. (E) The gravitropic curvature of scd1-1 and Col(g) plants grown for 5 days at 18°C then transferred to 25°C for 12 h prior to reorientation. (F) The gravitropic response of scd1-1 was quantified in seedlings grown at 18°C and transferred to 25°C for 4 h or 8 h before being reoriented 90° relative to the gravity vector. Curvature was measured 8 h after reorientation. aDenotes a significant difference in gravitropic curvature between scd1-1 at the indicated treatment and scd1-1 at 18°C and bdenotes a significant difference between treatment and Col(g) at 18°C. For all panels n = 12 seedlings of each genotype.To eliminate developmental consequences of the scd1-1 phenotype at the restrictive temperature on gravity response, we asked whether the gravity response would be impaired in plants grown at 18°C for 5 days and transferred to 25°C for 4–12 h prior to reorientation. The gravitropic response in the scd1-1 mutant 12 h after transition to 25°C was slower than Col(g), impaired to levels equivalent to seedlings grown continuously at 25°C (Figure 2E). In contrast, scd1-1 seedlings transferred from 18 to 25°C for 4 h before reorientation did not show a decrease in gravitropic curvature as compared to Col(g), while 8 h at 25°C led to a significant, but not complete, inhibition of curvature (Figure 2F). The elongation of roots of Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C and then transferred to 25°C were also monitored (Supplementary Figure S1). A significant decrease in the growth rate of scd1-1 was observed beginning at 5 h after transfer to 25°C, consistent with the impaired symmetric and asymmetric elongation of scd1-1 roots at 25°C, but not 18°C. It is possible that the gravity defect observed in scd1-1 was due to a change in physical structure of the gravity perception machinery, either the columella cells or their statoliths. When roots were grown at 18°C or switched from 18 to 25°C for 24 h, Col(g) and scd1-1 had similar numbers of statoliths per cell and number of columella cells, suggesting that the gravitropic defect in scd1-1 was not due to altered perception of the gravity vector (Supplementary Figure S2). IAA Transport Is Impaired in the scd1-1 Mutant at the Restrictive Temperature Rootward IAA transport, which is required for lateral root emergence (Reed et al., 1998; Bhalerao et al., 2002) was measured using an IAA pulse chase assay. At 18°C, rootward transport was equivalent in Col(g) and scd1-1 (Figure 3A). At 25°C, the length of the zone of transported IAA was reduced (Figure 3B) and a significant reduction in the total rootward IAA transport (the sum of samples in Figures 3A,B) was evident in scd1-1 relative to wild-type (Figure 3C). When rootward IAA transport in Col(g) and scd1-1 grown at constant 18 or 25°C was compared to transport in plants grown at 18°C and transferred to 25°C for 6 h, reduced IAA transport was evident in scd1-1 plants grown at constant 25°C or at 18°C and transferred to 25°C for 6 h (Figure 3D). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab The scd1-1 mutant has reduced IAA transport at the restrictive temperature. Rootward 3H-IAA transport was measured in a pulse chase assay using seedlings grown for 9 and 10 days for Col(g) and scd1-1, respectively, to match seedling length. Transported auxin was quantified in progressive 2 mm segments downstream of the site of application. For all panels, the averages and SE of 19–25 seedlings are reported. (A) Seedlings were grown at 18°C. (B) Seedlings were grown at 25°C. ND indicates that no radioactivity was detected. (C) Comparison of the total rootward IAA transport between Col(g) and scd1-1 at 18 and 25°C, *p < 0.05. (D) Rootward IAA transport was determined for seedlings grown at constant 18 or 25°C or transitioned from 18 to 25°C for 6 h before assay. (E) Shootward IAA transport was measured in thirty 5 day-old seedlings grown at 18°C or 25°C. (F) scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C were transferred to 25°C for 4, 8, and 24 h prior to the 3H-IAA transport assay. Significant reduction in IAA transport in scd1-1 seedlings as compared to Col(g) is indicated *p < 0.05. (G,H) Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings expressing pDR5-GFP, were grown for 7 days and treated with unlabeled IAA at the root tip. Auxin-induced gene expression was reflected in the movement of fluorescence from the root tip toward the shoot in the epidermal tissue at the indicated times after application of IAA at the root tip at (G) 18°C and (H) 25°C. Arrowheads indicate the most distal position of epidermal GFP signal. Scale bar = 50 μm.To determine whether shootward IAA transport, which controls gravity response (Rashotte et al., 2000), was impaired in scd1-1, 3H-IAA was applied to the root tip of 5-day old wild type and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C. After 2 h, shootward transport was measured. At 18°C, there was no significant difference between wild type and scd1-1 in the amount of IAA transported (Figure 3E). At 25°C, wild type roots had a twofold greater shootward auxin transport compared to those grown at 18°C, while scd1-1 showed equivalent levels of IAA transport at 18 and 25°C (Figure 3E). Thus unlike the wild type, scd1-1 does not display a temperature-dependent increase in auxin transport, and had significantly less transport than Col(g) at 25°C. scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18°C for 5 days then transferred to 25°C, and the amount of shootward 3H-IAA transport was determined. Within 8 h of transfer there was a significant decrease in IAA transport compared to wild type, with a further decrease by 24 h (Figure 3F). Wild type and scd1-1 seedlings expressing the auxin-responsive promoter driven reporter (DR5-GFP) were used to follow movement of an auxin-induced gene expression signal using a previously published method (Lewis and Muday, 2009). Unlabeled IAA was applied to the root tips of wild type and scd1-1 seedlings, and the spread of GFP fluorescence in epidermal cells from the root tip toward the shoot was visualized (Figures 3G,H). Before application of IAA, epidermal fluorescence was limited to the root tip (Figure 3G). At 18°C, for up to 4 h after IAA application, a similar steady elongation of the zone of fluorescence along the root tip was observed in wild type and scd1-1 seedlings (Figure 3G). However, at 25°C, scd1-1 roots showed a significantly slower shootward progression of GFP signal than wild type, and even accumulated a bolus of fluorescence near the root tip, consistent with the ability to take up IAA, but not to transport IAA away from the root tip (Figure 3H). These results are consistent with impaired IAA transport from the root tip at the restrictive temperature leading to reduced growth and gravitropic curvature. Gravity-Directed Asymmetric pDR5-GFP Expression Is Altered in scd1-1 Wild type and scd1-1 seedlings containing a reporter of auxin-induced gene expression in which the auxin-responsive DR5 artificial promoter drives GFP synthesis (DR5-GFP) were used to determine whether the altered gravitropic response of scd1-1 was accompanied by a temperature-sensitive defect in the lateral redistribution of auxin at the root tip. Seedlings were grown at 18°C for 5 days then were reoriented 90°, and then imaged at 2 h intervals after staining with propidium iodide (PI) to reveal the boundaries of cells. GFP fluorescence was captured in optical slices through the center of the root with settings optimized to visualize the signal in the epidermis on the lower side of the root. At 18°C roots of both genotypes showed asymmetric auxin-induced GFP fluorescence signal with the GFP signal moving a greater distance from the tip back on the lower side of roots beginning 4 h after reorientation (Figure 4). At 25°C, the wild type seedlings showed this same asymmetric GFP fluorescence, also beginning at 4 h post-reorientation. However, in scd1-1 at 25°C, weak asymmetric DR5-GFP fluorescence was not detected until 6 h post-re-orientation and was substantially less than scd1-1 at 18°C and wild type at either temperature. These data are consistent with reduced asymmetric auxin transport from the root tip affecting the shootward progression of auxin in scd1-1 roots reoriented relative to the gravity vector at 25°C, consistent with a role of SCD1 protein in auxin transport-dependent processes. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab scd1-1 shows decreased lateral distribution of auxin at 25°C as compared to wild type. Col(g) and scd1-1 pDR5-GFP-expressing seedlings were grown vertically for 5 days at 18 or 25°C. After 90° rotation, the asymmetrical pDR5-GFP expression was observed at the root tip at 4, 6, and 8 h after reorientation. The arrows indicate the position farthest from the root tip where asymmetric GFP fluorescence was detected. The seedlings were stained with propidium iodide (magenta) to delineate the cell walls. Representative images from more than 5 roots of each genotype and time point are shown. Scale bar = 50 μm. scd1-1 Shows Altered Localization of PIN Proteins The effects of the scd1-1 mutation on root development, gravitropism, and IAA transport suggests altered targeting of auxin transport proteins. To test this hypothesis, the distribution of PIN2pro::PIN2-GFP (PIN2-GFP) fusion protein was examined in wild type and scd1-1 seedlings (Figure 5). Wild type seedlings grown at 18 and 25°C, and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C displayed a typical asymmetric plasma membrane localization of PIN2-GFP at the shootward face of the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells. The scd1-1 seedlings grown at 25°C showed a reduced region of plasma membrane-localized PIN2-GFP fluorescence, with expression limited to epidermal cells near the root tip, disappearing at the start of the maturation zone (Figure 5A). scd1-1 seedlings grown at 25°C also revealed PIN2-GFP signal in endomembrane bodies, aberrant vesicular compartments in epidermal and cortical cells, similar to those reported previously in response to treatment with chemical that blocks targeting (Drakakaki et al., 2011). The PIN2-GFP endomembrane accumulation was most profound and consistent in the cortical cells in the transition zone (Figure 5B). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab PIN2-GFP shows altered localization in the root tips of the scd1-1 mutant after constitutive growth or transition to the restrictive temperature. (A) Wild type and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18 and 25°C. Scale bar = 50 μm (B) Higher magnification images of Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings grown for 7 days at 25°C. Scale bar = 20 μm. (C) Roots were grown at 18°C for 7 days then transferred to 25°C for the indicated times after transfer. Images representative of more than 100 roots are shown. Scale bar is 20 μm.To determine the time course of the appearance of the PIN2-GFP containing endomembrane bodies in the root epidermis, scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18°C, shifted to 25°C, and observed continuously for 35 min on a temperature-controlled stage at 25°C. In scd1-1, the PIN2-GFP signal was detected in endomembrane bodies 10–15 min after temperature shift, with an increase in frequency continuing over the next 10–15 min (Figure 5C). In Col(g), PIN2-GFP was rarely detected in endomembrane bodies, although a few are evident at 20 min after transition to 25°C. PIN1 localizes to the rootward surface of cells in the root vascular cylinder (Galweiler et al., 1998). The PIN1pro::PIN1-GFP(PIN1-GFP) was also found in endomembrane bodies in scd1-1 mutants at 25°C, but not in wild type (Figure 6). However, at 25°C, PIN3pro::PIN3-GFP (PIN3-GFP) was not detected in endomembrane bodies. The localization of ABCB19 and AUX1 fused to fluorescent proteins was not altered in scd1-1 (Figure 6). These data suggest that without fully functional SCD1 protein, the membrane targeting of PIN1 and PIN2 auxin transport proteins is disrupted. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab PIN1, but not PIN3, ABCB19, or AUX1, was found in endomembrane bodies in scd1-1 mutants. Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings expressing PIN1-GFP, PIN3-GFP, ABCB19-GFP (green), and AUX1-YFP (yellow) were grown for 7 days and imaged by LSCM using identical confocal settings after growth at the non-permissive temperature of 25°C. Propidium iodide was used to stain the cell wall (magenta). Representative images from at least 5 roots are shown. Scale bar = 10 μm. scd1-1 PIN2-GFP Endomembrane Bodies Co-localize With FM4-64 We used the endocytic tracer FM4-64 (Bolte et al., 2004) to determine whether the PIN2-containing endomembrane bodies in scd1-1 at 25°C were endosomes. Root tips of PIN2-GFP scd1-1 were incubated in FM4-64 for 20 min and co-localization of the fluorescent signals was quantified over time. Images captured at 60 min after treatment with FM4-64 contain endomembranes that exhibit FM4-64 fluorescence (magenta) or PIN2-GFP fluorescence (green), with the majority of endomembrane bodies containing both fluorescent signals (Figure 7A). These images contrast with scd1-1 roots treated with FM4-64 for 20 min, where the endomembrane bodies had either PIN2-GFP fluorescence or FM4-64 signal (Supplementary Figure S3) and with Col(g) root where no PIN2-GFP was visible in endomembranes, and there was no colocalization of FM4-64 and PIN2-GFP signal (Supplementary Figure S4). A threshold function was applied to individual channels to quantify co-localization independent of intensity in more than 30 cells from multiple roots at each time point. The thresholded overlay in which pixels were indicated as magenta for FM4-64, green for PIN2-GFP, and white for overlay of FM4-64 and GFP is shown in Figure 7A and Supplementary Figure S3. The percentage of the endomembrane bodies that showed overlapping signals increased steadily over the 60 min time course (Figure 7B), consistent with GFP accumulating in the late endosomes in scd1-1. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Colocalization of PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 in scd1-1. (A) An scd1-1 root containing PIN2-GFP (green) incubated in FM4-64 (magenta) for 20 min, rinsed, and imaged after an additional 40 min (a total of 60 min after initiation of staining). Colocalization is indicated in the overlay as white. The merged image was enhanced using a pseudocolor fill of a thresholded image (last panel). Scale bar = 10 μm. (B) Roots were stained in FM4-64 for 20 min, transferred to water, and imaged immediately (20 min) or at later times as indicated. The percentage of endomembrane bodies containing GFP, FM4-64, or both signals are plotted as a function of time after initiation of staining with FM4-64. The total number of roots examined was 21. At 20 min: n = 3, at 30 min: n = 5, at 40 min: n = 5, at 50 min: n = 4, at 60 min: n = 4. (C) The time course of colocalization was examined in scd1-1 PIN2-GFP roots shifted from 18 to 25°C. scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C for 7 days were transferred to 5 μM FM4-64 for 5 min, rinsed briefly, and then imaged by confocal microscopy at the indicated intervals on a temperature-controlled stage at 25°C. The PIN2-GFP (green) and FM4-64 (magenta) channels are shown separately and in the overlay, where the overlap of both signals is shown in white. Scale bar is 10 μm.To provide details of the kinetics of this response, the accumulation of FM4-64 and PIN2-GFP was observed over time in root tips of scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C for 7 days and placed in FM4-64 for 5 min before transition to 25°C. The formation of PIN2-GFP-positive endomembrane bodies was observed within 15 min after transfer to the non-permissive temperature and remained at relatively constant levels over a 30 min window (Figure 7C). The frequency and brightness of FM4-64 stained endomembranes increases as the dye moves from early to late endosomes. At 15 min some colocalization of FM4-64 and PIN2-GFP was observed, which increased over time with almost complete overlapping endomembrane signals by 20 min. The non-overlapping signals for PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 at early time points and increased colocalization at later time points is consistent with PIN2-GFP accumulation in late endosomes. scd1-1 PIN2-GFP Endomembrane Bodies Co-localize With ARA7 and ARA6 To identify the specific endomembrane compartment in which PIN2-GFP accumulated in scd1-1 mutants grown at 25°C, these lines were crossed with plants expressing red or cyan fluorescent protein fusion markers for five distinct endomembrane compartments (Supplementary Table S1). ARA6 and ARA7 are RAB5 GTPase homologs, found in recycling endosomes (ARA6) (Ebine et al., 2012) or in late endosomes, prevacuolar compartments and the trans Golgi network (ARA7) (Lee et al., 2004; Haas et al., 2007; Jia et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2014; Ito et al., 2018). When scd1-1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP (green) and RFP-ARA7 (magenta) were grown at 25°C, endomembrane bodies were observed that have only PIN2-GFP signal (green) or RFP-ARA7 (magenta) signal, while a subset contain both signals (white) (Figure 8). Higher magnification images of this localization are shown in Figure 9. To determine if PIN2-GFP in endomembrane bodies colocalized with both of these markers in scd1-1 mutants we performed a quantitative colocalization analysis examining signal in multiple PIN2-GFP positive endomembranes. The weighted Manders coefficients (Manders et al., 1993) for the colocalization of PIN2-GFP were 0.94 and 0.91 with ARA7 and ARA6, respectively, and Pearson’s overlap coefficients (Dunn et al., 2011) were 0.82 and 0.83, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The presence of both RFP-ARA7 or ARA6-RFP and PIN2-GFP in a subset of these vesicles is consistent with other cargo proteins that move through a subset of the ARA7-positive endosomes interacting with distinct sets of RAB5 proteins (Dunn et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2018). FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab PIN2 overlays ARA7 and ARA6 in endomembrane bodies found in the root tips of scd1-1 mutants at 25°C. RFP-ARA7 or ARA6-RFP (magenta) were crossed into scd1-1 containing PIN2-GFP (green) roots and fluorescence visualized by confocal microscopy in 7 day old seedlings. Pixels with both green and magenta fluorescence are shown in white. When scd1-1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP and RFP-ARA7 were grown at 25°C, endomembrane bodies were observed that have only PIN2-GFP signal (green) or RFP-ARA7 (magenta) signal, while a subset contain both signals (white). The insets are higher magnifications of the areas delineated by the white boxes above. For each reporter line, more than 20 seedlings were examined. The scale bar is 10 μm.FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab PIN2 co-localizes with ARA7 and ARA6 in endomembrane bodies scd1-1 mutants at 25°C. Roots of scd1-1 containing ARA7-RFP or ARA6-RFP (magenta) and PIN2-GFP (green) roots were visualized by confocal microscopy in 7 day old seedlings. The overlay shows pixels with both green and magenta fluorescence as white. Using colocalization software, thresholds were generated to better illustrate pixels with both fluorescent signals from 4 roots of each line. Colocalization graphs are shown for endomembrane bodies that are circled.We found little or no overlap in the endomembrane localization of PIN2-GFP fluorescence in lines containing reporters localized in either the early endosome (VHA1-RFP) (Geldner et al., 2007) TGN (SYP61-CFP) (Robert et al., 2008), or the sorting endosome (SNX1-RFP) (Jaillais et al., 2006, 2007; Supplementary Figure S5). These results are consistent with PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 accumulating in late multivesicular endosomes and not in other compartments.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Polar transport of the hormone auxin from cell to cell is controlled by the asymmetric localization of the PIN family of IAA efflux carriers (Grunewald and Friml, 2010; Zazimalova et al., 2010; Adamowski and Friml, 2015). These carrier proteins are directed to specific plasma membrane domains through dynamically regulated membrane trafficking and recycling pathways (Geldner, 2009; Grunewald and Friml, 2010; Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014). Internal and external environmental cues also affect the localization of the PIN proteins through regulation of the flow of PIN proteins between the endosome and plasma membrane (Paciorek et al., 2005; Jasik et al., 2013, 2016; Rakusova et al., 2015), as well as between the plasma membrane and the lytic vacuole (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008a). In this study we utilized a temperature-sensitive scd1-1 mutant to uncover the dynamics of auxin transport targeting and how these reversible changes in protein targeting control auxin transport and dependent process. SCD1 contains a DENN domain found in proteins with RAB-directed GEF activity and in proteins that interact with clathrin (Patino-Lopez et al., 2008; Sato et al., 2008; McMichael et al., 2013). SCD1 null mutants have revealed the function of this protein as a RAB-GEF that participates in both endocytosis and exocytosis (Mayers et al., 2017). The effects of the temperature-sensitive scd1-1 mutant on root development was examined at the permissive and restrictive temperatures of 18 and 25°C, respectively. We found that scd1-1 exhibits a suite of phenotypes only at restrictive temperature, which include impaired root elongation and gravity response, reduced lateral root formation, and inhibition of formation of asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression across a gravity-stimulated root. These phenotypes were also induced when plants were grown at the permissive temperature and then transitioned to the restrictive temperature and could be reversed when plants were transitioned from the restrictive temperature back to the permissive temperature. As all of these phenotypes are dependent on auxin transport, we also measured both shootward and rootward transport and found that both are impaired at the restrictive temperature. The ability to reversibly manipulate lateral root development in the scd1-1 mutant provided unique insight into how this process is regulated and revealed the critical time point when SCD1 and auxin transport are needed for lateral root development. A temperature-switch assay was performed resulting in the shift of seedlings from the permissive temperature to the non-permissive temperature or vice versa over 10 days. These data support the hypothesis that SCD1 is needed for lateral root development between days 2 and 6. Transition from the permissive to non-permissive temperature also reduces auxin transport in scd1-1 (but not Col(g)) showing reductions in the long distance rootward transport within 8 h after transition. A previous report suggested that there is specific regulation of auxin transport in this time window with a pulse of auxin moving from the shoot to the root at 3–5 days, which correlated with the emergence of the first lateral root (Bhalerao et al., 2002). Our ability to reversibly alter auxin transport by turning off or on SCD1 function support the model of an auxin pulse that drives root formation that occurs within a precise developmental window. The effects of the scd1-1 mutation on auxin transport and gravitropism were evident after both long and short-term exposure to the non-permissive temperature, with changes in auxin transport evident preceding gravitropic differences. When grown continuously at 25°C or within 8 h after transfer from the permissive 18°C temperature, scd1-1 seedlings showed reduced shootward 3H-IAA transport and accumulation of auxin-induced gene expression at the root tip, consistent with impaired auxin transport away from the site of application. Similarly, continuous growth at 25°C or a shift from 18 to 25°C for 8 h showed a significant decrease in the gravitropic curvature in scd1-1 compared to wild type. Auxin-induced gene expression, visualized via DR5-GFP fluorescence (Muday and Rahman, 2008; Geisler et al., 2014) was rapidly enhanced on the lower side of Col(g) roots after gravitropic reorientation, but was impaired in scd1-1 seedlings relative to wild type only in plants grown at 25°C. These data support the hypothesis that a functional SCD1 protein is needed to maintain polar and lateral auxin transport and the physiological processes dependent upon dynamic changes in appropriate auxin distribution. Consistent with this model, altered PIN2-GFP trafficking is even more rapidly perturbed in scd1-1 than auxin movements and gravity response. Because PIN2 is required for rootward transport and root gravitropism (Muller et al., 1998; Rashotte et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2002), we compared its localization in the scd1-1 mutant and wild type using a PIN2-GFP reporter. At 25°C, PIN2 is normally localized to the plasma membrane on the shootward end of cells of the lateral root cap and epidermis of the developing root of wild type seedlings (Muller et al., 1998). In the scd1-1 mutant, PIN2-GFP was not restricted to the plasma membrane but was also localized in endomembrane bodies. Mayers et al. (2017) showed that scd1-2 has altered PIN2-GFP trafficking during treatment with brefeldin A, a drug which blocks intracellular endosome and trans-Golgi transport. However, we find that in scd1-1 at the restrictive temperature, PIN2-GFP accumulates in the absence of BFA. The trafficking defect is not detectable in scd1-1 roots grown at 18°C, but when switched from 18 to 25°C, the PIN2 trafficking defect becomes apparent within minutes. Since changes in auxin transport and root growth and development are not observed for 8–12 h, this suggests that these responses are sequential and that PIN mislocalization is not a secondary result of compromised root development at 25°C. The linkage is most evident in terms of gravity response. PIN2 controls shootward auxin transport that is required for gravitropism (Muller et al., 1998; Rashotte et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2002). Upon transition of scd1-1 to the non-permissive temperature, PIN2-GFP endomembrane accumulation is evident with less than hour. In Col(g) a transition from 18 to 25°C increases shootward transport by more than fivefold within 5 h, leading to a more than twofold greater transport in Col(g) than in scd1-1. Treatment of roots for 12 h at the non-permissive temperature impaired gravity response in scd1-1 to levels consistent with constitutive growth at this non-permissive temperature. Together these results support the timeline where PIN2 targeting is impaired, reducing auxin transport and then dependent physiological processes. We also detected l PIN1-GFP within endomembrane bodies in scd1-1. However, other fluorescent fusions to the auxin transport proteins PIN3, ABCB19, and AUX1, were not observed in any endomembrane compartments. As all of these proteins are trafficked and recycled, and the scd1-1 mutation most strongly affects PIN1 and PIN2 and dependent physiological processes, there appears to be selectivity of SCD1 targets toward PIN2 and PIN1, which is consistent with other studies that reveal distinct regulatory and trafficking machinery between auxin transporters (Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014; Weller et al., 2017). Other reports have indicated that ABCB19 and AUX1 localization are regulated by different trafficking mechanisms than those that regulate PIN1 and PIN2 (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2006; Titapiwatanakun et al., 2008). The results are based on differences in the trafficking of these proteins in response to brefeldin A and FM4-64 uptake (Titapiwatanakun et al., 2008). We find that in scd1-1 at 25°C, PIN2-GFP accumulates in the late or multivesicular endosome. Impaired uptake of the endosomal marker dye FM4-64 has previously been observed in scd1-1, suggesting that SCD1 participates in endocytosis via clathrin coated vesicles (McMichael et al., 2013). To determine whether FM4-64 accumulates in the PIN2 endomembrane bodies observed here, the roots of scd1-1 containing PIN2-GFP grown at 18°C and transferred to 25°C were treated with FM4-64. Although initially there was little co-localization, within 20 min significant overlap was observed. These results are consistent with PIN2 being trapped in scd1 mutants in a late or multivesicular endosome or pre-vacuolar compartment on its way to or from the plasma membrane through the endosome. To confirm that the endomembranes in which PIN2-GFP accumulates in scd1-1 are late endosomes, we crossed multiple endosomal markers into this mutant and performed colocalization analyses. In scd1-1 at 25°C, but not 18°C, we observed PIN2-GFP colocalization with ARA7 and to a lesser extent with ARA6. ARA6 and ARA7 are RAB5 GTPases contained in late multivesicular endosomes, with related, but not identical trafficking activities (Ueda et al., 2004; Beck et al., 2012; Ebine et al., 2012; Paez Valencia et al., 2016). ARA7 function is required for vesicle transport between the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) and the vacuole (Lee et al., 2004; Haas et al., 2007; Jia et al., 2013) and ARA6 is associated with transport between the PVC and the plasma membrane, where it may regulate trafficking from the endosome to the plasma membrane (Ebine et al., 2011, 2012). PIN2 has also been localized to ARA7 vesicles in Arabidopsis roots after treatment with endosidin 16, which inhibits apical membrane trafficking (Li et al., 2017). The colocalization of PIN2 with both ARA7 and ARA6 Rab-related GTPases is not surprising considering that compartments bearing ARA7 and ARA6 have been previously shown to partially overlap, despite evidence that they are distinct endosomal compartments (Ueda et al., 2004; Beck et al., 2012; Ebine et al., 2012). The PVC, where both ARA6 and ARA7 are found, is a distinct organelle in plants that facilitates the transport of materials from the endosomes to the vacuole (Contento and Bassham, 2012). Using immunogold and confocal microscopy, plasma membrane proteins that pass through the PVC have been shown to be directed to the vacuole for degradation (Haas et al., 2007; Viotti et al., 2010). Thus, association of PIN2 with the PVC in scd1-1 suggests that PIN2 in the PVC is likely targeted to the vacuole for degradation. This could explain the reduced domain of PIN2-GFP staining seen in the mutants at the restrictive temperature, coincident with the changes in columella cells. However, there is also evidence that suggests that PIN2 can be retrieved from the PVC and recycled (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008b; Spitzer et al., 2009). Indeed, PIN1, PIN2, and AUX1 are targeted to the vacuole through the multi-vesicular body (MVB), and RabF2A co-localizes in the MVB with PIN1-GFP (Spitzer et al., 2009). The localization of PIN2-GFP in late endosomal compartments in scd1-1 is consistent with reports that PIN protein turnover involves both cycling between the endosome and plasma membrane and vacuolar degradation, depending on environmental conditions (Paciorek et al., 2005; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008b; Grunewald and Friml, 2010; Jasik et al., 2013). For example, when roots are reoriented relative to the gravity vector, enhanced endocytosis of PIN2 at the apical membrane followed by degradation through sorting to a proteolytic endosomal compartment resulted in asymmetric distribution of PIN2, redirected auxin flow, and root bending (Abas et al., 2006). The mis-localization and loss of membrane PIN2 in scd1-1 explains the observed reductions in auxin transport and the observed phenotypes. The efficient targeting of auxin transport proteins to the plasma membrane is required for appropriate auxin transport and dependent physiological processes. In this paper we have shown that the conditional scd1-1 mutant, with a defect in a gene that functions as a RAB-GEF (Mayers et al., 2017), has altered localization of PIN2, with accumulation of this protein in endomembrane bodies. The PIN2-GFP containing endomembrane bodies in scd1-1 showed dye accumulation and fluorescent protein reporter expression consistent with a late endosomal/prevacuolar character. Consistent with this altered protein localization, polar auxin transport and gravity response are impaired in scd1-1. The kinetics of the alterations in these responses upon transition to the non-permissive temperature demonstrate that altered trafficking of PIN2 is observed within minutes of transition to this temperature, while auxin transport and gravity defects are measured hours later, and root developmental defects can be quantified days after transition. These findings provide direct evidence that disruption of the targeting machinery which disrupts PIN2 protein localization precedes reductions in auxin transport and changes in auxin transport-dependent physiological processes.",

Copyright notice ID: 7358545 PMID: 32733502 Abstract Auxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport proteins of the PIN-formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele of Arabidopsis thaliana SCD1 (stomatal cytokinesis defective1) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. In scd1-1 at 25°C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 exhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature. Keywords: SCD1, gravitropism, lateral root, auxin transport, PIN2, Arabidopsis thalianaIntroduction The process of auxin transport drives many aspects of plant development, including primary root elongation, lateral root development, and asymmetric growth in response to gravity and light gradients (Muday and DeLong, 2001; Vieten et al., 2007; Zazimalova et al., 2010). Auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) is transported long distances in two polarities in two root cell layers (Muday and DeLong, 2001). Cell to cell IAA transport is mediated by AUX/LAX influx carriers and by efflux carriers of the PIN and ABCB families (Zazimalova et al., 2010). Directionality is controlled by asymmetric localization of PIN proteins at the plasma membrane (Wisniewska et al., 2006; Adamowski and Friml, 2015). In Arabidopsis roots, PIN1 is localized to the stele and implicated in auxin transport toward the root apex (Galweiler et al., 1998), which is now called rootward transport and this auxin flow is required for lateral root development (Reed et al., 1998; Lavenus et al., 2013). In contrast, PIN2 is localized to the epidermal and cortical cell layers of roots and mediates shootward transport from the root apex (Muller et al., 1998), which is integral to root elongation and gravitropism (Rashotte et al., 2000). PIN3 is localized to the columella cells at the root tip, where the angle of the gravity vector is perceived, and in the vascular cylinder, consistent with functions in gravitropism and root development, respectively (Friml et al., 2002; Harrison and Masson, 2007). The polar distribution of the PIN proteins is dynamic (Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014; Weller et al., 2017). Targeting of PIN proteins to the membrane in response to stimuli may be an important mechanism to allow changes in auxin transport and dependent growth processes (Paciorek et al., 2005; Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014). PIN proteins travel through the endosome to the plasma membrane after de novo synthesis through a highly regulated process (Jasik et al., 2013, 2016) involving the RAB and ARF families of small G proteins. GNOM, a well-studied ARF-GEF and target of the drug Brefeldin A, is critical in targeting of PIN1 and PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane (Geldner et al., 2001, 2004, 2003). Although genetic approaches have identified pathways for targeting PIN proteins (Adamowski and Friml, 2015), non-conditional mutants with impaired auxin transport, such as gnom, have profound developmental phenotypes (Geldner et al., 2003). This complicates determination of whether altered auxin transport causes developmental phenotypes or the converse. This study used a conditional scd1-1 mutant to test whether auxin transport trafficking defects precede growth or developmental phenotypes. The SCD1 protein has a DENN domain, found exclusively in RAB-GEFs (Yoshimura et al., 2010; Marat et al., 2011). SCD1 and an associated protein, SCD2, have been shown to complex with a RabE1 at the exocyst in Arabidopsis roots (Mayers et al., 2017), where it plays a role in exocytosis and recycling of membrane proteins. Three scd1 mutant alleles have been described: scd1-1, scd1-2, and scd1-3 (Falbel et al., 2003). scd1-2 and scd1-3 are loss of function mutants with altered guard cell development, and profound root growth and developmental phenotypes. However, the temperature sensitive scd1-1 allele, displays these phenotypes only at the restrictive temperature of 25°C (Falbel et al., 2003). This study utilizes the unique features of a temperature sensitive scd1-1 mutant allele to demonstrate that the growth and developmental effects in Arabidopsis roots at the restrictive temperature are tied to altered auxin transport protein targeting. The developmental and auxin transport defects can be induced by transition to the restrictive temperature and reversed by return to the permissive temperature. We report the effects of these treatments on polar auxin transport and dependent physiological processes including lateral root development, gravity response, and root elongation. At the restrictive temperature, PIN2 fused to GFP accumulates in endomembrane vesicles in scd1-1, which is consistent with a role of SCD1 in controlling PIN endomembrane targeting. Auxin transport and endomembrane accumulation of a PIN2 reporter were examined both in scd1-1 grown continuously at the restrictive temperature or in seedlings transitioned briefly to this temperature. The endomembrane bodies in which the PIN2 fusion protein is localized also accumulate other proteins that are linked to the late multivesicular endosome and the endosome dye FM4-64 after an extended incubation. These results provide support for the hypothesis that SCD1 protein functions to regulate the movement of PIN2 to and from the plasma membrane and that these transient changes in localization occur more rapidly than changes in auxin transport and dependent developmental processes.Results Root Elongation and Lateral Root Development Are Temperature-Sensitive in scd1-1 If scd1-1 has a defect in targeting of auxin transport proteins, then alterations in auxin transport-dependent root responses, including primary root elongation, gravitropism, and lateral root development, would be expected. Root growth and development of scd1-1 were compared to its parental line, Columbia glabrous-1 [(Col(g)], at 18°C and at 25°C. At 18°C, Col(g) and scd1-1 had similar primary root elongation rates and lateral root numbers (Figure 1). At 25°C scd1-1 primary roots were substantially shorter than Col(g) (Figure 1B), and the number of lateral roots were dramatically reduced (Figures 1B,C). We performed a two-way ANOVA to determine which of these differences were statistically significant across this time course. In both root elongation and lateral root development, scd1-1 was significantly impaired relative to Col(g) at both temperatures with p < 0.01 for all comparisons. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Root growth and lateral root formation in scd1-1 are reduced at the restrictive temperature. (A) Col(g) and scd1-1 roots 12 days after sowing grown under continuous light at 18°C or 25°C. (B,C) Primary root length (B) and lateral root number (C) were measured daily for Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings maintained at 25 or 18°C. The average and SE (n = 20) are reported, although some errors are smaller than the symbols. (D,E) For these experiments, the total number of lateral roots was determined at 10 days after germination, but seedlings were grown at the indicated temperatures prior to this quantification with the average and standard error reported for 20 seedlings. (D) Seedlings were grown continuously at 25°C, or at 18°C for the indicated number of days before transfer to 25°C, or continuously at 18°C, as indicated in the left-hand panel. In the right-hand panel, the number of lateral root primordia are reported. The red box indicates treatment when SCD1 function is sufficient for root formation. (E) The parallel experiment was performed where seedlings were grown continuously at either 18°C, or at 18°C and transferred to 25°C on the indicated day, or continuously at 25°C. The red box indicates treatment when SCD1 function is sufficient for root formation. aIndicates significant differences in genotype between 18°C control and indicated treatment determined by Student’s T-test with p < 0.05. bIndicates significant differences in genotype between 25°C control and indicated treatment as determined by Student’s T-test with p < 0.05.The temperature sensitive phenotype of the scd1-1 mutant allowed us to ask if shorter-term growth at 25°C could induce this lateral root phenotype and whether the impaired root development at this restrictive temperature could be rescued by transition back to the permissive temperature. Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at constant 18°C, or constant 25°C, or grown at 18°C and then transferred to 25°C after 2, 4, or 6 days (Figures 1D,E). For all these treatments, the number of lateral roots was quantified on the 10th day after sowing, there was a significant difference in the number of lateral root initiation events between 18 and 25°C for both Col(g) and scd1-1. Growth at 25°C increased lateral root formation in Col(g) and decreased lateral root formation in scd1-1. When scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18°C for 2 days before transfer to 25°C, significantly fewer lateral roots formed than in plants grown continuously at 18°C, while roots grown at 18°C for 4 or 6 days before transfer to 25°C formed an equivalent number of lateral roots to the continuous 18°C scd1-1 control (red box, Figure 1D), consistent with SCD1 function at 18°C allowing lateral root development. In a parallel experiment, Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 25°C and transferred to 18°C after 2, 4, and 6 days (Figure 1E) to determine if the ability to form roots could be restored upon transition to the permissive temperature. There were significantly more lateral root primordia formed on scd1-1 seedlings switched from 25 to 18°C at days 2 and 4 than seedlings grown at a constant 25°C or transitioned after 6 days. These two experiments indicate that there is a developmental window between 2 and 6 days in which SCD1 function is required for lateral root formation.Gravitropic Curvature Is Delayed in scd1-1 We examined the gravity response in wild type and scd1-1 seedling roots. Wild type and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C for 5 days were rotated 90° (Figure 2). At 18°C, scd1-1 and wild type had identical gravitropic responses. However, at 25°C, Col(g) showed a more rapid response than at 18°C, with root curvature reaching 80° and 50° by 8 h at 25° and 18°C, respectively. In contrast, scd1-1 at 25°C showed a 50% reduction in the gravitropic response relative to Col(g), with root curvature reaching a mean angle of only 40°. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Gravitropic response of scd1-1 at 25°C is impaired relative to wildtype. (A,C) Five day wildtype and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at (A) 18°C or (C) 25°C then rotated 90° relative to the gravity vector, with images taken at up to 8 h after reorientation. The root tips of seedlings at 8 h after reorientation are overlaid on the image of the root before curvature and the arrow shows the position of the root tip at the time of reorientation. (B,D) Root curvature as a function of time after reorientation was quantified after reorientation for (B) roots grown at 18°C and (D) roots grown at 25°C. Error bars = ± SEM. (E) The gravitropic curvature of scd1-1 and Col(g) plants grown for 5 days at 18°C then transferred to 25°C for 12 h prior to reorientation. (F) The gravitropic response of scd1-1 was quantified in seedlings grown at 18°C and transferred to 25°C for 4 h or 8 h before being reoriented 90° relative to the gravity vector. Curvature was measured 8 h after reorientation. aDenotes a significant difference in gravitropic curvature between scd1-1 at the indicated treatment and scd1-1 at 18°C and bdenotes a significant difference between treatment and Col(g) at 18°C. For all panels n = 12 seedlings of each genotype.To eliminate developmental consequences of the scd1-1 phenotype at the restrictive temperature on gravity response, we asked whether the gravity response would be impaired in plants grown at 18°C for 5 days and transferred to 25°C for 4–12 h prior to reorientation. The gravitropic response in the scd1-1 mutant 12 h after transition to 25°C was slower than Col(g), impaired to levels equivalent to seedlings grown continuously at 25°C (Figure 2E). In contrast, scd1-1 seedlings transferred from 18 to 25°C for 4 h before reorientation did not show a decrease in gravitropic curvature as compared to Col(g), while 8 h at 25°C led to a significant, but not complete, inhibition of curvature (Figure 2F). The elongation of roots of Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C and then transferred to 25°C were also monitored (Supplementary Figure S1). A significant decrease in the growth rate of scd1-1 was observed beginning at 5 h after transfer to 25°C, consistent with the impaired symmetric and asymmetric elongation of scd1-1 roots at 25°C, but not 18°C. It is possible that the gravity defect observed in scd1-1 was due to a change in physical structure of the gravity perception machinery, either the columella cells or their statoliths. When roots were grown at 18°C or switched from 18 to 25°C for 24 h, Col(g) and scd1-1 had similar numbers of statoliths per cell and number of columella cells, suggesting that the gravitropic defect in scd1-1 was not due to altered perception of the gravity vector (Supplementary Figure S2).IAA Transport Is Impaired in the scd1-1 Mutant at the Restrictive Temperature Rootward IAA transport, which is required for lateral root emergence (Reed et al., 1998; Bhalerao et al., 2002) was measured using an IAA pulse chase assay. At 18°C, rootward transport was equivalent in Col(g) and scd1-1 (Figure 3A). At 25°C, the length of the zone of transported IAA was reduced (Figure 3B) and a significant reduction in the total rootward IAA transport (the sum of samples in Figures 3A,B) was evident in scd1-1 relative to wild-type (Figure 3C). When rootward IAA transport in Col(g) and scd1-1 grown at constant 18 or 25°C was compared to transport in plants grown at 18°C and transferred to 25°C for 6 h, reduced IAA transport was evident in scd1-1 plants grown at constant 25°C or at 18°C and transferred to 25°C for 6 h (Figure 3D). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab The scd1-1 mutant has reduced IAA transport at the restrictive temperature. Rootward 3H-IAA transport was measured in a pulse chase assay using seedlings grown for 9 and 10 days for Col(g) and scd1-1, respectively, to match seedling length. Transported auxin was quantified in progressive 2 mm segments downstream of the site of application. For all panels, the averages and SE of 19–25 seedlings are reported. (A) Seedlings were grown at 18°C. (B) Seedlings were grown at 25°C. ND indicates that no radioactivity was detected. (C) Comparison of the total rootward IAA transport between Col(g) and scd1-1 at 18 and 25°C, *p < 0.05. (D) Rootward IAA transport was determined for seedlings grown at constant 18 or 25°C or transitioned from 18 to 25°C for 6 h before assay. (E) Shootward IAA transport was measured in thirty 5 day-old seedlings grown at 18°C or 25°C. (F) scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C were transferred to 25°C for 4, 8, and 24 h prior to the 3H-IAA transport assay. Significant reduction in IAA transport in scd1-1 seedlings as compared to Col(g) is indicated *p < 0.05. (G,H) Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings expressing pDR5-GFP, were grown for 7 days and treated with unlabeled IAA at the root tip. Auxin-induced gene expression was reflected in the movement of fluorescence from the root tip toward the shoot in the epidermal tissue at the indicated times after application of IAA at the root tip at (G) 18°C and (H) 25°C. Arrowheads indicate the most distal position of epidermal GFP signal. Scale bar = 50 μm.To determine whether shootward IAA transport, which controls gravity response (Rashotte et al., 2000), was impaired in scd1-1, 3H-IAA was applied to the root tip of 5-day old wild type and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C. After 2 h, shootward transport was measured. At 18°C, there was no significant difference between wild type and scd1-1 in the amount of IAA transported (Figure 3E). At 25°C, wild type roots had a twofold greater shootward auxin transport compared to those grown at 18°C, while scd1-1 showed equivalent levels of IAA transport at 18 and 25°C (Figure 3E). Thus unlike the wild type, scd1-1 does not display a temperature-dependent increase in auxin transport, and had significantly less transport than Col(g) at 25°C. scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18°C for 5 days then transferred to 25°C, and the amount of shootward 3H-IAA transport was determined. Within 8 h of transfer there was a significant decrease in IAA transport compared to wild type, with a further decrease by 24 h (Figure 3F). Wild type and scd1-1 seedlings expressing the auxin-responsive promoter driven reporter (DR5-GFP) were used to follow movement of an auxin-induced gene expression signal using a previously published method (Lewis and Muday, 2009). Unlabeled IAA was applied to the root tips of wild type and scd1-1 seedlings, and the spread of GFP fluorescence in epidermal cells from the root tip toward the shoot was visualized (Figures 3G,H). Before application of IAA, epidermal fluorescence was limited to the root tip (Figure 3G). At 18°C, for up to 4 h after IAA application, a similar steady elongation of the zone of fluorescence along the root tip was observed in wild type and scd1-1 seedlings (Figure 3G). However, at 25°C, scd1-1 roots showed a significantly slower shootward progression of GFP signal than wild type, and even accumulated a bolus of fluorescence near the root tip, consistent with the ability to take up IAA, but not to transport IAA away from the root tip (Figure 3H). These results are consistent with impaired IAA transport from the root tip at the restrictive temperature leading to reduced growth and gravitropic curvature.Gravity-Directed Asymmetric pDR5-GFP Expression Is Altered in scd1-1 Wild type and scd1-1 seedlings containing a reporter of auxin-induced gene expression in which the auxin-responsive DR5 artificial promoter drives GFP synthesis (DR5-GFP) were used to determine whether the altered gravitropic response of scd1-1 was accompanied by a temperature-sensitive defect in the lateral redistribution of auxin at the root tip. Seedlings were grown at 18°C for 5 days then were reoriented 90°, and then imaged at 2 h intervals after staining with propidium iodide (PI) to reveal the boundaries of cells. GFP fluorescence was captured in optical slices through the center of the root with settings optimized to visualize the signal in the epidermis on the lower side of the root. At 18°C roots of both genotypes showed asymmetric auxin-induced GFP fluorescence signal with the GFP signal moving a greater distance from the tip back on the lower side of roots beginning 4 h after reorientation (Figure 4). At 25°C, the wild type seedlings showed this same asymmetric GFP fluorescence, also beginning at 4 h post-reorientation. However, in scd1-1 at 25°C, weak asymmetric DR5-GFP fluorescence was not detected until 6 h post-re-orientation and was substantially less than scd1-1 at 18°C and wild type at either temperature. These data are consistent with reduced asymmetric auxin transport from the root tip affecting the shootward progression of auxin in scd1-1 roots reoriented relative to the gravity vector at 25°C, consistent with a role of SCD1 protein in auxin transport-dependent processes. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab scd1-1 shows decreased lateral distribution of auxin at 25°C as compared to wild type. Col(g) and scd1-1 pDR5-GFP-expressing seedlings were grown vertically for 5 days at 18 or 25°C. After 90° rotation, the asymmetrical pDR5-GFP expression was observed at the root tip at 4, 6, and 8 h after reorientation. The arrows indicate the position farthest from the root tip where asymmetric GFP fluorescence was detected. The seedlings were stained with propidium iodide (magenta) to delineate the cell walls. Representative images from more than 5 roots of each genotype and time point are shown. Scale bar = 50 μm. scd1-1 Shows Altered Localization of PIN Proteins The effects of the scd1-1 mutation on root development, gravitropism, and IAA transport suggests altered targeting of auxin transport proteins. To test this hypothesis, the distribution of PIN2pro::PIN2-GFP (PIN2-GFP) fusion protein was examined in wild type and scd1-1 seedlings (Figure 5). Wild type seedlings grown at 18 and 25°C, and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C displayed a typical asymmetric plasma membrane localization of PIN2-GFP at the shootward face of the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells. The scd1-1 seedlings grown at 25°C showed a reduced region of plasma membrane-localized PIN2-GFP fluorescence, with expression limited to epidermal cells near the root tip, disappearing at the start of the maturation zone (Figure 5A). scd1-1 seedlings grown at 25°C also revealed PIN2-GFP signal in endomembrane bodies, aberrant vesicular compartments in epidermal and cortical cells, similar to those reported previously in response to treatment with chemical that blocks targeting (Drakakaki et al., 2011). The PIN2-GFP endomembrane accumulation was most profound and consistent in the cortical cells in the transition zone (Figure 5B). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab PIN2-GFP shows altered localization in the root tips of the scd1-1 mutant after constitutive growth or transition to the restrictive temperature. (A) Wild type and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18 and 25°C. Scale bar = 50 μm (B) Higher magnification images of Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings grown for 7 days at 25°C. Scale bar = 20 μm. (C) Roots were grown at 18°C for 7 days then transferred to 25°C for the indicated times after transfer. Images representative of more than 100 roots are shown. Scale bar is 20 μm.To determine the time course of the appearance of the PIN2-GFP containing endomembrane bodies in the root epidermis, scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18°C, shifted to 25°C, and observed continuously for 35 min on a temperature-controlled stage at 25°C. In scd1-1, the PIN2-GFP signal was detected in endomembrane bodies 10–15 min after temperature shift, with an increase in frequency continuing over the next 10–15 min (Figure 5C). In Col(g), PIN2-GFP was rarely detected in endomembrane bodies, although a few are evident at 20 min after transition to 25°C. PIN1 localizes to the rootward surface of cells in the root vascular cylinder (Galweiler et al., 1998). The PIN1pro::PIN1-GFP(PIN1-GFP) was also found in endomembrane bodies in scd1-1 mutants at 25°C, but not in wild type (Figure 6). However, at 25°C, PIN3pro::PIN3-GFP (PIN3-GFP) was not detected in endomembrane bodies. The localization of ABCB19 and AUX1 fused to fluorescent proteins was not altered in scd1-1 (Figure 6). These data suggest that without fully functional SCD1 protein, the membrane targeting of PIN1 and PIN2 auxin transport proteins is disrupted. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab PIN1, but not PIN3, ABCB19, or AUX1, was found in endomembrane bodies in scd1-1 mutants. Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings expressing PIN1-GFP, PIN3-GFP, ABCB19-GFP (green), and AUX1-YFP (yellow) were grown for 7 days and imaged by LSCM using identical confocal settings after growth at the non-permissive temperature of 25°C. Propidium iodide was used to stain the cell wall (magenta). Representative images from at least 5 roots are shown. Scale bar = 10 μm. scd1-1 PIN2-GFP Endomembrane Bodies Co-localize With FM4-64 We used the endocytic tracer FM4-64 (Bolte et al., 2004) to determine whether the PIN2-containing endomembrane bodies in scd1-1 at 25°C were endosomes. Root tips of PIN2-GFP scd1-1 were incubated in FM4-64 for 20 min and co-localization of the fluorescent signals was quantified over time. Images captured at 60 min after treatment with FM4-64 contain endomembranes that exhibit FM4-64 fluorescence (magenta) or PIN2-GFP fluorescence (green), with the majority of endomembrane bodies containing both fluorescent signals (Figure 7A). These images contrast with scd1-1 roots treated with FM4-64 for 20 min, where the endomembrane bodies had either PIN2-GFP fluorescence or FM4-64 signal (Supplementary Figure S3) and with Col(g) root where no PIN2-GFP was visible in endomembranes, and there was no colocalization of FM4-64 and PIN2-GFP signal (Supplementary Figure S4). A threshold function was applied to individual channels to quantify co-localization independent of intensity in more than 30 cells from multiple roots at each time point. The thresholded overlay in which pixels were indicated as magenta for FM4-64, green for PIN2-GFP, and white for overlay of FM4-64 and GFP is shown in Figure 7A and Supplementary Figure S3. The percentage of the endomembrane bodies that showed overlapping signals increased steadily over the 60 min time course (Figure 7B), consistent with GFP accumulating in the late endosomes in scd1-1. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Colocalization of PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 in scd1-1. (A) An scd1-1 root containing PIN2-GFP (green) incubated in FM4-64 (magenta) for 20 min, rinsed, and imaged after an additional 40 min (a total of 60 min after initiation of staining). Colocalization is indicated in the overlay as white. The merged image was enhanced using a pseudocolor fill of a thresholded image (last panel). Scale bar = 10 μm. (B) Roots were stained in FM4-64 for 20 min, transferred to water, and imaged immediately (20 min) or at later times as indicated. The percentage of endomembrane bodies containing GFP, FM4-64, or both signals are plotted as a function of time after initiation of staining with FM4-64. The total number of roots examined was 21. At 20 min: n = 3, at 30 min: n = 5, at 40 min: n = 5, at 50 min: n = 4, at 60 min: n = 4. (C) The time course of colocalization was examined in scd1-1 PIN2-GFP roots shifted from 18 to 25°C. scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C for 7 days were transferred to 5 μM FM4-64 for 5 min, rinsed briefly, and then imaged by confocal microscopy at the indicated intervals on a temperature-controlled stage at 25°C. The PIN2-GFP (green) and FM4-64 (magenta) channels are shown separately and in the overlay, where the overlap of both signals is shown in white. Scale bar is 10 μm.To provide details of the kinetics of this response, the accumulation of FM4-64 and PIN2-GFP was observed over time in root tips of scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C for 7 days and placed in FM4-64 for 5 min before transition to 25°C. The formation of PIN2-GFP-positive endomembrane bodies was observed within 15 min after transfer to the non-permissive temperature and remained at relatively constant levels over a 30 min window (Figure 7C). The frequency and brightness of FM4-64 stained endomembranes increases as the dye moves from early to late endosomes. At 15 min some colocalization of FM4-64 and PIN2-GFP was observed, which increased over time with almost complete overlapping endomembrane signals by 20 min. The non-overlapping signals for PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 at early time points and increased colocalization at later time points is consistent with PIN2-GFP accumulation in late endosomes. scd1-1 PIN2-GFP Endomembrane Bodies Co-localize With ARA7 and ARA6 To identify the specific endomembrane compartment in which PIN2-GFP accumulated in scd1-1 mutants grown at 25°C, these lines were crossed with plants expressing red or cyan fluorescent protein fusion markers for five distinct endomembrane compartments (Supplementary Table S1). ARA6 and ARA7 are RAB5 GTPase homologs, found in recycling endosomes (ARA6) (Ebine et al., 2012) or in late endosomes, prevacuolar compartments and the trans Golgi network (ARA7) (Lee et al., 2004; Haas et al., 2007; Jia et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2014; Ito et al., 2018). When scd1-1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP (green) and RFP-ARA7 (magenta) were grown at 25°C, endomembrane bodies were observed that have only PIN2-GFP signal (green) or RFP-ARA7 (magenta) signal, while a subset contain both signals (white) (Figure 8). Higher magnification images of this localization are shown in Figure 9. To determine if PIN2-GFP in endomembrane bodies colocalized with both of these markers in scd1-1 mutants we performed a quantitative colocalization analysis examining signal in multiple PIN2-GFP positive endomembranes. The weighted Manders coefficients (Manders et al., 1993) for the colocalization of PIN2-GFP were 0.94 and 0.91 with ARA7 and ARA6, respectively, and Pearson’s overlap coefficients (Dunn et al., 2011) were 0.82 and 0.83, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The presence of both RFP-ARA7 or ARA6-RFP and PIN2-GFP in a subset of these vesicles is consistent with other cargo proteins that move through a subset of the ARA7-positive endosomes interacting with distinct sets of RAB5 proteins (Dunn et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2018). FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab PIN2 overlays ARA7 and ARA6 in endomembrane bodies found in the root tips of scd1-1 mutants at 25°C. RFP-ARA7 or ARA6-RFP (magenta) were crossed into scd1-1 containing PIN2-GFP (green) roots and fluorescence visualized by confocal microscopy in 7 day old seedlings. Pixels with both green and magenta fluorescence are shown in white. When scd1-1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP and RFP-ARA7 were grown at 25°C, endomembrane bodies were observed that have only PIN2-GFP signal (green) or RFP-ARA7 (magenta) signal, while a subset contain both signals (white). The insets are higher magnifications of the areas delineated by the white boxes above. For each reporter line, more than 20 seedlings were examined. The scale bar is 10 μm.FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab PIN2 co-localizes with ARA7 and ARA6 in endomembrane bodies scd1-1 mutants at 25°C. Roots of scd1-1 containing ARA7-RFP or ARA6-RFP (magenta) and PIN2-GFP (green) roots were visualized by confocal microscopy in 7 day old seedlings. The overlay shows pixels with both green and magenta fluorescence as white. Using colocalization software, thresholds were generated to better illustrate pixels with both fluorescent signals from 4 roots of each line. Colocalization graphs are shown for endomembrane bodies that are circled.We found little or no overlap in the endomembrane localization of PIN2-GFP fluorescence in lines containing reporters localized in either the early endosome (VHA1-RFP) (Geldner et al., 2007) TGN (SYP61-CFP) (Robert et al., 2008), or the sorting endosome (SNX1-RFP) (Jaillais et al., 2006, 2007; Supplementary Figure S5). These results are consistent with PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 accumulating in late multivesicular endosomes and not in other compartments.Discussion Polar transport of the hormone auxin from cell to cell is controlled by the asymmetric localization of the PIN family of IAA efflux carriers (Grunewald and Friml, 2010; Zazimalova et al., 2010; Adamowski and Friml, 2015). These carrier proteins are directed to specific plasma membrane domains through dynamically regulated membrane trafficking and recycling pathways (Geldner, 2009; Grunewald and Friml, 2010; Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014). Internal and external environmental cues also affect the localization of the PIN proteins through regulation of the flow of PIN proteins between the endosome and plasma membrane (Paciorek et al., 2005; Jasik et al., 2013, 2016; Rakusova et al., 2015), as well as between the plasma membrane and the lytic vacuole (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008a). In this study we utilized a temperature-sensitive scd1-1 mutant to uncover the dynamics of auxin transport targeting and how these reversible changes in protein targeting control auxin transport and dependent process. SCD1 contains a DENN domain found in proteins with RAB-directed GEF activity and in proteins that interact with clathrin (Patino-Lopez et al., 2008; Sato et al., 2008; McMichael et al., 2013). SCD1 null mutants have revealed the function of this protein as a RAB-GEF that participates in both endocytosis and exocytosis (Mayers et al., 2017). The effects of the temperature-sensitive scd1-1 mutant on root development was examined at the permissive and restrictive temperatures of 18 and 25°C, respectively. We found that scd1-1 exhibits a suite of phenotypes only at restrictive temperature, which include impaired root elongation and gravity response, reduced lateral root formation, and inhibition of formation of asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression across a gravity-stimulated root. These phenotypes were also induced when plants were grown at the permissive temperature and then transitioned to the restrictive temperature and could be reversed when plants were transitioned from the restrictive temperature back to the permissive temperature. As all of these phenotypes are dependent on auxin transport, we also measured both shootward and rootward transport and found that both are impaired at the restrictive temperature. The ability to reversibly manipulate lateral root development in the scd1-1 mutant provided unique insight into how this process is regulated and revealed the critical time point when SCD1 and auxin transport are needed for lateral root development. A temperature-switch assay was performed resulting in the shift of seedlings from the permissive temperature to the non-permissive temperature or vice versa over 10 days. These data support the hypothesis that SCD1 is needed for lateral root development between days 2 and 6. Transition from the permissive to non-permissive temperature also reduces auxin transport in scd1-1 (but not Col(g)) showing reductions in the long distance rootward transport within 8 h after transition. A previous report suggested that there is specific regulation of auxin transport in this time window with a pulse of auxin moving from the shoot to the root at 3–5 days, which correlated with the emergence of the first lateral root (Bhalerao et al., 2002). Our ability to reversibly alter auxin transport by turning off or on SCD1 function support the model of an auxin pulse that drives root formation that occurs within a precise developmental window. The effects of the scd1-1 mutation on auxin transport and gravitropism were evident after both long and short-term exposure to the non-permissive temperature, with changes in auxin transport evident preceding gravitropic differences. When grown continuously at 25°C or within 8 h after transfer from the permissive 18°C temperature, scd1-1 seedlings showed reduced shootward 3H-IAA transport and accumulation of auxin-induced gene expression at the root tip, consistent with impaired auxin transport away from the site of application. Similarly, continuous growth at 25°C or a shift from 18 to 25°C for 8 h showed a significant decrease in the gravitropic curvature in scd1-1 compared to wild type. Auxin-induced gene expression, visualized via DR5-GFP fluorescence (Muday and Rahman, 2008; Geisler et al., 2014) was rapidly enhanced on the lower side of Col(g) roots after gravitropic reorientation, but was impaired in scd1-1 seedlings relative to wild type only in plants grown at 25°C. These data support the hypothesis that a functional SCD1 protein is needed to maintain polar and lateral auxin transport and the physiological processes dependent upon dynamic changes in appropriate auxin distribution. Consistent with this model, altered PIN2-GFP trafficking is even more rapidly perturbed in scd1-1 than auxin movements and gravity response. Because PIN2 is required for rootward transport and root gravitropism (Muller et al., 1998; Rashotte et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2002), we compared its localization in the scd1-1 mutant and wild type using a PIN2-GFP reporter. At 25°C, PIN2 is normally localized to the plasma membrane on the shootward end of cells of the lateral root cap and epidermis of the developing root of wild type seedlings (Muller et al., 1998). In the scd1-1 mutant, PIN2-GFP was not restricted to the plasma membrane but was also localized in endomembrane bodies. Mayers et al. (2017) showed that scd1-2 has altered PIN2-GFP trafficking during treatment with brefeldin A, a drug which blocks intracellular endosome and trans-Golgi transport. However, we find that in scd1-1 at the restrictive temperature, PIN2-GFP accumulates in the absence of BFA. The trafficking defect is not detectable in scd1-1 roots grown at 18°C, but when switched from 18 to 25°C, the PIN2 trafficking defect becomes apparent within minutes. Since changes in auxin transport and root growth and development are not observed for 8–12 h, this suggests that these responses are sequential and that PIN mislocalization is not a secondary result of compromised root development at 25°C. The linkage is most evident in terms of gravity response. PIN2 controls shootward auxin transport that is required for gravitropism (Muller et al., 1998; Rashotte et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2002). Upon transition of scd1-1 to the non-permissive temperature, PIN2-GFP endomembrane accumulation is evident with less than hour. In Col(g) a transition from 18 to 25°C increases shootward transport by more than fivefold within 5 h, leading to a more than twofold greater transport in Col(g) than in scd1-1. Treatment of roots for 12 h at the non-permissive temperature impaired gravity response in scd1-1 to levels consistent with constitutive growth at this non-permissive temperature. Together these results support the timeline where PIN2 targeting is impaired, reducing auxin transport and then dependent physiological processes. We also detected l PIN1-GFP within endomembrane bodies in scd1-1. However, other fluorescent fusions to the auxin transport proteins PIN3, ABCB19, and AUX1, were not observed in any endomembrane compartments. As all of these proteins are trafficked and recycled, and the scd1-1 mutation most strongly affects PIN1 and PIN2 and dependent physiological processes, there appears to be selectivity of SCD1 targets toward PIN2 and PIN1, which is consistent with other studies that reveal distinct regulatory and trafficking machinery between auxin transporters (Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014; Weller et al., 2017). Other reports have indicated that ABCB19 and AUX1 localization are regulated by different trafficking mechanisms than those that regulate PIN1 and PIN2 (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2006; Titapiwatanakun et al., 2008). The results are based on differences in the trafficking of these proteins in response to brefeldin A and FM4-64 uptake (Titapiwatanakun et al., 2008). We find that in scd1-1 at 25°C, PIN2-GFP accumulates in the late or multivesicular endosome. Impaired uptake of the endosomal marker dye FM4-64 has previously been observed in scd1-1, suggesting that SCD1 participates in endocytosis via clathrin coated vesicles (McMichael et al., 2013). To determine whether FM4-64 accumulates in the PIN2 endomembrane bodies observed here, the roots of scd1-1 containing PIN2-GFP grown at 18°C and transferred to 25°C were treated with FM4-64. Although initially there was little co-localization, within 20 min significant overlap was observed. These results are consistent with PIN2 being trapped in scd1 mutants in a late or multivesicular endosome or pre-vacuolar compartment on its way to or from the plasma membrane through the endosome. To confirm that the endomembranes in which PIN2-GFP accumulates in scd1-1 are late endosomes, we crossed multiple endosomal markers into this mutant and performed colocalization analyses. In scd1-1 at 25°C, but not 18°C, we observed PIN2-GFP colocalization with ARA7 and to a lesser extent with ARA6. ARA6 and ARA7 are RAB5 GTPases contained in late multivesicular endosomes, with related, but not identical trafficking activities (Ueda et al., 2004; Beck et al., 2012; Ebine et al., 2012; Paez Valencia et al., 2016). ARA7 function is required for vesicle transport between the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) and the vacuole (Lee et al., 2004; Haas et al., 2007; Jia et al., 2013) and ARA6 is associated with transport between the PVC and the plasma membrane, where it may regulate trafficking from the endosome to the plasma membrane (Ebine et al., 2011, 2012). PIN2 has also been localized to ARA7 vesicles in Arabidopsis roots after treatment with endosidin 16, which inhibits apical membrane trafficking (Li et al., 2017). The colocalization of PIN2 with both ARA7 and ARA6 Rab-related GTPases is not surprising considering that compartments bearing ARA7 and ARA6 have been previously shown to partially overlap, despite evidence that they are distinct endosomal compartments (Ueda et al., 2004; Beck et al., 2012; Ebine et al., 2012). The PVC, where both ARA6 and ARA7 are found, is a distinct organelle in plants that facilitates the transport of materials from the endosomes to the vacuole (Contento and Bassham, 2012). Using immunogold and confocal microscopy, plasma membrane proteins that pass through the PVC have been shown to be directed to the vacuole for degradation (Haas et al., 2007; Viotti et al., 2010). Thus, association of PIN2 with the PVC in scd1-1 suggests that PIN2 in the PVC is likely targeted to the vacuole for degradation. This could explain the reduced domain of PIN2-GFP staining seen in the mutants at the restrictive temperature, coincident with the changes in columella cells. However, there is also evidence that suggests that PIN2 can be retrieved from the PVC and recycled (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008b; Spitzer et al., 2009). Indeed, PIN1, PIN2, and AUX1 are targeted to the vacuole through the multi-vesicular body (MVB), and RabF2A co-localizes in the MVB with PIN1-GFP (Spitzer et al., 2009). The localization of PIN2-GFP in late endosomal compartments in scd1-1 is consistent with reports that PIN protein turnover involves both cycling between the endosome and plasma membrane and vacuolar degradation, depending on environmental conditions (Paciorek et al., 2005; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008b; Grunewald and Friml, 2010; Jasik et al., 2013). For example, when roots are reoriented relative to the gravity vector, enhanced endocytosis of PIN2 at the apical membrane followed by degradation through sorting to a proteolytic endosomal compartment resulted in asymmetric distribution of PIN2, redirected auxin flow, and root bending (Abas et al., 2006). The mis-localization and loss of membrane PIN2 in scd1-1 explains the observed reductions in auxin transport and the observed phenotypes. The efficient targeting of auxin transport proteins to the plasma membrane is required for appropriate auxin transport and dependent physiological processes. In this paper we have shown that the conditional scd1-1 mutant, with a defect in a gene that functions as a RAB-GEF (Mayers et al., 2017), has altered localization of PIN2, with accumulation of this protein in endomembrane bodies. The PIN2-GFP containing endomembrane bodies in scd1-1 showed dye accumulation and fluorescent protein reporter expression consistent with a late endosomal/prevacuolar character. Consistent with this altered protein localization, polar auxin transport and gravity response are impaired in scd1-1. The kinetics of the alterations in these responses upon transition to the non-permissive temperature demonstrate that altered trafficking of PIN2 is observed within minutes of transition to this temperature, while auxin transport and gravity defects are measured hours later, and root developmental defects can be quantified days after transition. These findings provide direct evidence that disruption of the targeting machinery which disrupts PIN2 protein localization precedes reductions in auxin transport and changes in auxin transport-dependent physiological processes.Materials and Methods Growth of Mutant and Transgenic Seedlings Seeds were sterilized (75% ethanol, 0.01% Triton X-100) for 2 min, followed by a 95% ethanol rinse. The culture medium was 0.8% (w/v) agar (MP Biomedical), 1X MS nutrients (macro and micro salts: MSP01-50LT, Caisson Labs, Inc.), vitamins (1 μg/mL–1 thiamine, 1 μg/mL–1 pyridoxine HCL, and 0.5 μg/mL–1 nicotinic acid), 1.5% sucrose (w/v), and 0.05% MES (w/v); pH adjusted to 6.0 with 1M KOH. The seeds were placed in the dark at 4°C for 48 h before being moved to the permissive (18°C) or the restrictive (25°C) temperatures. The seedlings were grown vertically under continuous light at an intensity of 100 μmol m–2s–1 for 5 or 7 days at the specified temperature. The Arabidopsis scd1-1 mutant (Falbel et al., 2003) was crossed with a number of fluorescent protein fusions all driven by their endogenous promoters: PIN2-GFP (Xu and Scheres, 2005), PIN1-GFP (Heisler et al., 2005), PIN3-GFP (Laskowski et al., 2008), MDR1(ABCB19)-GFP (Wu et al., 2007), AUX1-YFP (Swarup et al., 2008), and the auxin responsive promoter driven GFP reporter, DR5-GFP (Ottenschläger et al., 2003; Lewis et al., 2011). The F2 generation was screened for lines homozygous for mutant phenotype and for reporter GFP expression. scd1-1 containing PIN2-GFP was also crossed with reporters that localize to specific endomembrane compartments, with these organelle specific reporters listed in Supplementary Table S1.Characterization of scd1-1 Root Length and Lateral Root Development Seedlings of similar size were placed on fresh agar plates on the 5th day after growth at 18 or 25°C. Lateral roots initiation events corresponding to stages VI and VII of primordia (Malamy and Benfey, 1997) and emerged lateral roots (defined as any root that broke through the epidermis of the primary root) were quantified using a dissecting microscope. To examine lateral root formation in seedlings that were moved between temperature conditions, Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings were grown at 18 or 25°C continuously or transferred from 18 to 25°C at 2, 4, or 6 days. Parallel experiments were performed where seedlings were grown at 25°C continuously or transferred from 25 to 18°C at the indicated times. The number of lateral root initiation events and the number of emerged lateral roots were quantified by DIC microscopy using the Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope with a Plan Apochromatic 40x objective and the reported data is from 20 seedlings.IAA Transport Assays Pulse-chase rootward (acropetal) IAA transport assays were performed using a previously published method (Lewis and Muday, 2009) in Col(g) seedlings at 9 and 6 days at 18 and 25° C, respectively. scd1-1 seedlings were assayed at 10 days for both 18°C and 25°C to more closely match the length of scd1-1 and Col(g). An agar droplet (1.25% agar w/v) containing 1 μM tritiated IAA was placed at the root shoot junction and incubated at 18 or 25°C for 10 min. The seedlings were transferred to a new agar plate and exposed to a “chase” droplet of unlabeled 1 μM IAA. After 50 min, 2 mm sections were excised beginning at the base of the droplet toward the root tip. Three to six segments were recovered from all plants, and each segment was counted separately, and IAA levels quantitated using a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. The average and SE of 19–25 seedlings is reported in all transport assays. Shootward IAA transport was measured by applying 500 nM tritiated IAA (3H-IAA) to root tips (Lewis and Muday, 2009) of 5 day seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C. For temperature switch experiments, seedlings were transferred to the appropriate temperature 4, 8, and 24 h before assay. Agar droplets containing 500 nM 3H-IAA were applied to the root tips, and seedlings were placed into the indicated temperatures under yellow filters to prevent auxin degradation (Stasinopoulos and Hangarter, 1990). After 2 h, the droplets were removed from the root tip. A 5 mm segment was excised 2 mm from the site of 3H-IAA application, and radioactivity was measured. Shootward IAA transport was also measured indirectly using the artificial DR5 promoter driving expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Ottenschläger et al., 2003). Droplets containing 1 μM unlabeled IAA in 1.25% agar were applied to the root tips of 5-day old seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C for the designated times. GFP fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss 710 LSCM (Jena, Germany) using the argon laser with excitation at 488 nm. Images of root tips were captured using 80% laser power with 40x magnification, a pinhole of 2.64 airy units (AU), 560 gain and an emission spectrum of 493-656 nm. Images were exported to Adobe Photoshop, and the distance of GFP fluorescence in the epidermal layers was measured using the line tool.Gravitropic Response Assays Five-day old Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C were placed in diffuse light at 20–22 μmol m–2 s–1 and re-oriented 90°. Images were captured for low temporal resolution analysis at time 0 and at 2 h intervals until 8 h after re-orientation, with a final image 24 h after re-orientation. Images were captured using an Epson Perfection 3200 Photo Perfection flatbed scanner (Nagano, Japan) with 16-bit grayscale and 800 dpi resolution. Images were exported to ImageJ to measure degree of curvature. The gravitropic root response was also observed using high temporal resolution imaging using an AVT Marlin camera (Stadtroda, Germany). Root curvature after gravity stimulation was measured by a MATLAB based custom image analysis software (Lewis et al., 2007) and is the average and standard error of 12 seedlings of each genotype.Asymmetric Auxin Induced Gene Expression After Gravitropic Reorientation Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings crossed with the proDR5-GFP construct were imaged after roots were reoriented 90° relative to the gravity vector. Seedlings were placed on agar plates on the 5th day after growth at 18 or 25°C. After 1 h, seedlings were placed in diffuse light at 20–22 μmol m–2s–1 and reoriented 90°. Images were captured at time 0 and at 2 h intervals until 8 h after re-orientation. Seedlings were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to visualize root structure and mounted in dH20 on slides. The root tips were visualized with the 40x objective of a Zeiss 710 LSCM using the argon laser at an excitation wavelength of 488nm and a pinhole of 1.0 AU. GFP emission was collected between 492 and 547 nm, while PI was collected at 567–735. All images were collected at identical gain and laser power and exported to Adobe Photoshop for analysis. Representative images of more than 5 roots at each time point and from each genotype were shown.Localization of Auxin Transport Protein-Fluorescent Protein Fusions Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings containing PIN2-GFP, PIN1-GFP, PIN3-GFP, ABCB19-GFP, and AUX1-YFP (protein fusions driven by endogenous promoters) were grown for 7 days at a constant 18 or 25°C. Seedlings were mounted in dH2O and maintained at the indicated temperatures using a Julabo F25 temperature stage (Seelbach, Germany). Images were captured using a 63x water objective with or without a 1.5x optical zoom on a Zeiss 710 LSCM, using the argon laser for excitation at 488 nm with a pinhole of 1.0AU. PIN2-GFP, PIN1-GFP, PIN3-GFP, and MDR1-GFP were imaged with an emission spectrum of 500–525 nm, while AUX1-YFP was imaged with an emission spectrum of 519–621 nm. For temperature shift experiments, wild-type and scd1-1 were grown at 18°C for 7 days. Seedlings were transferred to microscope slides and then placed on the temperature-controlled stage at 25°C. Samples were imaged as described above at various times after transfer. For each reporter construct more than 5 roots were analyzed at each treatment, with representative images shown.PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 Analysis Seedlings grown at 25°C were incubated in 5 μM FM4-64 to visualize endosomes (Bolte et al., 2004) for either 5 or 20 min, as indicated. The roots were rinsed in dH2O and imaged at various times after staining. The GFP and FM4-64 signals were visualized using a multi-track setting, as described above. No FM4-64 fluorescence was detected in the GFP channel. The FM4-64 signal was imaged using 80% laser power, a pinhole of 1.0 AU, 510 gain, and an emission spectrum of 632–759 nm. No GFP signal was detected in the FM4-64 channel. Individual images for each fluorophore and an overlay are shown with magenta for FM4-64, green for PIN2-GFP, and white for any pixels with both FM4-64 and PIN2. The red signal in these images was converted to magenta in Photoshop, changing the hue saturation. To better identify spatial colocalization independent of intensity, a thresholding function was applied to individual channels in Photoshop or in the Zeiss Zen colocalization module. We then prepared a thresholded overlay in which pixels are indicated as magenta for FM4-64, green for PIN2-GFP, and white for any pixels with both FM4-64 and GFP. To examine the change in colocalization of PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 over time, the number of PIN2-GFP, FM4-64, or both, signals in each cell with a PIN2-GFP labeled endomembrane compartment was quantified, and the percentage was determined for 740 cells from 20 roots. In the temperature shift experiments, scd1-1 seedlings grown at 18°C for 7 days were transferred to 5 mM FM4-64 for 5 min, rinsed briefly, and then imaged at intervals of 2 min on a temperature-controlled stage at 25°C.Colocalization of PIN2 and Endosomal Markers Col(g) and scd1-1 seedlings containing PIN2-GFP were crossed with fluorescently labeled endomembrane marker lines. These constructs and their localization patterns are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The seedlings were grown for 7 days at 25°C. Seedling roots were visualized using the Zeiss 710 laser scanning confocal microscope. GFP and RFP signals were resolved in dual channel mode with excitation at 488 and 594 nm, and emission wavelengths of 493–582 and 599–754 nm, respectively. For all samples, we verified the absence of RFP signal in the GFP channel and vice versa, using single-labeled samples. For colocalization analysis, samples were examined using Zeiss Zen software. The threshold for RFP or GFP was determined within each image, using regions that had only signal from one fluorophore. We selected regions of interest (ROI) of consistent size, focusing on individual endomembrane compartments (French et al., 2008) from at least 4 roots each of Ara6 and Ara7 reporters, measuring 21 and 17 endomembranes, respectively. Colocalization was quantified using both Pearson’s coefficients (weighted colocalization coefficients) and Manders’ overlap coefficients (Manders et al., 1993; Dunn et al., 2011). Lines containing both PIN2-GFP and other RFP reporters were examined in dual channel mode as described above. PIN2-GFP SYP61-CFP transgenics were imaged using spectral imaging and linear unmixing at an excitation wavelength of 458 nm and a 464–648 nm filter.Data Availability Statement All datasets generated for this study are included in the article/Supplementary Material.Author Contributions CG and JI designed and completed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.

    "introduction": "Introduction As of November 21st, 2021, over 257 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported, and more than 5 million lives claimed globally [1]. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 provide a major step forward in reducing COVID-19’s impact. However, the pandemic is ongoing, and the continued viral transmission allows for accumulation of mutations in the viral genome, which can provide advantages in replication, immune escape, increased transmissibility, or diagnostic detection failure [2]. With the quickly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and the slow rate of vaccination globally, it is critical to fully understand this novel virus and disease. Coronaviruses are named as such because the S proteins resemble a halo or corona on scanning electron microscope imagery [3]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus. Of the human Betacoronavirus, including OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4]. SARS-CoV-2 bears the highest genetic sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1 [5]. Accordingly, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, resembles SARS, caused by SARS-CoV-1, in many ways, but with some important differences [6]. Key characteristics of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 include: 1) a positive-sense RNA virus with a large genome of ~30 kilobases; 2) a large, enveloped virus containing a helical nucleocapsid with the virus’s genetic code, with an exterior studded in several spike proteins that facilitate the infection of host cells), and 3) similar genomic structures. The first 2/3 of both genomes encodes for two macro polypeptides pp1a/pp1b (see Fig. 1). Pp1a/pp1b are auto-proteolytically processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins (NSP). Fig. 1. SARS-CoV-2 structure. Open in a new tab Structural elements of the virus, including the spike protein, envelope, membrane, and internal components such as the viral single-stranded RNA and nucleocapsid proteins (above). SARS-CoV-2 genome components (below). The main virus-specific functions of the SARS-CoV-2 NSPs are: NSP1 - cellular mRNA degradation, global translation inhibition; NSP2 - cell cycle progression disruption; NSP3 - formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs; SARS-CoV-2 protease); NSP4 - formation of DMVs; NSP5 - main SARS-CoV-2 protease; NSP6 - formation of DMVs, NSP7 - replication complex; NSP8 – primase; NSP9 - RNA binding protein; NSP10 - cofactor of NSP14 & NSP16; NSP11 - unknown, NSP12 - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; NSP13 - RNA helicase, 5ʹ phosphatase, NSP14 - N7-MTase, 3ʹ-5ʹ exonuclease; NSP15 – endonuclease; and NSP16–2ʹ-O-MTase, mRNA capping. The remaining 1/3 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for the structural proteins S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid), and several open reading frames (ORFs; (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and 10) [7]. The S protein binds the host cell receptor, which for SARS-CoV-1/2 is the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) (see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). These proteins share homology and function with SARS-CoV-1. Fig. 2. SARS-CoV-2 binding, intracellular internalization, and intracellular processes. Open in a new tab Structural interactions between the virus and target cell, including the viral spike protein, ACE2-receptor, TMPRSS2 reaction to cleave and begin the viral intracellular internalization (above, A), and consequent signal transduction pathways stimulated by the virus as it hijacks pathways to turn the infected cell into a SARS-CoV-2 producing factory (below, B). There are two notable differences between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. First is the presence of the ORF8 polypeptide found in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV-1. SARS-CoV-1 has a 29 nucleotide (nt) deletion (del) which splits it into ORF8a and ORF8b. Second, SARS-CoV-2 contains a gene encoding a novel orphan protein, ORF10, which is not present in SARS-CoV-1 [7]. SARS-CoV-2’s evolutionary rate has been estimated to be around 9’×’10−4 substitutions per site per year [8], while also having a high transmissibility, large portion of asymptomatic cases [9], large pool of susceptible hosts to replicate in [10, 11], and on-going environmental pressures (e.g., low vaccination rates and changes in policies allowing human carriers to continue to transmit the virus), which have allowed SARS-CoV-2 to accumulate mutation in its genome. Mutations have been detected in all parts of the viral genome, including in the leader 5ʹ untranslated region (UTR), orf1ab (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP6, NSP12, NSP13, and NSP14), spike, ORF3a, ORF8, nucleocapsid, and ORF10 [8]. These genomic changes have been shown to influence viral immune evasion, inflammasome interaction, helicase, exonuclease proofreading mechanism, the activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and thereby viral replication, infectivity, and cell release [12]. Mutations associated with the spike are of particular interest, as they influence human-to-human transmission, as well as human-to-animal passage. Within the spike, mutations tend to fall into four general classes, those that affect the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which are of importance because some may provide both immune escape or a fitness advantage, as well as facilitate reverse zoonotic events. There are some mutations that occur in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which is the portion most exposed on the virus surface. There is evidence for immune selection in this region, and preliminary evidence that at least one of these changes (delH69/delV70) could improve fitness [13]. Mutations in or near the furin cleavage site, and several groupings close to the D614G mutation, possibly affect infection efficiency and can also be important for neutralizing antibodies. This large SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity has been categorized by different nomenclature systems, describing variants of varied public health interest or concern. Pango lineages B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) have been classified as “variants of concern” (VOC) because they present mutations that have been shown to impact diagnostics, treatments, or vaccines, conferring increased transmissibility and increased disease severity. The impact of these mutations highlights the need for further research not only on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 intracellular processes, but also how the extracellular environment may lead to further spread of the virus and subsequent public health burden. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can exert physiological effects by directly infecting cells and via intercellular signaling by the infected cells. In this review, we provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection and intracellular host responses (targets, pathways, networks, biological processes, and functional adaptations) to viral invasion. We emphasize a canonical set of reactions induced by SARS-CoV-2, which we have organized for the reader’s consideration. However, there is tremendous variation in cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2, depending on factors including the cell type, organ type, metabolic and physiological context, patient genetics, individual clinical characteristics (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities), and stage/severity in the COVID-19 disease. This is the first of a three-part comprehensive series of linked reviews on SARS-CoV-2 covering: intracellular effects (present study); extracellular consequences (review 2); and current and potential therapeutics (review 3). This review and the two that will follow aim to provide a foundational understanding of the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2, from basic biology to clinical outcome and therapy avenues, that highlight future areas of research and could help inform public health interventions across the world. Infected tissue and cell types SARS-CoV-2 targets the nasal cavity and lungs; however, the detailed cellular tropism remains unclear, and likely varies among individuals. Furthermore, there is increased variability of viral cellular tropism with the emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants, which include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Eta, Iota, Kappa, 1.617.3, Mu, Zeta, and in particular, Delta and Omicron, as well as the various lineages of each variant [14]. This is related with SARS-CoV-2’s mutation ability affecting its antigenic phenotype to circumvent immunity. The spike protein mediates attachment of the virus to host cell-surface receptors and fusion between virus and cell membranes; it is also the principal target for neutralizing antibodies generated following infection, and is the component for both mRNA and adenovirus-based vaccines [15]. Several studies have contributed to the current understanding of how mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affect neutralization and emergence of new strains, which include studies of traditional escape mutation, targeted characterization of particular mutations, and wider investigations of large numbers of circulating variants [16]. These are active areas of research, in particular given the continued emergence of new lineages of new variants. A study of human, bat, non-human primate, and mouse cell lines showed various cell types were susceptible to the virus. These included pulmonary, intestinal, hepatic, renal, and neuronal, with cell lines expressing the hACE-2 receptor (hACE-2) having a generally greater viral load [17]. Although cell lines do not reflect physiological conditions, this research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can infect many cell types, and that hACE-2 provides a critical entry mechanism [18]. Epithelial, vascular endothelial, pancreas, and mucosal cell types can all be infected by the virus [19–21]. Several investigations have employed 3D organoid cultures to simulate more physiological conditions than cell cultures [22]. In one such study, lung and colonic organoid models showed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reduced when various SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors were applied [22]. Another study illustrated the flexibility of different organoid models, such as pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids, cardiomyocytes, and dopaminergic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells, and adult primary cells (human islets, hepatocyte, and cholangiocytes) to test viral effects such as cytokine production, gene expression, and other physiological responses. The resultant data correlated well with some patient autopsy samples [22] indicating organoids provide a valuable disease modeling tool [18]. In one study of post-mortem patients, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence revealed viral antigen (spike protein) in pneumocytes and hyperplastic cells around the bronchioles, mucosal epithelia, submucosal glands, gland ducts of the trachea, glands of the small intestine, distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, islets of Langerhans, glands and intra-islet ducts of the pancreas, and vascular tissues of the brain and heart [23]. Few viral antigens were present in the large intestine and renal proximal tubules, and none in the liver. A follow-up colocalization analysis showed ACE2 and viral antigen in the lung, trachea, small intestine, kidney, pancreas, and heart. In the brain, ACE2-expressing cells were detected, but they were negative for the viral antigen [23]. Endothelial cells of multiple organs were infected, supporting the clinical observations of endotheliitis in some COVID-19 patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrated ACE2 receptor expression was primarily restricted to lung pneumocytes, gut absorptive enterocytes, and nasal mucosa goblet secretory cells [24]. In general, the distribution of ACE2 receptors may in part explain the systemic diversity and range of SARS-CoV-2’s effects. Further research into infection of these cell types versus others in mucosal barrier organs will be important to determine cell-types that serve as initial entry ways for the virus into the body. Human autopsy studies [21] have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple organs including lungs, pharynx, liver, nasal mucosa, trachea, intestines, skin, pancreas, kidney, brain, and heart. A study of 27 patients showed multi-organ tropisms (lung, pharynx, heart, liver, brain, and kidneys), with the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 copies per cell, as detected by in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence, in the respiratory tract, and lower levels in the kidneys, liver, heart, and brain [21]. Transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs, patient autopsy, and body-wide tissues (e.g. heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes), provided further evidence of the physiologically systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 [24]. These studies suggest that the virus has a varying range of expression within each organ, which may be influenced by levels of the ACE2-receptor and related entry factors (Transmembrane protease, serine-2 [TMPRSS2], transferrin receptor protein 1 [TRFC1], cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4], and neuropilin-1 [NRP1]) within each organ-type [24]. This further highlights the varied organ and tissues that are capable of being infected by the virus, and the resultant wide-range of patient symptoms. The physiological status of the individual significantly affects COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [25, 26]. Notably, patients with pre-existing conditions of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes have a less favorable disease outcome, likely in part due to the elevated levels of inflammation and metabolic disturbances associated with those conditions [25]. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 infection may exacerbate pre-existing conditions, leading to more severe COVID-19 outcome [27]. SARS-CoV-2 Receptors – Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) The cellular surface receptor ACE2, a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS). It is speculated to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 viral target for entry. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to infect multiple organs in part due to the widespread distribution, expression, and polymorphisms of ACE2 [28, 29]. ACE2’s molecular function in the human RAAS pathway is to cleave Angiotensin I to produce Angiotensin 1–9, and break down Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1–7. RAAS moderates blood pressure and osmolarity by means of hormonal feedback control. In response to binding of ACE2 to the ACE2 receptor (ACE2R), blood vessels vasoconstrict. This process is mediated by G-protein-signaling, activating phospholipase C and increasing cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. ACE2 also plays an important role in inactivating Des-Arg9-Bradykinin (DABK), a bradykinin involved in inflammation. This inactivation promotes C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIPS2), keratinocytes-derived chemokine (KC), and tumor necrosis factor-〈 (TNF-α) activity, drawing leukocytes into the affected tissues [30]. Decreased ACE2 receptor expression can have detrimental effects. Computational models of COVID-19 suggest the role of a bradykinin storm in the pathophysiology of the disease. In this model, the Kallikrein-Kinin and Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Systems are integrated, with cross-talk mediated by the degradation of bradykinin by ACE and prolylcarboxypeptidase [31]. This behavior makes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein behave akin to an ACE-inhibiting drug [32]. Thus, disruption of ACE2 expression from SARS-CoV-2 binding can lead to altered tissue function and exacerbate disease. The ~600-kDa trimeric S proteins can bind to ACE2 through the RBD required for membrane fusion (see Fig. 2). The binding initiates viral internalization, with the cleavage of S1/S2 inducing a conformational change from prefusion into post-fusion. S1 consists of the NTD, the RBD, and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2). S2 contains the hydrophobic fusion peptide and is responsible for the viral and cell membrane fusion [33]. SARS-CoV-2 S-protein shows varying states of conformational shifts of the RBD site progressing towards proteolytic processing, making the viral RBD more accessible to ACE2, with the cleavage at the S1/S2 leading towards RBD open confirmation and viral internalization [33, 34]. The S- and RBD-viral sites are notable for affecting transmission and disease severity, and variants have been shown to accumulate mutations at these sites leading to increased S- and RBD affinity with ACE2 [35]. Understanding the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 surface interactions will help elucidate how the virus can invade multiple organ systems and cell types. Calcium Ion (Ca2+) Signaling The calcium ion (Ca2+) is essential for many aspects of cellular physiology and viral replication. Experimental data on the relation between Ca2+ signaling and SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication is sparse. However, studies of other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV) have reported that these viruses utilize Ca2+ for host fusion [36]. The fusion protein (FP) of MERS-CoV binds to one Ca2+ ion, while the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein has two FP domains, FP1 and FP2, and binds to two Ca2+ ions for host cell entry [37]. SARS-CoV-2 appears to affect cellular function by altering the host Ca2+ homeostasis in ways that promote viral infection and reproduction (see Fig. 3). One mechanism is through disruption of calcium channels and pumps (e.g., voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), receptor-operated calcium channels, store-operated calcium channels, transient receptor-potential ion channels, and Ca2+-ATPase) [28, 37]. This leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, resulting in virus-induced cell lysis [28, 37]. The interaction between the virus and VGCCs may also promote virus-host cell fusion for entry [28]. Fig. 3. SARS-CoV-2 effects on Ca2+ signaling. Open in a new tab Structural elements of the virus, including the spike protein, envelope, membrane, and internal components such as the viral single-stranded RNA and nucleocapsid proteins (above).Viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming proteins that alter membrane permeability to ions including Ca2+ by forming membrane channels, are a characteristic of a diversity of virus. SARS-CoV-1/2 each encode viroporins. SARS-CoV-1 encodes for three viroporin proteins ORF3a, E and ORF8b, which alter ion homeostasis within the cell, and have important roles in pathogenesis and promoting viral fitness. SARS-CoV-2 encodes two of these viroporin proteins, E and ORF3a; however, the ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly divergent from SARS-CoV-1 ORF8b and lacks the viroporin sequence of SARS-CoV-1 ORF8b. The E and ORF3a proteins of coronaviruses impact Ca2+ homeostasis in the host, by acting as calcium ion channels, enhancing the virion’s entry and replication potential [38]. The SARS-CoV-2-E protein is a 76 amino acid (aa) integral membrane protein with one transmembrane domain (TMD) that allows the E protein to form protein-lipid channels in membranes that promote permeability to Ca2+ ions. The SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a protein is 274 aa in length, harbors three helical TMD, and is a Na+ or Ca2+ ion channel protein. The alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis by SARS-COV-1-E and SARS-COV-2-E proteins promotes SARS-CoV-1/2 fitness and elicits the production of chemokines and cytokines, contributing to pathogenesis. Ion channel activity modulation by the SARS-CoV-1-ORF3a protein also modulates viral release [39]. Therefore, when SARS-CoV-2 infects the human body, the resultant dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis may contribute to morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 patients have been noted to have low serum calcium levels overall [40]. We speculate that Ca2+ dysregulation could lead to increased cellular oxidative stress and shifts in metabolic activity. Low Ca2+ may also be coupled with viral infection and internalization through the ACE2R, which synergizes with Ca2+ signaling pathways. Understanding these reverberations will increase our insight into the basic biology of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the various organ systems. Intracellular signaling Viral infection and hijacking of cell-surface receptors begin to trigger activation of multiple intracellular pathways in addition to Ca2+ signaling. As infection proceeds, SARS-CoV-2 manipulates, or totally reprograms, the normal metabolism and signaling of the host cell, optimizing the molecular environment to enable the viral replication cycle. This involves interfering with signaling pathways that regulate processes of DNA repair and replication, immune response, transcription, metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis [39]. SARS-CoV-2 infection alters phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), Type I and III interferon, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), Toll-like receptors (TLR), and nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer (NF-κB) pathways. These pathways are dysregulated in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize host antiviral responses and are vital for viral replication, entry, propagation, and/or apoptosis/viral release. For instance, severe COVID-19 is characterized by an inflammatory profile dominated by NF-κB activity [41]. The SARS-CoV-2-encoded NSP13 and Open Reading Frame 9c (ORF9c) proteins can interact directly with elements of the transducin-like enhancer (TLE) family of proteins and thus regulate the NF-κB inflammatory response [42]. While broad activation of NF-κB is induced by a variety SARS-CoV-2-encoded products, Open Reading Frame 7a (ORF7a) specifically is a potent stimulator of NF-κB associated proinflammatory chemo- and cytokines, which are elevated in the presence of severe COVID-19. NF-κB plays a similar role in other coronavirus infections. Host antiviral immunity requires an optimal and coordinated response to control viral infections; this immunity is mediated by several host sensors, notably pattern recognition receptors (PRR). PRRs identify damage- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 infects the cell via the endosomal compartment, and may activate TLRs, such as TLR4, resulting in increased NF-κB activity and expression [42, 43]. The MyD88-mediated TRIF activation of TLR downstream pathways triggers the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7), resulting in the expression of innate immunity proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], interleukin-6 [IL- 6], TNF-α) and interferons (IFNs). Continuous activation of TLR can increase MyD88 and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which then can further activate NF-κB [43]. RNA viruses are detected by several sensors, such as TLRs 3, 7 and 8. TLR3 recognizes double stranded RNA, while TLR7 and TLR8 single stranded RNA. In addition to ssRNA and dsRNA, viral proteins can act as PAMPS and potentiate inflammatory signaling through the stimulation of surface TLRs. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV-2, TLR2 is a critical mediator of envelope protein detection and driver of pathogenesis through inflammatory process augmentation [44]. Some individuals with severe COVID-19 have mutations in genes associated with type I and III IFN pathways [45]. Ten percent of individuals that progress to severe COVID-19 pneumonia display elevated amounts of neutralizing antibodies against type I IFN-α2 and IFN-ω [46]; these antibodies are not present in healthy or asymptomatic individuals. Of note, albeit TLR3 activation is critical for viral clearance, TLR3 hyperactivation can lead to a cytokine storm and the subsequent severe COVID-19. Other receptors are also involved in SARS-CoV-2 recognition, such as the proteins of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5). Once inside the cell, double strand viral RNA can be recognized by RIG-I/MDA5, thus initiating an antiviral response through mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS). MAVS activated the downstream pathways, IκB kinase α/β (IKK) and TBK1/IKKε, leading to translocation of NF-κB and/or IRF3 into the nucleus and induction of genes involved with innate antiviral immunity and the subsequent induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Inhibition of IFNs and ISGs is a tactic used by several viruses to evade host antiviral responses [47], and SARS-CoV-2-mediated IFNs and ISGs dysregulation appears to be an important strategy used by this virus to replicate and disrupt immune homeostasis. Furthermore, therapies with type I and III IFNs alone or combined with other drugs suppressed SARS-CoV-2, ameliorating COVID-19 disease [48]. The cytokine TGF-β triggers the Janus kinases (JAKs) / signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins (JAK/STAT) pathway in certain contexts, while suppressing it in others [49]. It has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins, particularly NSP1 and ORF6, may dysregulate STAT1 and STAT3, leading to a positive feedback loop where coagulopathy triggers TLR4 via PAI-1 binding, circularly activating STAT; for this reason, therapeutic targeting of the Janus kinase pathway has been proposed [50]. The innate immune response is a first step to protecting against pathogens, which stimulate the interferon signaling pathway and expression of IFN-I, leading to an antiviral cellular response [51]. Coronaviruses have developed mechanisms to hinder IFN-expression and reduce the production of IFN. This suppression has been shown to correlate with disease severity and mortality [52]. This holds true for SARS-CoV-2, with recent studies showing that viral proteins ORF6, ORF8, and nucleocapsid being potent inhibitors of the IFN-I signaling pathway [53]. Metabolic adaptations Viruses rely on host cell machinery to propagate, promoting anabolism for generation of macromolecules needed for virion replication and assembly (see Fig. 2). Consequently, viral proteins (see Supplementary Table 1) affect intracellular pathways, leading to subsequent adaptations by the cellular metabolism where the mitochondria plays a central role. We reported recently through study of COVID-19 patient samples (i.e., nasopharyngeal swab samples, various organs from autopsy COVID-19 samples, murine lung tissues, and various organs from hamsters being infected with SARS-CoV-2) that heavy suppression occurs of mitochondrial functions in various organs [54]. Specifically, in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus blocks the transcription of discrete groups of mitochondrial genes from major bioenergetic organs, while upregulation occurs in others as a compensatory mechanism to rescue the damage occurring in the major bioenergetic organs. This demonstrated a dynamic evolution of mitochondrial gene expression and cellular energetics as the virus progresses from one organ to the next. Transcriptomic changes in the nasopharyngeal infected samples revealed that during initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, nDNA coded mitochondrial genes are blocked and the co-inhibited genes were found to group together as components of preassembly modules of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, II, III, IV and V. At the time of death for COVID-19 patients, we showed virtually all mitochondrial function were inhibited in the heart, suggesting cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in longer term COVID-19 pathology. In addition, mTOR signaling and the integrated stress response were highly dysregulated throughout all organs. Lastly, mitochondrial inhibition was shown to activate HIF-1α and its target genes shifting cellular metabolism away from catabolism and towards viral synthesis. Our results indicate that manipulation of mitochondrial function may be an important approach for mitigating the severity of COIVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human monocytes [55] and human pulmonary alveolar epithelial (HPAEpiC) cells [56] induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production, increased HIF-1α protein levels and upregulated expression of HIF-1α target genes [57]. The stability of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) during a SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 replication [55–57]. The expression of ORF3a in human embryonic kidney 293 T-antigen cells (HEK293T) cells increased the stability of HIF-1α and induced mROS production, which is an activator of HIF-1α. Together these results suggest that ORF3a induces mROS production to activate HIF-1α, which in turn triggers a shift in cellular metabolism to favor glycolysis, resulting in increased viral replication and transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Following host cell infection, the SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription complex synthesizes ~30 kb viral genomes as well as the subgenomic RNAs required to encode for viral structural and mechanistic proteins. Between 1–5 h post-infection, the percentage of coronavirus-encoded protein per total cellular protein translation may increase by as much as 20,000 times, with the fraction of viral to cellular RNA ultimately reaching as high as 90% intracellularly [58]. To accommodate this huge shift towards viral replication, there is certainly a requirement of a shift in cellular metabolism to accommodate for viral synthesis. An investigation of SARS-CoV-2 metabolism during the initial 48-hours post viral infection showed that amino acid availability and synthesis are altered, de novo purine synthesis intermediates are accumulated, intracellular glucose and folate are depleted, and lactate levels are elevated [59]. This suggests a viral strategy of upregulating purine metabolism at the post-translational level to coincide with the shutting off of the majority of host proteins at translation levels. Virus-infected cells also commonly exhibit the Warburg effect - increased glycolytic metabolism in the presence of inadequate oxygen for oxidative phosphorylation - to supply reducing equivalents and precursors for macromolecule biosynthesis, and to support generation of ATP needed for also increasing nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis. Metabolic shifts include dysregulated Ca2+ signaling and increased mitochondrial generation of ROS. How SARS-CoV-2 induces host cell nucleotide metabolism remains unanswered. Mitochondrial metabolism and function are highly impacted in multiple ways. With the shift towards glycolysis, there is a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation affecting the mitochondria and its function. SARS-CoV-2 may interact with the mitochondria to destabilize its oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Coronavirus replication requires the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These DMVs serve as a site for viral replication and help conceal the virus from host cellular defenses. Interestingly, mitochondrial stress is known to induce mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) that communicate with the ER. It is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 disruption of mitochondrial function results in the induction of (double-membrane) MDVs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA present in the mitochondria induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Increased DMVs can provide opportunity for viruses to hide and replicate [60]. SARS-CoV-2 and all subgenomic RNAs are enriched in the host mitochondria, and viral genome’s 5ʹ - and 3ʹ -UTRs contain distinct mitochondrial localization signals [61], indicating that the viral RNA may hijack the mitochondria, an interesting hypothesis for experimental validation [61]. Other recent studies have mapped physical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins with mitochondrial localized proteins. These interactions include: NSP8 interaction with mitochondrial ribosomal protein s2 (MRPS2), mitochondrial ribosomal protein s5 (MRPS5), mitochondrial ribosomal protein s25 (MRPS25), and mitochondrial ribosomal protein s27 (MRPS27) ribosomal proteins; ORF9c interaction with mitochondrial NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 1 (NDUFAF1) and NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 9 (NDUFB9); ORF10 interaction with TIMM8; and NSP7 interaction with mitochondrial NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 2 (NDUFAF2). NDUFAF1, NDUFAF2, NDUFB9, and NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 10 (NDUFA10) are all key players in the assembly of complex I, and NDUFA10 is suggested as being one of the master regulators of the SARS-CoV-2 pathology [7]. Interactions were also observed between viral M protein and ATPase Na+/K+ Transporting Subunit Beta 1 (ATP1B1), ATPase H + Transporting V1 Subunit A (ATP6V1A), acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (ACADM), Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), Peptidase, Mitochondrial Processing Subunit Beta (PMPCB), Pitrilysin Metallopeptidase 1 (PITRM1), Coenzyme Q8B (COQ8B), and Peptidase, Mitochondrial Processing Subunit Alpha (PMPCA); these proteins are each components of critical mitochondrial metabolic pathways. SARS-CoV-2-encoded ORF9b protein interacts and localizes with Translocase Of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 70 (TOMM70) [7], a mitochondrial import receptor important for transporting proteins into mitochondria and, more importantly, in modulating anti-viral cellular defense pathways [62]. These mitochondrial interactions offer glimpses of the viral effect on glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways and the potential side effects. Another example of COVID-19’s mitochondrial-related impacts is the over-production of cellular ROS [63]. ROS and reactive nitrogen species have diverse functions in biological systems; oxidatively attacking pathogens, regulating cell proliferation, and key signaling functions [64]. However, dysregulation of ROS is implicated in many diseases, including the hyper-inflammatory late phase of COVID-19 [65]. As a part of normal redox metabolism, superoxide radicals are converted into hydrogen peroxide by the action of superoxide dismutase. The hydrogen peroxide is subsequently broken down into water by glutathione peroxidase. During COVID-19, isoforms of enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, may be directly targeted and proteolyzed by the SARS-CoV-2 protease, Mpro. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to suppress the ROS-associated Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage. Dysregulation of the Nrf2 pathway will exacerbate the pro-oxidative stress caused by the virus [66]. SARS-CoV-2 may suppress the accumulation of the selenoprotein transcripts, which are crucial for the correct functioning of Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) and mitochondria function [67]. This redox impairment would lead to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide, which could trigger inflammation by promoting the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), NF-κB, and the nuclear NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome [68]. Due to the multiple effects of SARS-CoV-2 that alter cellular metabolic and oxidative states, there are multiple directions to deplete NAD+, loss of cellular ATP and reduced Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) activity, each of which have cytotoxic effects of their own [69]. In general, NADPH, synthesized from NAD+, is necessary for many key redox reactions; a reduced level of NADPH could play a mechanistic role in cellular metabolic changes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 mediated reduction in ATP and nitric oxide signaling induces cell stress Cellular metabolism adapts to the alterations induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cell (see Fig. 4). These adaptations depend on the cell and tissue type. Here, we focus on ATP signaling, which is relevant to epithelial cells, and nitric oxide (NO) signaling, which tends to be perturbed in endothelial cells [70]. Activation of each pathway at low levels provides protection to the host. Fig. 4. SARS-CoV-2 viral internalization & cellular hijacking. Open in a new tab Metabolic pathways and shifts that lead to cellular dysregulation and viral activation to lead towards viral replication (above).ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and other pathways is critical to support cellular physiology, but this molecule also has signaling properties, which can be particularly beneficial in epithelial cells [70]. Perturbations in ATP generation induced by the virus in epithelial cells [71] can lead to ATP release from the apical or basolateral spaces, and subsequent extracellular ATP signaling [72]. It can stimulate P2 receptors on neighboring epithelial cells to activate signal transduction pathways and alter cellular function in adjacent cells even if they are not infected, thus priming naive host cells for confrontation with the virus [71, 72]. In the endothelium, nitric oxide directly affects mitochondrial metabolism through interaction with cytochrome C, providing cytoprotection against free radicals. However, reduction of NO bioavailability, due to the increased oxidative stress state caused by SARS-CoV-2-elevated superoxides, results in the formation of peroxynitrites (ONOO-). The reduced NO diffusion to neighboring vascular smooth muscle may impair vascular function [73]. Peroxynitrite also causes injury to the mitochondria and reduces ATP synthesis, with all of the concomitant negative effects. Therefore, loss of NO bioavailability has major cellular consequences, inducing shifts in multiple enzymatic pathways, cell injury, and death. Like ATP, NO acts as a biological signaling molecule. This dissolved gas rapidly diffuses across cell membranes and regulates various functions across the body [73]. The vascular endothelium is the predominant cellular source of NO production, and it plays a critical role in maintaining cardiovascular function. Factors that reduce endothelial NO production (increased oxidative stress, changes in NO synthase synthesis) negatively affect endothelial function [73]. The cascade of inflammation and oxidative stress triggered by COVID-19 leads to the formation of superoxide free radicals, impairing biological processes and increasing cytotoxicity in the host cells [74]. The instantaneous reaction of superoxide and NO yields ONOO-, a powerful, cytotoxic nitrating agent. This reaction effectively destroys the NO, rendering it unavailable for its normal regulatory purposes. Thus, the downregulation of NO bioavailability is thought to be a central factor in the severity of COVID-19-associated endotheliitis and the onset of endothelial dysfunction [75].",

Here, we describe the virus and review state-of-the-art information about the processes it utilizes to enter and reprogram the human host machinery. We detail research on early infection using evidence from patient samples, organoids and cells, and non-human animal studies. Each of these has limitations but taken together provide unique observational and mechanistic insight on SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 is a pleiotropic condition. Viral insults and subsequent cellular metabolic adaptations differ in the context of cell-type, genotype and environmental influences. Thus, much of what we have presented applies to specific cell types and contexts, and we have attempted to cover these contexts. Key avenues of future research on SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation include: 1) defining the mechanisms of how the virus enters cells, and the protein and receptor molecules that are critical to this process; 2) elucidating the dynamics of how protein machinery is captured and retrofitted for viral purposes in a cell-specific manner; 3) understanding how the host genetics and environment can affect the ability of the virus to infect; 4) understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation; and 5) revealing how the mitochondria adapts to ultimately shift its physiology from steady-state. In the best-case scenario for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, infection leads to a cascade of intracellular adaptations in which multiple networks are remodeled, from transcription to metabolism to signal transduction, shifting the invaded host cell from its original physiology into a SARS-CoV-2 replication system, and causing the emission of new viral particles and signaling molecules. The subsequent disease events will reverberate across the body’s cells and organs. This will be the subject of our Part 2 review (in preparation).",

Copyright notice ID: 9108708 PMID: 35577935 Abstract COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has claimed approximately 5 million lives and 257 million cases reported globally. This virus and disease have significantly affected people worldwide, whether directly and/or indirectly, with a virulent pathogen that continues to evolve as we race to learn how to prevent, control, or cure COVID-19. The focus of this review is on the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ mechanism of infection and its proclivity at adapting and restructuring the intracellular environment to support viral replication. We highlight current knowledge and how scientific communities with expertize in viral, cellular, and clinical biology have contributed to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, and how these findings may help explain the widely varied clinical observations of COVID-19 patients. Subject terms: Viral infection, InfectionIntroduction As of November 21st, 2021, over 257 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported, and more than 5 million lives claimed globally [1]. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 provide a major step forward in reducing COVID-19’s impact. However, the pandemic is ongoing, and the continued viral transmission allows for accumulation of mutations in the viral genome, which can provide advantages in replication, immune escape, increased transmissibility, or diagnostic detection failure [2]. With the quickly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and the slow rate of vaccination globally, it is critical to fully understand this novel virus and disease. Coronaviruses are named as such because the S proteins resemble a halo or corona on scanning electron microscope imagery [3]. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus. Of the human Betacoronavirus, including OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [4]. SARS-CoV-2 bears the highest genetic sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1 [5]. Accordingly, COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, resembles SARS, caused by SARS-CoV-1, in many ways, but with some important differences [6]. Key characteristics of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 include: 1) a positive-sense RNA virus with a large genome of ~30 kilobases; 2) a large, enveloped virus containing a helical nucleocapsid with the virus’s genetic code, with an exterior studded in several spike proteins that facilitate the infection of host cells), and 3) similar genomic structures. The first 2/3 of both genomes encodes for two macro polypeptides pp1a/pp1b (see Fig. 1). Pp1a/pp1b are auto-proteolytically processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins (NSP). Fig. 1. SARS-CoV-2 structure. Open in a new tab Structural elements of the virus, including the spike protein, envelope, membrane, and internal components such as the viral single-stranded RNA and nucleocapsid proteins (above). SARS-CoV-2 genome components (below).The main virus-specific functions of the SARS-CoV-2 NSPs are: NSP1 - cellular mRNA degradation, global translation inhibition; NSP2 - cell cycle progression disruption; NSP3 - formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs; SARS-CoV-2 protease); NSP4 - formation of DMVs; NSP5 - main SARS-CoV-2 protease; NSP6 - formation of DMVs, NSP7 - replication complex; NSP8 – primase; NSP9 - RNA binding protein; NSP10 - cofactor of NSP14 & NSP16; NSP11 - unknown, NSP12 - RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; NSP13 - RNA helicase, 5ʹ phosphatase, NSP14 - N7-MTase, 3ʹ-5ʹ exonuclease; NSP15 – endonuclease; and NSP16–2ʹ-O-MTase, mRNA capping. The remaining 1/3 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for the structural proteins S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid), and several open reading frames (ORFs; (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and 10) [7]. The S protein binds the host cell receptor, which for SARS-CoV-1/2 is the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) (see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). These proteins share homology and function with SARS-CoV-1. Fig. 2. SARS-CoV-2 binding, intracellular internalization, and intracellular processes. Open in a new tab Structural interactions between the virus and target cell, including the viral spike protein, ACE2-receptor, TMPRSS2 reaction to cleave and begin the viral intracellular internalization (above, A), and consequent signal transduction pathways stimulated by the virus as it hijacks pathways to turn the infected cell into a SARS-CoV-2 producing factory (below, B).There are two notable differences between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. First is the presence of the ORF8 polypeptide found in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV-1. SARS-CoV-1 has a 29 nucleotide (nt) deletion (del) which splits it into ORF8a and ORF8b. Second, SARS-CoV-2 contains a gene encoding a novel orphan protein, ORF10, which is not present in SARS-CoV-1 [7]. SARS-CoV-2’s evolutionary rate has been estimated to be around 9’×’10−4 substitutions per site per year [8], while also having a high transmissibility, large portion of asymptomatic cases [9], large pool of susceptible hosts to replicate in [10, 11], and on-going environmental pressures (e.g., low vaccination rates and changes in policies allowing human carriers to continue to transmit the virus), which have allowed SARS-CoV-2 to accumulate mutation in its genome. Mutations have been detected in all parts of the viral genome, including in the leader 5ʹ untranslated region (UTR), orf1ab (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP6, NSP12, NSP13, and NSP14), spike, ORF3a, ORF8, nucleocapsid, and ORF10 [8]. These genomic changes have been shown to influence viral immune evasion, inflammasome interaction, helicase, exonuclease proofreading mechanism, the activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and thereby viral replication, infectivity, and cell release [12]. Mutations associated with the spike are of particular interest, as they influence human-to-human transmission, as well as human-to-animal passage. Within the spike, mutations tend to fall into four general classes, those that affect the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which are of importance because some may provide both immune escape or a fitness advantage, as well as facilitate reverse zoonotic events. There are some mutations that occur in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which is the portion most exposed on the virus surface. There is evidence for immune selection in this region, and preliminary evidence that at least one of these changes (delH69/delV70) could improve fitness [13]. Mutations in or near the furin cleavage site, and several groupings close to the D614G mutation, possibly affect infection efficiency and can also be important for neutralizing antibodies. This large SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity has been categorized by different nomenclature systems, describing variants of varied public health interest or concern. Pango lineages B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) have been classified as “variants of concern” (VOC) because they present mutations that have been shown to impact diagnostics, treatments, or vaccines, conferring increased transmissibility and increased disease severity. The impact of these mutations highlights the need for further research not only on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 intracellular processes, but also how the extracellular environment may lead to further spread of the virus and subsequent public health burden. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can exert physiological effects by directly infecting cells and via intercellular signaling by the infected cells. In this review, we provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection and intracellular host responses (targets, pathways, networks, biological processes, and functional adaptations) to viral invasion. We emphasize a canonical set of reactions induced by SARS-CoV-2, which we have organized for the reader’s consideration. However, there is tremendous variation in cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2, depending on factors including the cell type, organ type, metabolic and physiological context, patient genetics, individual clinical characteristics (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities), and stage/severity in the COVID-19 disease. This is the first of a three-part comprehensive series of linked reviews on SARS-CoV-2 covering: intracellular effects (present study); extracellular consequences (review 2); and current and potential therapeutics (review 3). This review and the two that will follow aim to provide a foundational understanding of the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2, from basic biology to clinical outcome and therapy avenues, that highlight future areas of research and could help inform public health interventions across the world. Infected tissue and cell types SARS-CoV-2 targets the nasal cavity and lungs; however, the detailed cellular tropism remains unclear, and likely varies among individuals. Furthermore, there is increased variability of viral cellular tropism with the emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants, which include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Eta, Iota, Kappa, 1.617.3, Mu, Zeta, and in particular, Delta and Omicron, as well as the various lineages of each variant [14]. This is related with SARS-CoV-2’s mutation ability affecting its antigenic phenotype to circumvent immunity. The spike protein mediates attachment of the virus to host cell-surface receptors and fusion between virus and cell membranes; it is also the principal target for neutralizing antibodies generated following infection, and is the component for both mRNA and adenovirus-based vaccines [15]. Several studies have contributed to the current understanding of how mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affect neutralization and emergence of new strains, which include studies of traditional escape mutation, targeted characterization of particular mutations, and wider investigations of large numbers of circulating variants [16]. These are active areas of research, in particular given the continued emergence of new lineages of new variants. A study of human, bat, non-human primate, and mouse cell lines showed various cell types were susceptible to the virus. These included pulmonary, intestinal, hepatic, renal, and neuronal, with cell lines expressing the hACE-2 receptor (hACE-2) having a generally greater viral load [17]. Although cell lines do not reflect physiological conditions, this research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can infect many cell types, and that hACE-2 provides a critical entry mechanism [18]. Epithelial, vascular endothelial, pancreas, and mucosal cell types can all be infected by the virus [19–21]. Several investigations have employed 3D organoid cultures to simulate more physiological conditions than cell cultures [22]. In one such study, lung and colonic organoid models showed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reduced when various SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors were applied [22]. Another study illustrated the flexibility of different organoid models, such as pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids, cardiomyocytes, and dopaminergic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells, and adult primary cells (human islets, hepatocyte, and cholangiocytes) to test viral effects such as cytokine production, gene expression, and other physiological responses. The resultant data correlated well with some patient autopsy samples [22] indicating organoids provide a valuable disease modeling tool [18]. In one study of post-mortem patients, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence revealed viral antigen (spike protein) in pneumocytes and hyperplastic cells around the bronchioles, mucosal epithelia, submucosal glands, gland ducts of the trachea, glands of the small intestine, distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, islets of Langerhans, glands and intra-islet ducts of the pancreas, and vascular tissues of the brain and heart [23]. Few viral antigens were present in the large intestine and renal proximal tubules, and none in the liver. A follow-up colocalization analysis showed ACE2 and viral antigen in the lung, trachea, small intestine, kidney, pancreas, and heart. In the brain, ACE2-expressing cells were detected, but they were negative for the viral antigen [23]. Endothelial cells of multiple organs were infected, supporting the clinical observations of endotheliitis in some COVID-19 patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrated ACE2 receptor expression was primarily restricted to lung pneumocytes, gut absorptive enterocytes, and nasal mucosa goblet secretory cells [24]. In general, the distribution of ACE2 receptors may in part explain the systemic diversity and range of SARS-CoV-2’s effects. Further research into infection of these cell types versus others in mucosal barrier organs will be important to determine cell-types that serve as initial entry ways for the virus into the body. Human autopsy studies [21] have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects multiple organs including lungs, pharynx, liver, nasal mucosa, trachea, intestines, skin, pancreas, kidney, brain, and heart. A study of 27 patients showed multi-organ tropisms (lung, pharynx, heart, liver, brain, and kidneys), with the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 copies per cell, as detected by in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence, in the respiratory tract, and lower levels in the kidneys, liver, heart, and brain [21]. Transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs, patient autopsy, and body-wide tissues (e.g. heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes), provided further evidence of the physiologically systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 [24]. These studies suggest that the virus has a varying range of expression within each organ, which may be influenced by levels of the ACE2-receptor and related entry factors (Transmembrane protease, serine-2 [TMPRSS2], transferrin receptor protein 1 [TRFC1], cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4], and neuropilin-1 [NRP1]) within each organ-type [24]. This further highlights the varied organ and tissues that are capable of being infected by the virus, and the resultant wide-range of patient symptoms. The physiological status of the individual significantly affects COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [25, 26]. Notably, patients with pre-existing conditions of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes have a less favorable disease outcome, likely in part due to the elevated levels of inflammation and metabolic disturbances associated with those conditions [25]. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 infection may exacerbate pre-existing conditions, leading to more severe COVID-19 outcome [27].SARS-CoV-2 Receptors – Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) The cellular surface receptor ACE2, a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS). It is speculated to be the primary SARS-CoV-2 viral target for entry. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to infect multiple organs in part due to the widespread distribution, expression, and polymorphisms of ACE2 [28, 29]. ACE2’s molecular function in the human RAAS pathway is to cleave Angiotensin I to produce Angiotensin 1–9, and break down Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1–7. RAAS moderates blood pressure and osmolarity by means of hormonal feedback control. In response to binding of ACE2 to the ACE2 receptor (ACE2R), blood vessels vasoconstrict. This process is mediated by G-protein-signaling, activating phospholipase C and increasing cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. ACE2 also plays an important role in inactivating Des-Arg9-Bradykinin (DABK), a bradykinin involved in inflammation. This inactivation promotes C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIPS2), keratinocytes-derived chemokine (KC), and tumor necrosis factor-〈 (TNF-α) activity, drawing leukocytes into the affected tissues [30]. Decreased ACE2 receptor expression can have detrimental effects. Computational models of COVID-19 suggest the role of a bradykinin storm in the pathophysiology of the disease. In this model, the Kallikrein-Kinin and Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Systems are integrated, with cross-talk mediated by the degradation of bradykinin by ACE and prolylcarboxypeptidase [31]. This behavior makes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein behave akin to an ACE-inhibiting drug [32]. Thus, disruption of ACE2 expression from SARS-CoV-2 binding can lead to altered tissue function and exacerbate disease. The ~600-kDa trimeric S proteins can bind to ACE2 through the RBD required for membrane fusion (see Fig. 2). The binding initiates viral internalization, with the cleavage of S1/S2 inducing a conformational change from prefusion into post-fusion. S1 consists of the NTD, the RBD, and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2). S2 contains the hydrophobic fusion peptide and is responsible for the viral and cell membrane fusion [33]. SARS-CoV-2 S-protein shows varying states of conformational shifts of the RBD site progressing towards proteolytic processing, making the viral RBD more accessible to ACE2, with the cleavage at the S1/S2 leading towards RBD open confirmation and viral internalization [33, 34]. The S- and RBD-viral sites are notable for affecting transmission and disease severity, and variants have been shown to accumulate mutations at these sites leading to increased S- and RBD affinity with ACE2 [35]. Understanding the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 surface interactions will help elucidate how the virus can invade multiple organ systems and cell types.Calcium Ion (Ca2+) Signaling The calcium ion (Ca2+) is essential for many aspects of cellular physiology and viral replication. Experimental data on the relation between Ca2+ signaling and SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication is sparse. However, studies of other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV) have reported that these viruses utilize Ca2+ for host fusion [36]. The fusion protein (FP) of MERS-CoV binds to one Ca2+ ion, while the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein has two FP domains, FP1 and FP2, and binds to two Ca2+ ions for host cell entry [37]. SARS-CoV-2 appears to affect cellular function by altering the host Ca2+ homeostasis in ways that promote viral infection and reproduction (see Fig. 3). One mechanism is through disruption of calcium channels and pumps (e.g., voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), receptor-operated calcium channels, store-operated calcium channels, transient receptor-potential ion channels, and Ca2+-ATPase) [28, 37]. This leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, resulting in virus-induced cell lysis [28, 37]. The interaction between the virus and VGCCs may also promote virus-host cell fusion for entry [28]. Fig. 3. SARS-CoV-2 effects on Ca2+ signaling. Open in a new tab Structural elements of the virus, including the spike protein, envelope, membrane, and internal components such as the viral single-stranded RNA and nucleocapsid proteins (above).Viroporins, transmembrane pore-forming proteins that alter membrane permeability to ions including Ca2+ by forming membrane channels, are a characteristic of a diversity of virus. SARS-CoV-1/2 each encode viroporins. SARS-CoV-1 encodes for three viroporin proteins ORF3a, E and ORF8b, which alter ion homeostasis within the cell, and have important roles in pathogenesis and promoting viral fitness. SARS-CoV-2 encodes two of these viroporin proteins, E and ORF3a; however, the ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly divergent from SARS-CoV-1 ORF8b and lacks the viroporin sequence of SARS-CoV-1 ORF8b. The E and ORF3a proteins of coronaviruses impact Ca2+ homeostasis in the host, by acting as calcium ion channels, enhancing the virion’s entry and replication potential [38]. The SARS-CoV-2-E protein is a 76 amino acid (aa) integral membrane protein with one transmembrane domain (TMD) that allows the E protein to form protein-lipid channels in membranes that promote permeability to Ca2+ ions. The SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a protein is 274 aa in length, harbors three helical TMD, and is a Na+ or Ca2+ ion channel protein. The alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis by SARS-COV-1-E and SARS-COV-2-E proteins promotes SARS-CoV-1/2 fitness and elicits the production of chemokines and cytokines, contributing to pathogenesis. Ion channel activity modulation by the SARS-CoV-1-ORF3a protein also modulates viral release [39]. Therefore, when SARS-CoV-2 infects the human body, the resultant dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis may contribute to morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 patients have been noted to have low serum calcium levels overall [40]. We speculate that Ca2+ dysregulation could lead to increased cellular oxidative stress and shifts in metabolic activity. Low Ca2+ may also be coupled with viral infection and internalization through the ACE2R, which synergizes with Ca2+ signaling pathways. Understanding these reverberations will increase our insight into the basic biology of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the various organ systems.Intracellular signaling Viral infection and hijacking of cell-surface receptors begin to trigger activation of multiple intracellular pathways in addition to Ca2+ signaling. As infection proceeds, SARS-CoV-2 manipulates, or totally reprograms, the normal metabolism and signaling of the host cell, optimizing the molecular environment to enable the viral replication cycle. This involves interfering with signaling pathways that regulate processes of DNA repair and replication, immune response, transcription, metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis [39]. SARS-CoV-2 infection alters phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), Type I and III interferon, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), Toll-like receptors (TLR), and nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer (NF-κB) pathways. These pathways are dysregulated in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize host antiviral responses and are vital for viral replication, entry, propagation, and/or apoptosis/viral release. For instance, severe COVID-19 is characterized by an inflammatory profile dominated by NF-κB activity [41]. The SARS-CoV-2-encoded NSP13 and Open Reading Frame 9c (ORF9c) proteins can interact directly with elements of the transducin-like enhancer (TLE) family of proteins and thus regulate the NF-κB inflammatory response [42]. While broad activation of NF-κB is induced by a variety SARS-CoV-2-encoded products, Open Reading Frame 7a (ORF7a) specifically is a potent stimulator of NF-κB associated proinflammatory chemo- and cytokines, which are elevated in the presence of severe COVID-19. NF-κB plays a similar role in other coronavirus infections. Host antiviral immunity requires an optimal and coordinated response to control viral infections; this immunity is mediated by several host sensors, notably pattern recognition receptors (PRR). PRRs identify damage- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 infects the cell via the endosomal compartment, and may activate TLRs, such as TLR4, resulting in increased NF-κB activity and expression [42, 43]. The MyD88-mediated TRIF activation of TLR downstream pathways triggers the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7), resulting in the expression of innate immunity proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], interleukin-6 [IL- 6], TNF-α) and interferons (IFNs). Continuous activation of TLR can increase MyD88 and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which then can further activate NF-κB [43]. RNA viruses are detected by several sensors, such as TLRs 3, 7 and 8. TLR3 recognizes double stranded RNA, while TLR7 and TLR8 single stranded RNA. In addition to ssRNA and dsRNA, viral proteins can act as PAMPS and potentiate inflammatory signaling through the stimulation of surface TLRs. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV-2, TLR2 is a critical mediator of envelope protein detection and driver of pathogenesis through inflammatory process augmentation [44]. Some individuals with severe COVID-19 have mutations in genes associated with type I and III IFN pathways [45]. Ten percent of individuals that progress to severe COVID-19 pneumonia display elevated amounts of neutralizing antibodies against type I IFN-α2 and IFN-ω [46]; these antibodies are not present in healthy or asymptomatic individuals. Of note, albeit TLR3 activation is critical for viral clearance, TLR3 hyperactivation can lead to a cytokine storm and the subsequent severe COVID-19. Other receptors are also involved in SARS-CoV-2 recognition, such as the proteins of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5). Once inside the cell, double strand viral RNA can be recognized by RIG-I/MDA5, thus initiating an antiviral response through mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS). MAVS activated the downstream pathways, IκB kinase α/β (IKK) and TBK1/IKKε, leading to translocation of NF-κB and/or IRF3 into the nucleus and induction of genes involved with innate antiviral immunity and the subsequent induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Inhibition of IFNs and ISGs is a tactic used by several viruses to evade host antiviral responses [47], and SARS-CoV-2-mediated IFNs and ISGs dysregulation appears to be an important strategy used by this virus to replicate and disrupt immune homeostasis. Furthermore, therapies with type I and III IFNs alone or combined with other drugs suppressed SARS-CoV-2, ameliorating COVID-19 disease [48]. The cytokine TGF-β triggers the Janus kinases (JAKs) / signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins (JAK/STAT) pathway in certain contexts, while suppressing it in others [49]. It has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins, particularly NSP1 and ORF6, may dysregulate STAT1 and STAT3, leading to a positive feedback loop where coagulopathy triggers TLR4 via PAI-1 binding, circularly activating STAT; for this reason, therapeutic targeting of the Janus kinase pathway has been proposed [50]. The innate immune response is a first step to protecting against pathogens, which stimulate the interferon signaling pathway and expression of IFN-I, leading to an antiviral cellular response [51]. Coronaviruses have developed mechanisms to hinder IFN-expression and reduce the production of IFN. This suppression has been shown to correlate with disease severity and mortality [52]. This holds true for SARS-CoV-2, with recent studies showing that viral proteins ORF6, ORF8, and nucleocapsid being potent inhibitors of the IFN-I signaling pathway [53].Metabolic adaptations Viruses rely on host cell machinery to propagate, promoting anabolism for generation of macromolecules needed for virion replication and assembly (see Fig. 2). Consequently, viral proteins (see Supplementary Table 1) affect intracellular pathways, leading to subsequent adaptations by the cellular metabolism where the mitochondria plays a central role. We reported recently through study of COVID-19 patient samples (i.e., nasopharyngeal swab samples, various organs from autopsy COVID-19 samples, murine lung tissues, and various organs from hamsters being infected with SARS-CoV-2) that heavy suppression occurs of mitochondrial functions in various organs [54]. Specifically, in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus blocks the transcription of discrete groups of mitochondrial genes from major bioenergetic organs, while upregulation occurs in others as a compensatory mechanism to rescue the damage occurring in the major bioenergetic organs. This demonstrated a dynamic evolution of mitochondrial gene expression and cellular energetics as the virus progresses from one organ to the next. Transcriptomic changes in the nasopharyngeal infected samples revealed that during initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, nDNA coded mitochondrial genes are blocked and the co-inhibited genes were found to group together as components of preassembly modules of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, II, III, IV and V. At the time of death for COVID-19 patients, we showed virtually all mitochondrial function were inhibited in the heart, suggesting cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in longer term COVID-19 pathology. In addition, mTOR signaling and the integrated stress response were highly dysregulated throughout all organs. Lastly, mitochondrial inhibition was shown to activate HIF-1α and its target genes shifting cellular metabolism away from catabolism and towards viral synthesis. Our results indicate that manipulation of mitochondrial function may be an important approach for mitigating the severity of COIVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection of human monocytes [55] and human pulmonary alveolar epithelial (HPAEpiC) cells [56] induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production, increased HIF-1α protein levels and upregulated expression of HIF-1α target genes [57]. The stability of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) during a SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 replication [55–57]. The expression of ORF3a in human embryonic kidney 293 T-antigen cells (HEK293T) cells increased the stability of HIF-1α and induced mROS production, which is an activator of HIF-1α. Together these results suggest that ORF3a induces mROS production to activate HIF-1α, which in turn triggers a shift in cellular metabolism to favor glycolysis, resulting in increased viral replication and transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Following host cell infection, the SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription complex synthesizes ~30 kb viral genomes as well as the subgenomic RNAs required to encode for viral structural and mechanistic proteins. Between 1–5 h post-infection, the percentage of coronavirus-encoded protein per total cellular protein translation may increase by as much as 20,000 times, with the fraction of viral to cellular RNA ultimately reaching as high as 90% intracellularly [58]. To accommodate this huge shift towards viral replication, there is certainly a requirement of a shift in cellular metabolism to accommodate for viral synthesis. An investigation of SARS-CoV-2 metabolism during the initial 48-hours post viral infection showed that amino acid availability and synthesis are altered, de novo purine synthesis intermediates are accumulated, intracellular glucose and folate are depleted, and lactate levels are elevated [59]. This suggests a viral strategy of upregulating purine metabolism at the post-translational level to coincide with the shutting off of the majority of host proteins at translation levels. Virus-infected cells also commonly exhibit the Warburg effect - increased glycolytic metabolism in the presence of inadequate oxygen for oxidative phosphorylation - to supply reducing equivalents and precursors for macromolecule biosynthesis, and to support generation of ATP needed for also increasing nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis. Metabolic shifts include dysregulated Ca2+ signaling and increased mitochondrial generation of ROS. How SARS-CoV-2 induces host cell nucleotide metabolism remains unanswered. Mitochondrial metabolism and function are highly impacted in multiple ways. With the shift towards glycolysis, there is a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation affecting the mitochondria and its function. SARS-CoV-2 may interact with the mitochondria to destabilize its oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Coronavirus replication requires the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These DMVs serve as a site for viral replication and help conceal the virus from host cellular defenses. Interestingly, mitochondrial stress is known to induce mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) that communicate with the ER. It is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 disruption of mitochondrial function results in the induction of (double-membrane) MDVs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA present in the mitochondria induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Increased DMVs can provide opportunity for viruses to hide and replicate [60]. SARS-CoV-2 and all subgenomic RNAs are enriched in the host mitochondria, and viral genome’s 5ʹ - and 3ʹ -UTRs contain distinct mitochondrial localization signals [61], indicating that the viral RNA may hijack the mitochondria, an interesting hypothesis for experimental validation [61]. Other recent studies have mapped physical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins with mitochondrial localized proteins. These interactions include: NSP8 interaction with mitochondrial ribosomal protein s2 (MRPS2), mitochondrial ribosomal protein s5 (MRPS5), mitochondrial ribosomal protein s25 (MRPS25), and mitochondrial ribosomal protein s27 (MRPS27) ribosomal proteins; ORF9c interaction with mitochondrial NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 1 (NDUFAF1) and NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 9 (NDUFB9); ORF10 interaction with TIMM8; and NSP7 interaction with mitochondrial NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 2 (NDUFAF2). NDUFAF1, NDUFAF2, NDUFB9, and NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 10 (NDUFA10) are all key players in the assembly of complex I, and NDUFA10 is suggested as being one of the master regulators of the SARS-CoV-2 pathology [7]. Interactions were also observed between viral M protein and ATPase Na+/K+ Transporting Subunit Beta 1 (ATP1B1), ATPase H + Transporting V1 Subunit A (ATP6V1A), acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (ACADM), Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), Peptidase, Mitochondrial Processing Subunit Beta (PMPCB), Pitrilysin Metallopeptidase 1 (PITRM1), Coenzyme Q8B (COQ8B), and Peptidase, Mitochondrial Processing Subunit Alpha (PMPCA); these proteins are each components of critical mitochondrial metabolic pathways. SARS-CoV-2-encoded ORF9b protein interacts and localizes with Translocase Of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 70 (TOMM70) [7], a mitochondrial import receptor important for transporting proteins into mitochondria and, more importantly, in modulating anti-viral cellular defense pathways [62]. These mitochondrial interactions offer glimpses of the viral effect on glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways and the potential side effects. Another example of COVID-19’s mitochondrial-related impacts is the over-production of cellular ROS [63]. ROS and reactive nitrogen species have diverse functions in biological systems; oxidatively attacking pathogens, regulating cell proliferation, and key signaling functions [64]. However, dysregulation of ROS is implicated in many diseases, including the hyper-inflammatory late phase of COVID-19 [65]. As a part of normal redox metabolism, superoxide radicals are converted into hydrogen peroxide by the action of superoxide dismutase. The hydrogen peroxide is subsequently broken down into water by glutathione peroxidase. During COVID-19, isoforms of enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, may be directly targeted and proteolyzed by the SARS-CoV-2 protease, Mpro. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to suppress the ROS-associated Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage. Dysregulation of the Nrf2 pathway will exacerbate the pro-oxidative stress caused by the virus [66]. SARS-CoV-2 may suppress the accumulation of the selenoprotein transcripts, which are crucial for the correct functioning of Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) and mitochondria function [67]. This redox impairment would lead to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide, which could trigger inflammation by promoting the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), NF-κB, and the nuclear NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome [68]. Due to the multiple effects of SARS-CoV-2 that alter cellular metabolic and oxidative states, there are multiple directions to deplete NAD+, loss of cellular ATP and reduced Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) activity, each of which have cytotoxic effects of their own [69]. In general, NADPH, synthesized from NAD+, is necessary for many key redox reactions; a reduced level of NADPH could play a mechanistic role in cellular metabolic changes from SARS-CoV-2 infection.SARS-CoV-2 mediated reduction in ATP and nitric oxide signaling induces cell stress Cellular metabolism adapts to the alterations induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cell (see Fig. 4). These adaptations depend on the cell and tissue type. Here, we focus on ATP signaling, which is relevant to epithelial cells, and nitric oxide (NO) signaling, which tends to be perturbed in endothelial cells [70]. Activation of each pathway at low levels provides protection to the host. Fig. 4. SARS-CoV-2 viral internalization & cellular hijacking. Open in a new tab Metabolic pathways and shifts that lead to cellular dysregulation and viral activation to lead towards viral replication (above).ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and other pathways is critical to support cellular physiology, but this molecule also has signaling properties, which can be particularly beneficial in epithelial cells [70]. Perturbations in ATP generation induced by the virus in epithelial cells [71] can lead to ATP release from the apical or basolateral spaces, and subsequent extracellular ATP signaling [72]. It can stimulate P2 receptors on neighboring epithelial cells to activate signal transduction pathways and alter cellular function in adjacent cells even if they are not infected, thus priming naive host cells for confrontation with the virus [71, 72]. In the endothelium, nitric oxide directly affects mitochondrial metabolism through interaction with cytochrome C, providing cytoprotection against free radicals. However, reduction of NO bioavailability, due to the increased oxidative stress state caused by SARS-CoV-2-elevated superoxides, results in the formation of peroxynitrites (ONOO-). The reduced NO diffusion to neighboring vascular smooth muscle may impair vascular function [73]. Peroxynitrite also causes injury to the mitochondria and reduces ATP synthesis, with all of the concomitant negative effects. Therefore, loss of NO bioavailability has major cellular consequences, inducing shifts in multiple enzymatic pathways, cell injury, and death. Like ATP, NO acts as a biological signaling molecule. This dissolved gas rapidly diffuses across cell membranes and regulates various functions across the body [73]. The vascular endothelium is the predominant cellular source of NO production, and it plays a critical role in maintaining cardiovascular function. Factors that reduce endothelial NO production (increased oxidative stress, changes in NO synthase synthesis) negatively affect endothelial function [73]. The cascade of inflammation and oxidative stress triggered by COVID-19 leads to the formation of superoxide free radicals, impairing biological processes and increasing cytotoxicity in the host cells [74]. The instantaneous reaction of superoxide and NO yields ONOO-, a powerful, cytotoxic nitrating agent. This reaction effectively destroys the NO, rendering it unavailable for its normal regulatory purposes. Thus, the downregulation of NO bioavailability is thought to be a central factor in the severity of COVID-19-associated endotheliitis and the onset of endothelial dysfunction [75].Conclusion The causative agent of the COVID-19 the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, has caused loss of incomes, economic crises, morbidities, and loss of life worldwide. Here, we describe the virus and review state-of-the-art information about the processes it utilizes to enter and reprogram the human host machinery. We detail research on early infection using evidence from patient samples, organoids and cells, and non-human animal studies. Each of these has limitations but taken together provide unique observational and mechanistic insight on SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 is a pleiotropic condition. Viral insults and subsequent cellular metabolic adaptations differ in the context of cell-type, genotype and environmental influences. Thus, much of what we have presented applies to specific cell types and contexts, and we have attempted to cover these contexts. Key avenues of future research on SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation include: 1) defining the mechanisms of how the virus enters cells, and the protein and receptor molecules that are critical to this process; 2) elucidating the dynamics of how protein machinery is captured and retrofitted for viral purposes in a cell-specific manner; 3) understanding how the host genetics and environment can affect the ability of the virus to infect; 4) understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation; and 5) revealing how the mitochondria adapts to ultimately shift its physiology from steady-state. In the best-case scenario for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, infection leads to a cascade of intracellular adaptations in which multiple networks are remodeled, from transcription to metabolism to signal transduction, shifting the invaded host cell from its original physiology into a SARS-CoV-2 replication system, and causing the emission of new viral particles and signaling molecules. The subsequent disease events will reverberate across the body’s cells and organs. This will be the subject of our Part 2 review (in preparation).Supplementary information Supplemental Table 1 (100.4KB, pdf) Acknowledgements The opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not reflect the view of the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Health and Human Services, or the United States government.Author contributions Conceptualization: DAJ; Writing – Original Draft: DAJ, SN; Writing – Review and Editing: AB, ESW, KKS, JWG, MJT, VZ, PMMV, DAJ, SN, NST.

    "title": "Changes in nuclear shape and gene expression in response to simulated microgravity are LINC complex-dependent.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555797/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Microgravity is known to affect the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell and nuclear morphology and to elicit differential expression of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions and the extracellular matrix. Although the nucleus is mechanically connected to the cytoskeleton through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the role of this group of proteins in these responses to microgravity has yet to be defined. In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of exposure to simulated microgravity. These LINC-dependent genes likely represent elements normally regulated by the mechanical forces imposed by gravity on Earth. Keywords: LINC complex, simulated microgravity, nuclear morphology",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction The nucleus is the largest organelle of the cell and homeostatic control of its shape and position are known to be crucial for cellular functions such as cell migration, cell division and the regulation of gene expression [1,2,3,4,5]. Forces generated by the cytoskeleton and external mechanical stimuli are directly transmitted to the nuclear surface through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex [3,6,7,8,9,10,11]—a series of proteins embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE). Thus, LINC complex Nesprins on the outer nuclear membrane are connected to different cytoplasmic cytoskeletal elements and to several other force-generating motor proteins. These Nesprin family proteins also have a KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, Syne Homology) domain that is located in the perinuclear space and connects to the SUN (Sad1 and UNC-84) proteins of the inner nuclear membrane [12]. The SUN proteins are in turn connected to chromatin through lamins. This mechanical connection from nuclear surface to chromatin is crucial in enabling the forces from the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM) to be transmitted to both the surface and interior of the nucleus. These forces can, therefore, alter not just nuclear morphology but also internal elements such as chromatin architecture and so lead to the modulation of mechanosensitive gene expression. Exposure of cells to microgravity is known to lead to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the ECM. In addition, microgravity leads to morphological changes in both the cell and its nucleus, and to altered gene expression [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]—all features related to LINC complex function. The LINC complex is also known to be a critical factor in the normal formation and development of tissues, such as the breast cell acinus [21]. Simulated microgravity (SMG) achieved by clinorotation disrupts features such as cell proliferation, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression and cytokine production [13,22]. These are all LINC-regulated processes, and failure in their normal functioning has been linked to aberrant developmental regulation, such as cancer. Indeed, in addition to altering all these LINC-dependent features, SMG also suppresses tumor cell growth and development in e.g., breast epithelial cell cultures [23]. However, despite such circumstantial evidence, the role of the LINC complex in cellular responses to altered gravitational environments has yet to be studied. Therefore, we have asked how the LINC complex affects changes in nuclear shape and differential gene expression in SMG. We report that the nucleus requires an intact LINC complex for its shape to be modulated by altered gravity conditions. We also identify LINC-dependent genes associated with this response, indicating that elements of the genome regulation normally seen in altered gravity requires an intact LINC complex.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture Human breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A from ATCC), MCF 10A SS-GFP-KDEL and MCF 10A SS-GFP-SUN1L-KDEL cells (created by Dr. Tanmay Lele and Dr. Kyle Roux [21,25]) were a kind gift to us. The inducible cell lines were created with MCF 10A TET-ON (Clontech) transduced retrovirally with pRetroX-Tight.puro containing either SS-HA-GFP-SUN1L-KDEL for LINC disruption or SS-HA-GFP-KDEL for controls [25]. To create a stable line, cell selection was performed with 0.5 μg/mL puromycin and then screened by immunofluorescence postinduction with or without 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 18 h. The cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA) without phenol red, supplemented with 5% (w/v) horse serum, cholera toxin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO USA), epidermal growth factor (Peprotech, Cranbury, NJ, USA), hydrocortisone (Sigma), insulin (Sigma) and penicillin streptomycin (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% (v/v) CO2 incubating chamber. The inducible cells were trypsinized and seeded in fibronectin coated chamber flasks with 30% confluency and cultured for 24 h. To induce SUN1L-KDEL for LINC disruption and GFP-KDEL for control comparison, the media were supplemented with 1 µg/mL doxycycline [21]. These cells were cultured in doxycycline for 24 h before placing them on the 3-D clinostat. 4.2. Simulated Microgravity Using 3-D Clinostat The chamber flasks were filled completely with media containing 1 µg/mL doxycycline (Fisher) and care taken to remove all the bubbles that may cause shear stress to the cell monolayer. The chamber flask was sealed with a rubber stopper, and a syringe was used to release any excess pressure. The 3-D clinostat (Gravite, Space Bio Laboratories Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan) consisting of two perpendicular rotating axes was run in Mode C preprogrammed with an inbuilt computer and gravity acceleration sensor to measure simulate microgravity (to the order of 10−3 G) by rotating the inner and outer frame simultaneously at a constant angular velocity (~2 rotations per minute) [58,59,60]. Four cell culture flasks on slides (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA, 170920) were mounted at the center and were placed in a controlled environment maintaining the temperature at 37 °C for 2 and 20 h. The 1G control samples were placed in the same incubator. All the experiments were conducted twice, and each experiment had two sets of samples in both 1G and SMG conditions. A Student’s t-test was applied for statistical comparison for nuclear morphology. 4.3. Immunostaining and Microscopy After the cells were exposed to simulated microgravity for fixed periods of time, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then washed with PBS. To stain for F-actin, 1:50 Alex Fluor 594 phalloidin was used and for the nucleus, 1:250 Hoechst 33,342 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used. Cells were then incubated for 20 min at room temperature before washing with PBS. The cells were then imaged with the 60×/1.40 NA oil immersion objective of a Nikon A1R laser scanning inverted confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). To immunostain for the Nesprin-2 protein, we followed the protocol of Zhang et al. [21] and used the primary antibody anti-Nesprin-2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, ab204308) at a 1:100 dilution and the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA, A-11037) at a 1:200 dilution. Z-stack images were acquired for the cells with 0.3 µM height intervals. The images were reconstructed using the Nikon NIS elements software, and maximum intensity profiles for the nucleus were created for the x-z view. The full width half maximum (FWHM) technique in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) was used to acquire the nuclear height measurement. The maximum intensity projection of the x-y view of the nucleus was used to measure the nuclear area using the ImageJ software. 4.4. RNA seq Library Preparation, Sequencing and Data Analysis Approximately 2 × 106 cells were frozen in 700 µL of QIAzol buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The samples were immediately vortexed and placed on ice before storing at −80 °C. Once all samples were collected, they were randomized, and total RNA was extracted and purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit, following recommended procedures, with on-column DNase treatment. Libraries were prepared from purified RNA (0.3 ng) using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Globin (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Three runs of 75 bp paired-end sequencing were performed on pooled libraries using the Illumina NextSeq 550 System. Quality control of purified RNA and RNA libraries was carried out using the Fragment Analyzer System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Raw DE multiplexed fastq paired end read files were trimmed of adapters and filtered using the program skewer [61] to discard any reads with an average phred quality score of less than 30, or a length of less than 36 nucleotides. Trimmed reads were then aligned using the HISAT2 aligner to the Homo sapiens  reference genome assembly version GRCh38 and sorted using SAM tools [62,63]. Aligned reads were counted and assigned to gene metafeatures using the program feature Counts as part of the Subread package [64]. These count files were imported into the R programming language and were assessed for quality control, normalized and analyzed using an in-house pipeline utilizing the edge R Bioconductor library, for differential gene expression testing, and the GSVA library, for GO and KEGG pathway analysis, utilizing their respective collections from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [28,65,66]. The GO pathway analysis shown in Supplementary Figure S5 is based on GSVA using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) GO collections, as opposed to the GO term enrichment, which does not take into account the ranking of the genes [27,28].",

Simulated Microgravity Elicits Changes in Nuclear Shape that Depend on the LINC Complex As noted above, breast epithelial cells have been previously shown to exhibit responses to SMG, suggesting that they might be a useful model to study the involvement of the LINC complex in SMG-related effects. Furthermore, we have a deep understanding of nuclear shaping under normal gravity conditions in MCF 10A—a non-tumerogenic human mammary epithelial cell line [24]. This cell line was engineered to express a construct that interferes with LINC complex function (see below), making it well-suited to investigating the role of the LINC complex in SMG-related effects. Therefore, we chose MCF 10A cells, wildtype and engineered, to study how SMG may impact nuclear events, using a 3-D clinostat to simulate microgravity. We first established whether the nuclear shape of MCF 10A cells is responsive to clinostat-induced SMG. After SMG treatment, we fixed the cells, and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342, allowing us to measure any change in nuclear height, major axis and minor axis using confocal microscopy. Actin staining was used to define the shape of the cells to ensure only those with the morphology characteristic of adherence to the substrate were analyzed. We observed that the nuclear height significantly (p < 0.05, t-test) decreased after 20 h of exposure to SMG, and the nuclear spreading area increased (Supplementary Figure S1A,B). To understand if this change in nuclear shape in response to SMG depends on the LINC complex, we used a doxycycline inducible MCF 10A cell line where the LINC complex function is disrupted. This inducible cell line stably expresses SS-HA-SUN1L-KDEL (signal sequence-hemaglutinin epitope tagged to SUN1 protein, with a lumenal domain-ER retrieval amino acid sequence; SUN1L-KDEL) [25]. SUN1L-KDEL acts in a dominant negative fashion disrupting the LINC complex by interfering with the connection between the endogenous KASH domain of nesprin-2 and nesprin-4 proteins and the SUN1 proteins in the nuclear envelope [3,21,25]. Cells expressing a similar doxycycline inducible construct SS-GFP-KDEL (GFP-KDEL) were used as the corresponding paired control. We confirmed that the induction of SUN1L-KDEL but not GFP-KDEL did indeed disrupt the LINC complex by immunostaining with a Nesprin-2 antibody (Supplementary Figure S2). As noted above, Nesprin-2 localizes to the nuclear membrane in a LINC-complex-dependent fashion, and the immunofluorescence staining showed a loss of Nesprin-2 in the NE in the doxycycline induced SUN1L-KDEL cells but not in the corresponding control doxycycline-treated GFP-KDEL cells. These observations are consistent with those of Zhang et.al. who previously showed that this system is effective in disrupting the LINC function [21]. The doxycycline-induced cells were, therefore, exposed to 3-D clinorotation for 20 h. The 1G (ground) controls (i.e., identically doxycycline treated cells but not on the clinostat) were placed next to the clinostat in the same incubator. After treatment, the cells were fixed and the 3-dimensional nuclear morphology was monitored using confocal microscopy as described earlier. The GFP-KDEL cells showed a decrease in nuclear height after 20 h (similar to the MCF 10A wild type cells, Supplementary Figure S1A,C,D) in SMG (Figure 1A and Table 1). In contrast, the SUN1L-KDEL cells showed a significant nuclear height increase when compared to 1G cells over this same time period in SMG. These results show that the normal nuclear shape change to SMG requires an intact LINC complex. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Nuclear shape response to simulated microgravity (SMG) depends on the LINC complex. (A) Confocal images show the nuclei (blue) and actin (red) staining (to reveal the cell morphology) of fixed GFP-KDEL (GFP) and SUN1L-KDEL (SUN1L) cells after 20 h in 1G and SMG. Top row shows the x-z view and the bottom rows show the x-y view of the corresponding nuclei and cells. Similarly, (B) shows confocal images of the nuclei and actin of fixed GFP-KDEL and SUN1L-KDEL cells in 1G and SMG condition for 2 h. Scale bars are 10 µm. Images are representative of the mean values.Table 1.

All values are shown as the mean ± SD.2.2. Short Duration Simulated Microgravity-Induced, LINC-Dependent Changes in Nuclear Shape.

Therefore, to observe the impact of short duration exposure of LINC disrupted cells to SMG, we assayed responses after 2 h on the clinostat. The nuclear height increased significantly (p < 0.05, t-test), and the nuclear area decreased in GFP-KDEL cells exposed to SMG for 2h. This impact, however, was opposite to the response at the 20 h time point, i.e., decrease in nuclear height in SMG (Figure 1B, Table 1), indicating that the cells may start adapting to SMG differently at longer timepoints. The SUN1L-KDEL cells on the other hand did not show any significant difference in nuclear morphology between the 1G and SMG cells over 2 h of SMG (Table 1). These observations again suggest that the effects of SMG on nuclear shape required an intact LINC complex. 2.2. LINC-Dependent Differential Gene Expression in Simulated Microgravity Since the changes in nuclear shape triggered by both 2 and 20 h SMG appear to require the LINC complex, we hypothesized that disruption of the LINC complex with SUN1L KDEL expression might also affect patterns of gene expression. We, therefore, used RNAseq analysis to characterize differential gene expression in GFP-KDEL and SUN1L-KDEL in SMG vs. 1G controls. Figure 2A shows a plot of the fold-change in expression level (SMG vs. 1G control) against significance of this change (p-value) in our initial analysis of transcriptional responses after 2 h of exposure to SMG. A larger number of genes were up- or down-regulated in SUN1L-KDEL cells in SMG (558 up, 434 down, nominal p < 0.05) compared to those in the GFP-KDEL cells (203 up, 179 down, nominal p < 0.05; Figure 2A,B, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Transcriptome responds to SMG and varies upon LINC disruption at different exposure times. Volcano plots of differentially expressing genes between SMG and 1G with statistical significance in the y-axis and fold change on the x-axis in (A) GFP-KDEL cells after 2 h, (B) SUN1L-KDEL cells after 2 h, (C) GFP-KDEL cells after 20 h, (D) SUN1L-KDEL cells after 20 h. Upregulated genes are shown in orange and downregulated genes are shown in blue. Significantly differentially expressing genes with p ≤ 0.05 are above the red dashed line. (E,F) summarize all the LINC-dependent genes identified through the interaction model at 2 and 20 h, respectively, which are described in Supplementary Tables S3 and S6. The whole distribution is shown to the right with the indicated area magnified on the left. Genes with statistical significance (p < 0.05) are shown to be differentially regulated under the interaction of LINC disruption and SMG conditions and are highlighted with LINC dependence equal to True in the figure. Genes that are not highlighted (False) did not attain significance and are not dependent on LINC. For each gene, the log fold-change (logFC) for response to SMG vs. its 1G control in the SUNL-KDEL cells is divided by the same characterization but in the GFP KDEL controls and is color-coded on the plot. Based on this logFC ratio, these genes could be characterized as being regulated in the opposite direction for each cell line (green, Ratio < 0), regulated more strongly under the SUN1L KDEL cell line (blue, Ratio > 1) or regulated more strongly under the GFP cell line (pink, 0 < Ratio < 1).We identified the top 50 most significantly differentially expressed genes (selected as showing the smallest p-value when comparing 2 h SMG to 1G control) in each condition, which are presented in Supplementary Figure S3. Nassef et al. used true microgravity (10-2 G) in parabolic flight to show that the expression of genes related to the cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix and chemokines is affected in breast epithelial cells exposed to true microgravity [14]. Thus, this study provides some specific genes as well as broad classes of potential genes of interest. We, therefore, closely compared the response of the individual genes in the Nassef et al. study with their responses in our study (Supplementary Table S10). Even though we did not see similar response in any of these genes after 2 h exposure to SMG, we found that TIMP1, SERPINE1 and RDX genes were differentially regulated after 20 h SMG exposure, similar to those reported in the Nassef study in cells after experiencing 31 parabolas. The differences in gene expression may be due to the alternating hypergravity and microgravity phases experienced during each parabola. However, in our 2 h SMG data, we did see changes in genes reflecting the broad classes of gene families reported by Nassef et al. Thus, in GFP-KDEL expressing cells, 2 h SMG led to the modulation of genes associated with the cytoskeleton (e.g., KRT85, TUBA1A), the extracellular matrix (TIMP3, SERPINF2), and chemokine response (CXCL3). These genes are highlighted in Figure 2A,B. To infer whether the LINC complex might play a role in regulating the expression of any of these genes in SMG, we compared their levels in the GFP-KDEL controls to those where the LINC complex was disrupted by SUN1L-KDEL expression. We predicted that genes for which the LINC function played a role in regulating their expression under SMG conditions would show one of several patterns of response. Thus, SMG-responsive genes for which the change in transcript level is LINC-dependent might show alteration in expression in SMG in the GFP KDEL control cells but lose this responsiveness to SMG in the SUN1L KDEL lines. Some genes might show responsiveness to SMG in the control cells but show a significantly larger or smaller change in the LINC-disrupted case, implying a role of the LINC complex in the degree of repression or activation of expression. Additionally, some genes may show no differential expression in SMG when comparing GFP KDEL cells in SMG to their 1G controls, but these genes would show differential expression in the LINC-disrupted SUN1L KDEL expressing cells. In this latter case, normal gene expression homeostasis would require LINC action, and in the LINC-disrupted cells, this regulation would be lost. Loss of this control would lead to either up- or down-regulation of their transcription, specifically in SMG, revealing a further layer of LINC-dependency to their normal transcriptional regulation under SMG conditions. Indeed, our analysis shows that the differential expression of some of these genes in SMG appears to depend on an intact LINC complex. For example, the cytoskeletal element keratin (KRT85) was upregulated by 2.13-fold in SMG in GFP-KDEL cells, but there was no significant difference in its expression levels in LINC-disrupted SUN1L-KDEL cells exposed to equivalent SMG treatment. Similarly, the chemokine response marker CXCL3 (C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 3) was downregulated 1.4-fold in GFP-KDEL, but this gene lost its sensitivity to SMG in SUN1L-KDEL cells. In contrast, the LINC disruption using SUN1L-KDEL resulted in the decreased expression (5.65-fold) of KRT83 (another cytoskeletal gene belonging to the keratin family), whereas this gene did not alter due to SMG in GFP-KDEL cells. Furthermore, the ECM gene (COL12A1) showed no significant difference in GFP-KDEL cells but was upregulated by 1.22-fold in the SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells. Thus, the LINC complex appears to play roles in normally inducing some genes, while repressing other genes in response to SMG and in maintaining homeostatic control of other genes under SMG conditions. To elucidate the role of the LINC in differential gene expression, we used an interaction model between transcriptional changes seen in SUN1L-KDEL and GFP-KDEL expressing cells with and without SMG exposure. The interaction effect is described in Figure 2E where the relative fold changes between SMG and 1G in GFP-KDEL and SUN1L-KDEL samples at 2 h are compared statistically. The majority of the LINC-dependent genes reversed their direction of change upon LINC disruption (Ratio < 0). For example, the FSIP2 gene was significantly down-regulated in GFP-KDEL cells in SMG. However, the change in expression level of this gene reversed in SUN1L-KDEL cells, with a significant upregulation. Similarly, CAGE1, a gene widely associated with cancer [26] was significantly upregulated in the GFP-KDEL cells, while it was significantly downregulated in SUN1L-KDEL cells illustrating an opposite pattern of response of the gene FSIP2 to LINC disruption. In addition to these genes, we identified genes whose sensitivity to SMG was lost (0 < Ratio < 1) and genes which gained such sensitivity (Ratio > 1) upon LINC disruption. For example, ARL14EP and ID1 are the genes which were significantly differentially expressed in GFP-KDEL cells exposed to 2h of SMG but were not altered in SUN1L-KDEL cells exposed to SMG, implying that these genes lost their sensitivity to SMG upon LINC disruption. On the other hand, PER3 and OSCP1 genes were not affected by SMG in GFP-KDEL cells but were significantly differentially expressed in SUN1L-KDEL cells exposed to 2 h of SMG. The results both imply that the LINC complex is required to maintain transcriptional homeostasis of some genes in the presence of SMG and that an intact mechanical nucleo-cytoskeletal linkage may mediate response to SMG and to regulate subsequent differential gene expression of other genes. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) signaling pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that in GFP-KDEL cells exposed to 2 h of SMG, six pathways were enriched, while a larger number of pathways were enriched only in the SUN1L-KDEL cells under the same conditions (Figure 3A). We next used the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to perform gene ontology analysis. The MSigDB is a curated set of annotated gene sets which can be analyzed by Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) to determine if any genes in a particular curated set (pathway, biological state, cellular locale etc.) are enriched in a genome-wide expression analysis using a ranked set of genes [27,28]. Pathway analysis of the GFP-KDEL cells in SMG for the MSigDB GSVA GO biological process dataset revealed enrichment in genes related to microtubule-based movement, the reproductive process and negative regulation of catalytic activity (Supplementary Figure S5b). A similar analysis for cellular components revealed that terms relating to nuclear specks and the kinetochore were significantly enriched (Supplementary Figure S5a). A greater number of significantly enriched GO pathways were identified in the SMG SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells, including many biological processes related to mechanoresponse systems such as: cell matrix adhesion, regulation of cell migration and negative regulation of cell migration (Supplementary Figure S5b). GO pathway analysis of cellular components revealed enrichment related to the mitochondrion, actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion. Some of the LINC-dependent GO cellular component pathways for mechanosensing identified by the interaction effect were mitochondrion, cell junction, intercellular junction, tight junction, kinetochore and nuclear specks (Supplementary Figure S5c). Figure 3. Open in a new tab KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressing genes in SMG vs. 1G after 2 and 20 h.

(B) Up- and down-regulated enriched pathways in GFP-KDEL cells (left) and SUN1L-KDEL cells (right) after 20 h in SMG. (C) LINC-dependent up- and down-regulated enriched pathways in SMG after 2 (left) and 20 h (right). 2.3. LINC Dependency of SMG-Induced Changes in Gene Expression Is Also Determined by the Duration of Exposure to SMG After 20 h in SMG, the GFP-KDEL cells had a larger number of genes that were significantly differentially expressed compared to the 2 h condition. Additionally, there was an even larger number of differentially expressed genes in SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells (1279 upregulated, 1542 downregulated, p ≤ 0.05) than the GFP-KDEL cells (813 upregulated, 846 downregulated, ≤0.05) after 20 h (Figure 2C,D, Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). In GFP-KDEL cells, the levels of expression of several genes associated with cytokines and chemokines were significantly altered, including the VEGFA gene. While the focal adhesion associated genes TLN2 and SERPINE1 (involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and spreading) were upregulated, the ECM genes TIMP3 and LAMA5 were down-regulated. The expression of the NE gene encoding for nesprin-3 (SYNE3) showed a significant decrease in expression (Figure 2C). We identified the genes whose expression depended on the duration of exposure to SMG by assessing the interaction effect between GFP-KDEL transcriptional changes at 2 and 20 h (Supplementary Table S7). We also identified the unique genes and pathways that depend on the LINC complex to potentially mechanosense the gravitational forces in SMG after 20 h by evaluating the interaction effect between SUN1L-KDEL and GFP-KDEL transcriptional changes at 20 h (Figure 2F, Supplementary Figure S3F, Supplementary Table S6). All the above-mentioned genes were differentially expressed in SMG-treated SUN1-KDEL cells, in a similar fashion to GFP-KDEL, implying that they were not dependent on the LINC complex, with the notable exception of TIMP3. In contrast, MMP19 (encodes a collagenase related to ECM dynamics), which was not responsive to SMG in GFP-KDEL cells, gained responsiveness upon LINC complex disruption. Similarly, the chemokine gene CXCL16 was also modulated differently in SMG-treated SUN1-KDEL cells compared to the expression in GFP KDEL cells (Figure 2C,D). We also identified the genes in SUN1L-KDEL cells that were dependent on the duration of exposure to SMG by assessing the interaction effect between SUN1L-KDEL transcriptional changes at 2 and 20 h (Supplementary Table S8). More KEGG pathways were enriched in GFP-KDEL cells after 20 h in SMG when compared to the effects of 2 h exposure (Figure 3A,B). For example, the cell cycle pathway was enriched in the differentially expressed transcripts in GFP-KDEL cells exposed to SMG for 20 h, whereas it was not affected in cells exposed for 2 h. In the SUN1-KDEL cells, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton was highlighted in the KEGG analysis, as were pathways associated with adhesion, such as focal adhesion, cell adhesion molecules and tight junction, implying alteration in the systems mediating cell-to-matrix and cell-to-cell contacts in SMG. The DNA replication mismatch repair pathway was also enriched, which may be linked to alterations in various cancer associated pathways/processes highlighted as being differentially regulated in the data (bladder cancer, melanoma, pathways in cancer, renal cell carcinoma). Altered cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathways were also seen in this analysis. Thus, the LINC complex disruption in simulated microgravity may be associated with pathways related to cancer development. We also identified the KEGG pathways that are LINC-dependent in microgravity with the interaction model. It is important to note that there were a greater number of LINC-dependent pathways that were enriched at 2 h when compared to 20 h (Figure 3C). Cluster analysis was next performed on the LINC-dependent differentially expressing genes (p ≤ 0.05) at both 2 and 20 h SMG exposure. Using the Metascape tool (www.metascape.org), pathway and process enrichment analysis was performed using KEGG Functional Sets, KEGG Pathway, in this approach, network and clusters were developed based on the enrichment with p ≤ 0.01 and with a minimum count of 3. In Figure 4A, the top 20 clusters are shown with each node color coded based on the cluster it belongs to. Each node represents an enriched term as detailed in Supplementary Table S9. From the pie chart representation of each node (Figure 4B), we can see that clusters 1, 2 and 5 had all the nodes enriched for both the LINC-dependent 2 and 20 h SMG exposure conditions. Interestingly, Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 comprised enriched terms all related to the mitochondrian as listed in Figure 4C. Previous studies have found similar dysregulation and dysfunction of the mitochondrian in human cells exposed to simulated microgravity provided by 3-D clinostat and RPM exposures [29,30]. Our analysis clearly shows that the LINC complex may be required in regulating mitochondrion-dependent pathways and processes due to simulated microgravity at 2 and 20 h. We hypothesize that LINC may be playing a crucial role in modulating the mitochondrial response to SMG. However, more experimentation will be required to robustly test how LINC may be impacting the response of mitochondria in simulated microgravity. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Network of top 20 clusters of the enriched terms. (A) Network representing each cluster by a different color; (B) network enrichment shown with pie chart. The size of the pie in each node depends on the gene count of the two conditions. Red indicates enrichment of pathways due to LINC-dependent genes at 20 h of SMG, and blue indicates enrichment of pathways in LINC-dependent genes at 2 h of SMG. (C) Enriched terms in Clusters 1 and 2 are all linked to mitochondria.The GO pathway analysis of these data revealed that processes such as regulation of cell growth, cell activation and protein folding were enriched, alongside cellular components including the actin cytoskeleton, myosin complex, microtubule organization center and endoplasmic reticulum in GFP-KDEL cells (Supplementary Figure S6a,c). The GO analysis for of SUN1L-KDEL cells further revealed enrichment in biological processes such as response to external stimulus, response to extracellular stimulus, response to hypoxia, response to wounding and inflammatory response (Supplementary Figure S6d). The GO analysis for cellular components revealed a mix of upregulated and down-regulated processes after 20 h of SMG (Supplementary Figure S6b): for example, upregulation of actin cytoskeleton, leading edge, cell junction, tight junction and downregulation of microtubule organizing center and chromosomes. Some patterns of gene expression were consistent between responses at 2 and 20 h, including enrichment in cell adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton. The GO cellular component pathway analysis with the interaction model revealed the LINC-dependent components after 20 h in SMG mainly highlighted the tight junction, plasma membrane, intercellular junction components and mitochondrial components. The LINC-dependent GO biological pathways were also identified (Supplementary Figure S6c).",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion A highly reproducible suite of effects were observed in cells exposed to altered gravity relating to the reorganization of their cytoskeleton and cell adhesion proteins [31], coupled with changes in the morphologies of the cells, including their nuclei. There is a close link between nuclear shape and the cytoskeleton, with various cytoskeletal elements playing roles in regulating nuclear shape and position. Thus, actin polymerization flattens the nucleus and repositions it by pulling on it. Additionally, forces generated by microtubule motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin, and acto-myosin contractile and tensile forces are also transmitted to the nuclear surface. Intermediate filaments also form a cage-like structure around the nucleus giving it structural stability. Each of these elements are mechanically connected to the nucleus through LINC complex proteins. The mechanical integration afforded by these connections through the LINC complex plays a critical role in transferring mechanical signals from the ECM and the forces generated within the cytoplasm to the nucleus [32]. These signals regulate features such as nuclear shape, homeostatic position and rotation—all important elements for nuclear functioning. Therefore, not surprisingly, the LINC complex is important for an array of normal cellular functions such as migration, division, proliferation, differentiation and wound healing [33]. Consistent with these ideas of a central role of the LINC complex in mechanical signaling, there are also major LINC-associated diseases such as nuclear envelopathies, laminopathy, skeletal muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. Abnormal regulation of LINC complex genes SUN1, SUN2 and nesprin 2 is also seen in breast cancer. Several LINC-associated proteins such as SUN1, SUN2, Emerins and Nesprin-3 were seen to be differentially regulated in cancer cells exposed to simulated microgravity [13]. Indeed, SMG promotes breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion, nuclear positioning, as well as cell cycle progression, apoptosis [22] and abnormal expression of cancer inducing cytokines [14]. The LINC complex is known to play a very important role in the normal formation and development of breast cell acinus and in regulating the shape of the cell and the nucleus in both the breast cell culture of single cells and of monolayers [24]. Thus, understanding how SMG affects these cellular processes holds potential for both understanding how gravitational forces might be playing roles in normal tissue development on Earth and in revealing potential practical issues and risks related to long duration spaceflight. In the present study, we looked at breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A) in SMG with and without LINC disruption. We discovered that the changes in nuclear shape seen after 2 h and 20 h exposures to SMG depend on the LINC complex. Previous studies have shown that both the shape of cells and their nuclei are impacted by altered gravity environments [34], and our studies now provide evidence that this effect depends on a functional LINC complex. Thus, after 2 h in SMG, LINC disruption leads to a lack of nuclear shape change normally observed in cells with intact LINC function. After 20 h in SMG, the response reverses in direction, with the nucleus rounding up compared to flatter nuclei in cells with an intact LINC complex. As discussed earlier, the cytoskeleton reorganizes in microgravity, with disruption of the microtubule network, and a so-called ‘loosening’ of the cytokeratin network around the nucleus, and this may be the reason for the rounding up of the nucleus (increased nuclear height and decrease in x-y area) in GFP-KDEL control cells exposed to 2 h of SMG. We hypothesize that, as in SUN1L-KDEL cells, the cytoskeleton is not mechanically connected to the nuclear surface, and so such SMG-induced changes in the cytoskeleton are not able to affect the nuclear shape. After 20 h in SMG, however, the nuclear height decreased, and the x-y nuclear area increased in GFP-KDEL cells compared to the cells in 1G. This observation can be explained by the increase in cell area reported in both simulated microgravity and true microgravity experiments conducted for long durations, and that the cell shape is inextricably linked to the nuclear shape, i.e., cell spreading is driving nuclear “flattening” [24,35,36,37]. On the other hand, the SUN1L-KDEL cells showed an increase in nuclear height under the same conditions, consistent with the idea of a loss of cytoskeletal interactions that normally pull on the periphery of the nuclear envelope. It has been reported previously that the response of cell morphology to calibrated physical external stimulus in LINC disrupted cells is different when compared to the cells with intact LINC complex function [1,2]. Therefore, we may expect the nuclear morphology in the LINC-disrupted cells to also respond to the longer duration SMG very differently to the control GFP-KDEL cells. Despite these time-dependent effects, our analysis shows that both at 2 and 20 h SMG exposure times, the LINC complex plays a role in the nuclear shaping mechanism. These results support the idea that the mechanosensitivity of the nuclear shape to external stimuli strongly depends on the SUN1-Nesprin linkage in the nuclear envelope provided by the LINC complex [3]. We also looked at the role of the LINC complex in differential gene expression in response to SMG, revealing that there are LINC-dependent genes that are up- and down-regulated in response to SMG. We hypothesize that the nuclear shape regulation and gene expression dependency on the LINC complex are inter-related. Thus, gene activity depends on the location of the chromosome and its packing inside the nucleus [38], e.g., chromosome territories are positioned differently and have different interactions in breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A) compared to corresponding malignant cells (MCF 10CA1a), supporting different patterns of gene expression [39]. Nuclear shape and rigidity depends on the packing of the heterochromatin [40] and changes in nuclear shape may in turn feedback to change the level of chromatin condensation [41]. Therefore, it is highly likely that patterns of gene expression depend to some degree on nuclear shape [4,42]. The LINC complex connects the cytoskeleton to the nuclear surface; the SUN proteins in the inner nuclear envelope are connected to lamins, which are connected to chromatin. Thus, the LINC complex provides a strong candidate for linking cellular level mechanical forces to changes in nuclear gene expression. For example, interfering with the LINC complex in plant cells led to decondensation of chromocenters and silencing of transcription [43]. Hence, the LINC complex may impact gene expression in two ways: (1) by directly affecting chromatin compaction; (2) by regulating the shape of the nucleus, and both mechanisms may be in play once cells move from the 1G to a microgravity environment. It is important to note that there are changes in cell physiology just with time growing in culture. For example, Seaman et al. have found that the nuclear morphology changes significantly over time in cultured human primary fibroblast cells [44]. Indeed, in our data both the GFP-KDEL and SUN1L-KDEL cells at 1G (Table 1) show expected decrease in nuclear area and increase in nuclear height when comparing data from 2 h and 20 h in culture. In most cell types, the shape of the nucleus depends mainly on factors such as the shape of the cell, cytoskeleton organization, and external adhesions such as cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion [3,24,45]. Studies with human breast epithelial cells found that the shape of the nucleus is controlled by the shape of the cell [24]. Also, fibroblast cell nuclei are flatter in cells with larger spreading area than in lesser spread cells [37]. The dynamic actin cap flattens the nucleus while actomyosin contractile forces pull on the nucleus regulating its volume and the gross morphology [2,46,47]. Intermediate filaments also wrap the nucleus like a cage and act as a passive network that transmits active forces from myosin motor proteins thereby playing a significant role in controlling the nuclear volume [3,46,47]. While active motor forces and changes in lamellipodia and filopodial formation occur during cell migration [48,49], cell polarization [50], cell division [51,52] and development [53]. Each of these processes are dynamic and require regular nuclear positioning and shaping which in turn depend on the cell shape and cytoskeletal organization over time to carry on with normal cell functions. These observations suggest physiological changes occurring in the cells with time in culture indeed have the potential to affect the nuclear shape in addition to any nuclear morphological changes mediated by SMG. Both the GFP-KDEL and the SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells showed similar culture time-related effects, with e.g., nuclear shape changing in an identical fashion when comparing the 2 h and 20 h treatments at 1G. Therefore, to better control the physiological changes along the culture time, we particularly evaluated the differences between nuclear shape and patterns of gene expression in SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells relative to the paired GFP-KDEL control at the same duration in culture under 1G or SMG. Comparing the SMG responses in the SUN1L-KDEL cells to the paired SMG-treated GFP-KDEL controls at the same time-point helps remove these culture time-related effects to focus on the effects of SMG exposure. Cancer is a leading cause of death around the world and with an ever-increasing range and duration of deep space exploration missions, astronauts are at a potentially elevated risk of developing this disease. For decades, cells have been studied in altered gravity environments using various platforms such as the International Space Station, sounding rockets, parabolic flights and microgravity simulators. Common cell functions such as proliferation, migration, division and differentiation are all affected differently in altered gravity environments [13,36,54,55]. Genes associated with the progression of cancer by metastasis (cytokines) are also differentially regulated in microgravity as are several other genes related to wound healing, focal adhesion [13], and growth factors. However, our analysis suggests a complex pattern of gene expression responses in microgravity in relation to the LINC complex. We discovered genes that are LINC-dependent in SMG that are associated with different types of cancer. For example, we found the gene RBMS3 to be significantly upregulated in a LINC-dependent manner in response to 2 h of SMG. This gene acts in a defense mechanism against breast and other types of cancer, and upregulation of this gene can suppress cancer or tumor progression [56]. Overexpression of the SRA1 gene is also associated with breast, ovarian, prostate, lung and liver cancer [57]. In our study, we found that SRA1 gene expression is sensitive to SMG. However, although the LINC-dependent SMG responsiveness of, e.g., RBMS3 remained at 20 h of SMG, it was lost for the SRA1 gene. These observations suggest an interplay of signaling and time in the LINC mediated modulation of these genes in response to SMG, and to potential effects on cancer development. In conclusion, we discovered that the LINC complex plays an important role in regulating nuclear morphology in breast epithelial cells exposed to SMG. We identified a series of LINC-dependent SMG responsive genes, where the spectrum of changes depend on how long the cells are exposed to SMG. Using KEGG and GO analysis, we found that pathways and processes associated with the cell cycle, the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion were the most affected upon LINC disruption in SMG. Taken together, our results imply that the mechanical forces on a cell imposed through altered gravity are likely acting through LINC complex-related transduction events to modulate both nuclear shape and patterns of gene expression, especially of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and other mechanical features of the cell. These results provide insight into a potentially important element of transcriptional control on Earth and highlight a potential risk factor for long duration spaceflight. Further studies using both true and simulated microgravity need to be performed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind LINC in cellular sensing and the response to microgravity.",

Copyright notice ID: 7555797 PMID: 32942630 Abstract Microgravity is known to affect the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell and nuclear morphology and to elicit differential expression of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions and the extracellular matrix. Although the nucleus is mechanically connected to the cytoskeleton through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the role of this group of proteins in these responses to microgravity has yet to be defined. In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of exposure to simulated microgravity. These LINC-dependent genes likely represent elements normally regulated by the mechanical forces imposed by gravity on Earth. Keywords: LINC complex, simulated microgravity, nuclear morphology1. Introduction The nucleus is the largest organelle of the cell and homeostatic control of its shape and position are known to be crucial for cellular functions such as cell migration, cell division and the regulation of gene expression [1,2,3,4,5]. Forces generated by the cytoskeleton and external mechanical stimuli are directly transmitted to the nuclear surface through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex [3,6,7,8,9,10,11]—a series of proteins embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE). Thus, LINC complex Nesprins on the outer nuclear membrane are connected to different cytoplasmic cytoskeletal elements and to several other force-generating motor proteins. These Nesprin family proteins also have a KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, Syne Homology) domain that is located in the perinuclear space and connects to the SUN (Sad1 and UNC-84) proteins of the inner nuclear membrane [12]. The SUN proteins are in turn connected to chromatin through lamins. This mechanical connection from nuclear surface to chromatin is crucial in enabling the forces from the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM) to be transmitted to both the surface and interior of the nucleus. These forces can, therefore, alter not just nuclear morphology but also internal elements such as chromatin architecture and so lead to the modulation of mechanosensitive gene expression. Exposure of cells to microgravity is known to lead to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the ECM. In addition, microgravity leads to morphological changes in both the cell and its nucleus, and to altered gene expression [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]—all features related to LINC complex function. The LINC complex is also known to be a critical factor in the normal formation and development of tissues, such as the breast cell acinus [21]. Simulated microgravity (SMG) achieved by clinorotation disrupts features such as cell proliferation, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression and cytokine production [13,22]. These are all LINC-regulated processes, and failure in their normal functioning has been linked to aberrant developmental regulation, such as cancer. Indeed, in addition to altering all these LINC-dependent features, SMG also suppresses tumor cell growth and development in e.g., breast epithelial cell cultures [23]. However, despite such circumstantial evidence, the role of the LINC complex in cellular responses to altered gravitational environments has yet to be studied. Therefore, we have asked how the LINC complex affects changes in nuclear shape and differential gene expression in SMG. We report that the nucleus requires an intact LINC complex for its shape to be modulated by altered gravity conditions. We also identify LINC-dependent genes associated with this response, indicating that elements of the genome regulation normally seen in altered gravity requires an intact LINC complex.2. Results 2.1. Simulated Microgravity Elicits Changes in Nuclear Shape that Depend on the LINC Complex As noted above, breast epithelial cells have been previously shown to exhibit responses to SMG, suggesting that they might be a useful model to study the involvement of the LINC complex in SMG-related effects. Furthermore, we have a deep understanding of nuclear shaping under normal gravity conditions in MCF 10A—a non-tumerogenic human mammary epithelial cell line [24]. This cell line was engineered to express a construct that interferes with LINC complex function (see below), making it well-suited to investigating the role of the LINC complex in SMG-related effects. Therefore, we chose MCF 10A cells, wildtype and engineered, to study how SMG may impact nuclear events, using a 3-D clinostat to simulate microgravity. We first established whether the nuclear shape of MCF 10A cells is responsive to clinostat-induced SMG. After SMG treatment, we fixed the cells, and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342, allowing us to measure any change in nuclear height, major axis and minor axis using confocal microscopy. Actin staining was used to define the shape of the cells to ensure only those with the morphology characteristic of adherence to the substrate were analyzed. We observed that the nuclear height significantly (p < 0.05, t-test) decreased after 20 h of exposure to SMG, and the nuclear spreading area increased (Supplementary Figure S1A,B). To understand if this change in nuclear shape in response to SMG depends on the LINC complex, we used a doxycycline inducible MCF 10A cell line where the LINC complex function is disrupted. This inducible cell line stably expresses SS-HA-SUN1L-KDEL (signal sequence-hemaglutinin epitope tagged to SUN1 protein, with a lumenal domain-ER retrieval amino acid sequence; SUN1L-KDEL) [25]. SUN1L-KDEL acts in a dominant negative fashion disrupting the LINC complex by interfering with the connection between the endogenous KASH domain of nesprin-2 and nesprin-4 proteins and the SUN1 proteins in the nuclear envelope [3,21,25]. Cells expressing a similar doxycycline inducible construct SS-GFP-KDEL (GFP-KDEL) were used as the corresponding paired control. We confirmed that the induction of SUN1L-KDEL but not GFP-KDEL did indeed disrupt the LINC complex by immunostaining with a Nesprin-2 antibody (Supplementary Figure S2). As noted above, Nesprin-2 localizes to the nuclear membrane in a LINC-complex-dependent fashion, and the immunofluorescence staining showed a loss of Nesprin-2 in the NE in the doxycycline induced SUN1L-KDEL cells but not in the corresponding control doxycycline-treated GFP-KDEL cells. These observations are consistent with those of Zhang et.al. who previously showed that this system is effective in disrupting the LINC function [21]. The doxycycline-induced cells were, therefore, exposed to 3-D clinorotation for 20 h. The 1G (ground) controls (i.e., identically doxycycline treated cells but not on the clinostat) were placed next to the clinostat in the same incubator. After treatment, the cells were fixed and the 3-dimensional nuclear morphology was monitored using confocal microscopy as described earlier. The GFP-KDEL cells showed a decrease in nuclear height after 20 h (similar to the MCF 10A wild type cells, Supplementary Figure S1A,C,D) in SMG (Figure 1A and Table 1). In contrast, the SUN1L-KDEL cells showed a significant nuclear height increase when compared to 1G cells over this same time period in SMG. These results show that the normal nuclear shape change to SMG requires an intact LINC complex. Figure 1.

Similarly, (B) shows confocal images of the nuclei and actin of fixed GFP-KDEL and SUN1L-KDEL cells in 1G and SMG condition for 2 h. Scale bars are 10 µm.

Therefore, to observe the impact of short duration exposure of LINC disrupted cells to SMG, we assayed responses after 2 h on the clinostat. The nuclear height increased significantly (p < 0.05, t-test), and the nuclear area decreased in GFP-KDEL cells exposed to SMG for 2h. This impact, however, was opposite to the response at the 20 h time point, i.e., decrease in nuclear height in SMG (Figure 1B, Table 1), indicating that the cells may start adapting to SMG differently at longer timepoints. The SUN1L-KDEL cells on the other hand did not show any significant difference in nuclear morphology between the 1G and SMG cells over 2 h of SMG (Table 1). These observations again suggest that the effects of SMG on nuclear shape required an intact LINC complex. 2.2. LINC-Dependent Differential Gene Expression in Simulated Microgravity Since the changes in nuclear shape triggered by both 2 and 20 h SMG appear to require the LINC complex, we hypothesized that disruption of the LINC complex with SUN1L KDEL expression might also affect patterns of gene expression. We, therefore, used RNAseq analysis to characterize differential gene expression in GFP-KDEL and SUN1L-KDEL in SMG vs. 1G controls. Figure 2A shows a plot of the fold-change in expression level (SMG vs. 1G control) against significance of this change (p-value) in our initial analysis of transcriptional responses after 2 h of exposure to SMG. A larger number of genes were up- or down-regulated in SUN1L-KDEL cells in SMG (558 up, 434 down, nominal p < 0.05) compared to those in the GFP-KDEL cells (203 up, 179 down, nominal p < 0.05; Figure 2A,B, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Transcriptome responds to SMG and varies upon LINC disruption at different exposure times.

Upregulated genes are shown in orange and downregulated genes are shown in blue. Significantly differentially expressing genes with p ≤ 0.05 are above the red dashed line. (E,F) summarize all the LINC-dependent genes identified through the interaction model at 2 and 20 h, respectively, which are described in Supplementary Tables S3 and S6. The whole distribution is shown to the right with the indicated area magnified on the left. Genes with statistical significance (p < 0.05) are shown to be differentially regulated under the interaction of LINC disruption and SMG conditions and are highlighted with LINC dependence equal to True in the figure. Genes that are not highlighted (False) did not attain significance and are not dependent on LINC. For each gene, the log fold-change (logFC) for response to SMG vs. its 1G control in the SUNL-KDEL cells is divided by the same characterization but in the GFP KDEL controls and is color-coded on the plot. Based on this logFC ratio, these genes could be characterized as being regulated in the opposite direction for each cell line (green, Ratio < 0), regulated more strongly under the SUN1L KDEL cell line (blue, Ratio > 1) or regulated more strongly under the GFP cell line (pink, 0 < Ratio < 1).We identified the top 50 most significantly differentially expressed genes (selected as showing the smallest p-value when comparing 2 h SMG to 1G control) in each condition, which are presented in Supplementary Figure S3. Nassef et al. used true microgravity (10-2 G) in parabolic flight to show that the expression of genes related to the cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix and chemokines is affected in breast epithelial cells exposed to true microgravity [14]. Thus, this study provides some specific genes as well as broad classes of potential genes of interest. We, therefore, closely compared the response of the individual genes in the Nassef et al. study with their responses in our study (Supplementary Table S10). Even though we did not see similar response in any of these genes after 2 h exposure to SMG, we found that TIMP1, SERPINE1 and RDX genes were differentially regulated after 20 h SMG exposure, similar to those reported in the Nassef study in cells after experiencing 31 parabolas. The differences in gene expression may be due to the alternating hypergravity and microgravity phases experienced during each parabola. However, in our 2 h SMG data, we did see changes in genes reflecting the broad classes of gene families reported by Nassef et al. Thus, in GFP-KDEL expressing cells, 2 h SMG led to the modulation of genes associated with the cytoskeleton (e.g., KRT85, TUBA1A), the extracellular matrix (TIMP3, SERPINF2), and chemokine response (CXCL3). These genes are highlighted in Figure 2A,B. To infer whether the LINC complex might play a role in regulating the expression of any of these genes in SMG, we compared their levels in the GFP-KDEL controls to those where the LINC complex was disrupted by SUN1L-KDEL expression. We predicted that genes for which the LINC function played a role in regulating their expression under SMG conditions would show one of several patterns of response. Thus, SMG-responsive genes for which the change in transcript level is LINC-dependent might show alteration in expression in SMG in the GFP KDEL control cells but lose this responsiveness to SMG in the SUN1L KDEL lines. Some genes might show responsiveness to SMG in the control cells but show a significantly larger or smaller change in the LINC-disrupted case, implying a role of the LINC complex in the degree of repression or activation of expression. Additionally, some genes may show no differential expression in SMG when comparing GFP KDEL cells in SMG to their 1G controls, but these genes would show differential expression in the LINC-disrupted SUN1L KDEL expressing cells. In this latter case, normal gene expression homeostasis would require LINC action, and in the LINC-disrupted cells, this regulation would be lost. Loss of this control would lead to either up- or down-regulation of their transcription, specifically in SMG, revealing a further layer of LINC-dependency to their normal transcriptional regulation under SMG conditions. Indeed, our analysis shows that the differential expression of some of these genes in SMG appears to depend on an intact LINC complex. For example, the cytoskeletal element keratin (KRT85) was upregulated by 2.13-fold in SMG in GFP-KDEL cells, but there was no significant difference in its expression levels in LINC-disrupted SUN1L-KDEL cells exposed to equivalent SMG treatment. Similarly, the chemokine response marker CXCL3 (C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 3) was downregulated 1.4-fold in GFP-KDEL, but this gene lost its sensitivity to SMG in SUN1L-KDEL cells. In contrast, the LINC disruption using SUN1L-KDEL resulted in the decreased expression (5.65-fold) of KRT83 (another cytoskeletal gene belonging to the keratin family), whereas this gene did not alter due to SMG in GFP-KDEL cells. Furthermore, the ECM gene (COL12A1) showed no significant difference in GFP-KDEL cells but was upregulated by 1.22-fold in the SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells. Thus, the LINC complex appears to play roles in normally inducing some genes, while repressing other genes in response to SMG and in maintaining homeostatic control of other genes under SMG conditions. To elucidate the role of the LINC in differential gene expression, we used an interaction model between transcriptional changes seen in SUN1L-KDEL and GFP-KDEL expressing cells with and without SMG exposure. The interaction effect is described in Figure 2E where the relative fold changes between SMG and 1G in GFP-KDEL and SUN1L-KDEL samples at 2 h are compared statistically. The majority of the LINC-dependent genes reversed their direction of change upon LINC disruption (Ratio < 0). For example, the FSIP2 gene was significantly down-regulated in GFP-KDEL cells in SMG. However, the change in expression level of this gene reversed in SUN1L-KDEL cells, with a significant upregulation. Similarly, CAGE1, a gene widely associated with cancer [26] was significantly upregulated in the GFP-KDEL cells, while it was significantly downregulated in SUN1L-KDEL cells illustrating an opposite pattern of response of the gene FSIP2 to LINC disruption. In addition to these genes, we identified genes whose sensitivity to SMG was lost (0 < Ratio < 1) and genes which gained such sensitivity (Ratio > 1) upon LINC disruption. For example, ARL14EP and ID1 are the genes which were significantly differentially expressed in GFP-KDEL cells exposed to 2h of SMG but were not altered in SUN1L-KDEL cells exposed to SMG, implying that these genes lost their sensitivity to SMG upon LINC disruption. On the other hand, PER3 and OSCP1 genes were not affected by SMG in GFP-KDEL cells but were significantly differentially expressed in SUN1L-KDEL cells exposed to 2 h of SMG. The results both imply that the LINC complex is required to maintain transcriptional homeostasis of some genes in the presence of SMG and that an intact mechanical nucleo-cytoskeletal linkage may mediate response to SMG and to regulate subsequent differential gene expression of other genes. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) signaling pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that in GFP-KDEL cells exposed to 2 h of SMG, six pathways were enriched, while a larger number of pathways were enriched only in the SUN1L-KDEL cells under the same conditions (Figure 3A). We next used the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to perform gene ontology analysis. The MSigDB is a curated set of annotated gene sets which can be analyzed by Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) to determine if any genes in a particular curated set (pathway, biological state, cellular locale etc.) are enriched in a genome-wide expression analysis using a ranked set of genes [27,28]. Pathway analysis of the GFP-KDEL cells in SMG for the MSigDB GSVA GO biological process dataset revealed enrichment in genes related to microtubule-based movement, the reproductive process and negative regulation of catalytic activity (Supplementary Figure S5b). A similar analysis for cellular components revealed that terms relating to nuclear specks and the kinetochore were significantly enriched (Supplementary Figure S5a). A greater number of significantly enriched GO pathways were identified in the SMG SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells, including many biological processes related to mechanoresponse systems such as: cell matrix adhesion, regulation of cell migration and negative regulation of cell migration (Supplementary Figure S5b). GO pathway analysis of cellular components revealed enrichment related to the mitochondrion, actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion. Some of the LINC-dependent GO cellular component pathways for mechanosensing identified by the interaction effect were mitochondrion, cell junction, intercellular junction, tight junction, kinetochore and nuclear specks (Supplementary Figure S5c).

LINC Dependency of SMG-Induced Changes in Gene Expression Is Also Determined by the Duration of Exposure to SMG After 20 h in SMG, the GFP-KDEL cells had a larger number of genes that were significantly differentially expressed compared to the 2 h condition. Additionally, there was an even larger number of differentially expressed genes in SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells (1279 upregulated, 1542 downregulated, p ≤ 0.05) than the GFP-KDEL cells (813 upregulated, 846 downregulated, ≤0.05) after 20 h (Figure 2C,D, Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). In GFP-KDEL cells, the levels of expression of several genes associated with cytokines and chemokines were significantly altered, including the VEGFA gene. While the focal adhesion associated genes TLN2 and SERPINE1 (involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and spreading) were upregulated, the ECM genes TIMP3 and LAMA5 were down-regulated. The expression of the NE gene encoding for nesprin-3 (SYNE3) showed a significant decrease in expression (Figure 2C). We identified the genes whose expression depended on the duration of exposure to SMG by assessing the interaction effect between GFP-KDEL transcriptional changes at 2 and 20 h (Supplementary Table S7). We also identified the unique genes and pathways that depend on the LINC complex to potentially mechanosense the gravitational forces in SMG after 20 h by evaluating the interaction effect between SUN1L-KDEL and GFP-KDEL transcriptional changes at 20 h (Figure 2F, Supplementary Figure S3F, Supplementary Table S6). All the above-mentioned genes were differentially expressed in SMG-treated SUN1-KDEL cells, in a similar fashion to GFP-KDEL, implying that they were not dependent on the LINC complex, with the notable exception of TIMP3. In contrast, MMP19 (encodes a collagenase related to ECM dynamics), which was not responsive to SMG in GFP-KDEL cells, gained responsiveness upon LINC complex disruption. Similarly, the chemokine gene CXCL16 was also modulated differently in SMG-treated SUN1-KDEL cells compared to the expression in GFP KDEL cells (Figure 2C,D). We also identified the genes in SUN1L-KDEL cells that were dependent on the duration of exposure to SMG by assessing the interaction effect between SUN1L-KDEL transcriptional changes at 2 and 20 h (Supplementary Table S8). More KEGG pathways were enriched in GFP-KDEL cells after 20 h in SMG when compared to the effects of 2 h exposure (Figure 3A,B). For example, the cell cycle pathway was enriched in the differentially expressed transcripts in GFP-KDEL cells exposed to SMG for 20 h, whereas it was not affected in cells exposed for 2 h. In the SUN1-KDEL cells, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton was highlighted in the KEGG analysis, as were pathways associated with adhesion, such as focal adhesion, cell adhesion molecules and tight junction, implying alteration in the systems mediating cell-to-matrix and cell-to-cell contacts in SMG. The DNA replication mismatch repair pathway was also enriched, which may be linked to alterations in various cancer associated pathways/processes highlighted as being differentially regulated in the data (bladder cancer, melanoma, pathways in cancer, renal cell carcinoma). Altered cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathways were also seen in this analysis. Thus, the LINC complex disruption in simulated microgravity may be associated with pathways related to cancer development. We also identified the KEGG pathways that are LINC-dependent in microgravity with the interaction model. It is important to note that there were a greater number of LINC-dependent pathways that were enriched at 2 h when compared to 20 h (Figure 3C). Cluster analysis was next performed on the LINC-dependent differentially expressing genes (p ≤ 0.05) at both 2 and 20 h SMG exposure. Using the Metascape tool (www.metascape.org), pathway and process enrichment analysis was performed using KEGG Functional Sets, KEGG Pathway, in this approach, network and clusters were developed based on the enrichment with p ≤ 0.01 and with a minimum count of 3. In Figure 4A, the top 20 clusters are shown with each node color coded based on the cluster it belongs to. Each node represents an enriched term as detailed in Supplementary Table S9. From the pie chart representation of each node (Figure 4B), we can see that clusters 1, 2 and 5 had all the nodes enriched for both the LINC-dependent 2 and 20 h SMG exposure conditions. Interestingly, Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 comprised enriched terms all related to the mitochondrian as listed in Figure 4C. Previous studies have found similar dysregulation and dysfunction of the mitochondrian in human cells exposed to simulated microgravity provided by 3-D clinostat and RPM exposures [29,30]. Our analysis clearly shows that the LINC complex may be required in regulating mitochondrion-dependent pathways and processes due to simulated microgravity at 2 and 20 h. We hypothesize that LINC may be playing a crucial role in modulating the mitochondrial response to SMG. However, more experimentation will be required to robustly test how LINC may be impacting the response of mitochondria in simulated microgravity. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Network of top 20 clusters of the enriched terms. (A) Network representing each cluster by a different color; (B) network enrichment shown with pie chart. The size of the pie in each node depends on the gene count of the two conditions. Red indicates enrichment of pathways due to LINC-dependent genes at 20 h of SMG, and blue indicates enrichment of pathways in LINC-dependent genes at 2 h of SMG. (C) Enriched terms in Clusters 1 and 2 are all linked to mitochondria.The GO pathway analysis of these data revealed that processes such as regulation of cell growth, cell activation and protein folding were enriched, alongside cellular components including the actin cytoskeleton, myosin complex, microtubule organization center and endoplasmic reticulum in GFP-KDEL cells (Supplementary Figure S6a,c). The GO analysis for of SUN1L-KDEL cells further revealed enrichment in biological processes such as response to external stimulus, response to extracellular stimulus, response to hypoxia, response to wounding and inflammatory response (Supplementary Figure S6d). The GO analysis for cellular components revealed a mix of upregulated and down-regulated processes after 20 h of SMG (Supplementary Figure S6b): for example, upregulation of actin cytoskeleton, leading edge, cell junction, tight junction and downregulation of microtubule organizing center and chromosomes. Some patterns of gene expression were consistent between responses at 2 and 20 h, including enrichment in cell adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton. The GO cellular component pathway analysis with the interaction model revealed the LINC-dependent components after 20 h in SMG mainly highlighted the tight junction, plasma membrane, intercellular junction components and mitochondrial components. The LINC-dependent GO biological pathways were also identified (Supplementary Figure S6c).3. Discussion A highly reproducible suite of effects were observed in cells exposed to altered gravity relating to the reorganization of their cytoskeleton and cell adhesion proteins [31], coupled with changes in the morphologies of the cells, including their nuclei. There is a close link between nuclear shape and the cytoskeleton, with various cytoskeletal elements playing roles in regulating nuclear shape and position. Thus, actin polymerization flattens the nucleus and repositions it by pulling on it. Additionally, forces generated by microtubule motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin, and acto-myosin contractile and tensile forces are also transmitted to the nuclear surface. Intermediate filaments also form a cage-like structure around the nucleus giving it structural stability. Each of these elements are mechanically connected to the nucleus through LINC complex proteins. The mechanical integration afforded by these connections through the LINC complex plays a critical role in transferring mechanical signals from the ECM and the forces generated within the cytoplasm to the nucleus [32]. These signals regulate features such as nuclear shape, homeostatic position and rotation—all important elements for nuclear functioning. Therefore, not surprisingly, the LINC complex is important for an array of normal cellular functions such as migration, division, proliferation, differentiation and wound healing [33]. Consistent with these ideas of a central role of the LINC complex in mechanical signaling, there are also major LINC-associated diseases such as nuclear envelopathies, laminopathy, skeletal muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. Abnormal regulation of LINC complex genes SUN1, SUN2 and nesprin 2 is also seen in breast cancer. Several LINC-associated proteins such as SUN1, SUN2, Emerins and Nesprin-3 were seen to be differentially regulated in cancer cells exposed to simulated microgravity [13]. Indeed, SMG promotes breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion, nuclear positioning, as well as cell cycle progression, apoptosis [22] and abnormal expression of cancer inducing cytokines [14]. The LINC complex is known to play a very important role in the normal formation and development of breast cell acinus and in regulating the shape of the cell and the nucleus in both the breast cell culture of single cells and of monolayers [24]. Thus, understanding how SMG affects these cellular processes holds potential for both understanding how gravitational forces might be playing roles in normal tissue development on Earth and in revealing potential practical issues and risks related to long duration spaceflight. In the present study, we looked at breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A) in SMG with and without LINC disruption. We discovered that the changes in nuclear shape seen after 2 h and 20 h exposures to SMG depend on the LINC complex. Previous studies have shown that both the shape of cells and their nuclei are impacted by altered gravity environments [34], and our studies now provide evidence that this effect depends on a functional LINC complex. Thus, after 2 h in SMG, LINC disruption leads to a lack of nuclear shape change normally observed in cells with intact LINC function. After 20 h in SMG, the response reverses in direction, with the nucleus rounding up compared to flatter nuclei in cells with an intact LINC complex. As discussed earlier, the cytoskeleton reorganizes in microgravity, with disruption of the microtubule network, and a so-called ‘loosening’ of the cytokeratin network around the nucleus, and this may be the reason for the rounding up of the nucleus (increased nuclear height and decrease in x-y area) in GFP-KDEL control cells exposed to 2 h of SMG. We hypothesize that, as in SUN1L-KDEL cells, the cytoskeleton is not mechanically connected to the nuclear surface, and so such SMG-induced changes in the cytoskeleton are not able to affect the nuclear shape. After 20 h in SMG, however, the nuclear height decreased, and the x-y nuclear area increased in GFP-KDEL cells compared to the cells in 1G. This observation can be explained by the increase in cell area reported in both simulated microgravity and true microgravity experiments conducted for long durations, and that the cell shape is inextricably linked to the nuclear shape, i.e., cell spreading is driving nuclear “flattening” [24,35,36,37]. On the other hand, the SUN1L-KDEL cells showed an increase in nuclear height under the same conditions, consistent with the idea of a loss of cytoskeletal interactions that normally pull on the periphery of the nuclear envelope. It has been reported previously that the response of cell morphology to calibrated physical external stimulus in LINC disrupted cells is different when compared to the cells with intact LINC complex function [1,2]. Therefore, we may expect the nuclear morphology in the LINC-disrupted cells to also respond to the longer duration SMG very differently to the control GFP-KDEL cells. Despite these time-dependent effects, our analysis shows that both at 2 and 20 h SMG exposure times, the LINC complex plays a role in the nuclear shaping mechanism. These results support the idea that the mechanosensitivity of the nuclear shape to external stimuli strongly depends on the SUN1-Nesprin linkage in the nuclear envelope provided by the LINC complex [3]. We also looked at the role of the LINC complex in differential gene expression in response to SMG, revealing that there are LINC-dependent genes that are up- and down-regulated in response to SMG. We hypothesize that the nuclear shape regulation and gene expression dependency on the LINC complex are inter-related. Thus, gene activity depends on the location of the chromosome and its packing inside the nucleus [38], e.g., chromosome territories are positioned differently and have different interactions in breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A) compared to corresponding malignant cells (MCF 10CA1a), supporting different patterns of gene expression [39]. Nuclear shape and rigidity depends on the packing of the heterochromatin [40] and changes in nuclear shape may in turn feedback to change the level of chromatin condensation [41]. Therefore, it is highly likely that patterns of gene expression depend to some degree on nuclear shape [4,42]. The LINC complex connects the cytoskeleton to the nuclear surface; the SUN proteins in the inner nuclear envelope are connected to lamins, which are connected to chromatin. Thus, the LINC complex provides a strong candidate for linking cellular level mechanical forces to changes in nuclear gene expression. For example, interfering with the LINC complex in plant cells led to decondensation of chromocenters and silencing of transcription [43]. Hence, the LINC complex may impact gene expression in two ways: (1) by directly affecting chromatin compaction; (2) by regulating the shape of the nucleus, and both mechanisms may be in play once cells move from the 1G to a microgravity environment. It is important to note that there are changes in cell physiology just with time growing in culture. For example, Seaman et al. have found that the nuclear morphology changes significantly over time in cultured human primary fibroblast cells [44]. Indeed, in our data both the GFP-KDEL and SUN1L-KDEL cells at 1G (Table 1) show expected decrease in nuclear area and increase in nuclear height when comparing data from 2 h and 20 h in culture. In most cell types, the shape of the nucleus depends mainly on factors such as the shape of the cell, cytoskeleton organization, and external adhesions such as cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion [3,24,45]. Studies with human breast epithelial cells found that the shape of the nucleus is controlled by the shape of the cell [24]. Also, fibroblast cell nuclei are flatter in cells with larger spreading area than in lesser spread cells [37]. The dynamic actin cap flattens the nucleus while actomyosin contractile forces pull on the nucleus regulating its volume and the gross morphology [2,46,47]. Intermediate filaments also wrap the nucleus like a cage and act as a passive network that transmits active forces from myosin motor proteins thereby playing a significant role in controlling the nuclear volume [3,46,47]. While active motor forces and changes in lamellipodia and filopodial formation occur during cell migration [48,49], cell polarization [50], cell division [51,52] and development [53]. Each of these processes are dynamic and require regular nuclear positioning and shaping which in turn depend on the cell shape and cytoskeletal organization over time to carry on with normal cell functions. These observations suggest physiological changes occurring in the cells with time in culture indeed have the potential to affect the nuclear shape in addition to any nuclear morphological changes mediated by SMG. Both the GFP-KDEL and the SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells showed similar culture time-related effects, with e.g., nuclear shape changing in an identical fashion when comparing the 2 h and 20 h treatments at 1G. Therefore, to better control the physiological changes along the culture time, we particularly evaluated the differences between nuclear shape and patterns of gene expression in SUN1L-KDEL expressing cells relative to the paired GFP-KDEL control at the same duration in culture under 1G or SMG. Comparing the SMG responses in the SUN1L-KDEL cells to the paired SMG-treated GFP-KDEL controls at the same time-point helps remove these culture time-related effects to focus on the effects of SMG exposure. Cancer is a leading cause of death around the world and with an ever-increasing range and duration of deep space exploration missions, astronauts are at a potentially elevated risk of developing this disease. For decades, cells have been studied in altered gravity environments using various platforms such as the International Space Station, sounding rockets, parabolic flights and microgravity simulators. Common cell functions such as proliferation, migration, division and differentiation are all affected differently in altered gravity environments [13,36,54,55]. Genes associated with the progression of cancer by metastasis (cytokines) are also differentially regulated in microgravity as are several other genes related to wound healing, focal adhesion [13], and growth factors. However, our analysis suggests a complex pattern of gene expression responses in microgravity in relation to the LINC complex. We discovered genes that are LINC-dependent in SMG that are associated with different types of cancer. For example, we found the gene RBMS3 to be significantly upregulated in a LINC-dependent manner in response to 2 h of SMG. This gene acts in a defense mechanism against breast and other types of cancer, and upregulation of this gene can suppress cancer or tumor progression [56]. Overexpression of the SRA1 gene is also associated with breast, ovarian, prostate, lung and liver cancer [57]. In our study, we found that SRA1 gene expression is sensitive to SMG. However, although the LINC-dependent SMG responsiveness of, e.g., RBMS3 remained at 20 h of SMG, it was lost for the SRA1 gene. These observations suggest an interplay of signaling and time in the LINC mediated modulation of these genes in response to SMG, and to potential effects on cancer development. In conclusion, we discovered that the LINC complex plays an important role in regulating nuclear morphology in breast epithelial cells exposed to SMG. We identified a series of LINC-dependent SMG responsive genes, where the spectrum of changes depend on how long the cells are exposed to SMG. Using KEGG and GO analysis, we found that pathways and processes associated with the cell cycle, the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion were the most affected upon LINC disruption in SMG. Taken together, our results imply that the mechanical forces on a cell imposed through altered gravity are likely acting through LINC complex-related transduction events to modulate both nuclear shape and patterns of gene expression, especially of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and other mechanical features of the cell. These results provide insight into a potentially important element of transcriptional control on Earth and highlight a potential risk factor for long duration spaceflight. Further studies using both true and simulated microgravity need to be performed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind LINC in cellular sensing and the response to microgravity.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture Human breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A from ATCC), MCF 10A SS-GFP-KDEL and MCF 10A SS-GFP-SUN1L-KDEL cells (created by Dr. Tanmay Lele and Dr. Kyle Roux [21,25]) were a kind gift to us. The inducible cell lines were created with MCF 10A TET-ON (Clontech) transduced retrovirally with pRetroX-Tight.puro containing either SS-HA-GFP-SUN1L-KDEL for LINC disruption or SS-HA-GFP-KDEL for controls [25]. To create a stable line, cell selection was performed with 0.5 μg/mL puromycin and then screened by immunofluorescence postinduction with or without 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 18 h. The cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA) without phenol red, supplemented with 5% (w/v) horse serum, cholera toxin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO USA), epidermal growth factor (Peprotech, Cranbury, NJ, USA), hydrocortisone (Sigma), insulin (Sigma) and penicillin streptomycin (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% (v/v) CO2 incubating chamber. The inducible cells were trypsinized and seeded in fibronectin coated chamber flasks with 30% confluency and cultured for 24 h. To induce SUN1L-KDEL for LINC disruption and GFP-KDEL for control comparison, the media were supplemented with 1 µg/mL doxycycline [21]. These cells were cultured in doxycycline for 24 h before placing them on the 3-D clinostat. 4.2. Simulated Microgravity Using 3-D Clinostat The chamber flasks were filled completely with media containing 1 µg/mL doxycycline (Fisher) and care taken to remove all the bubbles that may cause shear stress to the cell monolayer. The chamber flask was sealed with a rubber stopper, and a syringe was used to release any excess pressure. The 3-D clinostat (Gravite, Space Bio Laboratories Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan) consisting of two perpendicular rotating axes was run in Mode C preprogrammed with an inbuilt computer and gravity acceleration sensor to measure simulate microgravity (to the order of 10−3 G) by rotating the inner and outer frame simultaneously at a constant angular velocity (~2 rotations per minute) [58,59,60]. Four cell culture flasks on slides (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA, 170920) were mounted at the center and were placed in a controlled environment maintaining the temperature at 37 °C for 2 and 20 h. The 1G control samples were placed in the same incubator. All the experiments were conducted twice, and each experiment had two sets of samples in both 1G and SMG conditions. A Student’s t-test was applied for statistical comparison for nuclear morphology.4.3. Immunostaining and Microscopy After the cells were exposed to simulated microgravity for fixed periods of time, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then washed with PBS. To stain for F-actin, 1:50 Alex Fluor 594 phalloidin was used and for the nucleus, 1:250 Hoechst 33,342 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used. Cells were then incubated for 20 min at room temperature before washing with PBS. The cells were then imaged with the 60×/1.40 NA oil immersion objective of a Nikon A1R laser scanning inverted confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). To immunostain for the Nesprin-2 protein, we followed the protocol of Zhang et al. [21] and used the primary antibody anti-Nesprin-2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, ab204308) at a 1:100 dilution and the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA, A-11037) at a 1:200 dilution. Z-stack images were acquired for the cells with 0.3 µM height intervals. The images were reconstructed using the Nikon NIS elements software, and maximum intensity profiles for the nucleus were created for the x-z view. The full width half maximum (FWHM) technique in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) was used to acquire the nuclear height measurement. The maximum intensity projection of the x-y view of the nucleus was used to measure the nuclear area using the ImageJ software.4.4. RNA seq Library Preparation, Sequencing and Data Analysis Approximately 2 × 106 cells were frozen in 700 µL of QIAzol buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The samples were immediately vortexed and placed on ice before storing at −80 °C. Once all samples were collected, they were randomized, and total RNA was extracted and purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit, following recommended procedures, with on-column DNase treatment. Libraries were prepared from purified RNA (0.3 ng) using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Globin (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Three runs of 75 bp paired-end sequencing were performed on pooled libraries using the Illumina NextSeq 550 System. Quality control of purified RNA and RNA libraries was carried out using the Fragment Analyzer System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Raw DE multiplexed fastq paired end read files were trimmed of adapters and filtered using the program skewer [61] to discard any reads with an average phred quality score of less than 30, or a length of less than 36 nucleotides. Trimmed reads were then aligned using the HISAT2 aligner to the Homo sapiens  reference genome assembly version GRCh38 and sorted using SAM tools [62,63]. Aligned reads were counted and assigned to gene metafeatures using the program feature Counts as part of the Subread package [64]. These count files were imported into the R programming language and were assessed for quality control, normalized and analyzed using an in-house pipeline utilizing the edge R Bioconductor library, for differential gene expression testing, and the GSVA library, for GO and KEGG pathway analysis, utilizing their respective collections from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [28,65,66]. The GO pathway analysis shown in Supplementary Figure S5 is based on GSVA using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) GO collections, as opposed to the GO term enrichment, which does not take into account the ranking of the genes [27,28].Acknowledgments This work was supported by the NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) administered by Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and the NASA Space Biology Program.
