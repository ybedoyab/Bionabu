Copyright notice ID: 8213760 PMID: 34145277 Abstract Sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed aboard the International Space Station after 37 days of flight (RR-1 mission) and frozen carcasses returned to Earth. RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT). Spaceflight resulted in differential expression of genes in BAT consistent with increased non-shivering thermogenesis and differential expression of genes in WAT consistent with increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and β-oxidation. Subject terms: Biochemistry, Molecular biology Mice are facultative daily heterotherms and, in contrast to humans who maintain a near constant core body temperature over a wide range of environmental temperatures, mice can experience dramatic transient reductions in core temperature (torpor) when exposed to temperatures below thermoneutral1,2. Because of their small mass, mice are much more dependent on shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis for maintaining core body temperature than larger animals3. The recommended temperature for housing mice in a laboratory setting (20–26 °C) is well below their thermoneutral zone, which depending upon strain, sex and age typically ranges from 29–31 °C4. Subthermoneutral housing induces adaptive responses in mice to increase generation of heat5. These adaptations include shivering thermogenesis, non-shivering thermogenesis, thermic effect of increased food consumption and physical activity. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and the adipokine leptin are key factors involved in regulation of adaptive thermogenesis6,7. Subthermoneutral-housed mice use a variety of physiological and behavioral strategies to decrease their requirements for adaptive thermogenesis. These include entering torpor to lower core body temperature, and nest building, huddling and postural changes to minimize heat loss when exposed to a cool environment8,9. The physiological demands required for successful adaptation to subthermoneutral housing by mice are considerable; for example, female mice housed at room temperature (22 °C) consumed 40% more food to achieve comparable weight gain and expressed 5-fold higher Ucp1 gene expression in BAT (non-shivering thermogenesis) compared to thermoneutral-housed (32 °C) mice10. UCP-1 protein uncouples oxidative phosphorylation to produce heat instead of ATP. Extensive research supports the conclusion that by increasing UCP-1 protein levels, sympathetic signaling-driven non-shivering thermogenesis plays an important role in cold-induced thermoregulation in mice. We hypothesize that spaceflight reduces the ability of mice to employ some of the strategies used to minimize adaptive thermogenesis, such as huddling and postural adjustments, resulting in an increased dependence on adaptive thermogenesis to maintain core body temperature. Group housing attenuates the increase in non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT in mice exposed to a cool environment11 but it is plausible that another aspect of the spaceflight environment increases sympathetic signaling, an important positive regulator of thermogenesis. Whatever the precise mechanism, increased thermogenesis is important because it influences multiple physiological processes12–15. Collateral changes associated with increased thermogenesis include cancellous bone loss, immune suppression, increases in glucocorticoid production, increases in blood pressure and heart rate, and altered tumor and tissue response to ionizing radiation16–18. Mechanistically, at least some of these responses are mediated by increased sympathetic outflow14,19,20. Thus, activation of adaptive thermogenesis in mice housed in microgravity may introduce unrecognized and uncontrolled for confounding variables into spaceflight studies. We tested the hypothesis that nonshivering thermogenesis is increased in mice during spaceflight by measuring the effect of spaceflight on expression of genes related to energy metabolism in BAT and WAT in female C57BL/6J (B6) mice. In contrast to most prior spaceflight studies where flight animals were returned to Earth, the animals in this experiment (RR-1) were sacrificed aboard the International Space Station (ISS), avoiding the influence of restoration of normal gravitational loading. Temperatures during the spaceflight mission ranged from a low of 21.3 °C to a high of 28.0 °C. The average housing temperatures within the Habitats enclosing the mice aboard ISS were 26.0 °C and 26.4 °C for flight and ground control animals, respectively. These housing temperatures, while above temperatures commonly used to house mice, are below thermoneutral for this species. Weight gain did not differ, but activity levels were higher in the flight animals, as was food and water depletion21, findings consistent with increased adaptive thermogenesis. The effect of the spaceflight environment on differential expression of genes related to energy metabolism in BAT in flight animals is shown in Table 1. Transcript abundance of 13/84 genes were significantly altered in flight animals compared to ground controls. In particular, mice housed aboard ISS had 1.5x higher levels of Ucp-1 in BAT, providing direct evidence for elevated non-shivering thermogenesis. Several genes associated with adipogenesis and/or thermogenesis, including Adipoq, Ppargc1a, Cdkn1a22, and Cfd were differentially expressed in BAT during spaceflight23. However, these changes may reflect adaptation to long duration spaceflight. Regardless of the mechanisms for initiation, increased Ucp1-mediated thermogenesis in BAT may have had a major impact on adipose tissue turnover in WAT (Table 2). Transcript abundance of 30/84 genes were significantly altered in flight animals compared to ground controls. Notable changes, including higher expression levels for (1) Acacb (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase), a key gene in regulation of fatty acid oxidation, (2) Dio2 (Type II iodothyronine deiodinase), a key regulator of thyroid hormone action, (3) Sic2a4 (Glut 4), an insulin-regulated glucose transporter, and (4) Fasn (fatty acid synthase) which catalyzes the synthesis of palmitate, were observed in WAT of flight animals. There was also evidence for induction of Ucp-1; expression level for this gene was very low (Ct > 30) in ground control mice and consistently detected in flight mice (Ct < 30), suggesting browning of WAT24. We conclude from these findings that, in spite of comparable housing temperatures, adaptive thermogenesis is increased in BAT of mice housed aboard the ISS compared to ground controls. This is important because increased thermogenesis may exaggerate (e.g., bone loss) or alter (e.g., response to ionizing radiation) physiological responses to spaceflight in mice. Because of species specific differences in thermoregulation, this could impact the translatability of the animal studies to astronauts. Table 1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C) than in mice housed at 22°C, as are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels. We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 µg/d using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were maintained at 32°C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from ad lib mice, suggesting suppression of endogenous leptin production. In support, Ucp1 expression in BAT, percent body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib group, changes not replicated by pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. Compared to mice sacrificed at baseline (22°C), BMAT increased in ob/ob mice as well as WT mice, indicating a leptin independent response to increased temperature. However, infusion of ob/ob mice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.

    "introduction": "Introduction Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is a fat depot spatially confined within the skeleton. The resident adipocytes are derived primarily from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. As reviewed (1–4), BMAT differs from other adipose depots in that the density and spatial distribution of adipocytes can vary dramatically within and among bones and adipocytes are interspersed among many other cell populations, including hematopoietic lineage cells. The function and regulation of BMAT is incompletely understood but has received considerable recent attention, particularly in regard to its role as a potential regulator of bone metabolism (5, 6). In rodents, conditions such as diet-induced obesity, chronic heavy alcohol consumption, severe caloric restriction and microgravity have been reported to result in increased BMAT. Notably, the same conditions are often associated with decreased osteoblast differentiation and/or activity, and bone loss (7–10). Mechanistically, some investigators have hypothesized that differentiation to adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts and/or production of adipocyte-derived adipokines lead to a negative bone turnover balance (11, 12). However, a negative relationship between BMAT levels and osteoblasts is far from universal (6, 13–15) and, when the relationship occurs, causality has not been established. In total, the experimental evidence to date does not strongly support a deterministic model where reducing BMAT will invariably lead to increased bone mass (1). Mice are commonly used as a mammalian model organism, in part because of their diminutive size, relatively short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulation. However, skeletal adaptations do not scale linearly with body size (16). In addition to being physically small, mice are daily facultative heterotherms and have a thermoneutral zone that is much higher than in humans (17). One outcome of this difference in thermoregulation is that mice housed at room temperature (~22°C) experience cold stress. Adaptation to chronic cold stress is recognized to have profound physiological effects that influence disease processes (18, 19). In contrast to larger rodents and humans, male and female mice lose cancellous bone in femur and lumbar vertebra well before growth has ceased (20). We have shown that cold stress induced by room temperature housing contributes to, and may be fully responsible for, premature cancellous bone loss in mice. Additionally, cold stress in growing mice results in compartment-specific reductions in bone accrual, reduced leptin levels, and decreased accrual of BMAT (21, 22). There is strong circumstantial evidence that the adipokine leptin is an important negative regulator of BMAT in mice (23). Compared to C57BL/6J (B6) wild type (WT) mice, bone growth and turnover are lower and BMAT higher in long bones of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (24–28). Furthermore, treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin by either intracerebroventricular or subcutaneous delivery normalizes bone growth and turnover and reduces BMAT levels (23, 25, 29, 30). On the other hand, there are circumstances where elevated leptin is associated with increased BMAT. For example, compared to mice housed at 22°C, housing B6 female mice at 32°C results in increases in serum leptin and BMAT (31). Additionally, high blood leptin levels in obese rodents are associated with increased BMAT (32). These discrepant findings, where higher levels of leptin can be associated with either increases or decreases in BMAT, suggest that environmental temperature has actions on BMAT that do not require leptin. To better understand the role of leptin as a potential mediator of the response of BMAT to changes in environmental temperature, we performed 2 experiments where we measured BMAT 2 weeks following transfer of mice housed at room temperature (22°C) to near thermoneutral (32°C) housing. It is challenging to house mice at true thermoneutral because the thermoneutral point differs by several degrees between the dark and light photo periods (33). However, a constant temperature of 30-32°C approximates the midrange of thermoneutrality and was shown to prevent cold stress-induced cancellous bone loss in male and female mice as well as result in increased BMAT in female mice (21). In the first experiment, we supplemented 6-week-old female B6 WT mice with leptin, administered for 2 weeks using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump, at 10 µg/d. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food consumption of leptin-supplemented mice. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 WT, leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of treatment.",

Food intake (panel A) decreased over time in all groups; leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice consumed less food/day than ad lib-fed mice until day 7, after which food consumption did not differ among groups. Cumulative food intake (panel B) was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice. Body mass did not differ among treatment groups at any time point evaluated, including at termination of treatment (panel C). However, body mass change over the 14 days of treatment (panel D) was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice and tended (p = 0.06) to be lower in leptin-supplemented compared to pair-fed mice. Normalized body mass relative to baseline body mass was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice at all time points evaluated (panel E and F). Percent body fat (panel G) and WAT mass (panel H) were lower in leptin-supplemented mice than in ad lib or pair-fed mice. Significant differences in percent body fat or WAT mass were not detected between ad lib and pair-fed mice. Serum leptin levels (panel I) did not differ among treatment groups. Ucp1 expression in BAT (panel J) was lower in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ab lib and pair-fed mice. Significant differences in Ucp1 expression were not detected between ab lib and pair-fed mice. Figure 2.

Bone area (panel A) was higher in leptin-supplemented mice compared to both ad lib and pair-fed mice. Bone mineral content (panel B) was also higher in leptin-supplemented mice than in pair-fed mice. Significant differences in bone area or bone mineral content were not detected between ad lib and pair-fed mice. In addition, significant differences in bone mineral density (panel C) were not detected with treatment. Serum CTX (panel D) was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice but leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from pair-fed mice. Serum osteocalcin levels (panel E) did not differ among groups. Figure 3.

Significant differences in bone area/tissue area in the distal femur metaphysis (panel A) were not detected with treatment. However, mineralizing perimeter (panel B) was lower in pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice and leptin-supplemented mice, and mineral apposition rate (panel C) was higher in leptin-supplemented mice than in ad lib mice and pair-fed mice. Bone formation rate (panel D) tended (p = 0.053) to be higher in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib and was higher compared to pair-fed mice. Bone formation rate was lower in pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice. Adipocyte area fraction (panel E) and adipocyte density (panel F) were lower in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib and pair-fed mice whereas adipocyte size (panel G) did not differ between ad lib and leptin-supplemented mice but was higher in pair-fed mice compared to both ad lib and leptin-supplemented mice. The differences in BMAT among the treatment groups in the distal femur metaphysis can be readily appreciated in panel H. Treatment effects on BMAT were likewise observed in the distal femur diaphysis. Adipocyte area fraction (panel I), density (panel J) and size (panel K) were lower or tended to be lower in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib and pair-fed mice. However, differences in marrow adiposity were not detected between ad lib and pair-fed mice. Figure 4.

In abdominal WAT, 8/84 genes were differentially expressed in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib mice, 3/84 genes were differentially expressed in pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice, and 7/84 genes were differentially expressed in leptin-supplemented mice compared to pair-fed mice. In tibia, 14/84 genes were differentially expressed in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib mice, 32/84 genes were differentially expressed in pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice, and 17/84 genes were differentially expressed in leptin-supplemented mice compared to pair-fed mice.

Experiment 2: Effects of leptin on body composition and bone marrow adiposity in leptin-deficient ob/ob female mice The effects (1) of increasing housing temperature on body composition and BMAT in WT and ob/ob mice and (2) of leptin treatment on body composition and BMAT in ob/ob mice housed at 32°C are shown in Figure 7 . Percent body fat (panel A) and abdominal WAT mass (panel B) increased in WT mice and increased (percent fat) or tended (p = 0.064) to increase (abdominal WAT) in ob/ob mice following transfer from room temperature (baseline, 22°C) to thermoneutral housing (32°C). Leptin treatment in ob/ob mice resulted in lower percent body fat but had no effect on abdominal WAT mass. As expected, Ucp1 expression in BAT (panel C) decreased in WT mice following transfer to thermoneutral housing while thermoneutral housing had no effect on Ucp1 expression in the ob/ob mice. Administration of leptin to ob/ob mice resulted in higher Ucp1 expression compared to administration of vehicle. Adipocyte area fraction (panel D), adipocyte density (panel E) and adipocyte size (panel F) increased in both WT and ob/ob mice following transfer to thermoneutral housing. Leptin treatment in ob/ob mice resulted in lower adipocyte area fraction and adipocyte density compared to vehicle. Significant differences in adipocyte size were not detected with leptin treatment in the ob/ob mice. Figure 7.

    "discussion": "Discussion Food consumption decreased in B6 mice following transfer from room temperature to thermoneutral housing in this and prior studies (21, 22). The time course for reduced food consumption was advanced (i.e., occurred earlier) but the magnitude of the decrease was not influenced by leptin supplementation. Compared to ad lib mice, supplementation of B6 mice with leptin had no effect on serum leptin levels measured at necropsy but resulted in lower BAT Ucp1 expression, lower serum CTX, lower abdominal WAT and lower BMAT in metaphysis and diaphysis of the distal femur, and higher bone formation rate in distal femur metaphysis. Pair feeding did not closely replicate the effects of leptin supplementation on B6 mice housed at thermoneutral. Transfer of ob/ob mice from room temperature to thermoneutral resulted in higher abdominal WAT and higher BMAT in distal femur. Finally, treatment of ob/ob mice with low dose leptin reduced the increase in BMAT in distal femur following transfer to thermoneutral housing but did not impact abdominal WAT weight. In the present study, we observed a reciprocal relationship between bone formation rate (increased) and BMAT levels (decreased) in distal femur of B6 mice following leptin supplementation. We and others noted inverse relationships between bone formation and BMAT at various skeletal sites during aging and in response to hypophysectomy, spaceflight, ionizing radiation, high fat diets and chronic heavy alcohol consumption (7–10, 14, 23, 39–42). However, as mentioned in the Introduction, a causal association between changes in BMAT levels and bone formation rate has not been demonstrated and there are numerous exceptions to this reciprocal relationship. For example, ovariectomy (ovx) in rats results in increases in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter as well as BMAT, as does increasing housing temperature of mice from room temperature to the thermoneutral range (43). Furthermore, BMAT was increased and bone formation unchanged in ovx rats following a 14-day spaceflight (39). Finally, treatment with the bone anabolic hormones fibroblast growth factor or parathyroid hormone increased bone formation in rodents without reducing BMAT (14, 44). It remains uncertain as to whether BMAT alters the skeletal response to regulatory factors such as hormones and mechanical loads. Compared to B6 WT mice, adult ob/ob mice have higher BMAT levels. However, hindlimb unloading resulted in cancellous bone loss and changes in bone turnover in ob/ob mice indistinguishable from the skeletal response in B6 WT mice (45). Female mice housed at thermoneutral have higher BMAT and cancellous bone mass than female mice housed at room temperature but antagonizing accrual of BMAT by treatment with the nonspecific β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol had minimal effect on bone mass, microarchitecture and turnover (31). Additionally, in spite of differences in BMAT, inflammation-induced bone loss was similar in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at room temperature and at thermoneutral (46). The receptor tyrosine kinase cKit is required for fat storage in long bones and lumbar vertebra of mice (47, 48). Therefore, attenuation of cKit signaling provides a novel approach for investigating the regulation and function of BMAT. Results of studies performed in cKit-deficient KitW/Wv mice do not exclude the possibility that BMAT influences bone metabolism but do demonstrate that mature bone marrow adipocytes are not required for a negative bone turnover balance following ovx or during simulated microgravity (43, 49). Indeed, having normal BMAT levels appeared to attenuate bone loss in distal femur induced by simulated microgravity (49). A limitation of KitW/Wv mice is that they have hereditary macrocytic anemia, which could independently influence bone metabolism or alternatively modify the effects of BMAT (50, 51). However, adoptive transfer of purified WT (WBB6F1/J) hematopoietic stem cells into KitW/Wv mice (WT→ KitW/Wv) normalized bone marrow Kit expression (52). Hindlimb unloading resulted in reduced cancellous bone in WT→ KitW/Wv mice verifying that the BMAT-deficient mice are not protected against hindlimb unloading-induced cancellous bone loss (49). Taken together, factors such as ckit signaling, mechanical loading, leptin status, sex hormones and aging clearly influence BMAT levels but strong evidence that BMAT is an obligatory regulator of bone turnover balance is largely absent. These null results do not imply that BMAT is unimportant; there is compelling evidence that BMAT plays a role in regulated hematopoiesis (1, 53–55). Also, marrow adipocytes produce hormones, adipokines and cytokines capable of positive as well as negative effects on bone metabolism (1, 56–60). In the present study, leptin and pair feeding influenced expression of genes for adipokines (Lep), hormones and growth factors (Fgf2, Fgf10, Agt, Angpt2, Bmp2, Bmp7, Dlk1), cell cycle regulators (Ccnd1, Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b), nuclear hormone receptors (Ppard, Pparg), transcription factors (Jun, Nrob2, Twist1, E2f1, Hes1, Srebf1), and signaling pathways (Sfrp1, Sfrp5, Vdr, Wnt10b, Dkk1, Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Kfl2, Insr, Irs1). These changes in gene expression in bone marrow may lead to local, systemic or neuronal actions to influence bone metabolism, but definitive evidence for this is lacking. Leptin supplementation (Experiment 1) did not result in an increase in serum leptin levels in B6 mice, when measured at necropsy. We interpret this as evidence that supplemental leptin resulted in a compensatory reduction in endogenous hormone production and an increase in leptin sensitivity. Our conclusion is supported by the observed lower abdominal WAT weight and BAT Ucp1 expression in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib or pair-fed mice and lower BMAT in leptin-supplemented B6 WT as well as leptin-treated ob/ob mice. Down regulation of Lep expression in adipocytes is a potential alternative mechanism to decrease serum leptin levels and there is evidence that this mechanism is induced by hypothalamic leptin gene therapy (61). However, this alternative mechanism is unlikely because reduced abdominal WAT in the present study was not accompanied by a reduction in Lep expression. It is notable that the reduction in BMAT accrual in leptin-treated ob/ob mice was not accompanied by a parallel decrease in abdominal WAT. This suggests that leptin inhibits BMAT accrual at much lower levels than is required to inhibit WAT accrual, a conclusion supported by dose-response studies where leptin was administered to ob/ob mice (35). Indeed, administration of leptin at a dose rate of 0.3 μg/d did not increase serum leptin levels above the detection limit of 0.5 μg/ml. Food consumption was lower in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib-fed mice for several days following osmotic pump insertion, but afterwards there was no difference in food intake among treatment groups. We interpret this as further evidence that growing mice fed a normal diet are highly leptin sensitive. In support, partially leptin-deficient heterozygote ob/+ mice adapt to partial leptin deficiency by increasing adipose tissue mass until achieving leptin levels similar to B6 WT mice (62). Treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin resulted in dose-dependent decreases in appetite (35, 63). This finding contrasts with B6 mice fed a high fat diet; when treated with leptin, obese mice exhibit an attenuated response, attributable to leptin resistance (64). Sympathetic signaling is a positive regulator of non-shivering thermogenesis and the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blunted thermoneutral-associated increases in BMAT and WAT (65). Thus, leptin and environmental temperature may influence BMAT levels by regulating overlapping pathways. However, it is likely that the actions of leptin on BMAT differ from the adipokine’s positive central nervous system-mediated regulatory effects on non-shivering thermogenesis. It is well established that adipocytes express leptin receptors (54, 66). Additionally, treatment with leptin at a dose rate with minimal actions on energy metabolism decreased BMAT and increased bone formation in ob/ob mice (35). In contrast, mild caloric restriction by pair feeding was associated with an increase in BMAT levels. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that leptin signaling and environmental temperature independently regulate BMAT levels. Thermoneutral housing alters many, but not all, metabolic responses (67–70). Regarding bone, compared to room temperature, thermoneutral housing prevents premature cancellous bone loss, attenuates risperidone-induced trabecular bone loss, has modest effects on cortical response to mechanical loading, and does not impact polyethylene-particle induced osteolysis (46, 71, 72). We have shown that increasing environmental temperature from room temperature to thermoneutral impacts gene expression in WAT and bone (65). In the present study, performed at thermoneutral, leptin supplementation, but not pair feeding, increased expression of genes important to fat synthesis and turnover in WAT; Acacb (Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase), Adig (adipogenin), Retn (resistin), Slc2a4 (facilitated glucose transporter member 4, GLUT4), and Srebf1 (Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1). The findings are consistent with fat mobilization in response to leptin supplementation. Leptin supplementation and pair feeding also altered gene expression in whole tibia. However, there was no overlap in genes differentially expressed in WAT and tibia. In general agreement with treatment-associated differences in bone histomorphometry, there were differences in gene expression between leptin-treated mice and pair-fed or ad lib controls. Taken together, the results suggest that these two leptin target tissues respond differently to the hormone. The present studies were performed in growing female mice and evaluated (1) distal femur metaphysis (histomorphometry), a skeletal site where BMAT is closely associated with cancellous bone undergoing rapid turnover, and (2) whole tibia (gene expression). The present studies do not include controls for age-related changes in BMAT that may have occurred during the 2-week intervention. However, we have previously reported higher levels of BMAT in female mice housed at thermoneutral compared to age-matched controls housed at room temperature and pilot studies revealed no change during the evaluated age range (31, 34). Our evaluation of one sex is a study limitation because there are sex differences in bone growth and BMAT accrual (21). Additionally, adipocyte number differs with skeletal site, suggesting possible differences in regulation and function. Future studies should evaluate the effects of environmental temperature and leptin on BMAT at multiple locations in skeletally mature and aging male and female mice. Furthermore, because energy balance and thermoregulation in mice differs markedly from humans it would be enlightening to investigate the response of BMAT to environmental temperatures in additional model organisms. Our analyses were performed at 4 levels; quantitative histomorphometry, gene expression, serum biomarkers (indices of whole-body bone turnover and fat stores) and organ mass/density. Histomorphometry examined the relationships between bone turnover and BMAT at one cancellous bone site (distal femur metaphysis) in response to treatment. Evaluation of differential expression of a panel of genes related to adipogenesis was used to compare the response to leptin in WAT and whole tibia. The tibia, in addition to adipose tissue (regulated and constitutive BMAT), contains compartment-specific distributions of bone (e.g., cortical and cancellous), cartilage, hematopoietic tissue and other tissues. Differences between our skeletal site in femur and whole tibia preclude direct comparisons between these two long bones. This being said, changes identified in a long bone are generally representative of the appendicular skeleton (1, 31, 35, 43, 47, 49, 52, 62, 65). Serum biomarkers and whole organ measurements were performed as indices of macro changes in response to treatment. In summary, increasing environmental temperature from room temperature to thermoneutral in growing female B6 and ob/ob mice has major effects on body composition, including an increase in BMAT in the distal femur metaphysis in both genotypes and an increase in leptin levels in B6 mice. Administration of leptin lowered BMAT levels in both B6 WT and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Based on these findings, we conclude that increases in leptin signaling in leptin-sensitive mice and environmental temperature in normal and leptin-deficient mice have independent but opposite effects on BMAT levels. Specifically, alleviation of cold stress by housing mice at thermoneutral increases BMAT compared to room temperature housing, whereas increasing leptin signaling decreases BMAT.",

Copyright notice ID: 9582271 PMID: 36277726 Abstract Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C) than in mice housed at 22°C, as are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels. We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 µg/d using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were maintained at 32°C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from ad lib mice, suggesting suppression of endogenous leptin production. In support, Ucp1 expression in BAT, percent body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib group, changes not replicated by pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. Compared to mice sacrificed at baseline (22°C), BMAT increased in ob/ob mice as well as WT mice, indicating a leptin independent response to increased temperature. However, infusion of ob/ob mice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice. Keywords: leptin, BMAT, thermoneutral, room temperature, marrow adipose tissue, histomorphometryIntroduction Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is a fat depot spatially confined within the skeleton. The resident adipocytes are derived primarily from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. As reviewed (1–4), BMAT differs from other adipose depots in that the density and spatial distribution of adipocytes can vary dramatically within and among bones and adipocytes are interspersed among many other cell populations, including hematopoietic lineage cells. The function and regulation of BMAT is incompletely understood but has received considerable recent attention, particularly in regard to its role as a potential regulator of bone metabolism (5, 6). In rodents, conditions such as diet-induced obesity, chronic heavy alcohol consumption, severe caloric restriction and microgravity have been reported to result in increased BMAT. Notably, the same conditions are often associated with decreased osteoblast differentiation and/or activity, and bone loss (7–10). Mechanistically, some investigators have hypothesized that differentiation to adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts and/or production of adipocyte-derived adipokines lead to a negative bone turnover balance (11, 12). However, a negative relationship between BMAT levels and osteoblasts is far from universal (6, 13–15) and, when the relationship occurs, causality has not been established. In total, the experimental evidence to date does not strongly support a deterministic model where reducing BMAT will invariably lead to increased bone mass (1). Mice are commonly used as a mammalian model organism, in part because of their diminutive size, relatively short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulation. However, skeletal adaptations do not scale linearly with body size (16). In addition to being physically small, mice are daily facultative heterotherms and have a thermoneutral zone that is much higher than in humans (17). One outcome of this difference in thermoregulation is that mice housed at room temperature (~22°C) experience cold stress. Adaptation to chronic cold stress is recognized to have profound physiological effects that influence disease processes (18, 19). In contrast to larger rodents and humans, male and female mice lose cancellous bone in femur and lumbar vertebra well before growth has ceased (20). We have shown that cold stress induced by room temperature housing contributes to, and may be fully responsible for, premature cancellous bone loss in mice. Additionally, cold stress in growing mice results in compartment-specific reductions in bone accrual, reduced leptin levels, and decreased accrual of BMAT (21, 22). There is strong circumstantial evidence that the adipokine leptin is an important negative regulator of BMAT in mice (23). Compared to C57BL/6J (B6) wild type (WT) mice, bone growth and turnover are lower and BMAT higher in long bones of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (24–28). Furthermore, treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin by either intracerebroventricular or subcutaneous delivery normalizes bone growth and turnover and reduces BMAT levels (23, 25, 29, 30). On the other hand, there are circumstances where elevated leptin is associated with increased BMAT. For example, compared to mice housed at 22°C, housing B6 female mice at 32°C results in increases in serum leptin and BMAT (31). Additionally, high blood leptin levels in obese rodents are associated with increased BMAT (32). These discrepant findings, where higher levels of leptin can be associated with either increases or decreases in BMAT, suggest that environmental temperature has actions on BMAT that do not require leptin. To better understand the role of leptin as a potential mediator of the response of BMAT to changes in environmental temperature, we performed 2 experiments where we measured BMAT 2 weeks following transfer of mice housed at room temperature (22°C) to near thermoneutral (32°C) housing. It is challenging to house mice at true thermoneutral because the thermoneutral point differs by several degrees between the dark and light photo periods (33). However, a constant temperature of 30-32°C approximates the midrange of thermoneutrality and was shown to prevent cold stress-induced cancellous bone loss in male and female mice as well as result in increased BMAT in female mice (21). In the first experiment, we supplemented 6-week-old female B6 WT mice with leptin, administered for 2 weeks using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump, at 10 µg/d. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food consumption of leptin-supplemented mice. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 WT, leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of treatment.Materials and methods The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon State University in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Experiment 1: Effects of leptin supplementation on food intake, body composition, bone and bone marrow adiposity in female B6 mice Six-week-old female B6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). We chose 6-week-old mice because this age corresponds to near peak cancellous bone volume fraction in femur in the B6 female (20). The animals were placed at 32°C upon arrival and maintained individually housed on a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle. Near thermoneutral housing was used to prevent cold stress associated with subthermoneutral housing (e.g., standard room temperature, ~22°C) (31, 34). The mice were randomized by weight into one of 3 treatment groups: (1) ad lib (n=16), (2) leptin-supplemented (leptin) (n=9), or (3) vehicle-treated and pair-fed to leptin (pair-fed) (n=10) ( Figure 1 ). Mouse leptin (10 µg/d, equivalent to 400 ng/h; 498-OB-05M, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or vehicle (20 mM Tris-HCL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were delivered via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps (Alzet Model 1002, Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) to leptin and pair-fed mice, respectively as described (35). Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to the ad lib and leptin-supplemented mice. The pair-fed mice were calorically restricted to match food intake of the leptin-supplemented mice. These mice also served as vehicle-treated surgery controls. We did not include B6 mice housed at 22°C as an additional control because a pilot study (data not shown) revealed no change in BMAT. Food intake was recorded daily for the 2-week duration of treatment. Body weight was recorded 2 days prior to implant surgery, on day of implant surgery (only mice undergoing surgery were weighed), and on days 4, 11, and 14 (necropsy) post-surgery. Calcein was administered at 4 and 1 d prior to necropsy to label mineralizing bone. Mice were fasted overnight and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed prior to necropsy. For tissue collection death was induced by cardiac exsanguination. Abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) – perigonadal, mesenteric, perirenal, retroperitoneal – was excised and weighed. Samples of perigonadal WAT were stored in RNAlater for evaluation of gene expression. Interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) was also excised and stored in RNAlater for evaluation of gene expression. Femora were removed, fixed for 24h in 10% buffered formalin and stored in 70% ethanol for histomorphometric analysis. Tibiae were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for analysis of gene expression. Figure 1.

Following arrival, the B6 WT mice were randomized by weight into one of 2 groups: (1) baseline (n=8) and (2) no treatment control (n=9) ( Figure 1 ). The ob/ob mice were randomized by weight into 3 groups: (1) baseline (n=7), (2) vehicle (n=8), or (3) leptin-treated (n=8). The baseline groups were sacrificed at the start of the experiment and treatment mice placed at 32°C. Mouse leptin (0.3 µg/d, equivalent to 12 ng/h; 498-OB-05M, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or vehicle (20 mM Tris-HCL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were delivered via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps (Alzet Model 1002, Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) to leptin and vehicle mice, respectively. Infusion of leptin at 0.3 µg/d was shown to increase longitudinal bone growth and bone formation with minimal effects on hypothalamic gene expression in ob/ob mice (35). Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to all groups. We did not include mice housed at 22°C as an additional control because a pilot study (data not shown) did not reveal a change in BMAT. As in Experiment 1, percent body fat (DXA) and abdominal WAT mass (perigonadal, mesenteric, perirenal, retroperitoneal) were recorded at necropsy. In addition, interscapular BAT was removed and stored in RNA later for evaluation of gene expression and femora were removed, fixed for 24h in 10% buffered formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for histomorphometric analysis of bone marrow adiposity.Dual energy absorptiometry Total body bone mineral content (g), bone area (cm2), bone mineral density (g/cm2) and percent body fat were determined using DXA (PIXImus2, Lunar, Madison, WI) under isoflurane anesthesia immediately prior to necropsy.Blood measurements Serum leptin was measured using Mouse Leptin Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), serum osteocalcin was measured using Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and serum Mouse C terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX-1) was measured using ELISA kit (Life Sciences Advanced Technologies, St. Petersburg, FL) according to the respective manufacturer’s protocol. Intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for all ELISA assays were within the manufactures’ reported CVs of ≤ 5%.Histomorphometry The methods used to measure static and dynamic bone histomorphometry have been described, with modifications for mice (36). In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and xylene, and embedded undecalcified in modified methyl methacrylate. Longitudinal sections (4 µm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2065) and affixed to slides precoated with 1% gelatin solution. One section/animal was mounted unstained for measurement of fluorochrome labels and marrow adipocytes using ultraviolet illumination. All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA) in the distal femur metaphysis (10x) and distal femur diaphysis (6.7x) ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25 – 1.1 mm proximal to the growth plate, averaged 0.92 mm2 in area, and excluded primary spongiosa and cortical bone. The sampling site for the distal femoral diaphysis was located 2.0 – 2.7 mm proximal to the growth plate, averaged 0.63 mm2 in area, and excluded cortical bone. Proper depth was identified by a characteristic v-shaped growth plate and parallel diaphyseal cortices approximately equal in width ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). Fluorochrome-based measurements of bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single label normalized to bone perimeter, %), 2) mineral apposition rate (the distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3-day interlabel interval, µm/d), and 3) bone formation rate (bone formation rate/bone perimeter: calculated by multiplying mineralizing perimeter by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter, μm2/µm/y). All bone histomorphometric data are reported using standard 2-dimensional referents and nomenclature (37). Cell-based BMAT measurements included adipocyte area fraction (adipocyte area/tissue area, %), adipocyte number (#/mm2) and adipocyte size (µm2). Adipocytes were identified as large circular, oval or ellipsoid-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane; adipocytes are easily detected because ultraviolet absorption by lipid storage droplets is negligible due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. These cells can be appreciated as black ‘ghosts’ surrounded by a membrane in Supplemental Figure 1B . The size of each adipocyte was determined by outlining the cell perimeter; the OsteoMeasure software was used to calculate cell area. On average, we counted 55 adipocytes/mouse in the ROI in distal femur metaphysis and 17 adipocytes/mouse in the ROI in distal femur diaphysis.Gene expression Total RNA from BAT, WAT and tibia was isolated from 8 mice/group and individually analyzed. Whereas histomorphometry focused on a defined region of interest in femur, evaluation of gene expression included the entire tibia. Tibiae were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and further homogenized in Trizol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). BAT and WAT were directly homogenized in Trizol. Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Life Technologies). All quantitative polymerase chain (qPCR) reactions were done using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher), and relative quantification was determined using the ΔΔCt method. qPCR for BAT Ucp1 gene expression was done using primers specific for mouse Ucp1 (For: GTGAAGGTCAGAATGCAAGC, Rev: AGGGCCCCCTTCATGAGGTC) and mouse 18S ribosomal RNA (Rn18s) (For: CCGCAGCTAGGAATAATGGAAT, Rev: CGAACCTCCGACTTTCGTTCT). Data represent average fold change normalized to Rn18S. Expression levels for genes related to adipogenesis were determined for WAT and tibia using the Mouse Adipogenesis RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen). Gene expression was normalized using the averaged expression of Gapdh, Gusb, and Hsp90ab1 housekeeping genes, and relative quantification (ΔΔCt method) was determined using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software (Qiagen).Statistical analysis Experiment 1 Numerical outcome variables collected in female B6 mice that were supplemented with leptin or served as controls (ad lib-fed mice and mice pair-fed to match food consumption by leptin-supplemented mice) were compared using parametric one-factor analysis of variance or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. Group mean comparisons were made using the fitted analysis of variance linear model, Welch’s two-sample t-test, or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests.Experiment 2 Linear models with 5 groups (untreated B6 WT or ob/ob mice housed at 22°C, untreated B6 WT mice housed at thermoneutral temperature, and ob/ob mice receiving leptin at 0.3µg/day or a vehicle control housed at thermoneutral temperature) were used to evaluate the effects of housing temperature and leptin supplementation on BMAT.Experiments 1 and 2 Residual analysis and Levene’s test were used to assess homogeneity of variance and normality. Adjustment for multiple comparisons was made by setting the maximum false discovery rate equal to 5% (38). Differences were considered significant at false discovery rate adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05. All data are presented as mean ± SD. Data analysis was performed using R version 4.1.2.Results Experiment 1: Effects of leptin supplementation on food intake, body composition, bone, and bone marrow adiposity in female B6 mice The effects of leptin supplementation and pair feeding on food intake, body composition, serum leptin, and Ucp1 gene expression in BAT are shown in Figure 2 . Food intake (panel A) decreased over time in all groups; leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice consumed less food/day than ad lib-fed mice until day 7, after which food consumption did not differ among groups. Cumulative food intake (panel B) was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice. Body mass did not differ among treatment groups at any time point evaluated, including at termination of treatment (panel C). However, body mass change over the 14 days of treatment (panel D) was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice and tended (p = 0.06) to be lower in leptin-supplemented compared to pair-fed mice. Normalized body mass relative to baseline body mass was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice at all time points evaluated (panel E and F). Percent body fat (panel G) and WAT mass (panel H) were lower in leptin-supplemented mice than in ad lib or pair-fed mice. Significant differences in percent body fat or WAT mass were not detected between ad lib and pair-fed mice. Serum leptin levels (panel I) did not differ among treatment groups. Ucp1 expression in BAT (panel J) was lower in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ab lib and pair-fed mice. Significant differences in Ucp1 expression were not detected between ab lib and pair-fed mice. Figure 2.

Bone area (panel A) was higher in leptin-supplemented mice compared to both ad lib and pair-fed mice. Bone mineral content (panel B) was also higher in leptin-supplemented mice than in pair-fed mice. Significant differences in bone area or bone mineral content were not detected between ad lib and pair-fed mice. In addition, significant differences in bone mineral density (panel C) were not detected with treatment. Serum CTX (panel D) was lower in leptin-supplemented and pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice but leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from pair-fed mice. Serum osteocalcin levels (panel E) did not differ among groups. Figure 3.

Significant differences in bone area/tissue area in the distal femur metaphysis (panel A) were not detected with treatment. However, mineralizing perimeter (panel B) was lower in pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice and leptin-supplemented mice, and mineral apposition rate (panel C) was higher in leptin-supplemented mice than in ad lib mice and pair-fed mice. Bone formation rate (panel D) tended (p = 0.053) to be higher in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib and was higher compared to pair-fed mice. Bone formation rate was lower in pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice. Adipocyte area fraction (panel E) and adipocyte density (panel F) were lower in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib and pair-fed mice whereas adipocyte size (panel G) did not differ between ad lib and leptin-supplemented mice but was higher in pair-fed mice compared to both ad lib and leptin-supplemented mice. The differences in BMAT among the treatment groups in the distal femur metaphysis can be readily appreciated in panel H. Treatment effects on BMAT were likewise observed in the distal femur diaphysis. Adipocyte area fraction (panel I), density (panel J) and size (panel K) were lower or tended to be lower in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib and pair-fed mice. However, differences in marrow adiposity were not detected between ad lib and pair-fed mice. Figure 4.

In abdominal WAT, 8/84 genes were differentially expressed in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib mice, 3/84 genes were differentially expressed in pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice, and 7/84 genes were differentially expressed in leptin-supplemented mice compared to pair-fed mice. In tibia, 14/84 genes were differentially expressed in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib mice, 32/84 genes were differentially expressed in pair-fed mice compared to ad lib mice, and 17/84 genes were differentially expressed in leptin-supplemented mice compared to pair-fed mice.

Percent body fat (panel A) and abdominal WAT mass (panel B) increased in WT mice and increased (percent fat) or tended (p = 0.064) to increase (abdominal WAT) in ob/ob mice following transfer from room temperature (baseline, 22°C) to thermoneutral housing (32°C). Leptin treatment in ob/ob mice resulted in lower percent body fat but had no effect on abdominal WAT mass. As expected, Ucp1 expression in BAT (panel C) decreased in WT mice following transfer to thermoneutral housing while thermoneutral housing had no effect on Ucp1 expression in the ob/ob mice. Administration of leptin to ob/ob mice resulted in higher Ucp1 expression compared to administration of vehicle. Adipocyte area fraction (panel D), adipocyte density (panel E) and adipocyte size (panel F) increased in both WT and ob/ob mice following transfer to thermoneutral housing. Leptin treatment in ob/ob mice resulted in lower adipocyte area fraction and adipocyte density compared to vehicle. Significant differences in adipocyte size were not detected with leptin treatment in the ob/ob mice. Figure 7.

The time course for reduced food consumption was advanced (i.e., occurred earlier) but the magnitude of the decrease was not influenced by leptin supplementation. Compared to ad lib mice, supplementation of B6 mice with leptin had no effect on serum leptin levels measured at necropsy but resulted in lower BAT Ucp1 expression, lower serum CTX, lower abdominal WAT and lower BMAT in metaphysis and diaphysis of the distal femur, and higher bone formation rate in distal femur metaphysis. Pair feeding did not closely replicate the effects of leptin supplementation on B6 mice housed at thermoneutral. Transfer of ob/ob mice from room temperature to thermoneutral resulted in higher abdominal WAT and higher BMAT in distal femur. Finally, treatment of ob/ob mice with low dose leptin reduced the increase in BMAT in distal femur following transfer to thermoneutral housing but did not impact abdominal WAT weight. In the present study, we observed a reciprocal relationship between bone formation rate (increased) and BMAT levels (decreased) in distal femur of B6 mice following leptin supplementation. We and others noted inverse relationships between bone formation and BMAT at various skeletal sites during aging and in response to hypophysectomy, spaceflight, ionizing radiation, high fat diets and chronic heavy alcohol consumption (7–10, 14, 23, 39–42). However, as mentioned in the Introduction, a causal association between changes in BMAT levels and bone formation rate has not been demonstrated and there are numerous exceptions to this reciprocal relationship. For example, ovariectomy (ovx) in rats results in increases in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter as well as BMAT, as does increasing housing temperature of mice from room temperature to the thermoneutral range (43). Furthermore, BMAT was increased and bone formation unchanged in ovx rats following a 14-day spaceflight (39). Finally, treatment with the bone anabolic hormones fibroblast growth factor or parathyroid hormone increased bone formation in rodents without reducing BMAT (14, 44). It remains uncertain as to whether BMAT alters the skeletal response to regulatory factors such as hormones and mechanical loads. Compared to B6 WT mice, adult ob/ob mice have higher BMAT levels. However, hindlimb unloading resulted in cancellous bone loss and changes in bone turnover in ob/ob mice indistinguishable from the skeletal response in B6 WT mice (45). Female mice housed at thermoneutral have higher BMAT and cancellous bone mass than female mice housed at room temperature but antagonizing accrual of BMAT by treatment with the nonspecific β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol had minimal effect on bone mass, microarchitecture and turnover (31). Additionally, in spite of differences in BMAT, inflammation-induced bone loss was similar in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at room temperature and at thermoneutral (46). The receptor tyrosine kinase cKit is required for fat storage in long bones and lumbar vertebra of mice (47, 48). Therefore, attenuation of cKit signaling provides a novel approach for investigating the regulation and function of BMAT. Results of studies performed in cKit-deficient KitW/Wv mice do not exclude the possibility that BMAT influences bone metabolism but do demonstrate that mature bone marrow adipocytes are not required for a negative bone turnover balance following ovx or during simulated microgravity (43, 49). Indeed, having normal BMAT levels appeared to attenuate bone loss in distal femur induced by simulated microgravity (49). A limitation of KitW/Wv mice is that they have hereditary macrocytic anemia, which could independently influence bone metabolism or alternatively modify the effects of BMAT (50, 51). However, adoptive transfer of purified WT (WBB6F1/J) hematopoietic stem cells into KitW/Wv mice (WT→ KitW/Wv) normalized bone marrow Kit expression (52). Hindlimb unloading resulted in reduced cancellous bone in WT→ KitW/Wv mice verifying that the BMAT-deficient mice are not protected against hindlimb unloading-induced cancellous bone loss (49). Taken together, factors such as ckit signaling, mechanical loading, leptin status, sex hormones and aging clearly influence BMAT levels but strong evidence that BMAT is an obligatory regulator of bone turnover balance is largely absent. These null results do not imply that BMAT is unimportant; there is compelling evidence that BMAT plays a role in regulated hematopoiesis (1, 53–55). Also, marrow adipocytes produce hormones, adipokines and cytokines capable of positive as well as negative effects on bone metabolism (1, 56–60). In the present study, leptin and pair feeding influenced expression of genes for adipokines (Lep), hormones and growth factors (Fgf2, Fgf10, Agt, Angpt2, Bmp2, Bmp7, Dlk1), cell cycle regulators (Ccnd1, Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b), nuclear hormone receptors (Ppard, Pparg), transcription factors (Jun, Nrob2, Twist1, E2f1, Hes1, Srebf1), and signaling pathways (Sfrp1, Sfrp5, Vdr, Wnt10b, Dkk1, Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Kfl2, Insr, Irs1). These changes in gene expression in bone marrow may lead to local, systemic or neuronal actions to influence bone metabolism, but definitive evidence for this is lacking. Leptin supplementation (Experiment 1) did not result in an increase in serum leptin levels in B6 mice, when measured at necropsy. We interpret this as evidence that supplemental leptin resulted in a compensatory reduction in endogenous hormone production and an increase in leptin sensitivity. Our conclusion is supported by the observed lower abdominal WAT weight and BAT Ucp1 expression in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib or pair-fed mice and lower BMAT in leptin-supplemented B6 WT as well as leptin-treated ob/ob mice. Down regulation of Lep expression in adipocytes is a potential alternative mechanism to decrease serum leptin levels and there is evidence that this mechanism is induced by hypothalamic leptin gene therapy (61). However, this alternative mechanism is unlikely because reduced abdominal WAT in the present study was not accompanied by a reduction in Lep expression. It is notable that the reduction in BMAT accrual in leptin-treated ob/ob mice was not accompanied by a parallel decrease in abdominal WAT. This suggests that leptin inhibits BMAT accrual at much lower levels than is required to inhibit WAT accrual, a conclusion supported by dose-response studies where leptin was administered to ob/ob mice (35). Indeed, administration of leptin at a dose rate of 0.3 μg/d did not increase serum leptin levels above the detection limit of 0.5 μg/ml. Food consumption was lower in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib-fed mice for several days following osmotic pump insertion, but afterwards there was no difference in food intake among treatment groups. We interpret this as further evidence that growing mice fed a normal diet are highly leptin sensitive. In support, partially leptin-deficient heterozygote ob/+ mice adapt to partial leptin deficiency by increasing adipose tissue mass until achieving leptin levels similar to B6 WT mice (62). Treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin resulted in dose-dependent decreases in appetite (35, 63). This finding contrasts with B6 mice fed a high fat diet; when treated with leptin, obese mice exhibit an attenuated response, attributable to leptin resistance (64). Sympathetic signaling is a positive regulator of non-shivering thermogenesis and the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blunted thermoneutral-associated increases in BMAT and WAT (65). Thus, leptin and environmental temperature may influence BMAT levels by regulating overlapping pathways. However, it is likely that the actions of leptin on BMAT differ from the adipokine’s positive central nervous system-mediated regulatory effects on non-shivering thermogenesis. It is well established that adipocytes express leptin receptors (54, 66). Additionally, treatment with leptin at a dose rate with minimal actions on energy metabolism decreased BMAT and increased bone formation in ob/ob mice (35). In contrast, mild caloric restriction by pair feeding was associated with an increase in BMAT levels. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that leptin signaling and environmental temperature independently regulate BMAT levels. Thermoneutral housing alters many, but not all, metabolic responses (67–70). Regarding bone, compared to room temperature, thermoneutral housing prevents premature cancellous bone loss, attenuates risperidone-induced trabecular bone loss, has modest effects on cortical response to mechanical loading, and does not impact polyethylene-particle induced osteolysis (46, 71, 72). We have shown that increasing environmental temperature from room temperature to thermoneutral impacts gene expression in WAT and bone (65). In the present study, performed at thermoneutral, leptin supplementation, but not pair feeding, increased expression of genes important to fat synthesis and turnover in WAT; Acacb (Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase), Adig (adipogenin), Retn (resistin), Slc2a4 (facilitated glucose transporter member 4, GLUT4), and Srebf1 (Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1). The findings are consistent with fat mobilization in response to leptin supplementation. Leptin supplementation and pair feeding also altered gene expression in whole tibia. However, there was no overlap in genes differentially expressed in WAT and tibia. In general agreement with treatment-associated differences in bone histomorphometry, there were differences in gene expression between leptin-treated mice and pair-fed or ad lib controls. Taken together, the results suggest that these two leptin target tissues respond differently to the hormone. The present studies were performed in growing female mice and evaluated (1) distal femur metaphysis (histomorphometry), a skeletal site where BMAT is closely associated with cancellous bone undergoing rapid turnover, and (2) whole tibia (gene expression). The present studies do not include controls for age-related changes in BMAT that may have occurred during the 2-week intervention. However, we have previously reported higher levels of BMAT in female mice housed at thermoneutral compared to age-matched controls housed at room temperature and pilot studies revealed no change during the evaluated age range (31, 34). Our evaluation of one sex is a study limitation because there are sex differences in bone growth and BMAT accrual (21). Additionally, adipocyte number differs with skeletal site, suggesting possible differences in regulation and function. Future studies should evaluate the effects of environmental temperature and leptin on BMAT at multiple locations in skeletally mature and aging male and female mice. Furthermore, because energy balance and thermoregulation in mice differs markedly from humans it would be enlightening to investigate the response of BMAT to environmental temperatures in additional model organisms. Our analyses were performed at 4 levels; quantitative histomorphometry, gene expression, serum biomarkers (indices of whole-body bone turnover and fat stores) and organ mass/density. Histomorphometry examined the relationships between bone turnover and BMAT at one cancellous bone site (distal femur metaphysis) in response to treatment. Evaluation of differential expression of a panel of genes related to adipogenesis was used to compare the response to leptin in WAT and whole tibia. The tibia, in addition to adipose tissue (regulated and constitutive BMAT), contains compartment-specific distributions of bone (e.g., cortical and cancellous), cartilage, hematopoietic tissue and other tissues. Differences between our skeletal site in femur and whole tibia preclude direct comparisons between these two long bones. This being said, changes identified in a long bone are generally representative of the appendicular skeleton (1, 31, 35, 43, 47, 49, 52, 62, 65). Serum biomarkers and whole organ measurements were performed as indices of macro changes in response to treatment. In summary, increasing environmental temperature from room temperature to thermoneutral in growing female B6 and ob/ob mice has major effects on body composition, including an increase in BMAT in the distal femur metaphysis in both genotypes and an increase in leptin levels in B6 mice. Administration of leptin lowered BMAT levels in both B6 WT and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Based on these findings, we conclude that increases in leptin signaling in leptin-sensitive mice and environmental temperature in normal and leptin-deficient mice have independent but opposite effects on BMAT levels. Specifically, alleviation of cold stress by housing mice at thermoneutral increases BMAT compared to room temperature housing, whereas increasing leptin signaling decreases BMAT.Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Materials .

    "abstract": "Abstract Mice are typically housed at temperatures well below their thermoneutral zone. When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment. It is not clear if there is a threshold temperature for cold stress-induced bone loss. It is also not clear if alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, influence bone accrual and turnover. This study aimed to determine how small differences in temperature (4 °C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) single housed at 22 °C, 3) single housed at 26 °C, or 4) group housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C. Mice in the baseline group were sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other 3 groups of mice were maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions for 13 weeks until 18 weeks of age. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis. The cancellous bone loss was attenuated but not prevented in mice individually housed at 26 °C or group housed at 22 °C. In conclusion, by impacting thermogenesis or heat loss, modest differences in housing conditions could influence experimental results.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Mice are a commonly used model organism for studying how factors, such as physical activity, influence aging-related bone loss. Mice are typically maintained at housing temperatures of 20–26 °C (National Research Council (US) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011). However, this temperature range is below the thermoneutral zone for the species and results in cold stress. There is evidence and concern that maintaining mice under sustained cold stress may influence experimental results as well as hinder the translatability of preclinical research findings to human physiology (Speakman and Keijer, 2013; Vialard and Olivier, 2020). In contrast to humans, who are homeotherms and maintain a tight window of core body temperature, mice are facultative daily heterotherms. Because of their small size, mice are more limited in mechanisms for maintaining body temperature than larger animals when subjected to a cool environment, and under some conditions, their body temperature decreases when the ambient temperature drops below thermoneutral. The thermoneutral zone for C57BL/6 J mice varies from ~29 to ~34 °C and thermoregulatory responses to subthermoneutral housing follow a diurnal pattern. During the light photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are low, the thermoneutral point for mice is ~29 °C (Škop et al., 2020). If food is restricted during the light photoperiod (e.g., fasting) and the ambient temperature drops below thermoneutral, mice enter the hypometabolic state of torpor (Swoap, 2008). During the dark photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are high, the thermoneutral point is ~33 °C (Škop et al., 2020). When the ambient temperature drops below thermoneutral during this phase, mice maintain their core body temperature through adaptive thermogenesis. One important form of adaptive thermogenesis is non-shivering thermogenesis. During non-shivering thermogenesis heat is produced by a variety of distinct mechanisms, including uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), primarily in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Klingenspor, 2003), and sarcolipin-based thermogenesis, primarily in muscle (Bal and Periasamy, 2020). In addition to its effects on energy metabolism, low ambient temperature may also play a role in the timing and pattern of aging-related bone loss in mice. Our laboratory has shown that housing male and female mice at 22 °C results in cancellous bone loss when the mice are still growing. While the bone loss occurs at multiple skeletal locations, it is particularly severe in the distal femur metaphysis (Iwaniec et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2019), a commonly-evaluated weight-bearing site. We are particularly interested in the issue of bone loss associated with cold temperature in microgravity studies because skeletally mature mice, particularly female mice, have very low cancellous bone volume in their hindlimbs, making it difficult to observe further loss associated with skeletal unloading (Glatt et al., 2007). The bone loss occurring in the distal femur metaphysis in mice housed at room temperature is due to a negative bone turnover balance resulting from a combination of lower bone formation and higher bone resorption, and it is associated with increased sympathetic activity (Turner et al., 2020), which in turn is an important mediator of cold stress-induced adaptive thermogenesis. The reported negative effects of room temperature housing on bone microarchitecture suggest that environmental temperature is an important consideration when using mice for bone research. Additionally, there is concern that the mechanisms mediating cold adaptation may influence experimental results. For example, treatment with risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug that induces bone loss, resulted in temperature-dependent effects; specifically, risperidone treatment of female mice housed at 28 °C lowered bone turnover, whereas treatment at room temperature resulted in increased bone resorption (Kunst et al., 2021). Additionally, we have recently shown that cold stress induced by room temperature alters the skeletal response of growing female mice to hindlimb unloading, a ground-based model for microgravity (Wong et al., In Press). While maintaining mice at thermoneutrality is likely the most effective solution for avoiding cold stress-related bone loss, this is not always achievable or desirable. Not all mouse housing facilities are capable of maintaining mice at thermoneutral temperatures and under some conditions (e.g., group housing) thermoneutral housing may be undesirable (Speakman and Keijer, 2013). To date, no detailed temperature response study on bone has been performed in mice. Therefore, it is of interest whether modest increases in housing temperature or standard group housing (up to 5 mice/cage) at room temperature attenuate premature bone loss associated with cold stress in mice. Animal care guidelines recommend housing at temperatures between 20 °C and 26 °C. Mice are housed individually or in groups at ~22 °C but when normal thermoregulation is compromised, such as during hindlimb unloading, warmer housing is recommended (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002). The objectives of this study were 1) to determine whether a small (4 °C) difference in temperature (22 °C versus 26 °C) influences bone microarchitecture in growing female mice, and 2) to evaluate how lowering heat loss (5 mice per cage with nestlets) (Gaskill et al., 2013) influences the effect of room temperature housing on bone. The central hypotheses of this study are that 1) increasing temperature will influence bone microarchitecture by reducing cold stress-induced bone loss and 2) lowering heat loss by group housing mice with nestlets will attenuate the effects of room temperature housing on bone.",

    "discussion": "4. Discussion Body weight, lean mass, fat mass, femur size, BMC and BMD, and cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar and caudal vertebrae increased from 6 to 18 weeks of age in female B6 mice housed at room temperature (22 °C). These increases contrast with a large decrease in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and a lack of change in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur epiphysis. A small (4 °C) difference in temperature influenced bone microarchitecture at select skeletal sites, as did group housing the mice with nestlets. Compared to mice single housed at 22 °C, mice single housed at 26 °C had higher cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular number, and lower trabecular separation in distal femur metaphysis. Additionally, they had higher bone volume fraction and lower trabecular separation in lumbar vertebrae. Group housing with nestlets also moderated the effect of room temperature housing and bone measurements did not differ in mice group housed at 22 °C compared to mice single housed at 26 °C. Laboratory mice are typically housed at ~22 °C, which is within the thermoneutral comfort zone for humans but well below thermoneutral for mice. As facultative daily heterotherms, mice maintain their core body temperature through adaptive thermogenesis when the ambient temperature is below thermoneutral. This impacts energy partitioning and results in premature cancellous bone loss (Iwaniec et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2019). The present study found that an increase in housing temperature of individually housed mice from 22 °C to 26 °C influenced bone mass and microarchitecture in female mice and significantly attenuated, but did not prevent, bone loss in distal femur metaphysis. Mice are often group-housed. According to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council (US) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011), up to 5 mice may be housed in a single cage. In the current study, mice group housed (5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C had similar outcomes compared to mice single housed at 26 °C, which suggests that group housing, by lowering heat loss, partially compensates for the reduction in temperature. There are inherent differences in thermal physiology between single and group-housed mice, with lesser effects of cold stress in group-housed mice including reduced heat loss due, in part, to their ability to huddle (Speakman and Keijer, 2013). However, the results from our present study are in support of previous research concluding that group housing alone is not sufficient to fully prevent cold stress in mice housed at room temperature (Maher et al., 2015). Nevertheless, a reduced ability to huddle under some conditions, such as microgravity, could contribute to bone loss. This possibility is supported by our finding that female mice housed aboard the International Space Station (ISS) had increased expression of Ucp1 in BAT compared to ground-based control mice, in spite of comparable housing temperatures (Wong et al., 2021). The inclusion of a baseline control group is critical for a full appreciation of the bone and bone-compartment-specific effects of housing on the mouse skeleton. In the present study, mice single housed at 26 °C had 54 % higher cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis and 11 % higher cancellous bone volume fraction in the 5th lumbar vertebra compared to mice single housed at 22 °C. Although impressive, this higher value in the femur is small compared to the magnitude of bone loss relative to baseline values. Additionally, whereas the bone volume fraction in the femur metaphysis of mice housed at the warmer temperature was due to attenuated bone loss, the higher vertebral bone volume fraction was due to increased bone accrual. As expected, there was a lower expression of Ucp1 in BAT among mice single housed at 26 °C compared to mice single housed at 22 °C. Mice group housed at 22 °C also had lower Ucp1 expression compared to mice single housed at 22 °C and notably, the magnitude of the change in Ucp1 expression was similar to that of mice single housed at 26 °C. Ucp-1 functions to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation to release heat rather than store energy as ATP and is activated by cold. The protein contributes to adaptive non-shivering thermogenesis and has been reported to have a protective effect on bone under conditions of severe cold stress (Nguyen et al., 2018). Similar outcomes have been reported in male B6 mice housed in pairs at 20 °C, 22 °C, and 26 °C, with increased Ucp1 expression in BAT and impaired cancellous bone acquisition at lower temperatures (Robbins et al., 2018). Research conducted in mice housed aboard the ISS revealed bone loss and altered microarchitecture, especially in lower limbs (Fu et al., 2021). The findings of the present study suggest that the skeletal response of mice to spaceflight may be due, in part, to housing conditions and thus not entirely due to skeletal unloading during microgravity. Mice are transported to the ISS and subsequently group housed in rodent habitats with a reported temperature range of 26–28 °C (Choi et al., 2020). As mentioned (Wong et al., 2021), although animal enclosure temperature was comparable, Ucp1 expression in BAT was higher in the flight mice aboard the ISS. There was also evidence that the flight mice consumed more food. These two findings are consistent with increased thermogenesis in mice flown aboard the ISS that is similar in magnitude to the increase associated with a 4 °C lower housing temperature. It is likely that mice aboard the ISS are unable to huddle as efficiently or assume postural positions to reduce heat loss as ground controls. Consequently, they are more dependent upon adaptive thermogenesis to maintain core body temperature. A side effect of this important adaptive response to countering cold stress may be accelerated bone loss. The response of bones of the lower limb, such as the femur, to differences in thermogenesis is of particular interest for microgravity research because spaceflight simulation studies using ground-based models such as hindlimb unloading typically focus on the response of weight-bearing bone to unloading (Grimm et al., 2016). As demonstrated here and in prior studies, the impact of cold stress varies among bones and skeletal sites (Iwaniec et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2019). Lumbar vertebrae, for example, are less impacted by cold temperature stress than femora, but they are less desirable than long bones of the hindlimb for simulated microgravity studies because although load bearing they do not bear weight (Keune et al., 2019). This report was limited to female mice due to facility constraints. We chose to perform the initial studies in female mice because female mice exhibit an earlier and more dramatic skeletal response to cold stress than male mice. However, we have shown that thermoneutral housing prevents premature (while the mice are growing) bone loss in both sexes. Additional research is needed to assess whether male mice would experience a similar attenuation of bone loss following a small (4 °C) increase in housing temperature above room temperature (22 °C). Another limitation of the study is that we only evaluated growing mice. Additional studies will be required to determine if cold stress accelerates age-related bone loss in skeletally mature mice. Finally, single housed mice may experience additional stress due to social isolation (Liu et al., 2020) and we cannot rule out the possibility that the attenuation of bone loss observed among the group housed mice may also be due, in part, to reduced stress independent of temperature.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions In conclusion, differences in housing conditions resulting in even modest differences in thermogenesis or heat retention can influence bone mass and architecture. In the present study, a 4 °C increase in environmental temperature, as well as group housing mice with nestlets to reduce heat loss, attenuated the skeletal response to chronic cold stress associated with housing mice individually at standard room temperature. These findings suggest that unless thermoregulation is controlled for, even minor differences in housing conditions or behavior (e.g., huddling) could influence experimental results.",

When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment. It is not clear if there is a threshold temperature for cold stress-induced bone loss. It is also not clear if alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, influence bone accrual and turnover. This study aimed to determine how small differences in temperature (4 °C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) single housed at 22 °C, 3) single housed at 26 °C, or 4) group housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C. Mice in the baseline group were sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other 3 groups of mice were maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions for 13 weeks until 18 weeks of age. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis. The cancellous bone loss was attenuated but not prevented in mice individually housed at 26 °C or group housed at 22 °C. In conclusion, by impacting thermogenesis or heat loss, modest differences in housing conditions could influence experimental results.

Introduction Mice are a commonly used model organism for studying how factors, such as physical activity, influence aging-related bone loss. Mice are typically maintained at housing temperatures of 20–26 °C (National Research Council (US) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011). However, this temperature range is below the thermoneutral zone for the species and results in cold stress. There is evidence and concern that maintaining mice under sustained cold stress may influence experimental results as well as hinder the translatability of preclinical research findings to human physiology (Speakman and Keijer, 2013; Vialard and Olivier, 2020). In contrast to humans, who are homeotherms and maintain a tight window of core body temperature, mice are facultative daily heterotherms. Because of their small size, mice are more limited in mechanisms for maintaining body temperature than larger animals when subjected to a cool environment, and under some conditions, their body temperature decreases when the ambient temperature drops below thermoneutral. The thermoneutral zone for C57BL/6 J mice varies from ~29 to ~34 °C and thermoregulatory responses to subthermoneutral housing follow a diurnal pattern. During the light photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are low, the thermoneutral point for mice is ~29 °C (Škop et al., 2020). If food is restricted during the light photoperiod (e.g., fasting) and the ambient temperature drops below thermoneutral, mice enter the hypometabolic state of torpor (Swoap, 2008). During the dark photoperiod, when food intake and locomotor activity are high, the thermoneutral point is ~33 °C (Škop et al., 2020). When the ambient temperature drops below thermoneutral during this phase, mice maintain their core body temperature through adaptive thermogenesis. One important form of adaptive thermogenesis is non-shivering thermogenesis. During non-shivering thermogenesis heat is produced by a variety of distinct mechanisms, including uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), primarily in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Klingenspor, 2003), and sarcolipin-based thermogenesis, primarily in muscle (Bal and Periasamy, 2020). In addition to its effects on energy metabolism, low ambient temperature may also play a role in the timing and pattern of aging-related bone loss in mice. Our laboratory has shown that housing male and female mice at 22 °C results in cancellous bone loss when the mice are still growing. While the bone loss occurs at multiple skeletal locations, it is particularly severe in the distal femur metaphysis (Iwaniec et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2019), a commonly-evaluated weight-bearing site. We are particularly interested in the issue of bone loss associated with cold temperature in microgravity studies because skeletally mature mice, particularly female mice, have very low cancellous bone volume in their hindlimbs, making it difficult to observe further loss associated with skeletal unloading (Glatt et al., 2007). The bone loss occurring in the distal femur metaphysis in mice housed at room temperature is due to a negative bone turnover balance resulting from a combination of lower bone formation and higher bone resorption, and it is associated with increased sympathetic activity (Turner et al., 2020), which in turn is an important mediator of cold stress-induced adaptive thermogenesis. The reported negative effects of room temperature housing on bone microarchitecture suggest that environmental temperature is an important consideration when using mice for bone research. Additionally, there is concern that the mechanisms mediating cold adaptation may influence experimental results. For example, treatment with risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug that induces bone loss, resulted in temperature-dependent effects; specifically, risperidone treatment of female mice housed at 28 °C lowered bone turnover, whereas treatment at room temperature resulted in increased bone resorption (Kunst et al., 2021). Additionally, we have recently shown that cold stress induced by room temperature alters the skeletal response of growing female mice to hindlimb unloading, a ground-based model for microgravity (Wong et al., In Press). While maintaining mice at thermoneutrality is likely the most effective solution for avoiding cold stress-related bone loss, this is not always achievable or desirable. Not all mouse housing facilities are capable of maintaining mice at thermoneutral temperatures and under some conditions (e.g., group housing) thermoneutral housing may be undesirable (Speakman and Keijer, 2013). To date, no detailed temperature response study on bone has been performed in mice. Therefore, it is of interest whether modest increases in housing temperature or standard group housing (up to 5 mice/cage) at room temperature attenuate premature bone loss associated with cold stress in mice. Animal care guidelines recommend housing at temperatures between 20 °C and 26 °C. Mice are housed individually or in groups at ~22 °C but when normal thermoregulation is compromised, such as during hindlimb unloading, warmer housing is recommended (Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002). The objectives of this study were 1) to determine whether a small (4 °C) difference in temperature (22 °C versus 26 °C) influences bone microarchitecture in growing female mice, and 2) to evaluate how lowering heat loss (5 mice per cage with nestlets) (Gaskill et al., 2013) influences the effect of room temperature housing on bone. The central hypotheses of this study are that 1) increasing temperature will influence bone microarchitecture by reducing cold stress-induced bone loss and 2) lowering heat loss by group housing mice with nestlets will attenuate the effects of room temperature housing on bone.2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental design Experimental protocols were approved by the Oregon State University Animal Care and Use Committee and mice were maintained in accordance with the  Guide for the Care and the Use of Laboratory Animals. Five-week-old female C57BL/6 J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed under controlled conditions in a room on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum and food consumption and body weight were monitored weekly. Food consumption is not reported for group-housed mice due to the unreliability of the measurements; group-housed mice tended to grind their food into crumbs and discarded the crumbs at the bottom of their cages. Upon arrival mice were randomized by weight into one of four groups (n = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) 22 °C and single housed, 3) 26 °C and single housed, 4) 22 °C and group housed (n = 5/cage with nestlets to mimic housing conditions known to reduce cold stress in mice). Cages in all treatment groups contained bedding (BioFresh Performance Bedding; ⅛″ pelleted cellulose) to a depth of approximately ½″. Initial body weights averaged 18.8 ± 0.3 g, 18.5 ± 0.3 g, 18.1 ± 0.4 g, and 18.0 ± 0.2 g for groups 1 through 4, respectively. Mice in the baseline group were individually housed and sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other three groups of mice were maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions until 18 weeks of age. The following strategies were employed in order to minimize confounders: 1) other than experimental conditions, the mice were housed in identical cages in separate rooms in the same vivarium, 2) housing temperature was carefully monitored, and 3) visitation by laboratory personnel was logged and followed a predetermined protocol for weighing and feeding. Due to differences in ambient temperature between groups and the number of mice/cage, the experimenter could not be blinded to treatment. However, mice were randomly numbered and the evaluator was blinded to experimental groups during data collection. For assessment of body composition and tissue collection, mice were anesthetized with 2–3 % isoflurane delivered in oxygen. Following dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA) scanning, mice were sacrificed by decapitation. Abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT; perigonadal, mesenteric, perirenal, retroperitoneal) was excised and weighed. Interscapular BAT was excised, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Femora, lumbar vertebrae, and caudal vertebrae were removed, fixed overnight in 10 % formalin, and stored in 70 % ethanol for microcomputed tomography (μCT) analysis. 5th lumbar vertebra (LV5) and 5th caudal vertebra (CaV5) were selected for analysis.2.2. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry Lean mass and fat mass were measured in vivo using DXA (Piximus, Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), and % lean mass and % fat mass was calculated. Whole femora were scanned ex vivo to determine bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD).2.3. Microcomputed tomography Bone volume and architecture were measured using a Scanco μCT scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland). Bones were scanned in 70 % ethanol at a voxel size of 12 × 12 × 12 μm (55 kVp x-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold for bone segmentation was determined empirically and set at 245 (grayscale, 0–1000). In the femur, total mineralized tissue volume (mm3) was evaluated followed by site-specific evaluation of cortical bone in the midshaft femur and cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis. For the femur diaphysis, a sample of 20 slices (240 μm) of bone distal to the femur midshaft was assessed. Measurements included cross-sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (μm). For the distal femur metaphysis, a sample of 42 slices (504 μm) of cancellous bone was evaluated starting 45 slices (540 μm) proximal to the growth plate / metaphysis boundary. For the distal femur epiphysis, the full cancellous compartment (36 ± 0 slices, 432 ± 0 μm) was assessed. Direct cancellous bone measurements for the femur metaphysis and epiphysis included cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume / tissue volume, %), connectivity density (mm−3), trabecular thickness (μm), trabecular number (mm−1), and trabecular separation (μm). The same parameters were evaluated in the entire cancellous compartments of the lumbar vertebra (163 ± 2 slices, 1956 ± 24 μm) and caudal vertebra (164 ± 2 slices, 1968 ± 24 μm).2.4. Gene expression RNA was isolated from individual BAT samples from mice single housed at 22 °C, mice single housed at 26 °C, and mice group housed at 22 °C (n = 8/group). mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix and primers specific for mouse Ucp-1 (For: GTGAAGGTCAGAATGCAAGC, Rev: AGGGCCCCCTTCATGAGGTC) and mouse 18S ribosomal RNA (Rn18s) (For: CCGCAGCTAGGAATAATGGAAT, Rev: CGAACCTCCGACTTTCGTTCT). Data represent average fold change normalized to Rn18S using the ΔΔCt method, using mice single housed at 22 °C as the control.2.5. Statistical analysis Mean comparisons of quantitative variables were made between 6-week-old mice single housed at 22 °C and 18-week-old mice single housed at 22 °C or 26 °C or group housed at 22 °C using one-way analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test when assumptions of normality were violated. When results were significant, t-tests were used to make comparisons to the baseline group as well as comparisons between mice single housed at 22 °C, mice single housed at 26 °C, and mice group housed at 22 °C. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used when assumptions of normality were violated. False discovery rate was maintained at 5 % using the Benjamini and Hochberg method to adjust for multiple comparisons (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Data analysis was performed using R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019).3. Results 3.1.

Discussion Body weight, lean mass, fat mass, femur size, BMC and BMD, and cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar and caudal vertebrae increased from 6 to 18 weeks of age in female B6 mice housed at room temperature (22 °C). These increases contrast with a large decrease in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and a lack of change in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur epiphysis. A small (4 °C) difference in temperature influenced bone microarchitecture at select skeletal sites, as did group housing the mice with nestlets. Compared to mice single housed at 22 °C, mice single housed at 26 °C had higher cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular number, and lower trabecular separation in distal femur metaphysis. Additionally, they had higher bone volume fraction and lower trabecular separation in lumbar vertebrae. Group housing with nestlets also moderated the effect of room temperature housing and bone measurements did not differ in mice group housed at 22 °C compared to mice single housed at 26 °C. Laboratory mice are typically housed at ~22 °C, which is within the thermoneutral comfort zone for humans but well below thermoneutral for mice. As facultative daily heterotherms, mice maintain their core body temperature through adaptive thermogenesis when the ambient temperature is below thermoneutral. This impacts energy partitioning and results in premature cancellous bone loss (Iwaniec et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2019). The present study found that an increase in housing temperature of individually housed mice from 22 °C to 26 °C influenced bone mass and microarchitecture in female mice and significantly attenuated, but did not prevent, bone loss in distal femur metaphysis. Mice are often group-housed. According to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council (US) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011), up to 5 mice may be housed in a single cage. In the current study, mice group housed (5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C had similar outcomes compared to mice single housed at 26 °C, which suggests that group housing, by lowering heat loss, partially compensates for the reduction in temperature. There are inherent differences in thermal physiology between single and group-housed mice, with lesser effects of cold stress in group-housed mice including reduced heat loss due, in part, to their ability to huddle (Speakman and Keijer, 2013). However, the results from our present study are in support of previous research concluding that group housing alone is not sufficient to fully prevent cold stress in mice housed at room temperature (Maher et al., 2015). Nevertheless, a reduced ability to huddle under some conditions, such as microgravity, could contribute to bone loss. This possibility is supported by our finding that female mice housed aboard the International Space Station (ISS) had increased expression of Ucp1 in BAT compared to ground-based control mice, in spite of comparable housing temperatures (Wong et al., 2021). The inclusion of a baseline control group is critical for a full appreciation of the bone and bone-compartment-specific effects of housing on the mouse skeleton. In the present study, mice single housed at 26 °C had 54 % higher cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis and 11 % higher cancellous bone volume fraction in the 5th lumbar vertebra compared to mice single housed at 22 °C. Although impressive, this higher value in the femur is small compared to the magnitude of bone loss relative to baseline values. Additionally, whereas the bone volume fraction in the femur metaphysis of mice housed at the warmer temperature was due to attenuated bone loss, the higher vertebral bone volume fraction was due to increased bone accrual. As expected, there was a lower expression of Ucp1 in BAT among mice single housed at 26 °C compared to mice single housed at 22 °C. Mice group housed at 22 °C also had lower Ucp1 expression compared to mice single housed at 22 °C and notably, the magnitude of the change in Ucp1 expression was similar to that of mice single housed at 26 °C. Ucp-1 functions to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation to release heat rather than store energy as ATP and is activated by cold. The protein contributes to adaptive non-shivering thermogenesis and has been reported to have a protective effect on bone under conditions of severe cold stress (Nguyen et al., 2018). Similar outcomes have been reported in male B6 mice housed in pairs at 20 °C, 22 °C, and 26 °C, with increased Ucp1 expression in BAT and impaired cancellous bone acquisition at lower temperatures (Robbins et al., 2018). Research conducted in mice housed aboard the ISS revealed bone loss and altered microarchitecture, especially in lower limbs (Fu et al., 2021). The findings of the present study suggest that the skeletal response of mice to spaceflight may be due, in part, to housing conditions and thus not entirely due to skeletal unloading during microgravity. Mice are transported to the ISS and subsequently group housed in rodent habitats with a reported temperature range of 26–28 °C (Choi et al., 2020). As mentioned (Wong et al., 2021), although animal enclosure temperature was comparable, Ucp1 expression in BAT was higher in the flight mice aboard the ISS. There was also evidence that the flight mice consumed more food. These two findings are consistent with increased thermogenesis in mice flown aboard the ISS that is similar in magnitude to the increase associated with a 4 °C lower housing temperature. It is likely that mice aboard the ISS are unable to huddle as efficiently or assume postural positions to reduce heat loss as ground controls. Consequently, they are more dependent upon adaptive thermogenesis to maintain core body temperature. A side effect of this important adaptive response to countering cold stress may be accelerated bone loss. The response of bones of the lower limb, such as the femur, to differences in thermogenesis is of particular interest for microgravity research because spaceflight simulation studies using ground-based models such as hindlimb unloading typically focus on the response of weight-bearing bone to unloading (Grimm et al., 2016). As demonstrated here and in prior studies, the impact of cold stress varies among bones and skeletal sites (Iwaniec et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2019). Lumbar vertebrae, for example, are less impacted by cold temperature stress than femora, but they are less desirable than long bones of the hindlimb for simulated microgravity studies because although load bearing they do not bear weight (Keune et al., 2019). This report was limited to female mice due to facility constraints. We chose to perform the initial studies in female mice because female mice exhibit an earlier and more dramatic skeletal response to cold stress than male mice. However, we have shown that thermoneutral housing prevents premature (while the mice are growing) bone loss in both sexes. Additional research is needed to assess whether male mice would experience a similar attenuation of bone loss following a small (4 °C) increase in housing temperature above room temperature (22 °C). Another limitation of the study is that we only evaluated growing mice. Additional studies will be required to determine if cold stress accelerates age-related bone loss in skeletally mature mice. Finally, single housed mice may experience additional stress due to social isolation (Liu et al., 2020) and we cannot rule out the possibility that the attenuation of bone loss observed among the group housed mice may also be due, in part, to reduced stress independent of temperature.5. Conclusions In conclusion, differences in housing conditions resulting in even modest differences in thermogenesis or heat retention can influence bone mass and architecture. In the present study, a 4 °C increase in environmental temperature, as well as group housing mice with nestlets to reduce heat loss, attenuated the skeletal response to chronic cold stress associated with housing mice individually at standard room temperature. These findings suggest that unless thermoregulation is controlled for, even minor differences in housing conditions or behavior (e.g., huddling) could influence experimental results.Funding sources This work was supported by NASA (80NSSC19K0430).CRediT authorship contribution statement Conceptualization: RT and UI Data Collection: CW, DO, LS, and AA Data analysis: LS and AB Drafting manuscript: LS, RT, UI Revising manuscript content: LS, CW, AB, DO, AA, RT, and UI Approving final version: LS, CW, AB, AA, RT, and UI RT takes responsibility for the integrity of the data.Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no competing interests.Acknowledgments We would like to acknowledge our co-author, Dawn Olson, who passed away in August 2022 while this manuscript was in preparation.Data availability Data will be made available on request.References Bal N.C., Periasamy M.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is hypothesized to serve as an expandable/contractible fat depot which functions, in part, to minimize energy requirements for sustaining optimal hematopoiesis. We investigated whether BMAT is required for immune reconstitution following injury. Male wild type (WBB6F1, WT) and BMAT-deficient WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW-v/J (KitW/W-v) mice were lethally irradiated. Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal response to treatment. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in KitW/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Bone marrow fat is an important depot for short- and long-duration storage of triglycerides. By middle age, bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in humans typically contributes 5–10% of total body adipose tissue [1]. Fat depots generally act as dynamic energy reserves in which fatty acids are taken up by adipocytes from lipoproteins and subsequently released into the general circulation following lipolysis. Although BMAT can be highly labile [2], in contrast to white adipose tissue (WAT), bone marrow adipocytes often increase in number and sequester and esterify fatty acids during energy deprivation, implying that the bone marrow fat depot does not necessarily function as a traditional energy reservoir for peripheral tissues [3]. The physiological function of BMAT as well as its role in chronic disease initiation and progression are topics of current interest and debate [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. We previously reviewed evidence that increased BMAT during fasting reflects an adaptive response to a negative energy balance [14]. An increase in BMAT and the resulting reduction in hematopoietic compartment size during long-duration fasting potentially promotes survival by lowering the energy expenditure required to maintain the turnover of hematopoietic cells. In support, age-related increases in BMAT and decreases in hematopoiesis are reversed by cold temperature stress, blood loss, and infection, conditions with increased requirement for hematopoiesis [15,16,17,18,19]. Mesenchymal lineage cells, including adipocytes, often express stem cell factor (kit ligand), the endogenous ligand for the protooncogene kit (CD117). Kit is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on early hematopoietic lineage cells and is required for their differentiation and survival [20]. In addition to regulating hematopoietic cell compartment size, it is possible that lipolysis of triglycerides stored in BMAT provides an energy source for hematopoietic cells. In this regard, Li et al. [21] concluded that BMAT is essential for recovery of the hematopoietic system and bone following exposure to an energy deficit, injury, or high-dose ionizing radiation. Excessive quantities of BMAT may be undesirable and could contribute to skeletal pathologies, including bone loss associated with aging and gonadal insufficiency [22,23]. This possibility is supported by studies showing an inverse relationship between BMAT levels and bone formation as well as between BMAT levels and bone mass [24,25,26,27]. Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells residing in bone marrow, suggesting that an increase in BMAT may reflect a shift in the differentiation program of mesenchymal stem cells from osteoblasts to adipocytes [28]. Studies investigating the physiological role of BMAT in skeletal biology and its possible contribution to disease have been largely observational and causality has not been established. We have used mouse models with BMAT deficiency to address some of the limitations of prior research. These include two mouse strains (KitSl/Sld and KitW/W-v having defects in expression of kit ligand and kit receptor, respectively), that do not accrue BMAT in their long bones or lumbar vertebrae [29]. Using female KitW/W-v mice, we showed that the well-established increase in BMAT following ovariectomy had no effect on bone loss [30]. In contrast, BMAT deficiency in male KitW/W-v mice was associated with enhanced bone loss during hindlimb unloading, suggesting BMAT had a protective action [31]. However, KitW/W-v and KitSl/Sld mouse strains have bone marrow and skeletal abnormalities that could be due to BMAT-independent effects of kit signaling deficiency [30,31,32]. To address this limitation, we have refined the BMAT-deficient mouse models by restoring kit signaling to select tissues, including bone [29,33]. The objectives of this investigation were to assess the importance of BMAT following severe injury in (1) supporting hematopoiesis and (2) maintaining bone turnover balance. To accomplish the first objective, we examined the extent of immune reconstitution in lethally irradiated WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice after adoptive transfer of purified green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive Kit+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To accomplish the second objective, we compared bone microarchitecture, turnover, and cell populations in WT and KitW/W-v mice following irradiation and adoptive transfer of WT HSCs. The experimental protocol is outlined in Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental protocol: Mice were randomized into 4 groups: GFP HSC → WT (n = 3), GFP HSC → KitW/W−v (n = 3), WT HSC → WT (n = 10), and WT HSC → KitW/W−v (n = 10), lethally irradiated, and injected with purified HSCs from donor GFP or WT mice. GFP HSC → WT and GFP HSC → KitW/W−v were maintained for 9 weeks with blood collected at 4 and 9 weeks post adoptive transfer. Mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow were collected at necropsy (2 days following 2nd blood collection) for assessment of GFP+ B and T cells. WT HSC → WT and WT HSC → KitW/W−v were maintained for 11 weeks. Fluorochromes were administered 4 days and 1 day prior to necropsy in WT HSC → WT and WT HSC → KitW/W−v mice to label mineralizing bone matrix. Humeri, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and femora were collected at necropsy for bone assessment using dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA; femur only), microcomputed tomography (μCT), and histomorphometry (femur only).",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Animals Four- to five-week-old male WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW−v/J (KitW/W−v) mice (n = 13) and their WT WBB6F1/J littermates (n = 13) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and used as adoptive transfer recipients. Additional WT and GFP-expressing (stock 006567 C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)131Osb/LeySopJ) mice were purchased as the source of bone marrow and as HSC donors. The experimental protocol (ACUP 4304) was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon State University. The mice were single-housed at 32 °C for the duration of the study. Housing mice at 32 °C (near thermoneutral temperature) has been shown to minimize resting energy expenditure and prevent cold stress-induced reductions in peak bone mass and premature (while still growing) age-associated cancellous bone loss [50]. 4.2. Experimental Protocol The experimental protocol is outlined in Figure 1. At 3 weeks following arrival, the mice were randomized into 4 groups: (1) GFP HSC → WT (n = 3), (2) GFP HSC → KitW/W−v (n = 3), (3) WT HSC → WT (n = 10), and (4) WT HSC → KitW/W−v (n = 10), and lethally irradiated (two split doses of 5 Gy each, 10 Gy total; Gammacell 220 60Co gamma irradiator). One day later, the mice were injected with purified HSCs from donor GFP or WT mice. Mice in groups 1 and 2 (GFP HSC → WT and GFP HSC → KitW/W−v, respectively) were maintained for 9 weeks. Mice in groups 3 and 4 (WT HSC → WT and WT HSC → KitW/W−v, respectively) were maintained for 11 weeks. Purified WT and GFP HSCs were prepared as follows: whole bone marrow cells were harvested from the femora and tibia of 12 WT donor mice and 3 GFP donor mice, respectively. Lineage-negative (lin−) cells were enriched from bone marrow cells using magnetic cell separation with MACS lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA, USA). Enriched lin− bone marrow cells were incubated with anti-CD117 (c-kit) and anti-Sca-1 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). HSCs (Lin−Sca-1+ Kit+) were purified from enriched lin− cells by flow cytometry and single-cell sorting using MoFlo XDP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Purified HSCs were resuspended in saline, and 200 μL containing 1000 donor HSCs was injected into the tail vein of each irradiated recipient mouse. The extent of cellular reconstitution of the hematopoietic compartment was determined by the presence of differentiated GFP+ immune cells in irradiated mice that received GFP HSC donor cells. GFP+ and GFP- B and T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry using B cell-specific (CD19) and T cell-specific (CD3) antibodies at 4 weeks and 9 weeks post adoptive transfer. Mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow were collected at necropsy (2 days following 2nd blood collection) and the percentage of GFP+ B and T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, as well as bone marrow, were evaluated. Mice (n = 2) that did not undergo adoptive transfer were used as immunostaining controls. Calcein (15 mg/kg) was administered by subcutaneous injection 4 days and 1 day prior to necropsy in group 3 and 4 mice (WT HSC → WT and WT HSC → KitW/W−v, respectively) to label mineralizing bone matrix. For tissue collection, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane anesthesia and then terminated by decapitation and exsanguination. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g), spleen weight (g), seminal vesicle weight (g), adrenal gland weight (g), and blood glucose (mg/dL) were recorded at necropsy. Humeri, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and femora were removed and placed in formalin for 24-h fixation, then stored at 4 °C in 70% ethanol prior to sequential analysis by dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA; femur only), microcomputed tomography (μCT), and histomorphometry (femur only). 4.3. Densitometry Total femur bone area (cm2), bone mineral content (g), and bone mineral density (g/cm2) were measured using DXA (PIXImus 2; Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). 4.4. Micro-Computed Tomography μCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of bone volume and architecture. Humeri, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and femora were scanned using a Scanco μCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 μm × 12 μm × 12 μm (55 kVp X-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). The filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0–1000). Cortical bone was evaluated in the humerus and femur diaphysis and cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal humerus epiphysis, vertebral body, and distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis (Figure 4). Assessment of cortical bone in the humerus and femur diaphysis began 60% distal to the top of the humeral/femoral head and consisted of 20 slices (240 µm) each. Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from the marrow cavity. All cortical slices were visually examined for evidence of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex and manually removed when present. Direct cortical bone measurements included total cross-sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (µm). Polar moment of inertia (Ipolar, mm4) was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Regions of interest evaluated in (A) humerus, (B) lumbar vertebra, and (C) femur.Assessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540 µm) proximal to the growth plate and included 40 slices (480 µm). The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal humerus epiphysis (23 ± 0.5 slices; 276 ± 6 µm), distal femur epiphysis (34 ± 0.5 slices; 408 ± 6 µm), and vertebral body (169 ± 1 slices; 2028 ± 12 µm). Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, 1/mm3), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, µm), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, 1/mm), and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, µm). 4.5. Histomorphometry The histological methods used have been described [31]. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene, then embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Four µm thick sections were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and fixed to slides with a dried precoated 1% gelatin solution. Unstained slides were used for measurements of fluorochrome labels. For cell-based measurements, slides were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femur metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. Dynamic (fluorochrome) histological measurements included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter; %), mineral apposition rate (distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3-day label interval; μm/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter; μm2/μm/year, bone area; %/year, and tissue area; %/year). Static (cell-based) histological measurements include bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, %), osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), and adipocyte size (μm2). Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase-positive (stained red) cytoplasm. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to a layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. 4.6. Statistical Analysis Mean outcomes for WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice were compared using Welch’s two-sample t-test or the distribution-free Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (when normality was violated). Residual analysis and Levene’s test were used to assess normality and homogeneity of variance. The Benjamini and Hochberg [51] method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. All data are presented as mean ± SE. Data analysis was performed using R version 4.1.2.",

Representative FACS plots of mesenteric lymph node immune cells in respective treatment groups showed extensive reconstitution of B and T cell compartments with donor-derived GFP+ immune cells in recipient mice 9 weeks following adoptive transfer (Figure 2A). Reconstitution of recipient mouse B cells and T cells with donor HSC-derived GFP+ B cells and T cells was in progress in both WT and KitW/W-v mice by 4 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer (Figure 2B). By 9 weeks, excellent reconstitution with donor-derived GFP+ B cells and T cells was observed in the blood (Figure 2C) and following necropsy in mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure 2D) in both WT and KitW/W-v mice. Additionally, GFP+ cells were common in bone marrow (Figure 2E), indicating efficient repopulation of bone marrow from donor HSCs. Notably, the magnitude of hematopoietic cell reconstitution did not differ significantly between WT and KitW/W-v mice. As expected, the control mice had no GFP-labeled cells. Figure 2.

Body Composition and Blood Glucose Levels The effects of adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into irradiated WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice on total body and selected organ weights and on blood glucose levels at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer are shown in Table 1. No significant differences in terminal body, spleen, or adrenal weights were noted and there was no difference in blood glucose levels at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer.

Static and Dynamic Histomorphometry The effects of irradiation/adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice on static and dynamic bone histomorphometry in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table 5. No differences were observed for bone area fraction, mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate, bone formation rates (perimeter, bone, and tissue referents), osteoclast-lined bone perimeter, or osteoblast-lined bone perimeter. Bone marrow adipocytes were common in WT mice but not detected in 8 out of 10 KitW/W-v mice; adipocytes were present in very low numbers in the remaining 2 KitW/W-v mice. Adipocyte area/tissue area and adipocyte density were much lower in BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice than in WT mice but the few adipocytes that were present did not differ in size from those present in WT mice. The pronounced difference in adiposity can be appreciated in representative photomicrographs from a WT and a BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mouse (Figure 3). Table 5.

    "discussion": "3. Discussion Adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT HSCs was effective in reconstituting the immune systems of both WT and KitW/W-v mice following lethal irradiation. In agreement with prior studies [31,33], adoptive transfer of WT HSCs did not result in accrual of BMAT in the femurs of KitW/W-v mice. Furthermore, the near absence of BMAT did not prevent equalization of most bone parameters, particularly for cancellous bone, between WT and KitW/W-v mice. KitW/W-v mice have a point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain that inactivates the kit receptor in one allele and a mutation in the other allele that prevents translocation of the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the cell surface [34]. Consequently, activation of the kit receptor by a kit ligand is greatly reduced but sufficient to allow for survival. The kit ligand is produced in two forms, as membrane-bound and as soluble. The Sl mutation in KitSl/Sld mice deletes the entire Sl (kit ligand) gene whereas the Steel-Dickie (Sld) mutation, resulting from an intragenic 4-kb deletion, removes sequences encoding transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, limiting expression of the gene to produce only a soluble form of kit ligand [35]. Male KitW/W-v mice, comparable in age (and housing conditions) to mice evaluated in the present study, had lower total body weight, WAT weight, and seminal vesicle weight and lower serum glucose levels compared to WT mice [31]. KitW/W-v mice also had a lower cancellous bone volume fraction and higher bone turnover in the distal femur metaphysis [31]. Other studies described osteopenia associated with abnormalities in bone turnover balance in female KitW/W-v mice [30] and male and female KitSl/Sld mice [32]. The differences between Kit signaling-deficient KitW/W-v and KitSl/Sld mice and WT controls reported in the literature contrast with the minimal differences at cancellous bone sites reported in this study following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs to normalize kit signaling. These findings suggest an important role for kit signaling in bone metabolism. However, they do not identify the underlying mechanisms or target cells. We have administered soluble kit ligand to KitSl/Sld mice and have successfully adoptively transferred purified WT HSCs to male and female KitW/W-v mice [29,31,33]. Neither approach resulted in the accrual of BMAT. However, a detailed comparison of the immune system and skeletal response of WT and KitW/W-v mice to the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs had not been performed. In the present study, we confirmed that rescue of kit signaling in KitW/W-v mice following adoptive transfer of WT HSCs does not result in the accrual of BMAT in the femur. On the other hand, normalization of kit signaling equalized many of the divergent bone parameters typically observed between WT and KitW/W-v mice. This latter finding argues in favor of defective HSC differentiation as the primary cause for the skeletal abnormalities in kit signaling-deficient mice. However, the findings do not rule out a role for BMAT in supporting hematopoiesis. There is strong in vitro evidence that adipocytes support the long-term survival of hematopoietic lineage cells via kit signaling [36] and a recent study concluded that lipolysis from BMAT is required to fuel bone cells and the marrow niche following energy deficits or injury [21]. However, weight loss due to a chronic energy deficit has highly variable effects on BMAT levels in humans as well as experimental animals [37,38]. Decreased weight due to involuntary caloric restriction often, but not always, leads to an increase in BMAT [37,39]. In contrast, weight loss resulting from increased hypothalamic leptin levels results in no change or decreased BMAT [40,41]. Additionally, the effects of injury induced by exposure to ionizing radiation on bone marrow adiposity are highly variable, ranging from no change to large increases [33,42]. This variability in response to irradiation may be due to radiation dose, skeletal site evaluated, or timing of measurement. The latter is likely important because high doses of ionizing radiation result in a rapid decrease in bone marrow cell density followed by gradual recovery [42]. Specifically, following a whole-body dose of 137Cs (6 Gy), bone marrow cell density declined by 77% after 1 day and 86% after 3 days. However, by 2 weeks post irradiation, recovery was well underway. Importantly, the effect of radiation on cells was not uniform; while total marrow cell numbers declined drastically post irradiation, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter increased [42]. Furthermore, neither bone marrow collapse nor early-stage recovery (2 weeks) was accompanied by increased BMAT. In contrast, we observed increased BMAT following a longer duration (8 week) recovery post lethal irradiation [33]. Taken together, these findings suggest BMAT levels are a marker of recovery and argue against the hypothesis that energy stored in BMAT is critical to support bone marrow recovery following radiation-induced injury. The present study directly tested the requirement for BMAT for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal (10 Gy) irradiation. Exposure to high-dose whole body radiation results in a large negative energy balance as well as massive cell death [42,43]. Despite the absence of BMAT, the reconstitution of lymphocyte cell populations in the present study with only 1000 donor GFP-expressing cells was similar in WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice. KitW/W-v mice are mast cell-deficient, and we detected mast cells on bone surfaces in these mice following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs, further supporting the successful restoration of normal hematopoietic cell differentiation. It is important to note that mesenchymal stem cells are radioresistant and, consequently, bone marrow cells expressing kit ligand are available to support hematopoiesis following irradiation. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that BMAT is not required for skeletal recovery from injury and energy deficit following exposure to high-dose radiation. It is well established that kit is expressed by HSCs and kit ligand by differentiated mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and adipocytes [32]. However, recent studies suggest that there are kit-expressing populations of mesenchymal cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts and adipocytes [44,45]. We previously demonstrated that the purified HSC population used for adoptive transfer can differentiate in vitro into osteoclasts but not osteoblasts or adipocytes [33]. We also demonstrated that inhibition of kit signaling with the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gleevec rapidly reduced marrow adipocyte area and density in rats, suggesting that maintenance of mature adipocytes in bone marrow requires kit signaling [29]. Further research is necessary to determine whether the adoptive transfer of kit-expressing WT mesenchymal cells restores the ability of KitW/W-v mice to accrue BMAT. This study has limitations. The present study was performed in male mice. However, we have previously shown that female KitW/W-v mice are also BMAT-deficient prior to and following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs [33]. Lymphocytes can influence bone metabolism [46,47] and mast cells have been implicated in diet-induced obesity and diabetes in mice [48]. Additionally, mast cells participate in several skeletal disorders, including parathyroid bone disease [49]. Further research will be required to tease out the contribution of specific immune cells to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice. Although we did not include unirradiated WT and KitW/W-v mice in the current analysis, the skeletal phenotypes of male and female KitW/W-v mice and KitS/Sld mice have been reported [30,31]. In summary, adoptive transfer of WT HSCs attenuated the skeletal differences between WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice, with the notable exception that mature adipocytes continued to be absent or very rare in the bone marrow of femurs of KitW/W-v mice. The absence of BMAT had little or no influence on the reconstitution of immune, osteoblast, or osteoclast cell populations following lethal radiation. Taken together, these findings indicate that BMAT is not required for recovery from severe bone marrow injury. Our findings also support the conclusion that kit signaling plays an important role in bone turnover balance in mice. Finally, the present studies demonstrate the value of BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice as a model for investigating the role of BMAT in bone physiology.",

Copyright notice ID: 10889206 PMID: 38396660 Abstract Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is hypothesized to serve as an expandable/contractible fat depot which functions, in part, to minimize energy requirements for sustaining optimal hematopoiesis. We investigated whether BMAT is required for immune reconstitution following injury. Male wild type (WBB6F1, WT) and BMAT-deficient WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW-v/J (KitW/W-v) mice were lethally irradiated. Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal response to treatment. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in KitW/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.

Introduction Bone marrow fat is an important depot for short- and long-duration storage of triglycerides. By middle age, bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in humans typically contributes 5–10% of total body adipose tissue [1]. Fat depots generally act as dynamic energy reserves in which fatty acids are taken up by adipocytes from lipoproteins and subsequently released into the general circulation following lipolysis. Although BMAT can be highly labile [2], in contrast to white adipose tissue (WAT), bone marrow adipocytes often increase in number and sequester and esterify fatty acids during energy deprivation, implying that the bone marrow fat depot does not necessarily function as a traditional energy reservoir for peripheral tissues [3]. The physiological function of BMAT as well as its role in chronic disease initiation and progression are topics of current interest and debate [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. We previously reviewed evidence that increased BMAT during fasting reflects an adaptive response to a negative energy balance [14]. An increase in BMAT and the resulting reduction in hematopoietic compartment size during long-duration fasting potentially promotes survival by lowering the energy expenditure required to maintain the turnover of hematopoietic cells. In support, age-related increases in BMAT and decreases in hematopoiesis are reversed by cold temperature stress, blood loss, and infection, conditions with increased requirement for hematopoiesis [15,16,17,18,19]. Mesenchymal lineage cells, including adipocytes, often express stem cell factor (kit ligand), the endogenous ligand for the protooncogene kit (CD117). Kit is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on early hematopoietic lineage cells and is required for their differentiation and survival [20]. In addition to regulating hematopoietic cell compartment size, it is possible that lipolysis of triglycerides stored in BMAT provides an energy source for hematopoietic cells. In this regard, Li et al. [21] concluded that BMAT is essential for recovery of the hematopoietic system and bone following exposure to an energy deficit, injury, or high-dose ionizing radiation. Excessive quantities of BMAT may be undesirable and could contribute to skeletal pathologies, including bone loss associated with aging and gonadal insufficiency [22,23]. This possibility is supported by studies showing an inverse relationship between BMAT levels and bone formation as well as between BMAT levels and bone mass [24,25,26,27]. Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells residing in bone marrow, suggesting that an increase in BMAT may reflect a shift in the differentiation program of mesenchymal stem cells from osteoblasts to adipocytes [28]. Studies investigating the physiological role of BMAT in skeletal biology and its possible contribution to disease have been largely observational and causality has not been established. We have used mouse models with BMAT deficiency to address some of the limitations of prior research. These include two mouse strains (KitSl/Sld and KitW/W-v having defects in expression of kit ligand and kit receptor, respectively), that do not accrue BMAT in their long bones or lumbar vertebrae [29]. Using female KitW/W-v mice, we showed that the well-established increase in BMAT following ovariectomy had no effect on bone loss [30]. In contrast, BMAT deficiency in male KitW/W-v mice was associated with enhanced bone loss during hindlimb unloading, suggesting BMAT had a protective action [31]. However, KitW/W-v and KitSl/Sld mouse strains have bone marrow and skeletal abnormalities that could be due to BMAT-independent effects of kit signaling deficiency [30,31,32]. To address this limitation, we have refined the BMAT-deficient mouse models by restoring kit signaling to select tissues, including bone [29,33]. The objectives of this investigation were to assess the importance of BMAT following severe injury in (1) supporting hematopoiesis and (2) maintaining bone turnover balance. To accomplish the first objective, we examined the extent of immune reconstitution in lethally irradiated WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice after adoptive transfer of purified green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive Kit+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To accomplish the second objective, we compared bone microarchitecture, turnover, and cell populations in WT and KitW/W-v mice following irradiation and adoptive transfer of WT HSCs. The experimental protocol is outlined in Figure 1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental protocol: Mice were randomized into 4 groups: GFP HSC → WT (n = 3), GFP HSC → KitW/W−v (n = 3), WT HSC → WT (n = 10), and WT HSC → KitW/W−v (n = 10), lethally irradiated, and injected with purified HSCs from donor GFP or WT mice. GFP HSC → WT and GFP HSC → KitW/W−v were maintained for 9 weeks with blood collected at 4 and 9 weeks post adoptive transfer. Mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow were collected at necropsy (2 days following 2nd blood collection) for assessment of GFP+ B and T cells. WT HSC → WT and WT HSC → KitW/W−v were maintained for 11 weeks. Fluorochromes were administered 4 days and 1 day prior to necropsy in WT HSC → WT and WT HSC → KitW/W−v mice to label mineralizing bone matrix. Humeri, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and femora were collected at necropsy for bone assessment using dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA; femur only), microcomputed tomography (μCT), and histomorphometry (femur only).2. Results 2.1. Immune Cell Reconstitution The time course for immune cell reconstitution is shown in Figure 2. Representative FACS plots of mesenteric lymph node immune cells in respective treatment groups showed extensive reconstitution of B and T cell compartments with donor-derived GFP+ immune cells in recipient mice 9 weeks following adoptive transfer (Figure 2A). Reconstitution of recipient mouse B cells and T cells with donor HSC-derived GFP+ B cells and T cells was in progress in both WT and KitW/W-v mice by 4 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer (Figure 2B). By 9 weeks, excellent reconstitution with donor-derived GFP+ B cells and T cells was observed in the blood (Figure 2C) and following necropsy in mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure 2D) in both WT and KitW/W-v mice. Additionally, GFP+ cells were common in bone marrow (Figure 2E), indicating efficient repopulation of bone marrow from donor HSCs. Notably, the magnitude of hematopoietic cell reconstitution did not differ significantly between WT and KitW/W-v mice. As expected, the control mice had no GFP-labeled cells. Figure 2.

Body Composition and Blood Glucose Levels The effects of adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into irradiated WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice on total body and selected organ weights and on blood glucose levels at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer are shown in Table 1. No significant differences in terminal body, spleen, or adrenal weights were noted and there was no difference in blood glucose levels at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer.

No differences were observed for femur bone area, BMC, or BMD between WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice. Femur length, total bone volume, and cortical thickness likewise did not differ between the two groups. However, compared to WT mice, BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice had lower cross-sectional, cortical, and marrow volume and lower polar moment of inertia. There were few differences in cancellous bone microarchitecture, the exceptions being that connectivity density in BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice was higher than in WT mice in distal femur metaphysis but lower in distal femur epiphysis.

Static and Dynamic Histomorphometry The effects of irradiation/adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice on static and dynamic bone histomorphometry in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table 5. No differences were observed for bone area fraction, mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate, bone formation rates (perimeter, bone, and tissue referents), osteoclast-lined bone perimeter, or osteoblast-lined bone perimeter. Bone marrow adipocytes were common in WT mice but not detected in 8 out of 10 KitW/W-v mice; adipocytes were present in very low numbers in the remaining 2 KitW/W-v mice. Adipocyte area/tissue area and adipocyte density were much lower in BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice than in WT mice but the few adipocytes that were present did not differ in size from those present in WT mice. The pronounced difference in adiposity can be appreciated in representative photomicrographs from a WT and a BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mouse (Figure 3). Table 5.

Please note the difference in BMAT between the 2 mice.3. Discussion Adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT HSCs was effective in reconstituting the immune systems of both WT and KitW/W-v mice following lethal irradiation. In agreement with prior studies [31,33], adoptive transfer of WT HSCs did not result in accrual of BMAT in the femurs of KitW/W-v mice. Furthermore, the near absence of BMAT did not prevent equalization of most bone parameters, particularly for cancellous bone, between WT and KitW/W-v mice. KitW/W-v mice have a point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain that inactivates the kit receptor in one allele and a mutation in the other allele that prevents translocation of the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the cell surface [34]. Consequently, activation of the kit receptor by a kit ligand is greatly reduced but sufficient to allow for survival. The kit ligand is produced in two forms, as membrane-bound and as soluble. The Sl mutation in KitSl/Sld mice deletes the entire Sl (kit ligand) gene whereas the Steel-Dickie (Sld) mutation, resulting from an intragenic 4-kb deletion, removes sequences encoding transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, limiting expression of the gene to produce only a soluble form of kit ligand [35]. Male KitW/W-v mice, comparable in age (and housing conditions) to mice evaluated in the present study, had lower total body weight, WAT weight, and seminal vesicle weight and lower serum glucose levels compared to WT mice [31]. KitW/W-v mice also had a lower cancellous bone volume fraction and higher bone turnover in the distal femur metaphysis [31]. Other studies described osteopenia associated with abnormalities in bone turnover balance in female KitW/W-v mice [30] and male and female KitSl/Sld mice [32]. The differences between Kit signaling-deficient KitW/W-v and KitSl/Sld mice and WT controls reported in the literature contrast with the minimal differences at cancellous bone sites reported in this study following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs to normalize kit signaling. These findings suggest an important role for kit signaling in bone metabolism. However, they do not identify the underlying mechanisms or target cells. We have administered soluble kit ligand to KitSl/Sld mice and have successfully adoptively transferred purified WT HSCs to male and female KitW/W-v mice [29,31,33]. Neither approach resulted in the accrual of BMAT. However, a detailed comparison of the immune system and skeletal response of WT and KitW/W-v mice to the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs had not been performed. In the present study, we confirmed that rescue of kit signaling in KitW/W-v mice following adoptive transfer of WT HSCs does not result in the accrual of BMAT in the femur. On the other hand, normalization of kit signaling equalized many of the divergent bone parameters typically observed between WT and KitW/W-v mice. This latter finding argues in favor of defective HSC differentiation as the primary cause for the skeletal abnormalities in kit signaling-deficient mice. However, the findings do not rule out a role for BMAT in supporting hematopoiesis. There is strong in vitro evidence that adipocytes support the long-term survival of hematopoietic lineage cells via kit signaling [36] and a recent study concluded that lipolysis from BMAT is required to fuel bone cells and the marrow niche following energy deficits or injury [21]. However, weight loss due to a chronic energy deficit has highly variable effects on BMAT levels in humans as well as experimental animals [37,38]. Decreased weight due to involuntary caloric restriction often, but not always, leads to an increase in BMAT [37,39]. In contrast, weight loss resulting from increased hypothalamic leptin levels results in no change or decreased BMAT [40,41]. Additionally, the effects of injury induced by exposure to ionizing radiation on bone marrow adiposity are highly variable, ranging from no change to large increases [33,42]. This variability in response to irradiation may be due to radiation dose, skeletal site evaluated, or timing of measurement. The latter is likely important because high doses of ionizing radiation result in a rapid decrease in bone marrow cell density followed by gradual recovery [42]. Specifically, following a whole-body dose of 137Cs (6 Gy), bone marrow cell density declined by 77% after 1 day and 86% after 3 days. However, by 2 weeks post irradiation, recovery was well underway. Importantly, the effect of radiation on cells was not uniform; while total marrow cell numbers declined drastically post irradiation, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter increased [42]. Furthermore, neither bone marrow collapse nor early-stage recovery (2 weeks) was accompanied by increased BMAT. In contrast, we observed increased BMAT following a longer duration (8 week) recovery post lethal irradiation [33]. Taken together, these findings suggest BMAT levels are a marker of recovery and argue against the hypothesis that energy stored in BMAT is critical to support bone marrow recovery following radiation-induced injury. The present study directly tested the requirement for BMAT for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal (10 Gy) irradiation. Exposure to high-dose whole body radiation results in a large negative energy balance as well as massive cell death [42,43]. Despite the absence of BMAT, the reconstitution of lymphocyte cell populations in the present study with only 1000 donor GFP-expressing cells was similar in WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice. KitW/W-v mice are mast cell-deficient, and we detected mast cells on bone surfaces in these mice following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs, further supporting the successful restoration of normal hematopoietic cell differentiation. It is important to note that mesenchymal stem cells are radioresistant and, consequently, bone marrow cells expressing kit ligand are available to support hematopoiesis following irradiation. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that BMAT is not required for skeletal recovery from injury and energy deficit following exposure to high-dose radiation. It is well established that kit is expressed by HSCs and kit ligand by differentiated mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and adipocytes [32]. However, recent studies suggest that there are kit-expressing populations of mesenchymal cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts and adipocytes [44,45]. We previously demonstrated that the purified HSC population used for adoptive transfer can differentiate in vitro into osteoclasts but not osteoblasts or adipocytes [33]. We also demonstrated that inhibition of kit signaling with the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gleevec rapidly reduced marrow adipocyte area and density in rats, suggesting that maintenance of mature adipocytes in bone marrow requires kit signaling [29]. Further research is necessary to determine whether the adoptive transfer of kit-expressing WT mesenchymal cells restores the ability of KitW/W-v mice to accrue BMAT. This study has limitations. The present study was performed in male mice. However, we have previously shown that female KitW/W-v mice are also BMAT-deficient prior to and following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs [33]. Lymphocytes can influence bone metabolism [46,47] and mast cells have been implicated in diet-induced obesity and diabetes in mice [48]. Additionally, mast cells participate in several skeletal disorders, including parathyroid bone disease [49]. Further research will be required to tease out the contribution of specific immune cells to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice. Although we did not include unirradiated WT and KitW/W-v mice in the current analysis, the skeletal phenotypes of male and female KitW/W-v mice and KitS/Sld mice have been reported [30,31]. In summary, adoptive transfer of WT HSCs attenuated the skeletal differences between WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice, with the notable exception that mature adipocytes continued to be absent or very rare in the bone marrow of femurs of KitW/W-v mice. The absence of BMAT had little or no influence on the reconstitution of immune, osteoblast, or osteoclast cell populations following lethal radiation. Taken together, these findings indicate that BMAT is not required for recovery from severe bone marrow injury. Our findings also support the conclusion that kit signaling plays an important role in bone turnover balance in mice. Finally, the present studies demonstrate the value of BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice as a model for investigating the role of BMAT in bone physiology.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Animals Four- to five-week-old male WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW−v/J (KitW/W−v) mice (n = 13) and their WT WBB6F1/J littermates (n = 13) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and used as adoptive transfer recipients. Additional WT and GFP-expressing (stock 006567 C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)131Osb/LeySopJ) mice were purchased as the source of bone marrow and as HSC donors. The experimental protocol (ACUP 4304) was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon State University. The mice were single-housed at 32 °C for the duration of the study. Housing mice at 32 °C (near thermoneutral temperature) has been shown to minimize resting energy expenditure and prevent cold stress-induced reductions in peak bone mass and premature (while still growing) age-associated cancellous bone loss [50].4.2. Experimental Protocol The experimental protocol is outlined in Figure 1. At 3 weeks following arrival, the mice were randomized into 4 groups: (1) GFP HSC → WT (n = 3), (2) GFP HSC → KitW/W−v (n = 3), (3) WT HSC → WT (n = 10), and (4) WT HSC → KitW/W−v (n = 10), and lethally irradiated (two split doses of 5 Gy each, 10 Gy total; Gammacell 220 60Co gamma irradiator). One day later, the mice were injected with purified HSCs from donor GFP or WT mice. Mice in groups 1 and 2 (GFP HSC → WT and GFP HSC → KitW/W−v, respectively) were maintained for 9 weeks. Mice in groups 3 and 4 (WT HSC → WT and WT HSC → KitW/W−v, respectively) were maintained for 11 weeks. Purified WT and GFP HSCs were prepared as follows: whole bone marrow cells were harvested from the femora and tibia of 12 WT donor mice and 3 GFP donor mice, respectively. Lineage-negative (lin−) cells were enriched from bone marrow cells using magnetic cell separation with MACS lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA, USA). Enriched lin− bone marrow cells were incubated with anti-CD117 (c-kit) and anti-Sca-1 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). HSCs (Lin−Sca-1+ Kit+) were purified from enriched lin− cells by flow cytometry and single-cell sorting using MoFlo XDP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Purified HSCs were resuspended in saline, and 200 μL containing 1000 donor HSCs was injected into the tail vein of each irradiated recipient mouse. The extent of cellular reconstitution of the hematopoietic compartment was determined by the presence of differentiated GFP+ immune cells in irradiated mice that received GFP HSC donor cells. GFP+ and GFP- B and T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry using B cell-specific (CD19) and T cell-specific (CD3) antibodies at 4 weeks and 9 weeks post adoptive transfer. Mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow were collected at necropsy (2 days following 2nd blood collection) and the percentage of GFP+ B and T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, as well as bone marrow, were evaluated. Mice (n = 2) that did not undergo adoptive transfer were used as immunostaining controls. Calcein (15 mg/kg) was administered by subcutaneous injection 4 days and 1 day prior to necropsy in group 3 and 4 mice (WT HSC → WT and WT HSC → KitW/W−v, respectively) to label mineralizing bone matrix. For tissue collection, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane anesthesia and then terminated by decapitation and exsanguination. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g), spleen weight (g), seminal vesicle weight (g), adrenal gland weight (g), and blood glucose (mg/dL) were recorded at necropsy. Humeri, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and femora were removed and placed in formalin for 24-h fixation, then stored at 4 °C in 70% ethanol prior to sequential analysis by dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA; femur only), microcomputed tomography (μCT), and histomorphometry (femur only).4.3. Densitometry Total femur bone area (cm2), bone mineral content (g), and bone mineral density (g/cm2) were measured using DXA (PIXImus 2; Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).4.4. Micro-Computed Tomography μCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of bone volume and architecture. Humeri, 5th lumbar vertebrae, and femora were scanned using a Scanco μCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 μm × 12 μm × 12 μm (55 kVp X-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). The filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0–1000). Cortical bone was evaluated in the humerus and femur diaphysis and cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal humerus epiphysis, vertebral body, and distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis (Figure 4). Assessment of cortical bone in the humerus and femur diaphysis began 60% distal to the top of the humeral/femoral head and consisted of 20 slices (240 µm) each. Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from the marrow cavity. All cortical slices were visually examined for evidence of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex and manually removed when present. Direct cortical bone measurements included total cross-sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (µm). Polar moment of inertia (Ipolar, mm4) was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Regions of interest evaluated in (A) humerus, (B) lumbar vertebra, and (C) femur.Assessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540 µm) proximal to the growth plate and included 40 slices (480 µm). The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal humerus epiphysis (23 ± 0.5 slices; 276 ± 6 µm), distal femur epiphysis (34 ± 0.5 slices; 408 ± 6 µm), and vertebral body (169 ± 1 slices; 2028 ± 12 µm). Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, 1/mm3), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, µm), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, 1/mm), and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, µm).4.5. Histomorphometry The histological methods used have been described [31]. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene, then embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Four µm thick sections were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and fixed to slides with a dried precoated 1% gelatin solution. Unstained slides were used for measurements of fluorochrome labels. For cell-based measurements, slides were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femur metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. Dynamic (fluorochrome) histological measurements included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter; %), mineral apposition rate (distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3-day label interval; μm/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter; μm2/μm/year, bone area; %/year, and tissue area; %/year). Static (cell-based) histological measurements include bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, %), osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), and adipocyte size (μm2). Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase-positive (stained red) cytoplasm. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to a layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing.4.6. Statistical Analysis Mean outcomes for WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice were compared using Welch’s two-sample t-test or the distribution-free Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (when normality was violated). Residual analysis and Levene’s test were used to assess normality and homogeneity of variance. The Benjamini and Hochberg [51] method for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. All data are presented as mean ± SE. Data analysis was performed using R version 4.1.2.Author Contributions J.A.K.: Investigation, Writing—Review and Editing; C.P.W.: Investigation, Visualization, Writing—Review and Editing; A.J.B.: Formal Analysis, Writing—Review and Editing; S.A.M.: Resources, Writing—Review and Editing; U.T.I.: Funding Acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing—Review and Editing; R.T.T.: Conceptualization, Funding Acquisition, Investigation, Project Administration, Supervision, Writing—Original Draft, Writing—Review and Editing.

    "title": "Simulated Microgravity Promotes Horizontal Gene Transfer of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes between Bacterial Genera in the Absence of Antibiotic Selective Pressure",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468678/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments through many mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could occur in space, biosafety level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth with concomitant 1G controls. Two AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter pittii, were tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. All four S. aureus strains that were co-cultured with A. pittii under SMG had a significantly higher number of isolates that were now blaOXA-500- and ISAba1-positive compared to growth at 1G. The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic change, as these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible to. This is a novel study, presenting, for the first time, increased HGT activity under SMG and the potential impact of the space environment in promoting increased gene dissemination within bacterial communities. Keywords: horizontal gene transfer, simulated microgravity, high aspect ratio vessel (HARV), antimicrobial resistance, space environment, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter pittii",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Bacteria are able to adapt to a wide variety of conditions, as evidenced by their survival and growth in extreme environments, such as the arid Atacama desert [1], hypersaline salt mines and lakes [2,3], acidic rocks in the Yellowstone geothermal environment [4], and the multi-stressor environment of Antarctica [5]. Bacterial communities have also been found beyond the Earth’s surface on the International Space Station (ISS), a low-gravity, high-radiation, hermetically sealed built environment [6]. The microbial communities characterized here consist of environmental organisms, human-associated commensal bacteria and biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) microbes, resistant to various antibiotics, and carrying numerous anti-microbial resistance genes [7,8,9]. This resistance could potentially pose a serious threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions, as medical attention would not be readily available. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the movement of genetic material (i.e., DNA) between microorganisms through either transformation, conjugation or transduction, and is considered to be central to microbial evolution [10,11]. In dynamic mixed communities, either human or environmental, HGT between species may confer an overall fitness advantage to the community, as the acquisition of new traits in individual cells within that community allows them to better adapt to changing conditions [12,13,14,15]. In other cases, HGT may have an unfavorable effect if it leads to an excessive accumulation of genes, or a neutral one [16], if there is no impact on the fitness of the organism [16]. In a recent study comparing bacteria from two extreme built environments, one on Earth (Concordia Research Station in Antarctica) and one in space (International Space Station), a comparison between isolates of the same species showed that those from the International Space Station (ISS) had more mobile genetic elements within their genomes than those from Concordia [17]. In a follow-up analysis conducted by our group using the ISS resistome and microbiome data presented by Urbaniak et al. 2018 [7], we performed a series of correlation analyses to determine which antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were associated with which species. Interestingly, no statistically significant correlations were found. These data, coupled by the Concordia/ISS study, led us to hypothesize that the stressors of the ISS, specifically microgravity, promote enhanced HGT between organisms, compared to what would be observed on Earth. To address this hypothesis, co-cultures between donor and recipient strains were grown under simulated microgravity (SMG) (which we used as a proxy for µgravity conditions on the ISS) and normal gravity (1G), using the high-aspect-ratio vessel (HARV), with gene transfer tracked using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The donor and recipient strains were Acinetobacter pittii (strain IIF1SW-P1) and Staphylococcus aureus (strains IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW), respectively. All strains were previously isolated from various locations on the ISS as part of the Microbial-1 Tracking study [8]. A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 was chosen as the donor, since it was previously shown by our group to be resistant to oxacillin and contained the chromosomally located blaOXA-500 gene within its genome [7], a beta-lactamase which alone can confer resistance to oxacillin [18]. The four S. aureus strains, IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW, were chosen as recipients because they were susceptible to oxacillin and harbored neither the blaOXA-500 gene nor any other beta-lactamase genes [7]. The donor, A. pittii, harbored ISAba1, a transposable element that can jump between segments of the genome and, in some cases, can act as a promoter region for blaOXA genes, allowing for increased resistance to oxacillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics [19,20]. ISAba1 was not found in either of the recipient S. aureus strains. HGT ability was, therefore, tracked between A. pittii and S. aureus using the AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1.",
    "methods": "2. Methods 2.1. Co-Culture Experiments All strains examined in this study were cultivated from the ISS environment collected during Flight 2 (May 2015) as per the published protocol [8]. A. pittii strain, IIF1SW-P1, was isolated at Location #1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. S. aureus strain IF4SW was isolated from Location #4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the table was for dining, crew members also used the table for experimental work. S. aureus strain IIF6SW was cultured from the sample collected at Location #6, a stowage rack where experimental materials were stored for long duration. S. aureus strain IF7SW was isolated from Location #7, an overhead three-panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1, which is used for basic material research in the microgravity environment of the ISS. S. aureus strain IIF8SW was retrieved from the samples at Location #8, an exterior aft wall of crew quarters. The crew quarters are a permanent personal space for crewmembers to sleep and perform personal recreation and communication, as well as provide on-orbit stowage of personal belongings. Donor (A. pittii strain IIF1SW-P1) and recipient (S. aureus strains IF4SW-P1, IIF6SW-P1, IF7SW-P3, IIF8SW-P1) bacteria were streaked from −80 °C freezer stocks onto tryptic soy agar plates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) and incubated overnight (~16 h) at 37 °C. A single colony from each plate was added to 10 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) in a 50 mL Falcon tube for S. aureus, and 8 mL of TSB in a snap cap tube for A. pittii and grown overnight (~20 h) in a shaking incubator at 85 rpm. A low speed was chosen, so as to not dislodge pili or flagella that could be used for HGT, but high enough that the bacteria did not settle out of culture over time. The overnight culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000× g, the supernatant decanted, and the pellet washed in 1× sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Pellets were then resuspended in 10 mL of 1× PBS. For S. aureus, 1 mL was then transferred to 9 mL of PBS and, for A. pittii, the tube was topped with 3 mL of PBS. The biomass of the cultures was measured with DENSICHEK® (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) and adjusted with PBS to reach a concentration of 108 cfu/mL, which was then serially diluted to 106 cfu/mL. 100 µL of one S. aureus recipient strain was added to 10 mL of TSB and 100 µL of the donor A. pittii was added to the same 10 mL tube to set up the co-cultures. After gentle mixing, the complete 10 mL volume containing the donor and recipient was carefully added to HARVs to avoid any bubbles. HARVs were grown under SMG (vertical position) and 1G (horizontal position) at 33 rpm for 20 h at 37 °C. 2.2. Isolation of Colonies after HARV Growth After incubation, the liquid from each HARV vessel was collected and 100 µL, in duplicate, was plated on MSA (selective for S. aureus) (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA), MSA+ 4 µg/mL oxacillin sodium salt monohydrate (VWR, USA) (selective for S. aureus that had become resistant to oxacillin) and Leeds agar (selective for A. pittii) (VWR, USA). MSA and Leeds plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and MSA+ oxacillin plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Colonies on MSA, MSA+ oxacillin, and Leeds plates were counted, and cfu/mL was calculated. Colonies that grew on MSA+ oxacillin plates were picked and placed in 250 µL 1× PBS and stored at 4 °C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep Kit (ZymoResearch, Irvine, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.3. Designing Primers Primers were designed using the A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 draft genome that we had previously published, in which blaOXA-500 gene resides on scaffold 5 and ISAba1 gene on both scaffolds 44 and 70 [21]. Primers were designed using IDT DNA PrimerQuest for genes of interest. IDT DNA OligoAnalyzer was used to ensure no hairpins and correct PCR melting temperature.  BLAST was used to ensure no off-target binding sites for strains used in this study. Amplification product of the primers for blaOXA-500 and the location within the genome is shown in Figure S3A and for ISAba1, in Figure S3B in Supplementary Materials. The product size of blaOXA-500 is 591 bp and for ISAba1, is 390 bp. 2.4. PCR Each 25-μL reaction consisted of 12.5 μL of GoTaq® Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 1 μL each of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (10 μM each), 5.5 µL of nuclease free water (Promega, USA) and 5 μL of template DNA. The following primer pairs were used: blaOXA-500_F (5′-CCGAGTTGTTCCAATCCCTTAT-3′) and blaOXA-500_R (5′-ATATGTTCCCGCCTCTACCT-3′) to amplify blaOXA-500 and ISAba1_F (5′-ATGCAGCGCTTCTTTGCAGG-3′) and ISAba1_R (5′-AATGATTGGTGACAATGAAG-3′) to amplify ISAba1. The reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min and then a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min. Amplified PCR products were run on the E-Gel™ Power Snap Electrophoresis System (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, MA, USA, cat # G8300) using their pre-cast 1.2% SYBR Safe, E-gels (cat # G521801). Gels were run with a 1 Kb plus DNA ladder (cat # 10488090). Gel images were captured with the built-in camera. The positive control consisted of DNA isolated from the parental A. pittii strain and the negative controls were DNA isolated from the parental S. aureus strains. A no-template control (NTC) consisting of molecular-grade water instead of DNA was used. For PCR reactions that were negative, a follow-up PCR was performed using the 16S rRNA gene to confirm that the DNA extraction procedure produced sufficient DNA. The following primers were used for 16S rRNA gene amplification: the forward primer, 27F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′) and the reverse primer, 1492R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 50 s, annealing at 55 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s and finalized by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR with the 16S rRNA gene showed that all our samples did indeed have the DNA product and that extraction was successful. 2.5. Calculating the Efficiency of Gene Transfer The number of colonies that had grown on MSA+ oxacillin and were positive for at least one gene (blaOXA-500 or ISAba1) was divided by 0.1 mL (the volume of the HARV culture used for plating). This number represents the theoretical concentration (cfu/mL) of cells in the culture that have acquired one of the genes. This number was then divided by the total concentration of S. aureus cells (cfu/mL) in the culture, which was calculated from the number of colonies that grew on MSA. 2.6. Chromosome vs. Plasmid Location of blaOXA-500 Others have documented in the literature that blaOXA-500 is located on the chromosome and is not a plasmid. To confirm that the same was true for our donor strain, A. pittii IIF1SW-P1, the following analyses were performed. plasmidSPAdes was used to assemble plasmid sequences from the whole genome-sequencing data of our strain. A simple blastn comparison between the blaOXA-500 sequence and the plasmid sequences showed the absence of the gene from the plasmid-assembled contigs. Furthermore, oriTfinder was used to determine whether scaffold_5 (length = 172 kb), on which blaOXA-500 was found, as well as the assembled sequences not characterized as plasmid sequences (from the plasmidSPAdes output above), contained evidence of plasmid markers, such as an origin of transfer site (oriT) and relaxases. None of these plasmid markers were detected on scaffold_5 and the “chromosomal” sequences.",

Results In order to determine whether HGT occurred between donor and recipient, suitable PCR primers were designed to amplify regions of the blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 genes from A. pittii IIF1SW-P1. The sequences of the two genes, used to design the primers, were extracted from the draft whole-genome sequence of A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 [21]. PCR analysis performed on DNA isolated from A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 using the designed blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 primers showed strong bands on an agarose gel, while PCR analysis performed on DNA isolated from the four S. aureus strains showed no amplicons. To compare HGT potential between SMG and 1G, co-cultures of A. pittii (donor strain) and S. aureus (recipient strain) were grown in the HARV under SMG (vertical rotation) or 1G (horizontal rotation) for 20 h, after which the culture was plated on mannitol salt agar (MSA) to select for S. aureus. The MSA was also supplemented with oxacillin to select only those S. aureus colonies that had acquired resistance to the antibiotic. To verify that this newly acquired resistance to oxacillin was not due to spontaneous mutations but rather through the HGT of blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 from A. pittii, the S. aureus colonies that grew on MSA supplemented with oxacillin were picked for PCR analysis.

On average, 77% of the S. aureus colonies that were grown with A. pittii under SMG and had acquired resistance to oxacillin now harbored both blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 (89% of the colonies had acquired at least one). This is in contrast with 1G, where only 1% of S. aureus colonies that had acquired oxacillin resistance were positive for both blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 (8% of the colonies had acquired at least one). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Comparison of HGT activity between SMG and 1G.

Cultures were plated on MSA containing 4 µg/mL of oxacillin. Colonies that grew were picked, subjected to DNA extraction and then analyzed by PCR with primers specific to blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 from the donor strain.

The differences in proportions observed between SMG and 1G were not due to differences in growth at these different conditions, as each strain showed the same biomass after 20 h, whether grown under SMG or 1G (Figure S2). The efficiency of transfer under SMG for all four strains was, on average, 3.06 × 10−7 while, for 1G, it was 3.21 × 10−9 (Table 1).

    "discussion": "4. Discussion We have shown that HGT is increased under SMG compared to 1G. The transfer of AMR genes, which were tracked by PCR, occurred in the absence of selective pressure by antibiotics. This transfer led to functional changes, as the acquisition of the two AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, that were tracked in the four strains of S. aureus, made them resistant to oxacillin, to which they were previously susceptible. These results have significant implications for long-duration space missions because pathogens that are susceptible to antibiotics could become resistant and thus harder to treat. In addition, even if astronauts are screened for problematic microbes prior to flight, issues could still arise, as commensals are known to act as reservoirs for AMR genes that can be disseminated to (opportunistic) pathogens [22,23,24]. For example, a study conducted in a hospital in the Netherlands showed that mecA gene transfer occurred in a patient between mecA+ S. epidermidis and a mecA− strain of S. aureus [25]. It was beyond the scope of the study to determine the cause of the increased HGT that was observed, but one mechanism could be increased competence, allowing for transformation to occur, one of three modes of gene transfer. Competence allows bacterial cells to uptake DNA from its environment and increase the response to different stressors [26,27,28,29]. In this case, naked DNA released from dead A. pittii cells could have been readily taken up by S. aureus when exposed to SMG due to an increase in its competence. While S. aureus is not classically considered to be naturally competent, as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis are, it does harbor genes that are involved in competence and thought to promote natural competence under the right conditions [30,31]. The conditions that S. aureus needs are not yet known, but, similar to other bacteria, it could be an adverse environment. Indeed, when S. aureus cells were subjected to heat-shock, cold-shock and the stringent response, there was increased expression of competence gene orthologs compared to the non-stressed conditions [32]. In S. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, competence confers a survival advantage when cells are subjected to stress [33,34], so there is a possibility that growth under SMG led to an adverse environment for S. aureus, causing cells to become more competent to increase survival. Conjugation is a less likely scenario since, consistent with what others have documented in the literature, blaOXA-500 is located on the chromosome and not a plasmid. A second mechanism could be increased transduction caused by growth under SMG. Transduction is the transfer of genetic material via bacterial phages. It is well known that prophage activity is increased during stress, leading to increased phage production, helping the host survive these adverse conditions [35,36].",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions This paper describes, for the first time, the effects of SMG on HGT and has shown that it is increased in SMG compared to 1G. If the same trend is observed on the ISS, this will have a significant impact on how we view bacterial interactions in space and its effects on astronaut health. The next steps would be to elucidate the mechanisms behind the HGT, to develop appropriate countermeasures for long-duration space missions.",

Copyright notice ID: 8468678 PMID: 34575109 Abstract Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments through many mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could occur in space, biosafety level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth with concomitant 1G controls. Two AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter pittii, were tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. All four S. aureus strains that were co-cultured with A. pittii under SMG had a significantly higher number of isolates that were now blaOXA-500- and ISAba1-positive compared to growth at 1G. The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic change, as these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible to. This is a novel study, presenting, for the first time, increased HGT activity under SMG and the potential impact of the space environment in promoting increased gene dissemination within bacterial communities. Keywords: horizontal gene transfer, simulated microgravity, high aspect ratio vessel (HARV), antimicrobial resistance, space environment, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter pittii1. Introduction Bacteria are able to adapt to a wide variety of conditions, as evidenced by their survival and growth in extreme environments, such as the arid Atacama desert [1], hypersaline salt mines and lakes [2,3], acidic rocks in the Yellowstone geothermal environment [4], and the multi-stressor environment of Antarctica [5]. Bacterial communities have also been found beyond the Earth’s surface on the International Space Station (ISS), a low-gravity, high-radiation, hermetically sealed built environment [6]. The microbial communities characterized here consist of environmental organisms, human-associated commensal bacteria and biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) microbes, resistant to various antibiotics, and carrying numerous anti-microbial resistance genes [7,8,9]. This resistance could potentially pose a serious threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions, as medical attention would not be readily available. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the movement of genetic material (i.e., DNA) between microorganisms through either transformation, conjugation or transduction, and is considered to be central to microbial evolution [10,11]. In dynamic mixed communities, either human or environmental, HGT between species may confer an overall fitness advantage to the community, as the acquisition of new traits in individual cells within that community allows them to better adapt to changing conditions [12,13,14,15]. In other cases, HGT may have an unfavorable effect if it leads to an excessive accumulation of genes, or a neutral one [16], if there is no impact on the fitness of the organism [16]. In a recent study comparing bacteria from two extreme built environments, one on Earth (Concordia Research Station in Antarctica) and one in space (International Space Station), a comparison between isolates of the same species showed that those from the International Space Station (ISS) had more mobile genetic elements within their genomes than those from Concordia [17]. In a follow-up analysis conducted by our group using the ISS resistome and microbiome data presented by Urbaniak et al. 2018 [7], we performed a series of correlation analyses to determine which antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were associated with which species. Interestingly, no statistically significant correlations were found. These data, coupled by the Concordia/ISS study, led us to hypothesize that the stressors of the ISS, specifically microgravity, promote enhanced HGT between organisms, compared to what would be observed on Earth. To address this hypothesis, co-cultures between donor and recipient strains were grown under simulated microgravity (SMG) (which we used as a proxy for µgravity conditions on the ISS) and normal gravity (1G), using the high-aspect-ratio vessel (HARV), with gene transfer tracked using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The donor and recipient strains were Acinetobacter pittii (strain IIF1SW-P1) and Staphylococcus aureus (strains IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW), respectively. All strains were previously isolated from various locations on the ISS as part of the Microbial-1 Tracking study [8]. A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 was chosen as the donor, since it was previously shown by our group to be resistant to oxacillin and contained the chromosomally located blaOXA-500 gene within its genome [7], a beta-lactamase which alone can confer resistance to oxacillin [18]. The four S. aureus strains, IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW, were chosen as recipients because they were susceptible to oxacillin and harbored neither the blaOXA-500 gene nor any other beta-lactamase genes [7]. The donor, A. pittii, harbored ISAba1, a transposable element that can jump between segments of the genome and, in some cases, can act as a promoter region for blaOXA genes, allowing for increased resistance to oxacillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics [19,20]. ISAba1 was not found in either of the recipient S. aureus strains. HGT ability was, therefore, tracked between A. pittii and S. aureus using the AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1.2. Methods 2.1. Co-Culture Experiments All strains examined in this study were cultivated from the ISS environment collected during Flight 2 (May 2015) as per the published protocol [8]. A. pittii strain, IIF1SW-P1, was isolated at Location #1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. S. aureus strain IF4SW was isolated from Location #4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the table was for dining, crew members also used the table for experimental work. S. aureus strain IIF6SW was cultured from the sample collected at Location #6, a stowage rack where experimental materials were stored for long duration. S. aureus strain IF7SW was isolated from Location #7, an overhead three-panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1, which is used for basic material research in the microgravity environment of the ISS. S. aureus strain IIF8SW was retrieved from the samples at Location #8, an exterior aft wall of crew quarters. The crew quarters are a permanent personal space for crewmembers to sleep and perform personal recreation and communication, as well as provide on-orbit stowage of personal belongings. Donor (A. pittii strain IIF1SW-P1) and recipient (S. aureus strains IF4SW-P1, IIF6SW-P1, IF7SW-P3, IIF8SW-P1) bacteria were streaked from −80 °C freezer stocks onto tryptic soy agar plates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) and incubated overnight (~16 h) at 37 °C. A single colony from each plate was added to 10 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) in a 50 mL Falcon tube for S. aureus, and 8 mL of TSB in a snap cap tube for A. pittii and grown overnight (~20 h) in a shaking incubator at 85 rpm. A low speed was chosen, so as to not dislodge pili or flagella that could be used for HGT, but high enough that the bacteria did not settle out of culture over time. The overnight culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000× g, the supernatant decanted, and the pellet washed in 1× sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Pellets were then resuspended in 10 mL of 1× PBS. For S. aureus, 1 mL was then transferred to 9 mL of PBS and, for A. pittii, the tube was topped with 3 mL of PBS. The biomass of the cultures was measured with DENSICHEK® (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) and adjusted with PBS to reach a concentration of 108 cfu/mL, which was then serially diluted to 106 cfu/mL. 100 µL of one S. aureus recipient strain was added to 10 mL of TSB and 100 µL of the donor A. pittii was added to the same 10 mL tube to set up the co-cultures. After gentle mixing, the complete 10 mL volume containing the donor and recipient was carefully added to HARVs to avoid any bubbles. HARVs were grown under SMG (vertical position) and 1G (horizontal position) at 33 rpm for 20 h at 37 °C.2.2. Isolation of Colonies after HARV Growth After incubation, the liquid from each HARV vessel was collected and 100 µL, in duplicate, was plated on MSA (selective for S. aureus) (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA), MSA+ 4 µg/mL oxacillin sodium salt monohydrate (VWR, USA) (selective for S. aureus that had become resistant to oxacillin) and Leeds agar (selective for A. pittii) (VWR, USA). MSA and Leeds plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and MSA+ oxacillin plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Colonies on MSA, MSA+ oxacillin, and Leeds plates were counted, and cfu/mL was calculated. Colonies that grew on MSA+ oxacillin plates were picked and placed in 250 µL 1× PBS and stored at 4 °C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep Kit (ZymoResearch, Irvine, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.2.3. Designing Primers Primers were designed using the A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 draft genome that we had previously published, in which blaOXA-500 gene resides on scaffold 5 and ISAba1 gene on both scaffolds 44 and 70 [21]. Primers were designed using IDT DNA PrimerQuest for genes of interest. IDT DNA OligoAnalyzer was used to ensure no hairpins and correct PCR melting temperature.  BLAST was used to ensure no off-target binding sites for strains used in this study. Amplification product of the primers for blaOXA-500 and the location within the genome is shown in Figure S3A and for ISAba1, in Figure S3B in Supplementary Materials. The product size of blaOXA-500 is 591 bp and for ISAba1, is 390 bp.2.4. PCR Each 25-μL reaction consisted of 12.5 μL of GoTaq® Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 1 μL each of forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers (10 μM each), 5.5 µL of nuclease free water (Promega, USA) and 5 μL of template DNA. The following primer pairs were used: blaOXA-500_F (5′-CCGAGTTGTTCCAATCCCTTAT-3′) and blaOXA-500_R (5′-ATATGTTCCCGCCTCTACCT-3′) to amplify blaOXA-500 and ISAba1_F (5′-ATGCAGCGCTTCTTTGCAGG-3′) and ISAba1_R (5′-AATGATTGGTGACAATGAAG-3′) to amplify ISAba1. The reaction conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min and then a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min. Amplified PCR products were run on the E-Gel™ Power Snap Electrophoresis System (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, MA, USA, cat # G8300) using their pre-cast 1.2% SYBR Safe, E-gels (cat # G521801). Gels were run with a 1 Kb plus DNA ladder (cat # 10488090). Gel images were captured with the built-in camera. The positive control consisted of DNA isolated from the parental A. pittii strain and the negative controls were DNA isolated from the parental S. aureus strains. A no-template control (NTC) consisting of molecular-grade water instead of DNA was used. For PCR reactions that were negative, a follow-up PCR was performed using the 16S rRNA gene to confirm that the DNA extraction procedure produced sufficient DNA. The following primers were used for 16S rRNA gene amplification: the forward primer, 27F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′) and the reverse primer, 1492R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 50 s, annealing at 55 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s and finalized by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR with the 16S rRNA gene showed that all our samples did indeed have the DNA product and that extraction was successful.2.5. Calculating the Efficiency of Gene Transfer The number of colonies that had grown on MSA+ oxacillin and were positive for at least one gene (blaOXA-500 or ISAba1) was divided by 0.1 mL (the volume of the HARV culture used for plating). This number represents the theoretical concentration (cfu/mL) of cells in the culture that have acquired one of the genes. This number was then divided by the total concentration of S. aureus cells (cfu/mL) in the culture, which was calculated from the number of colonies that grew on MSA.2.6. Chromosome vs. Plasmid Location of blaOXA-500 Others have documented in the literature that blaOXA-500 is located on the chromosome and is not a plasmid. To confirm that the same was true for our donor strain, A. pittii IIF1SW-P1, the following analyses were performed. plasmidSPAdes was used to assemble plasmid sequences from the whole genome-sequencing data of our strain. A simple blastn comparison between the blaOXA-500 sequence and the plasmid sequences showed the absence of the gene from the plasmid-assembled contigs. Furthermore, oriTfinder was used to determine whether scaffold_5 (length = 172 kb), on which blaOXA-500 was found, as well as the assembled sequences not characterized as plasmid sequences (from the plasmidSPAdes output above), contained evidence of plasmid markers, such as an origin of transfer site (oriT) and relaxases. None of these plasmid markers were detected on scaffold_5 and the “chromosomal” sequences.3.

Even after the 4th sub-culture, the colonies were still resistant to oxacillin, and PCR confirmed that blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 were still present within the genome.4. Discussion We have shown that HGT is increased under SMG compared to 1G. The transfer of AMR genes, which were tracked by PCR, occurred in the absence of selective pressure by antibiotics. This transfer led to functional changes, as the acquisition of the two AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, that were tracked in the four strains of S. aureus, made them resistant to oxacillin, to which they were previously susceptible. These results have significant implications for long-duration space missions because pathogens that are susceptible to antibiotics could become resistant and thus harder to treat. In addition, even if astronauts are screened for problematic microbes prior to flight, issues could still arise, as commensals are known to act as reservoirs for AMR genes that can be disseminated to (opportunistic) pathogens [22,23,24]. For example, a study conducted in a hospital in the Netherlands showed that mecA gene transfer occurred in a patient between mecA+ S. epidermidis and a mecA− strain of S. aureus [25]. It was beyond the scope of the study to determine the cause of the increased HGT that was observed, but one mechanism could be increased competence, allowing for transformation to occur, one of three modes of gene transfer. Competence allows bacterial cells to uptake DNA from its environment and increase the response to different stressors [26,27,28,29]. In this case, naked DNA released from dead A. pittii cells could have been readily taken up by S. aureus when exposed to SMG due to an increase in its competence. While S. aureus is not classically considered to be naturally competent, as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis are, it does harbor genes that are involved in competence and thought to promote natural competence under the right conditions [30,31]. The conditions that S. aureus needs are not yet known, but, similar to other bacteria, it could be an adverse environment. Indeed, when S. aureus cells were subjected to heat-shock, cold-shock and the stringent response, there was increased expression of competence gene orthologs compared to the non-stressed conditions [32]. In S. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, competence confers a survival advantage when cells are subjected to stress [33,34], so there is a possibility that growth under SMG led to an adverse environment for S. aureus, causing cells to become more competent to increase survival. Conjugation is a less likely scenario since, consistent with what others have documented in the literature, blaOXA-500 is located on the chromosome and not a plasmid. A second mechanism could be increased transduction caused by growth under SMG. Transduction is the transfer of genetic material via bacterial phages. It is well known that prophage activity is increased during stress, leading to increased phage production, helping the host survive these adverse conditions [35,36].5. Conclusions This paper describes, for the first time, the effects of SMG on HGT and has shown that it is increased in SMG compared to 1G. If the same trend is observed on the ISS, this will have a significant impact on how we view bacterial interactions in space and its effects on astronaut health. The next steps would be to elucidate the mechanisms behind the HGT, to develop appropriate countermeasures for long-duration space missions.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/life11090960/s1, Figure S1: Representative gel images of PCR analysis.

    "conclusion": "10. Conclusions By the end of the decade, NASA aims to establish a sustainable habitat on the Moon, followed by the next ambitious plan of human occupation on Mars. NASA, along with other space agencies, government, academia, and industry are striving to address the challenges of living in space for long periods of time. Missions to the Moon would be 1000× farther from the Earth than the International Space Station, and a mission to Mars would last at least 6 months. The 20 years of human studies conducted on the ISS have provided invaluable knowledge of how the human body adapts to the space environment, but more work is needed to understand how the human body will function and adapt to space conditions beyond LEO. One such adaptation is the human microbiome, and as discussed in this review, this plays a significant role in modulating health and disease. We have demonstrated the importance of a balanced microbiome to help maintain astronaut health in orbit and have discussed adverse events experienced by the crew during missions of varying lengths and how the microbiome (either balanced or in dysbiosis) ties into those medical events. Moreover, we have examined less well-established links between spaceflight, bone loss and the microbiome and emphasized the importance of taking into account gender differences when designing appropriate countermeasures for short- and long-term missions. In addition, we have also examined the role that the microbiome can play in altering the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals that are part of the astronaut medical toolkit in space, and the consequence of this for long-term missions. As we move forward with long-term space travel and human habitation beyond LEO, more studies will be needed that explore the astronaut microbiome, the factors governing its stability or disruption and its interaction with the host and the spacecraft environment. We hope that the literature presented in this review and the recommendations provided will help in future study design, technology and product development, and policies that center around the human microbiome, as we propel human exploration beyond anything we have seen so far.",

Human Microbiome Our body consists of trillions of bacteria that are on par with the number of human cells we have [7]. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) alone harbors 100 trillion bacteria, consisting of 1000 different species, 7000 strains and 3.3 million non-redundant microbial genes [8,9,10]. The skin bacterial communities on a typical hand consist of >150 species, with only 13% similarity amongst different individuals [11]. Other sites have simpler bacterial communities, like the healthy vagina, which is mainly composed of Lactobacillus [12]. Human breast tissue, once thought of as sterile, is now accepted as having a stable microbial population [13,14]. These microbial communities, found in and outside our body, are referred to as the “human microbiome”, a term first coined in 2001 by Joshua Lederberg to refer to the “ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space” [15]. These microorganisms consist of archaea, eukaryotes (fungi and protists) and viruses, with bacteria making up the majority of organisms present (99%) [10]. While the terms “human microbiome” and “human microbiota” are often used interchangeably, the latter refers to the microbial taxa associated with humans, while the former refers to the collection of microbial taxa and their genes [16]. The microbial communities that colonize various parts of our body are important in promoting health, by synthesizing vitamins the host cannot make, salvaging energy from indigestible compounds, creating a competitive environment to prevent pathogen colonization, promoting maturation and regulation of the immune system, contributing to vascular development and angiogenesis or enhancing the integrity of the epithelial barrier [17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. These benefits are achieved by a delicate balance of commensals, symbionts and pathobionts that collectively make up one’s microbiome. If this balance is disrupted even slightly, a breakdown in homeostasis will occur, leading to disease [24]. Microbial differences have been documented between healthy and diseased individuals with periodontitis [25], inflammatory bowel disease [26], psoriasis [27], asthma [28], bacterial vaginosis [29], colorectal cancer [30] and breast cancer [31]. These observed microbial differences are not simply a consequence of the diseased state creating an environment that selects for certain bacteria, as studies have shown that healthy animals transplanted with feces from those with obesity [32], colitis [33] and colorectal cancer [34] then go on to develop disease. Shifts in bacterial profiles not only have consequences at the site of origin but can have distal site effects as well. For example, alterations in the gut microbiota can have effects on the brain [35,36], liver [37,38], and pancreas [39], while microbial shifts in the oral cavity can be detrimental to cardiovascular health [40].3. Spaceflight and the Astronaut Microbiome 3.1. Spaceflight Hazards: Conditions and Challenges Facing Space Travelers Long-term spaceflight and especially deep-space exploratory missions represent an extreme environment for humans that demands adaptations to both physical and psychological stressors (Figure 1) [41]. As such, a large part of spaceflight research focuses on the effects of space exposure on humans, with the aim to elucidate physiological, psychological and behavioral health risks and the necessary solutions to combat them [42]. Much of the existing knowledge about spaceflight hazards derives from crewed missions in LEO, such as those onboard the International Space Station (ISS), and analog missions on Earth. Additionally, a significant amount of data have been generated by experiments carried out in ground-based facilities, simulating different space conditions. This information, however, may provide inaccurate estimates into the risks connected to deep-space missions (outside LEO), which involve more time spent in space during a single mission than that hitherto experienced by astronauts (i.e., on average 7 months). Moreover, deep-space exploration will venture beyond the protective effects of Earth’s geomagnetic field; therefore, crewmembers on upcoming missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond will be exposed to significantly higher doses of cosmic radiation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Biological features of spaceflight. In space, microgravity, radiation, and confinement in a closed environment thousands of miles away from Earth pose health risks and drive many physiological changes and psychological effects seen during spaceflight. Figure created with BioRender.com (accessed on 18 February 2022).3.1.1. Radiation The global radiation dose for astronauts is affected by galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system, which include high atomic number and energy (HZE) ions and high-intensity solar particle events (SPEs) that produce pulses of heavy ion and energetic proton radiation [43]. It is estimated that a one-year stay on the lunar surface would result in absorbed doses for crews in the range from 100 to 120 mGy (milligray), whereas during a three-year Mars mission, transit and stay included, the values would increase to 450 mGy [44]. In comparison, the predicted doses for 6- to 12-month ISS missions range instead from roughly 30 to 120 mGy [44]. For reference, 4.5 Gy has been indicated as the LD50 value for human cells (median lethal dose) [45]. During SPEs, astronauts may additionally be exposed to an extremely high dose of protons (i.e., up to 1 Gy or more) that could lead to acute radiation sickness (ARS) [46,47]. Although radiation derived from SPEs is effectively absorbed by the shielding material of a spacecraft or well-designed spacesuit, not all SPEs are predictable and can therefore pose a real threat to astronauts, especially during planetary extravehicular activity (EVA), which would take place more frequently than during a 6-month ISS stay [48]. The consequences of chronic exposure to radiation, and to CGR in particular, is concerning, due to the high energy, high penetrability and ionizing nature of their most hazardous components, the HZE particles [49]. These particles are so penetrating that shielding can only partially protect against exposure and the large emission of secondary neutrons that may follow, posing an additional hazard to the crew [50]. The types of radiation encountered in space are different from terrestrial radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, and induce distinct patterns of DNA double-strand breaks and disease outcomes, resulting in epigenetic changes and persistently high levels of oxidative damage and tissue inflammation following exposure [51]. This is relevant because of the association of oxidative stress with the etiology of several human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., altered sensory perception, neurovestibular problems, etc. [52]), gastrointestinal diseases [53], and the possible correlation between spaceflight and the onset of a number of diseases normally related to aging [54]. Exposure to space radiation, especially when considering that heavy ions are more effective per unit dose in causing solid cancer compared to gamma-rays [55], can therefore have a detrimental impact on the quality of life during and post flight. Visual disturbances appear to also be correlated to radiation exposure, as indicated by reports from past Apollo, Skylab and MIR missions where astronauts experienced flashes of light moving across their visual field, possibly due to alteration in perception caused by ionizing radiation [56]. An additional aspect to consider when assessing radiation-related risks are the non-targeted effects (NTEs) of radiation, which increase biological effectiveness for low doses of high linear energy transfer radiation (LET), such as HZE particles, and may lead to alterations in cell signaling and/or genomic instability of cell progeny [55,57]. 3.1.2. Microgravity Along with radiation, microgravity—a condition in which the gravity level is almost zero but not neutralized—represents another major health hazard related to spaceflight. While astronauts mostly experience microgravity during spaceflight and onboard the ISS, they do experience intermediate periods of hypergravity (e.g., 3–6 G) during launch and ascent and upon descent back through the Earth’s atmosphere [58]. Additionally, various levels of altered gravity are found on other planetary bodies, such as on the Earth’s Moon—one-sixth gravity (G)—and Mars—one-third gravity (G)—(hypogravity) [42]. Spaceflight and ground-based analog experiments have shown that altered gravity, as well as the transition through various levels of gravity, subject biological systems (i.e., humans, animals, plants) to varying levels of stress with negative consequences. Specifically, microgravity can induce cellular and molecular alterations with changes to the genome, epigenome, and proteome, connected with a range of pathologies [42]. In humans, exposure to microgravity can influence several body systems such as the neurovestibular, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, bone metabolic and immune-hematological system [59,60]. For example, altered body fluid distribution occurs during microgravity and this headward shift of fluids, including blood, leads to a compensatory cardiovascular system change, with increased intracranial pressure, cerebrospinal pressure or inner ear fluid pressure, decreased leg volume, puffiness in the face and even long-term ocular damage [61]. According to the “fluid shift” theory, this increased pressure is the root of “space motion sickness”, a set of symptoms that impair operational performance of 60–80% of astronauts. Additional interconnected abnormalities include morphological changes in the white and grey matter of the brain following long-duration spaceflight (average of 171 days), which have been attributed to the structural neuroplasticity of the sensorimotor system, in an effort to adapt motor strategies to maintain physiological homeostasis and ensure proper behavioral output in space [3]. Lack of gravitational loading also results in muscle atrophy, especially in the lower extremities, accompanied by functional and structural alterations. While muscular loss has been linked to reduced muscular activity and hypokinesia due to limited movement inside the spacecraft, structural changes seem to be related to both a higher level of muscle protein degradation enzymes and a decrease in protein synthesis [59]. Extended exposure to microgravity also results in bone loss due to insufficient bone formation compared with bone resorption, and this reduction in bone mass and strength during spaceflight increases the risk of bone fracture, even upon return to Earth [62]. As reported for radiation, similarities have been observed between the adaptive response to microgravity in humans and aging, since both prompt the decline of almost every body system [5]. Though several phenotypic changes resemble those determined by aging under standard gravitational conditions, the magnitude and speed of some processes (bone loss, among others) is far greater (i.e., 1% loss/month) than that which is typically seen during aging. Hence, this is of critical concern when considering the effects of long-duration spaceflight [1]. 3.1.3. Psychological Stressors In addition to the aforementioned stressors, several psychological and social issues have been demonstrated to affect the crew during extended separation from society in a closed and confined environment. They may include homesickness and loneliness, apathy, interpersonal stressors, and sexual attraction/tension [63]. A constricted living environment can lead to isolation, loss of spatial capacity, increased anxiety and depression, which can be accompanied by symptoms such as hallucinations, reduced consciousness and poor bodily coordination [64,65]. Additional psychological triggers range from external physical hazards such as space debris and vehicular malfunction to gravitational shifts and outer space radiation [65]. The ability of ionizing radiation to modulate the psycho-emotional status and, specifically, to exert an anxiogenic effect on the central nervous system was shown in rats exposed to doses related to deep-space missions [66]. In addition, diet has a critical role in both the physiological and the psychological health of space travelers. The spacecraft environment, in particular the lack of ultraviolet exposure, increased carbon dioxide levels, the spacesuit atmosphere, etc., can affect nutrition requirements for long-duration missions. Crewmembers may even experience a reduction in their food intake, dubbed “anorexia in space” which may be linked to microgravity, alterations in the circadian rhythm (continuous light environment of space missions) and “menu fatigue”, which not only affects appetite but the proper functioning of the gastrointestinal system [64]. Hence, nutritious and palatable food is necessary not only to meet nutritional requirements and avoid deficiency diseases, but also to keep astronauts psychologically healthy [67]. Excessive exposure to noise, mainly due to equipment and crew activities, may represent another stressor compromising well-being as well as sleeping patterns [68]. As a matter of fact, the duration of an astronaut’s sleep is reportedly reduced to around 6 to 6.5 h/day during missions [69]. Psychosomatic disorders (e.g., headaches, fear of illness, gastroenteric problems), consisting of distressing physical symptoms which are not fully explained by a real physical condition, have also been reported from space [64]. Similarly, post-return personality changes and psychiatric problems have been observed in space travelers [70]. Other stress factors that may arise in a multicultural crew are related to language barriers, stereotypes and cultural misunderstandings [67]. Additionally, new psychological stressors could appear in deep-space missions that were not present in missions closer to Earth, and already-known issues could be intensified, leading to stress and problematic behaviors that may interfere with a crew’s productivity and relationships [71]. For example, during a multi-year spaceflight such as that required for a mission to Mars, the crew would be confronted with no access to most of the mitigation strategies currently in place on the ISS, such as real-time communications with family and ground-based mission control and the view of Earth, that contribute to their psychological well-being [48]. Based on the “Earth-out-of-view phenomenon”, humans traveling in outer space might start feeling unconnected to Earth and to family and friends [72]. On the other hand, delays in crew–ground communication (up to 22 min on Mars) would require astronauts to operate more autonomously from mission control [73]. Furthermore, people on a Mars expedition will need to depend on local resources to generate water and fuel for the return home and thus, the psychology of this dependance is an important issue to be considered [70]. In this context, a greater likelihood of withdrawal, territorial behavior and asthenia may occur [74]. The latter is a problematic syndrome quite commonly observed during long-duration missions that produces fatigue, irritability, attention and concentration difficulties, along with heightened perceptual sensitivities, physical weakness, sleep and appetite problems, etc. [64,75].3.1.4. Additional Risk Factors Psychological stress, circadian rhythms, and sleep are key factors strongly connected with one another, as well as with the immune system. This is especially relevant since microbial infection is another challenge facing space travelers. The isolation of opportunistic and pathogenic microorganisms from spacecraft and space stations has been frequently reported [76,77,78] and several studies have demonstrated that spaceflight affects both the immune system (i.e., immune dysregulation) [79] and microbial physiology (i.e., enhanced virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotics resistance) [80], leading to increased risk of disease [81]. Additionally, the proximity of crewmembers to one another in the spacecraft can promote the spread of secondary infections [82]. Due to limited access to medical care during a mission, any possibility of infection should be prevented to ensure the health and safety of the astronauts and to maximize the success rate of the space mission [83]. Crews do not experience the aforementioned stressors independently; therefore, it is important to consider the combined effects of these space environment threats on human physiology, psychology, and performance. These stressful conditions, collectively referred to as “the space exposome” [6], may also exacerbate complex health problems in astronauts embarking on long-duration missions [3]. Space agencies have adopted a number of operational mitigations, direct and indirect countermeasures, whose aim is to lessen the clinical risks related to the physical and psychological stressors associated with space flight. These encompass strict exercise regimes, the use of devices to induce footward fluid shift (i.e., lower body negative pressure, LBNP) [2], pre-flight quarantine to reduce contact with potential pathogens [6], radiation-shielding spacesuits [84], the use of HEPA air filters and in-line water filters in the spacecraft, nutritional supplementation, vaccination, psychological support, etc. [6]. While some of the changes induced by exposure to space conditions (e.g., reduction in some motor functions) reportedly disappear shortly or a few months after the end of LEO missions [85], it should be noted that risk assessments and mitigation for lunar visit/habitation, deep-space journey/habitation and planetary missions remain uncertain [86]. If certain medical risks, such as nutrition, infection, psychological impact and even death, appear to be common to all mission profiles, other risks are actually unique to individual scenarios [87]. For instance, risks associated with lunar missions—e.g., lunar surface operations, a lunar outpost, etc.—along with radiation, microgravity and the aforementioned psychological issues, also include exposure to hazardous materials such as rocket fuel, lunar dust (regolith), micrometeorite impact damage, and extremes of temperature [87]. Similarly, perchlorates in the Martian dust would be a concern in terms of contamination of the habitats and of inhalation of harmful particles, posing a great risk to the lung already affected by altered pulmonary deposition induced by microgravity [88]. The optimization of current and novel countermeasures will therefore be critical. 3.2. Effects of Spaceflight Conditions on the Human Microbiome It is apparent that the space environment imposes several challenges to human physiology. Specific space environment factors, such as microgravity and radiation, are thought to also induce changes in microbiome composition (i.e., dysbiosis) [89], which may alter host–microbe interactions and adversely affect immune function and metabolism, thereby representing a risk to astronaut health, especially during long-term spaceflight missions. A list of reviewed microbiome studies pertaining to spaceflight as well as ground-based simulations (conducted through to 2021) is provided in Table 1. Table 1. Effects of spaceflight, postflight and ground-based analog missions on the host microbiome.

Research included pre-flight and post-flight monitoring. Gingival sulcus, dental plaque, and saliva. Increase in counts of anaerobic bacteria of the oral microflora in-flight compared to pre-flight samples. None of these changes were, however, deemed hazardous to astronauts’ health. In-flight increments of dental plaque, calculus, and gingival inflammation were moderate. There was a sparsity of preflight and postflight clinical problems.

Gut (fecal samples), skin, nose, tongue Spaceflight-dependent changes in the microbiome associated with the gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose, and tongue. Individual differences were observed in skin samples. The composition of the gut microbiota became more similar across astronauts in space, mostly due to a drop in the abundance of a few bacterial taxa.

Gut Microbiome The gut microbiome, often described as the “virtual organ of the human body” [104], will play a crucial and significant role in maintaining astronaut health during space travel, as it does for humans on Earth. High microbiome diversity and richness are generally considered a hallmark of a healthy gut ecosystem; however, there is still no consensus on the actual health-related values [105]. Healthy adult humans characteristically harbor more than 1000 species of bacteria, with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes being the dominant phyla [106]. While Bacteroidetes (recently renamed as Bacteroidota [107]) are connected with immunomodulation and augmented immune reactions through synthesis of cytokines, Firmicutes are involved in the metabolism, nutrition, and regulation of hunger and satiety, via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis [108]. Exposure to various stressors can change the stability of the gut microbiota, impacting its composition and functions, and increasing the relative abundance of potentially harmful bacteria (e.g., opportunistic pathogens) [109,110,111,112,113]. Studies have been conducted to monitor changes in the gut microbiome under real or simulated spaceflight conditions, involving both animal and human subjects. Culture-dependent techniques, substantially used in the past, have been in recent years replaced by high-throughput omics technologies—i.e., 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis and metagenomic sequencing—which by detecting and measuring also non-cultivable strains have allowed a more comprehensive characterization of the microbiome structure and its biological functions [114]. Despite the advent of new technologies, the number of reports is still limited, and the dynamics of the gut microbiome during space missions are yet to be fully elucidated. A recent analysis of fecal samples from mice flown on the ISS for 37 days revealed spaceflight-associated changes in the gut microbiome as compared to the ground controls. These changes consisted of an altered community structure (i.e., an elevated Firmicutes-to-Bacteroides ratio), higher abundance of bacteria belonging to the order Clostridiales and a reduction in the number of Lactobacillales (organisms usually considered probiotics), with these changes connected to an altered liver transcriptome [89]. The richness of the microbiome, however, remained unchanged. Similar trends were previously observed in a study reporting the effects of 13-day spaceflight on female mice and were confirmed using a ground-based model of microgravity [92]. The above results are comparable with data collected from Voorhies et al. (2019), which assessed the impact of long-term space travel on the crew microbiome and surrounding ISS environment, and the consequence on human health [98]. A total of nine crewmembers were sampled pre-, during and post-flight, comparing 6-month and 1-year missions. Results indicated that the microbiome composition became more similar between astronauts over the course of the mission, mostly due to a drop in the abundance of a few bacterial taxa [98]. It was revealed that 13 of 17 genera, whose abundance significantly changed in space, were Firmicutes, mainly belonging to the order Clostridiales. Specifically, the authors reported higher proportions of Faecalibacterium, which is known to be a beneficial SCFA producer (i.e., butyrate), but also of genera associated with chronic intestinal inflammation, such as Parasutterella. At the same time, it was observed a greater than five-fold reduction in the relative abundance of Akkermansia, a genus with anti-inflammatory properties, which according to the authors, could play a role in the moderate increase in the inflammatory immune response observed in the crew during spaceflight. Accordingly, the administration in space of prebiotics or next-generation probiotics, such as Akkermansia, has been proposed [115]. Previous sampling campaigns carried out for the Skylab program had also reported a decrease in the diversity of the gastrointestinal community, although the overall microbial count went up following space flight. The data showed an increase in certain pathogenic strains, i.e., Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus, the latter of which was found to be transmitted among astronauts, thereby indicating the transmission of pathogens between individuals in the spaceship environment [91]. The “Twins Study” has provided the unique chance to evaluate the impact of long-duration flight on the gut microbiome by comparing profiles of an astronaut and his twin, who, by remaining on Earth, served as ground control. The study aimed to monitor various health parameters including changes in ocular, cardiovascular, cognitive and immune functions, as well as cell-specific changes in physiology, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, epigenome, and telomere length, while controlling for genetics [97]. Although each subject maintained individual microbiome characteristics, more changes were found to occur in the microbial community composition and function during the flight period. In line with what previously observed in other spaceflight experiments [89], a specific increase in the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio was detected during the 1-year flight period onboard the ISS. Interestingly, this was a transient change, not persisting upon return to Earth, indicating a rebound across the microbial ecosystem of the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, as anticipated above, microbiome richness composition remained substantially unchanged. Alterations in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome can be induced even by short-term space travel. Liu et al. (2020) reported shifts between dominant genera in the microbiome during space missions of 15 and 35 days that led to increased abundance of Bacteroides. By contrast, the probiotic taxa Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium appeared reduced, possibly affecting host immune function [81]. Individual specificity was, however, uncompromised. These changes were accompanied by fluctuations in virulence and antibiotic resistance genes and in mobile genetic elements, and by an increase in genes related to biofilm formation [81], which are suggestive of enhanced virulence potential and possibility of infection by opportunistic pathogens or pathobiont of the gut microbiota in space missions [115]. Changes in the intestinal microbiota were also reported in response to increased gravity, a condition experienced by astronauts during specific flight phases such as launch, ascent and descent [58]. A study conducted on mice by Alauzet et al. (2019) revealed disruption of intracaecal microbiota following exposure to hypergravity (3G) for 21 days, which resulted in a decrease in the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, however without alteration of mucosal integrity [96]. Of interest, a significant diminution of Proteobacteria was observed at 3G, while the opposite was observed for potentially deleterious taxa, such as members of the Paraprevotella genus which have been described as being more prevalent in intestinal lumen of patients with colorectal cancer [116]. Rearrangements in microbiome composition have also been observed in ground-based analog missions. With the MARS500 study, the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome of six male crewmembers were monitored over 520 days of isolation within an analog Mars-surface habitat [94]. During the stay in the spacecraft-like habitat, the crewmembers performed realistic activities of a round-trip mission to Mars, including operative work, scientific experiments, exercise and even simulated emergency events, and their access to water and food, whose composition reflected the diet used in the ISS, was limited as in a real space flight [94]. Fecal samples were collected not only during the mission but 10 days before and up until 6 months following the return to normal life, making it the longest controlled human confinement study conducted to date. In the first stage of the mission, an increase in the Bacteroides-to-Firmicutes ratio was detected, which is consistent with observations from another analog mission, the “Skylab Medical Experiments Altitude Test” carried out in the 1970s in a 56-day confinement environment [117]. Additionally, the study revealed decreased proportions of some SCFA producers, especially Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (a butyrate producer), that reached their lowest value at about 1 year of confinement. Not only were increased relative abundance of Bacteroides and a decrease in SCFA producers observed in all subjects involved in the study, but these findings paralleled psychological and physiological data that hint at the presence of both mental and physical stress. The authors thereby suggested that changes in this kind in gut microbiota components could be used for the early diagnosis of potential health warnings. MARS500 project data from early (days 7–45) and late (days 420–520) fecal samples were recently reanalyzed using improved 16S rRNA gene amplicon bioinformatics technology [102]. The reanalysis confirmed a significant alteration in relative abundance of the microbiome throughout the period of the study, which included species known to influence inflammation and glucose homeostasis in their host (e.g., F. prausnitzii, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia luti, Anaerostipes hadrus, Roseburia faecis, and Lactobacillus rogosae) and was consistent with crewmembers’ symptoms. Moreover, a certain level of species overlap could be observed between crewmembers and their habitat: 49 species were shared, representing 49% and 12% of the human and environmental microbiome diversity, respectively. Convergence in the microbiota composition of crewmembers (n = 3) was also observed in a study monitoring a 105-day analog mission that took place in the Chinese Lunar Palace 1 (LP1) [95]. Results also showed the beneficial influence of the LP1 bioregenerative life-support system (a closed ecosystem integrating efficient higher plant cultivation) dietary structure and a balanced lifestyle (daily diet, living and working activities strictly followed a regular schedule) on the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota. A high-plant and high-fiber diet resulted in higher microbiome diversity and richness and specifically, a higher abundance of bacteria of the genera Lachnospira, Faecalibacterium and Blautia of the Firmicutes phylum that are known to metabolize dietary polysaccharides and to have anti-inflammatory properties [118]. These studies are indicative that modifications in the astronaut gut microbiome occur during spaceflight and analog missions, but the full implications of these findings are yet to be determined in relation to the risks for human health and performance during space travel [119]. Analyses showed that changes to gut microbiome composition are reversible, with at least partial reversal occurring in the order of days to weeks following return to Earth or completion of an analog mission [89,97,98]. However, with extended exploration missions, microbial changes will persist for longer as a consequence of flight duration, due to the limited opportunity of microbial replenishment as compared to individuals on Earth, and this may have long-lasting and serious side-effects, even upon return to Earth [77]. It is also unknown how long after extended spaceflight the microbiome will return to pre-flight levels. The combination of space stressors can also impact the gut metabolome, as observed by Casero et al. (2017), where continuous exposure to space-type radiation led to functional shifts in metabolic pathways dominated by microbiome-specific enzymatic reactions [93]. Changes in small-molecule markers of microbial metabolism were also observed in the “Twins Study”, along with particularly low levels of metabolites with anti-inflammatory activity [97]. In this context, looking into the metabolome of the gut microbiota and its modulation as a result of the spaceflight environment may be promising to aid the development of countermeasures that include the use of prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics to prevent and mitigate pathological effects in astronauts [112].3.2.2. Skin, Oropharyngeal and Nasal Microbiome Microbiome communities residing in the nose and oral cavities and on the skin have also been investigated in relation to spaceflight-induced compositional and functional changes. Located at the entrance of the upper respiratory tract, the nasal cavity and oropharynx serve as the physical barrier to the invasion of pathogens as well as habitats for a large number of commensals and opportunistic pathogens that live in the host as part of the normal microfloa [103]. In the skin, most resident microbes behave as commensal or mutualistic under steady-state conditions and play important roles in the maturation and homeostasis of cutaneous immunity [120]. The disruption of the balance of the microbiota associated with the human respiratory tract and to the skin may result in an increased susceptibility to infection and to the overgrowth of pathogens (Figure 2). On that basis, surveillance of the microbiota structure may be crucial to counteract significant health risks during long-term flight and to guide medical treatment. Moreover, since astronaut skin is the primary source of spacecraft surface contamination, monitoring skin alterations and alterations in the skin-associated microbiome is key to managing astronaut health as well as in the maintenance of space stations, spaceships and spacecraft equipment [121]. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Impact of spaceflight-induced microbiome alterations on human biology and physiology. Physiology on Earth (in blue) is compared to physiology in space (in red). Factors that can influence the microbiome—i.e., diet—or that can both influence and be influenced by the microbiome—i.e., immunity—are also shown.

Figure created with BioRender.com (accessed on 18 February 2022).Early analyses of the microbiome revealed a reduction in the number of nonpathogenic bacteria and an increase in the number of opportunistic pathogens in the nasal flora of astronauts [122]. Similarly, culture-based analyses conducted during the Skylab missions registered noteworthy elevations in counts of anaerobic bacteria, streptococci, Neisseria, lactobacilli and enteric bacilli in the oral microflora, in-flight compared to pre-flight samples from a total of 18 astronauts [90]; however, none of these changes were considered hazardous to astronauts’ health. These findings are consistent with the work conducted by Voorhies et al. (2019), discussed earlier, which showed that the microbiome composition of skin, nose and tongue, such as the gut microbiome, changes in microgravity, and additionally, becomes more similar between astronauts [98]. A more recent study used metagenomic sequencing to investigate the microbial profile of mouth, skin, nose, ear, and saliva swabs collected from an astronaut at eight different time points prior to, during and post-spaceflight [99]. While the main objective of the study was to determine the influence of the crew microbiome on the microbial composition of ISS habitable surfaces, it was noted that in saliva samples a flight-dependent decrease in species diversity was observed along with an increase in the relative abundance of Alloprevotella [99], a genus associated with dental caries [123]. Interestingly, an increase in the effective number of species was recorded in the samples after returning to Earth. In a later study, shotgun metagenomic sequencing and microarrays were applied to characterize the microbial diversity of four astronauts, before, during and following spaceflight on the ISS [100]. The authors reported that astronaut microbiome composition of body swabs and saliva samples changed during spaceflight but went back to normal post-flight. Moreover, these changes were not universal for all four crew members. Interestingly, the relative abundance of the genus Prevotella was found to be increased in the saliva samples of two astronauts. The genus consists of several common oral species and increased abundance has been linked to a diseased periodontal state [124]. Additional changes observed in the saliva samples concerned antimicrobial resistance genes: most notably, the elfamycin resistance gene significantly increased in all four astronauts following return to Earth, an aspect which should be considered when administrating antibiotic treatments post spaceflight. In another recent study, Urbaniak et al. (2020) used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to monitor spaceflight-induced salivary microbiome changes [101]. Based on the data on microbial composition and diversity, the authors suggested that astronauts’ microbiome can adapt to spaceflight conditions and, moreover, is less recalcitrant to microbiome effects during spaceflight upon re-exposure. Half of the participants involved in the study (i.e., 5) had distinct microbial communities pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Quite interestingly, these subjects were on their first mission, while the other five subjects, who had previously flown to the ISS, did not display microbiome differences. Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva (i.e., 8% of the total organisms detected) and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Changes in the skin and nose microbiome were investigated in a study by Voorhies et al. (2019) [98] that aimed at a thorough characterization of the microbiome’s fluctuation during 6- to 12-month space exploration. The forehead and forearm skin microbiota of 9 astronauts appeared to be differentially influenced by the ISS environment: diversity and richness increased or decreased depending upon the individual; however, it was consistent between the two sampled areas [98]. Moreover, a common shift in the microbial composition was observed in all crew members and affected the abundance of Proteobacteria, mostly Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. A concomitant increase in Firmicutes, including the genera Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, was also observed. The authors speculated that decreased levels of Gammaproteobacteria may possibly be due to the lack of a “green” natural environment, the constant filtration of air and the alteration of the skin structure during spaceflight [98]. As a reduction in skin Gammaproteobacteria has been associated with inflammation and allergy sensitization [125], it is possible that it also plays a role in the occurrence of skin hypersensitivity reactions, rashes, and skin infections, frequently observed in astronauts [126]. In this scenario, skin infections caused by opportunistic pathogens, such as the staphylococcal and streptococcal species, may be facilitated. Fewer spaceflight-dependent changes were found in the nose microbiome, as compared to the skin; however, they concerned the same bacterial genera, whose abundance was found to be modulated in skin (i.e., increase in Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium-1 and Bifidobacterium). An elevated relative abundance of clinical pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus in the nose has been reported by several studies in association with chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma [127,128]. Hence, it is consistent with symptoms such as prolonged congestion, rhinitis, and sneezing, which have been reported by astronauts. Nonetheless, other factors could also be playing a role in it. Many of the observed changes in the nose microbiome persisted for at least 2 months after the astronauts returned to Earth. Increased abundance of Staphylococcus in the nasal cavity has also been reported in a recent study examining temporal characteristics of the oropharyngeal and nasal microbiome during a 180-day ground-based confined experiment in the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) [103]. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze data from four volunteers at eight time points during confinement and the results showed that the structure of the oropharyngeal and nasal microbiota varied greatly. Individual differences were also observed, with bacterial community structure and diversity changing with time. As with Staphylococcus in the nasal cavity, the abundance of Neisseria increased over time in the oropharynx. Staphylococcus in particular showed the characteristics of inter-individual transfer, suggesting that the microbiota structure and health of the respiratory tract could be affected by living in a closed environment for a long time. To date, studies have revealed modifications in the skin, oral and nasal microbiome as a consequence of both spaceflight conditions and confinement in ground-based experiments. Changes at the individual level, and specifically an increase in a microbiome’s richness and diversity—i.e., alpha diversity—were reported during spaceflight in studies of the saliva microbiome [100,101], but changes at the populational level were not detected. By contrast, a decrease in alpha diversity in in-flight saliva samples was indicated by an earlier report [99], but this trend was not consistent across all four astronauts involved in the study. Mixed responses were detected in nasal and skin samples [98,103]. Individual differences in the reaction of the skin microbiota to spaceflight may be attributed to the composition of the microbial communities, but also to skin-specific properties such as moisture and pH and/or astronauts’ personal hygiene habits [98]. Concerning the nasal microbiome, changes were observed in relation to both spaceflight [98] and ground-based confined experiments [103], suggesting that the nasal flora of all crewmembers may evolve in the same direction. Microbial transfer between individuals could play a role in it, suggesting that the microbiota structure and health of the respiratory tract could be affected by living in a closed environment for a long time [103]. Aspects including microbial interactions and exchange of microbiota within the crew or with the environment have not yet been fully elucidated and further studies will therefore need to be conducted.3.3. Impact of Spaceflight Conditions on Microbial Physiology and Host-Microbe Interactions Space microbiology studies have suggested that microgravity is a dominant factor influencing bacterial growth kinetics and cell behavior, and that space radiation may be responsible for increased mutation rates in microbes [129]. Several in vitro studies with bacteria have reported significant in-flight responses that included increased growth rate and cell concentration [130]. Other studies indicated that microgravity is associated with changes in gene expression and virulence factors and can promote antibiotic resistance and elevated transfer rates of genetic material between cells [131,132]. Microgravity-induced changes also include increased membrane integrity and differential secondary metabolite production [133]. Decreased susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to antimicrobial agents has been repeatedly observed during space missions (e.g., Cytos 2 experiment, Antibio experiment during the Spacelab D1 mission, Space Shuttle STS-42 mission, etc.) and in ground-based simulations using model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus [134]. These finding show that in space, bacteria adapt to grow at higher antibiotic concentrations, compared to ground samples [135]. Similarly, resistance to a broad range of antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol and cefalotin, persisting for over 110 generations) [136], as well as increased production of the heat-labile enterotoxin [137] and enhanced adherence to mammalian gastrointestinal epithelium [138], have been observed in E. coli under simulated microgravity (SMG) conditions. Moreover, increased virulence and resistance to environmental stress were observed in cultures of the pathogenic bacterium Salmonella typhimurium grown under spaceflight conditions, together with increased survival in murine macrophages following oral infection [139]. The mechanisms contributing to this enhanced virulence were the Hfq pathway, which is required for virulence in several bacterial pathogens and considered a global regulator of the microbial response to spaceflight [140], and extracellular matrix accumulation, which is part of biofilm formation. Biofilms protect bacteria from various environmental conditions and increased production of biofilm communities has been frequently observed in bacteria exposed to both simulated and real space conditions [134,141]. In Candida albicans, such a feature was found in combination with increased filamentation and increased amphotericin B resistance [142]. In spaceflight-grown bacteria (e.g., the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa), biofilms tend to show enhanced resistance towards disinfectants, antibiotics and environmental stresses [143]. Still in P. aeruginosa and in few other bacterial species, microgravity appears to also stimulate production of signaling molecules (e.g., N-Acyl homoserine lactone) able to trigger bacterial communication and to regulate virulence [144]. Considering the effects of spaceflight-dependent alterations on bacterial mono-cultures, the impact of spaceflight on host-associated microbial communities can potentially be more profound. It is known that enhanced virulence of potential pathogens, immune system dysregulation, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, and disruption of mutualistic interactions, can all be induced by microgravity [79,137,145]; however, the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity—or various gravitational shifts (i.e., hypo- or hypergavity) that astronauts will face during deep-spaceflight missions—on the complex relationship between host and its microbiome are yet to be fully elucidated. Microbe–animal interactions, e.g., mutualistic, pathogenic/parasitic or commensal, and functional networks of microbe–microbe can be equally affected by gravities encountered beyond LEO, with consequences for host health and wellbeing. These interactions rely on a complex system of communication between each member of a microbial community, that influences growth, physiology and metabolism [146]. One such example is horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which is the transfer of genetic material between microorganisms, through either transformation, conjugation or transduction. Research has shown that the human microbiome is a hotspot of HGT [147,148,149], with the rate of HGT between human-associated bacteria 25-fold higher than that among ecologically diverse non-human isolates [150]. HGT is significant as it regulates the exchange of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes and is the main mechanism driving antibiotic resistance in bacterial communities [151]. Spaceflight conditions reportedly influence gene transfer and enhance HGT. For example, the content of mobile genetic elements appears to be higher in the genome of bacterial isolates grown in space (ISS) than in isolates of the same species from extreme built environments on Earth [152]. In line with this, HGT activity concerning the transfer of AMR genes was found to be more increased in bacteria under simulated microgravity conditions than in 1 G controls [80]. The transfer of these genes from donor (i.e., Acinetobacter pitti) to co-cultured recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus, resulted in a phenotypic change, as the recipient strains developed resistance to the antibiotic oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible to [80]. A similar study conducted on the ISS showed increased gene transfer as well, using a phenomenological model. However, plasmid stability was short lived, resulting in overall lower antibiotic resistance compared to ground controls [153]. According to the authors, the reason lies in the fact that processes of segregation and spontaneous elimination of drug resistance genes would prevail over the processes of their cointegration [153]. The exact mechanism influencing enhanced HGT is yet to be determined; nonetheless, it may be related to increased competence or transduction, known to be promoted in bacteria in response to different stressors [154]. Regardless of the mechanisms, the potential impact of the space environment in promoting increased spread of determinants associated with antibiotic resistance and virulence, is of particular concern. Furthermore, risks are not restricted to the astronauts’ microbiome but may as well arise within the microbial flora populating the spacecraft environment (air, surface, water, etc.). Acquired antibiotic resistance can have serious implications as the efficacy of antibiotic treatment may be diminished during space missions [129]. Although antibiotic resistance may also increase during short-term spaceflights [155], in the context of long-term space missions, strategy and tactics of using antibiotics would have particular relevance. Over-prescribed antibiotic therapy can generally represent an infectious risk factor, potentially resulting in accumulation of antibiotic resistance and pathogenic genes on certain strains due to the process of plasmid mobilization and cointegration [153]. In confined compartments such as spacecrafts, this issue is of even greater concern, not only since microbial communities are a pool for the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes, but also because the transmission of a resistant strain among individuals would be facilitated [79]. Under these conditions, the formation and spread of multidrug-resistant strains of microorganisms and of strains with increased virulence (disease-causing microbes) could be promoted, which, in conjunction with dysbiosis and a possible weakened immune system during spaceflight, carries the risk of increased severity of crewmembers’ infection in long-term space missions [156]. More studies will be needed to further our understanding of space environment-driven microbiome changes during long missions, to clarify whether the effects on communities are potentiated or dampened and what the consequences are for the host. In order to obtain a realistic overview of host–microbiome relationships, investigations should not be limited to disease-causing microbes that represent a potential risk to astronauts but shall also include mutualistic and commensal microbes. This can be crucial to learn what drives microbial fitness in the spaceflight environment and how to maintain a healthy symbiotic homeostasis [133].3.4. Influence of the Space Dietary Regime on the Microbiome Food intake is strictly connected to the composition and the functionality of the microbiome. Research has shown that changes in the diet are followed by rearrangement of the gut flora that can occur within just 24 h of initiation and have secondary effects on host immunologic and metabolic markers [157]. As such, protein consumption positively correlates with overall microbial diversity, with animal protein intake leading to increased abundance of bile-tolerant organisms such as Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Bilophila [158], whereas a diet rich in fibers tends to increase the abundance of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria, known for their anti-inflammatory properties [118]. Along with the type of food, the food’s form (raw or cooked) appears to influence diet-driven host–microbial interactions, with cooking impacting the gut microbiome differently on meat versus plant-based (e.g., tuber) diets [159]. Additionally, multiple compounds with known antimicrobial effects are significantly decreased in cooked food, thus limiting their bioactivity [160]. The close relationship between diet, the gut microbiome, and health suggests that modulations in the diet can have a beneficial or detrimental impact on our health, depending on the relative identity and abundance of constituent bacterial population [161]. It follows that a change in diet such as that faced by astronauts, can also potentially affect the gut microbiome with repercussions on their health [115]. Space food includes a variety of products specifically created for the consumption in outer space and as such, it must meet certain criteria: nutritional properties in line with the crew’s recommended caloric intake, palatability, ease of preparation and storage, etc. [67]. Since water, storage, crew time, and food preparation capability—which does not include cooking—are limited, current space food consists of a narrow choice of shelf-stable, single-serving food products either in their natural form or preserved by dehydration, retort thermostabilization, or irradiation [162]. The variety and amount of fresh fruit and vegetables vary, and their consumption is limited to a few days or weeks. Hence, the ISS food system, for instance, is dominated by meat and meat products [6] and long-term missions will have to rely on bioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs)—e.g., integrating plant cultivation—to introduce a larger variety of food [71]. The optimization of the food system to mitigate negative effects of spaceflight on crewmembers’ health and performance is paramount. A reduction in the astronauts’ caloric intake to 70–80% of the daily requirement [163] occurs at the beginning of the mission due to space motion sickness; however, it can extend well beyond the first days of flight [164], potentially leading to the loss of both fat and lean tissue mass, and to adverse effects on muscle, bone and cardiovascular systems and motor and cognitive functions [115,165]. Moreover, although the reasons are not entirely clear, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance are frequently observed both in short- and longer-term space missions, and in analog missions [166]. A reduced caloric intake like that often experienced by astronauts, may also lead to a restructuring of the gut microbiome similar to that observed in association with very-low-calorie diet (Figure 2) [167]. Accordingly, a low calorie intake and the consequent weight loss may be paralleled by a decrease in bacterial abundance, impaired nutrient absorption, and enrichment in endogenous enteric pathogens (e.g., Clostridioides difficile), suggesting that diet-induced shifts in the gut microbiome may influence colonization resistance and thus host physiology. Low-caloric intake may additionally be associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress, with possible repercussions on the functioning of the immune system [6]. Countermeasures have been developed to provide more balanced diets with increased average caloric intake, optimized to reduce nutrient deficiency and to improve energy supply to lessen the potential downstream dysregulation of the immune system [168]. Despite these efforts, however, diet imbalance during spaceflight remains an issue, as it depends on multiple factors that are not limited to food quality ad palatability but also include cultural habits, alteration of circadian rhythms and in general, the stress associated with the mission [169]. Notwithstanding individual differences, microbiome studies carried out in both real and analog missions generally reported rearrangements in the gut microbiome consistent with the higher abundance of bacteria associated with chronic intestinal inflammation and a concomitant reduction in the number of genera with known anti-inflammatory properties [89,94,98]. In some cases, these data correlated with a moderate increase in the inflammatory immune response observed in the crew during spaceflight [98]. Such changes in relative abundance of gut microbial components are possibly the result of multiple factors connected to spaceflight. However, evidence demonstrated the impact of the diet—i.e., a plant- and fiber-based BLSS-dietary structure—on the maintenance of a high gut microbiome diversity enriched with bacteria having anti-inflammatory action during analog missions [95]. Production of SCFAs through gut microbiome-mediated fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates was shown to contribute, among other things, to the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis [170]. Providing the crewmembers with a balanced diet, possibly delivered through BLSSs and rich in fibers, is therefore of great importance to help prevent nutritional imbalances as well as to preserve a healthy gut microbiome. Due to individual differences, personalized nutritional approaches have been suggested [171]. Furthermore, probiotics-based countermeasures via the supplementation of given bacteria strains (e.g., Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, etc.) [98,172,173] or the administration of SCFA-producing next-generation probiotics (Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, etc.) [174], have additionally been proposed. 3.5. Microbiome and Crewmembers Mental and Physical Health As we have emphasized throughout the review, the human microbiome contributes to overall health through different routes, including protection against pathogens, maintenance of the immune system, proper intestinal function, and contribution to metabolic functions [79,106,175]. Competitive exclusion of pathogenic bacteria is one of the main functions exerted by the microbiome communities residing in various anatomic sites of the human body. Antagonistic interactions play a pivotal role in determining the composition of a functional antimicrobial barrier, by means of strategies that include production of antibiotics, secretion of digestive enzymes, and quorum sensing [176]. Accordingly, the establishment of new microbes can be prevented through competition for shared nutrients and other resources, with endogenous bacteria [177]. Moreover, microbial communities help strengthen mucosal barrier function and can stimulate epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides and proteins (e.g., bacteriocins), thereby killing pathogenic competitors and preventing translocation [173,178,179]. In view of this, particular concern has been generated by the documented changes in the astronauts’ microbiome [97,98,100,101] and their potential effects on astronaut health and performance, in conjunction with immune system dysregulations and increased risk of pathogenic infections during spaceflight [103,180]—e.g., transient or permanent governance of pathogenic/opportunistic bacterial species, e.g., Staphylococcus spp. [181] along with enhanced HGT and decreased susceptibility of pathogens to antimicrobial agents [80]. As a matter of fact, crewmembers do experience adverse medical events of varying severity during spaceflight missions, related to infectious diseases, which include cold sores, skin and urinary tract infections, lymphadenitis and pharyngitis [182]. An altered microbiome is not only associated with the onset of infections but with non-infectious diseases as well, such as inflammatory bowel disease [183], systemic metabolic disorder (e.g., type 2 diabetes and obesity) and allergic reactions and sensitivities [184,185]. Changes in the oropharingeal and in the skin microbiome are implicated in the development and progression of caries, gingivitis, tooth decay, as well as endocarditis and heart disease [186,187,188,189], pharyngitis, asthma and pneumonia [190,191,192], acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and chronic wound pathology [193,194]. Moreover, evidence of microbial dysbiosis has been observed in conjunction with various types of cancers [195], including colorectal cancer (CRC) [30,196] and breast cancer [31], among others. The space environment has been shown to alter the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor cell proliferation, transformation and survival [197]. Indeed, US astronauts have an increased incidence of prostate cancer and melanoma, similar to that observed with airline pilots, compared to the general US population [198]. Considering the role that an altered microbiome plays in cancer development and/or progression, microbial disruption during spaceflight, coupled with higher radiation exposure [55], could put astronauts at an even greater risk of developing certain types of cancers with long-duration missions. In addition to the aforementioned functions of the microbiome in supporting host physiology, research has more recently shed light on the relationship between the gut microbiome and mental health through what is known as the brain–gut–microbiome axis (BGMA) [199]. BGMA signaling has been suggested to be bi-directional, as not only can gut bacteria influence health and the development of emotional behavior, but psychological states can in turn alter gut health [200]. Moreover, the communication appears to occur directly and indirectly via the central and enteric nervous systems and the vagus nerve, through endocrine, neural and immune pathways [115]. Microbiota–gut–brain communication has hitherto mostly been explored in animal models, with human research lagging behind. However, studies have indicated that the gut microbiota can modulate the BGMA via multiple mechanisms, including alterations in microbial composition (i.e., SCFA-producing bacteria seem to be associated with higher mental quality of life indicators [201]) or the potential production of microbial neuroactive metabolites (e.g., SCFAs, neurotransmitters, hormones or neurotoxic metabolites) [202,203]. Preliminary studies have also demonstrated gut microbiota alterations in subjects affected by neurodevelopment disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders [204,205]. Furthermore, perturbations of the BGMA have been found in association with stress-related gastrointestinal disorders [206], as well as increased anxiety [207], depression [208], Parkinson’s disease [209] and decreased cognitive abilities [203], suggesting that the microbiota may contribute to shaping cognitive networks encompassing emotional and social domains [205]. Of interest, altered BGMA and microbiome have also been found in conjunction with disrupted sleep physiology, with microbiome diversity being positively correlated with increased sleep efficiency and total sleep time [200]. Cognitive or behavioral conditions reported during spaceflight include reduced sleep quality and increased anxiety and depression, which can be accompanied by the impairment of psychomotor functions and neurocognitive performance [210,211]. Occurring as a result of several mission-related environmental (e.g., radiation, microgravity, excessive exposure to noise and light) and psychosocial stressors (e.g., isolation, homesickness), these symptoms represent a threat to the success of space missions, as they greatly affect astronaut wellbeing [212]. In light of the bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiome and the brain [213], based on which the microbiome can influence cognition and emotion, it can be assumed that strategies aimed at maintaining a healthy microbiome might also be helpful in mitigating unwanted neurobehavioral effects [115]. In line with this, research shows that successful treatment of anxiety symptoms can be achieved by regulation of intestinal microbiota by means of both probiotic and non-probiotic (e.g., regulating diet, supplementation of short-chain fructooligosaccharides scFOS) interventions [214]. This aspect is of particular significance as it underlines the far-reaching impact of the gut microbiome and offers new perspectives regarding the understanding and at the same time the mitigation of psychological stressors (external or self-imposed) that may arise during spaceflight. Although microbiome changes generally seem to rebound after returning to Earth [97], the entity and persistence of alterations induced by longer space missions (e.g., deep-space missions) and the associated risk of increased severity of infection, disease onset, and mental health impairments, are yet to be fully assessed. In the long run, compositional changes in the gut flora might even predispose astronauts to more prolonged-development diseases such as IBS, autoimmunity and even cancer [182]. The risks associated with these factors should therefore be explored in more depth.4. Spaceflight, Microbiome and Immunity Understanding the combined effects of spaceflight on the immune system is significant for the health and safety of crewmembers and is an important area of interest as long-term exploration flights become more common. The intense conditions that astronauts encounter in space, including radiation exposure, microgravity, changes in diet, disruption of circadian rhythm and stress, all have an effect on the immune system (Figure 2) [6,215,216,217,218,219,220]. A dysregulated immune response has been well-established during spaceflight, with many changes to immune cell parameters, such as in the distribution, function and proliferation of leukocytes [215,216,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229], cytokine profiles [97,217,219,221,222,229,230,231,232,233] and neutrophil [221,234], monocyte [232,235] and NK cell function [236,237,238]. As discussed earlier, microbial physiology changes as a result of spaceflight, with one such change being increased virulence in some pathogens grown in space [139,144,239,240], which is problematic considering the dysregulated immune responses astronauts experience during spaceflight [6,97]. However, the observation that a vaccine administered in space was able to stimulate an appropriate immune response is promising for long-term missions [97]. The effect of gut microbiome dysbiosis is an essential factor to consider when reflecting on the immunity of astronauts as the microbiome has essential roles in the development and function of both the innate immune system—including regulating neutrophils [241], and macrophages [242,243], and the adaptive immune system—including influence on the function and repertoire of B cells [244], the induction of intestinal IgA [245], the differentiation of Tfh cells [246,247], and transition of antigen-activated CD8 T cells into memory cells [248]. Although there are variations in the results due to different circumstances such as spaceflight duration, sample retrieval and experimental protocols, overall, the generation, function or proportion of immune cells are affected during spaceflight, which disrupts the homeostasis required for an appropriate immune response [97,222,228]. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been associated with a dysregulated immune system, where changes in T cell regulation and cytokine secretion are observed [249,250,251,252]. The gut microbiome has a significant role in differentiating naive CD4+ T cells, which defend against extracellular pathogens and suppress the immune system when a response is not required. Microbes such as Bacteroides fragilis, segmented filamentous bacteria and Clostridia can differentially induce the development of TH1, TH17 and Treg cells, respectively [19,250,253,254,255]. T cell function is affected in space, but the response differs depending on the flight duration, as short-term missions increase T cell function and long-term missions cause T cell function to decrease upon landing [229]. Cytokine production profiles, such as IFN𝛾, IL-17 and IL-10, are also affected during spaceflight [222,228]. These are cytokines that are secreted from immune cells, which are regulated by the gut microbiome [249,256,257]. Additionally, astronauts experience spaceflight-related reductions in certain SCFA-producing bacteria in their gut microbiome, such as Pseudobutyrivibrio and Akkermansia [98], which may be a result of the imposed conditions of flight, such as the decrease in dietary fiber in the astronaut diet [6,258]. SCFAs produced by the gut microbiota are important in immune system regulation, as they have a role in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function, generation and cytokine secretion [259,260]. Butyrate, for example, has been identified in reducing gastrointestinal inflammation through the induction of IL-10, inhibiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and regulating innate immune cells and Treg cells [261,262,263,264]. Although many other factors have been implicated in the dysregulation of the immune system in space, the microbiome’s effect cannot be discounted. Many astronauts experience uncharacteristic allergies and skin rashes during spaceflight [182], with some requiring antihistamines or steroids to manage these reactions [265]. These hypersensitivities may result from a TH2 shift in the immune system, which has been observed to occur in spaceflight [229]. Significantly higher IL-10 levels than IFN𝛾, which suggest a shift towards a TH2 response, were also observed among astronauts upon landing [229]. Skin reactions in space could be associated with changes to the skin microbiome since decreases in Gram-negative Proteobacteria, which includes Acinetobacter, were documented in astronauts [98]. Acinetobacter is a commensal skin microbe that can help maintain homeostasis by reducing inflammation, regulating the balance between TH1 and TH2 cells, and inducing IL-10 production [266,267]. The relative proportions of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, in particular staphylococcal and streptococcal species, increase in the skin microbiome during space flight [98]. An increase in Staphylococcus aureus colonization has been seen in patients with atopic dermatitis on Earth [268,269]. These alterations to the skin microbiome may contribute to the overactive immune responses encountered in space and may contribute to conditions such as erythema, psoriasis, various types of dermatitis and delayed wound healing, which represent frequent skin problems during space missions [126,265,270,271]. Increased and persistent reactivation of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus, herpes-simplex-1, and cytomegalovirus, four naturally occurring latent herpesviruses, have been reported by astronauts during both short- (10–16 days) and long (60–180 days)-duration missions, with viral titers and shedding increased with the length of the mission [272,273]. While a robust and competent immune system is necessary to maintain latency, as observed in spaceflight [231,274] and space analog studies [275,276], a dysbiotic microbiome could also be a contributing factor (Figure 2). This could be through changes in microbiome-immune modulation, or through changes in bacterial–viral interactions. In the case of the latter, metabolites produced from the oral microbiome were shown to influence viral reactivation from latent human immunodeficiency virus, Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus, and EBV, by activating viral promotors or causing epigenetic modifications of the viral genome [277,278,279,280]. Correlation analyses between the salivary microbiome and EBV titers, in astronaut saliva, revealed a strong positive correlation (suggestive of promotion) with Gracilibacteria and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation (suggestive of protection) with Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus [101]. Veillonella is one of the main hydrogen sulfide (H2S) producers in the oral cavity [281], a chemical that is also produced by the intestinal microbiome [282]. While H2S displays antiviral activity against pathogenic RNA viruses [283,284], it is also regarded as an endogenous regulator of both the innate and adaptive immune arms [285]. Research has shown that therapeutically administered doses of H2S can improve the function of various immune cells and protect them against dysfunction from various stressors (reviewed in [285]). Studies are currently limited regarding the role of the microbiome in latent viral reactivation, especially as it pertains to spaceflight. However, this is a topic that warrants further investigation to help reduce the risks and complications of viral infections in astronauts during long-duration missions. While it is important to note that many cases on the ISS are asymptomatic [286], with a lower incidence of reactivation in recent years attributed to better biomedical countermeasures [287], infections that do arise, under certain circumstances, can lead to shingles, mononucleosis, various types of cancers and different inflammatory diseases such as myocarditis and pancreatitis, all of which will be hard to treat in outer space. Many immune responses and resulting medical issues encountered by astronauts during spaceflight could be linked to abnormal microbiomes, and further studies should be conducted to gain insight into the mechanisms of these microbiomes in human health and immunity. 5. The Impact of the Built Environment on the Astronaut Microbiome The microbiome of the built environment is the collective of microbial inhabitants in human-constructed environments [288]. The indoor microbiome is infrastructurally unique and differs between hospitals, offices, classrooms, and homes influenced by variations in material design, ventilation, temperature, humidity, pressure, and occupants [289,290,291,292,293]. Humans leave behind a microbial footprint through shedding, exhalation, and waste, accounting for approximately 40% of the microbes found in buildings [294,295]. It has been shown that less urbanized and more confined environments with reduced outside contact are even more overshadowed by human-associated microbes [296]. The ISS is one such confined environment, a unique habitat where the only exchange with the “outside” comes from the turnover in crew members, cargo capsules and supplies, with crew members being the main source of the ISS built environment microbial community [98,99,297,298]. Of the most abundant microbes catalogued on the ISS are those pertaining to skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts [98,99,299]. These include Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium, Actinobacterium, Enterobacterium, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, and Pantoea, along with various bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes [78,98,297,299,300]. The ISS microbiome has also been observed to change over time in accordance with flight and exchange of crewmembers suggesting that temporal changes in the built environment may be due to different occupants on board [297]. Earth-based studies in the inflatable lunar/Mars habitat mimicked this trend where microbial communities during complete vacancy at day 0 differed from those seen at day 30 post human occupancy [301]. Although there is ample evidence that the human microbiome can influence the built environment, microbial transfer is not unidirectional. Early microbial studies in Russian astronauts aboard the Salyut and Mir orbital stations, revealed an interchange of gut microbiota between crew members [122,302]. With new metagenomic technologies, a direct transmission between ISS surfaces and the astronaut microbiome has been observed, through either single-nucleotide polymorphism, haplotype matching and/or genomic read recruiting [303,304]. This two-way microbial transfer between the ISS environment and the astronaut suggests ISS occupants can not only help build the microbiome of the ISS, but also uptake it as their own. Microbial transfer between astronaut and the ISS environment, as well as astronaut to astronaut (via surfaces) can be hazardous due to the altered immunity astronauts encounter during spaceflight, increasing their susceptibility to infection from opportunistic pathogens (Figure 2) [156,235,236,305,306,307]. Evidence of opportunistic pathogens identified on ISS surfaces include cultivable populations of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Platanthera conspicua, Acinetobacter pittii, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus [297]. Although the ISS and astronauts are strictly monitored to prevent risks from pathogenic infection, conjunctivitis, acute upper respiratory tract, and urinary tract infections have been reported by crew members of the ISS [308,309]. Microbial virulence and antimicrobial resistance of these opportunistic pathogens could be further increased by the stressors of space, making infection not only more likely, but possibly harder to treat [217,310,311,312,313]. For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis grown in space acquired mutations in the rpoB gene, heightening its resistance to rifampcin [314,315] and Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from the ISS was significantly more lethal to neutrophil-deficient zebrafish compared to Earth-based clinical isolates [240]. Building material can affect microbiome diversity and pathogenesis as well. Materials with higher hygroscopicity and porosity tend to have higher microbiome diversity due to moisture accumulation and environmental protection [316,317,318,319]. A submerged analog habitat that simulates ISS confinement and pressure found that different niches between particle board surfaces (LDP) and glass/metal surfaces selected for different viable microbial communities, with microbes found on LDP surfaces having higher abundance of antimicrobial and virulence associated genes. This suggests that material type can not only affect microbial diversity, but also pathogenicity [318]. It has been hypothesized that increased virulence and AMR resistance in confined environments, with low microbial diversity, are a result of adaptations that help bacteria and fungi survive in these restricted conditions [320,321,322,323]. These genomic and metabolic changes that occur in confined environments could explain the many novel species that have been identified in various confined habitats [324,325,326,327,328]. Efforts toward design of spacecraft materials to mitigate pathogenic growth would benefit from the prevention of infection rather than relying on treatment after infection, with limited medical resources. Analysis of other highly controlled environments such as spacecraft assembly clean rooms and intensive care units revealed that microbes in controlled environments rely more on nitrogen, carbohydrate, and heightened drug metabolisms versus in uncontrolled environments where microbes depend more on oxygen and amino acid metabolisms [329,330]. Understanding how microbes adapt to utilize different resources in a controlled built environment can help provide insight in future spacecraft design. Another consideration for future spacecraft design is the risk of biofilm formation which can affect astronaut health and spacecraft integrity. Biofilms are associated with a range of disease including cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, prostatitis, rhinosinusitis, otitis media, urinary tract infection, endocarditis, periodontitis, and infectious kidney stones [331,332] and are responsible for 80% of chronic and recurrent infections [331,333,334]. Biofilms also induce corrosion, lead to mechanical blockages, and decrease the effectiveness of heat transfer on ISS equipment [335,336,337,338,339], putting spacecraft integrity at risk and posing an indirect safety hazard to the crew. Biofilm forming microbes such as Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Corynebacterium, Klebsiella and fungi Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula have been found on the ISS [297], though it is important to note that almost all species of bacteria can form biofilms under certain conditions; hence, many more biofilm formers could be present on the ISS. The astronaut microbiota heavily contributes to the built environment of the ISS. Once transferred from host to environment, stressors such as microgravity, radiation, and confinement can alter pathogenicity, making it an infection risk for crew members should it be transferred to them from the environment. It is therefore vital to continually monitor microbial pathogenesis on the ISS to avoid crew member infections and continue studying the built environment for optimization for future space travel.6. Microbiome and Bone Health Astronaut bone loss during space flight has been an unresolved medical concern since the 1970s. Pre- and post-flight measurements of bone density in astronauts quantified with absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography have shown an overall bone loss rate of 1–1.5% per month with areas of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and lower limbs contributing most heavily to the decline in bone density (Figure 2) [340,341,342,343,344,345]. Measurements of volumetric bone mineral density in astronaut tibias after spaceflight showed a 5-percentile reduction that is comparable to average bone loss occurring in men over twenty years and 6 times faster than the accelerated bone loss that is often seen in menopausal women [346]. These findings have made bone loss treatment and prevention a high priority for astronaut health and safety. Bones undergo modeling during development and remodeling in later stages of life to form, replace, and remove bone [347]. Osteoblasts are derived from stromal cells of the bone marrow and are responsible for bone formation [348]. In contrast, osteoclasts that derive from the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, resorb bone during remodeling, making the equilibrium between the bone forming osteoblast and bone resorbing osteoclast vital to overall bone homeostasis [349,350]. Bone formation and resorption can be biochemically measured in the urine through quantification of proteins produced during formation, such as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, as well as peptides released during matrix degradation, such as hydoxyproline, collagen type I, pyridinoline, and deoxypyridinoline [345,351,352]. These biochemical assays have been conducted on astronaut urine before, during, and after spaceflight to reveal that bone resorption markers heavily increase during spaceflight with only a slow increase in bone formation markers [345,353,354,355,356,357,358,359,360,361,362]. Post-flight measurements showed exponential decreases in bone resorption markers, but only a linear increase in bone formation markers, keeping bone homeostasis out of equilibrium during and post flight [345,357,358,359,362,363]. Furthermore, trabecular bone, the sponge-like structure at the epiphyses of long bones involved in metabolic processes associated with bone turnover, was also reduced post-flight [364,365,366]. Compromised trabeculae can irreversibly damage bone structure altogether [367,368]. One hypothesis contributing to region-specific bone loss during spaceflight is the changes in mechanical loading induced by microgravity [369,370]. High mechanical loading zones are reduced to low mechanical loading in microgravity and may therefore also reduce bone for the lack of necessity in that region. Extensive resistive exercise regimes have been employed in astronauts to stimulate mechanical loading to these areas that have shown to reduce bone loss, but do not ameliorate the bone loss process [342,345,365,371,372,373]. It has also been pointed out by Stanichuk et al. that bone density changes were also found in areas of neutral mechanical loading such as the skull, suggesting that microgravity-induced changes in mechanical loading may not be the sole contributor to bone changes during spaceflight [345]. With increased understanding of the influence of the microbiome to overall health, many studies have revealed that the gut microbiome can also specifically influence bone health. Proteins and SCFAs produced by the gut microbiome have been shown to promote bone formation [374]. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produce by Lactobacillus of the gut microbiome, promotes bone formation through T cell signaling inducing differentiation of osteoblasts in the bone marrow [375,376,377,378]. The gut microbiome is also a rich source of vitamin K2, which is required for the activation of osteocalcin, a protein produced by osteoblasts during bone formation [379,380]. Antibiotic-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis dampens vitamin K2 synthesis and is associated with decreases in osteocalcin and bone strength [381]. Bone loss in models that promote bone resorption can be reduced through dietary supplementation of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus reuteri which protects against bone resorption in estrogen-deficient mice [382,383] and trabecular bone loss during antibiotic dysbiosis in mice [384,385]. Gut microbiome dysbiosis has been linked to bone disease in humans with osteoporosis and osteopenia, where diseased patients showed higher microbiome diversity than their healthy counterparts, and the severity of bone loss is positively correlated with higher microbiome diversity [386,387]. Gut microbiome dysbiosis can lead to inflammation followed by intestinal permeability that allows the gut microbiome to enter circulation [388,389]. Microbes in circulation stimulate an immune response from immune cells that recognize lipopolysaccharides using Toll-like receptors. Once recognized, the immune cells then activate to produce cytokines that promote maturation of TH17 cells in the bone marrow which then stimulate osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption [390,391,392]. As we have mentioned, the stressors of spaceflight can stimulate astronaut microbiome dysbiosis [110,111,217,393,394]. One such change during spaceflight is the decrease in genera with anti-inflammatory properties in the gut microbiome and the increase in Parasutterella, known to be associated with chronic inflammation [98,115]. These microbial changes may be increasing intestinal inflammation, which signals the promotion of bone resorption. Additionally, it is worth noting that astronaut gut microbiomes have been reported to have an increased abundance in Firmicutes [81], a similar phenomenon seen in the gut microbiomes of patients with osteoporosis [374,387]. There is evidence of both astronaut bone loss and microbiome dysbiosis during spaceflight; however, research is lacking on a possible association between the two. Additional investigation on this relationship could provide easier methods of inflight bone loss treatment and prevention through dietary pre and probiotic supplementation. Combining microbiome symbiosis with exercise regimes that maintain mechanical loading may help diminish bone loss during space travel.7. Gender Differences As space exploration expands to include more long-term missions, the health and safety of both male and female astronauts are important factors to consider. As there are many differences between the sexes, including the composition of their microbiomes, making sure that these differences are identified and evaluated is critical for understanding the impact spaceflight has on crewmembers. Microbiome diversity and composition diverge at similar ages after puberty in males and females, and high testosterone or estradiol levels result in a more diverse gut microbiome [395,396,397]. Studies have shown that microbes in the intestinal tract can impact sex hormone levels, and sex hormones have a role in shaping the gut microbiome composition [396,397,398,399,400,401,402,403]. This bi-directional relationship contributes to the gender-specific differences observed in disease, such as a greater occurrence of CaOx kidney stones [404,405,406,407,408] and earlier onset of cardiovascular disease in males [409], and postmenopausal osteoporosis [410,411] and IBS [412,413] in females. This relationship has also been implicated in ovarian cancer [414,415] and polycystic ovary syndrome [416,417]. Sex hormones have been shown to affect the immune system through interactions with the gut microbiome, including influencing the gut barrier permeability and interacting with immune cells [418,419]. Studies show that there are sex-specific differences in the immune system, which are independent of the gut microbiota and are already present in germ-free mice, suggesting that the immune system can select a gender-specific gut microbiome conformation, which also plays a part in the differential influence on the immune system observed across genders [420]. These gender-specific differences in immunity result in males being more susceptible to infections [421], and females being more susceptible to autoimmune disorders [422]. The implications of microbial dysbiosis on astronaut health can be better evaluated when the gender-specific distinctions between male and female microbiomes are considered. Astronauts’ microbiomes are exposed to and influenced by many intense factors in space, and there is evidence that these factors have a gender bias. Astronauts are exposed to cosmic radiation, which has been observed to alter the gut microbiome composition [423]. Cui et al. conducted animal studies with mice to show that the effect of radiation toxicity is more prevalent on female gut microbiomes and that gender-matched fecal microbiota transplantation was most successful in reversing these effects [424]. Females are also more vulnerable to radiation-induced cancer than males, especially radiation-induced breast, lung, thyroid and ovarian cancer [425,426]. Looking more closely at the microbiomes of Chernobyl victims or nuclear power plant workers may be an area of interest to further investigate the long-term effects of radiation [427,428]. There are also extensive lifestyle changes during spaceflight, which include alterations to circadian rhythms and modifications to the diet. Changes in sleep patterns have been observed to have an influence on the gut microbiome, leading to a higher risk of breast cancer in females [429,430,431,432]. Diet has a sex-specific effect on the microbiome, where variations in changes to the microbiome composition have been observed in the presence of different diets and prebiotics [398,433,434,435]. Dietary fibers can affect estrogen levels [436], whose link with the microbiome has been recognized, and high-fat high-sugar diets can affect bile acid production differently across genders, which also has been shown to influence the gut microbiome [398]. Astronauts experience high levels of stress in space due to a multitude of factors, including isolation, resulting in higher levels of cortisol and catecholamines [437]. Increased levels of stress-induced cortisol can trigger an inflammation response, disrupt the intestinal barrier and alter microbial composition [438,439,440]. As there are sex-specific differences between the way males and females regulate their stress response, the impact on the microbiome varies [441,442]. Studies examining the effect of isolation on prairie voles showed gender-specific changes in the gut microbiome composition [443]. Dietary supplementation of DHA reduced stress and changed the microbiome composition in socially isolated male mice, but not in female mice, further suggesting the impact of sex-specific stress responses on the microbiome [444]. Cortisol can also negatively impact the vaginal microbiome by inhibiting the glycogen deposition, which can lead to genitourinary tract infections [445]. Therefore, the associated stress of spaceflight has a different impact on male and female microbiomes, which may contribute to the gender-specific associated health risks of space travel. The disproportion of men compared to women who have flown to space introduces a bias to the data collected from astronauts and the available evidence limits the conclusions that can be made on the impacts of space exploration on female health. Recognizing gender-specific differences in the microbiome response to the extreme factors of space will allow for better and more personalized countermeasures and medical care to help preserve the homeostasis of the microbiome and as a result, the health of astronauts. 8. Pharmogenetics, Spaceflight and the Microbiome Even with countermeasures and preventions put in place to keep astronauts safe during long-duration missions, the extended time in space with prolonged exposure to radiation, weightlessness, and other stressors on the body will inevitably lead to medical issues that arise during flight. These ailments will need to be addressed by pharmaceutical intervention with even more robustness and rigor than in low-earth orbit, due to the inability for emergency evacuation and limited non-medicinal interventions. An excellent review by Blue et al. discusses the challenges and current understanding for NASA in supplying a pharmacy for exploration spaceflight [446]. Medication has been used for decades by astronauts during spaceflight to help relieve symptoms such as headaches and muscle/joint pain [447], or for more serious issues, such as treating jugular venous thrombosis [448]. Medical toolkits onboard the ISS now contain about 190 different frequently used pharmaceuticals. However, observational studies and anecdotal reports from crew members indicate medications to be “not effective” or “less effective” at managing their complaints (Figure 2) [446,449,450]. More formal studies support these reports and suggest altered drug disposition in space compared to Earth, which include differences in efficacy, absorption, drug elimination, pro-drug activation and build-up of toxic metabolites [446,447]. While human physiological changes [451,452] and reduced drug self-life [453,454] during spaceflight can alter drug disposition in space, the gut microbiome can also contribute to differential drug efficacy and safety, by enzymatically transforming drug structure and altering drug bioavailability, bioactivity, or toxicity [455,456]. For example, the common human gut bacterium, Eggerthella lenta, inactivates the cardiac drug digoxin, used to treat heart failure and arrythmia, via a two-gene ‘cardiac glycoside reductase’ (cgr) operon, which is conserved and widespread within the human-associated gut microbiome [457]. It has also been shown that co-culture of E. lenta with the fecal microbiome increased cgr expression, thereby enhancing digoxin metabolism and inactivation [458], reminding us of the interconnectedness of microbial species within a community and its impact on the host. Of interest, dietary protein was able to reduce digoxin metabolism [458], thereby maintaining its efficacy. This has important implications for the crew as a carefully considered “microbiome diet” could help ameliorate any negative effects that may be imposed by a dynamic and changing microbiome caused by spaceflight. The gut microbiome can also promote drug activation, which was first discovered in 1937, with the antibiotic prontosil, which required bacterial azoreductases in the gut to cleave the drug into its active form [459]. Since then, other prodrugs have been developed, such as sulfasalazine, balsalazide, and olsalazine, used to treat ulcerative colitis, which rely on colonic bacteria for activation [460]. Unfortunately, microbial-mediated drug metabolism can also lead to toxic side effects, with the most notable example being that of sorivudine, an antiviral agent, which led to the death of 18 people in Japan, and which was withdrawn from the market only weeks after being released [461]. This example stresses the importance of incorporating pharmacomicrobiomics (the study of microbe–drug interactions) [462] when making policies and decisions for planned and future missions. To date, over 270 drugs have been recognized as being susceptible to gut microbiome metabolism, leading to inactive, active or toxic forms [461]. Some that may be of relevance to spaceflight currently or in the future include acetaminophen—used to treat mild to moderate pain and reduce fever [463]; ranitidine and nizatidine—antacids used to treat and prevent stomach ulcers and acid reflux [464]; loperamide—used to treat acute diarrhea [465]; metronidazole—an antibiotic [466]; and methotrexate to treat breast, bone and lung cancer, along with rheumatoid arthritis [467]. There is still a great deal of work that needs to be carried out to understand the host–microbiome–drug response and how it affects each individual astronaut in flight and on the ground. Understanding how the astronaut microbiome composition, its collective genes, the expression of those genes and the metabolites they produce change during spaceflight and post-flight will undoubtedly help prevent serious side effects from microbe–drug interactions, but also make a positive impact on an astronaut’s response to a given drug. Opportunities for drug substitutions could be available, as multiple drugs within a drug class can be differentially affected by the gut microbiome. For example, while the H2 antagonists ranitidine and nizatidine were quickly metabolized and negatively affected by colonic bacteria, cimetidine and famotidine (also H2 antagonists) were not [464]. In human bedrest analog studies, used to mimic microgravity, on Earth, the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin was effected [468], but not of penicillin [469,470]. Knowledge of this kind can help us to make more informed decisions of which drugs should be included in the medical toolkit for flight. 9. Recommendations Maintaining astronaut health and performance is necessary to ensure successful long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit. With NASA’s long-term plans to include crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, incorporating microbiome data into planning and policies will help astronauts complete these challenging missions and preserve their long-term health. In this section, we provide recommendations on how best to incorporate microbiome research when designing and planning for the next milestone in space exploration. We recommend the following: Personalized microbiome monitoring plus personalized countermeasures to strengthen microbiome resilience to deep-space exploration. Inclusion of more women astronauts in space biology studies to determine gender-specific effects of space travel. Investigations that include a systems biology approach to obtain a comprehensive overview of gene expression and metabolic networks, e.g., the metabolites produced from microbiome and host. Many gaps in our understanding exist about host–microbe interactions and how they are essential to human health and wellbeing. It is thus crucial that research be prioritized to assess what are the key beneficial interactions and associated molecular processes that contribute to maintaining function. Comprehensive analysis of the impact of space conditions on microbial communities that includes the study of both pathogenic and beneficial microbes and their mutualistic interactions. Though pathogenic microbes represent a potential risk to astronauts, it is essential to have an understanding of mutualistic microbes to learn what drives microbial fitness in the spaceflight environment and how to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans and their microbiome. Achieving a better understanding of the interplay of changes in microbiome composition and their impact on the astronauts can help in developing prevention or countermeasures. There is a need to evaluate the long-term effects of microgravity (or diverse gravity) on the microbiome. So far, studies have been carried out for a maximum of 1 year. Longer studies on the same human subjects are not possible. The development of computational models for simulation and analysis could represent an alternative approach. More directed studies regarding probiotics and prebiotics in the astronaut diet, to modulate and balance the microbiome and aid in reducing inflammation, bone loss and other impacts of spaceflight. Promote research on built environment material design such as using natural antimicrobial materials or treatment of surfaces with specialized coatings. These can help reduce bacterial load, biofilm formation, HGT transfer and prevent changes in bacterial physiology that could be detrimental to astronaut health and spacecraft integrity. 10. Conclusions By the end of the decade, NASA aims to establish a sustainable habitat on the Moon, followed by the next ambitious plan of human occupation on Mars. NASA, along with other space agencies, government, academia, and industry are striving to address the challenges of living in space for long periods of time. Missions to the Moon would be 1000× farther from the Earth than the International Space Station, and a mission to Mars would last at least 6 months. The 20 years of human studies conducted on the ISS have provided invaluable knowledge of how the human body adapts to the space environment, but more work is needed to understand how the human body will function and adapt to space conditions beyond LEO. One such adaptation is the human microbiome, and as discussed in this review, this plays a significant role in modulating health and disease. We have demonstrated the importance of a balanced microbiome to help maintain astronaut health in orbit and have discussed adverse events experienced by the crew during missions of varying lengths and how the microbiome (either balanced or in dysbiosis) ties into those medical events. Moreover, we have examined less well-established links between spaceflight, bone loss and the microbiome and emphasized the importance of taking into account gender differences when designing appropriate countermeasures for short- and long-term missions. In addition, we have also examined the role that the microbiome can play in altering the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals that are part of the astronaut medical toolkit in space, and the consequence of this for long-term missions. As we move forward with long-term space travel and human habitation beyond LEO, more studies will be needed that explore the astronaut microbiome, the factors governing its stability or disruption and its interaction with the host and the spacecraft environment. We hope that the literature presented in this review and the recommendations provided will help in future study design, technology and product development, and policies that center around the human microbiome, as we propel human exploration beyond anything we have seen so far.

    "introduction": "Introduction Humanity may be tempted to view the cosmos as a rich reservoir of infinite resources. However, the practical reality of space exploration tells a different story. The need for sustainability in space exploration, as well as the exploitation of space, is becoming more evident with the strengthening desire for the expansion of human activities beyond Earth-orbit, pursued by public and private sectors alike. When applied to space, the concept of sustainability has often been understood as \"ensuring that all humanity can continue to use outer space for peaceful purposes and socioeconomic benefit now and in the long term\"1. Until now, it mainly referred to the need to control, regulate, and remove space debris from low Earth orbit (LEO)2,3 and planetary protection (which promotes the implementation and development of the responsible exploration of the solar system, in order to protect the space environments and Earth)3. As humans aspire to venture into deep space, the definition of this concept shifts and expands, and the self-sustainability of mission operations becomes a critical aspect. Loop-closure, which indicates the recycling and the reuse of resources toward the establishment of a circular economy, could greatly enhance the sustainability of space exploration, and it is key not only to minimise the costs of resupply of resources from Earth but also for ethical considerations associated with space waste generation and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments4–10. The United Nations resolved that outer space activities should minimise impacts on the space environment, as well as on Earth, taking into account the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development11,12. The biggest impediment to progress on this frontier is the lack of deployable technologies enabling outposts, extended missions and, in the future, settlements, to sustain themselves through in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and maximised recycling of resources5. In addition to mechanical/physical/chemical approaches, biotechnologies broadly and microorganisms specifically will help enable long-term life-support and habitat systems’ performance (loop-closure), as well as ISRU, manufacturing and energy collection/storage6,7,13–17. Microbiological approaches can be self-sustaining with occasional monitoring and maintenance, owing to their resilience, and could overall require less energy than physicochemical approaches16. Here, we focus on the pivotal roles that microorganisms can play in the development of technologies for sustainable human exploration of deep space, considering two main aspects: (i) the requirement for mature biotechnologies and bioprocesses to allow near closed-loop operations of mission functions, such as life-support, to increase autonomy and sustainability; and (ii) the need to reduce supply chain dependency for the expansion of human presence in space. The approaches presented here are based on processes and technologies currently implemented on Earth at different technology readiness levels (TRL), which must be adapted to meet the specific requirements and challenges of the space environment. Selecting the most suitable bioprocess and most applicable microorganism for any given space application is non-trivial, as terrestrial technologies are rarely readily adaptable to the harsh conditions of space18. Therefore, extensive research and development are compulsory to increase TRL to the point where these technologies can be successfully implemented in space16. Finally, microbial biotechnologies aimed to increase the sustainability of space exploration may be translatable to Earth applications for advancement towards a circular economy, further supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)11,12.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions With this work, we aimed to advocate the urgency of sustainable approaches for human space exploration, and the essential role microbial biotechnologies could play in this. It has been discussed how microbial biotechnologies may support several processes that, in turn, can help decrease supply chain dependency (from Earth) on long-duration deep-space exploration missions to eventually enable human footholds and settlements across the solar system. In parallel, several of these microbially-supported processes may also help close the loop on LSS and other systems, which can preserve resources and extra-terrestrial environments. These two aspects, independently and together, enable space exploration in a sustainable fashion. To provide appropriate conditions for the maturation of named biotechnologies and to open the field to a wider community, research and innovation are needed. Preliminary studies should be supported in laboratories on Earth, simulation platforms, and in LEO, and full investigations in cis-Lunar space and on the Lunar surface. Augmenting existing space-based facilities to increase the capacity for space experiments, in terms of sample replicates and experimental conditions, should also be considered to improve the impact of the preliminary studies. Funding should take into account the high cost (and time) of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, on which these technologies will likely heavily rely. Finally, the potential of these technologies for terrestrial benefits has been discussed, with specific reference to the United Nation SDGs. If ultra-efficient approaches to sustaining human life and economic activity off-Earth can be adapted towards meaningfully solving problems on our planet, space exploration will have yielded a manifold return on public investments and will thereby become more sustainable not only technologically, but also politically. The debate about the public benefits of space travel and exploration is healthy and necessary, but in the field of sustainability, space advocates may now have an opportunity to win this debate for a generation.",

Finally, microbial biotechnologies aimed to increase the sustainability of space exploration may be translatable to Earth applications for advancement towards a circular economy, further supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)11,12.Habitat air bioremediation A spacecraft’s Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) manages water supply, atmospheric pressure and composition (O2, CO2, and inert-gas levels), temperature and relative humidity, as appropriate for human operations and conducive to comfortable living19. Carbon dioxide on the International Space Station (ISS) is currently scrubbed from the cabin air and converted in a Sabatier reaction to recover oxygen, while the by-product (methane) is vented into space. This has two drawbacks: (i) hydrogen is required as a substrate, production of which is energy intense; (ii) hydrogen and carbon are lost, requiring constant resupply. Recycling CO2 and/or methane back into the organic matter could improve loop-closure and preserve resources. Microbial bioremediation can support the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere in habitats, while also supplementing the generation of breathable oxygen20. The captured carbon may be upcycled again and reintegrated into the resource cycle, e.g., for the biomanufacturing of food/supplements. Alternatively, captured carbon may be sequestered for end-use (Fig. 1), e.g., for bioconcrete production or microbial-electrolytic carbon capture, as described later. Direct air capture of CO2 could reduce the need for energy-intensive auxiliary processes and shorten the recycling loop21. Researchers at the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM, University of Bremen, Germany) are exploring the application of cyanobacteria like Anabaena sp. PCC 7938 in a Martian context, taking advantage of its carbon- (photosynthetic) and nitrogen-fixing (diazotrophic) capabilities. Low carbon concentration in habitats or spacecraft yields a conversion efficiency two- to five-fold lower than with preconcentrated CO222. Hence, the most applicable approach will strongly depend on the mission scenario, in terms of size, extent and duration. Reversible carbon scrubbers23 combined with microbial conversion may enable a sustainable and near-closed process for deep space travel and exploration missions or initial human settlements24,25. Fig. 1. Graphical rendering of a microbial biotechnology-based life-support system in an agnostic space environment. Open in a new tab Microorganisms are included in all the functional compartments, including the ‘Human habitats and laboratories’ (i.e., human microbiome) and those that also require mechanochemical reactors. Up- and recycling of different resource streams and loop-closure is indicated by white arrows, supported by in situ resource utilization (coloured arrows), as applicable.Human waste processing and reclamation Human waste management poses a challenge for human space exploration, and proposed solutions commonly focus on how to compact, sterilise and dispose of human waste, rather than recycling it26. On the ISS, human waste is currently stabilised, dried and ejected from the station to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere27. This method is clearly not sustainable for long-distance missions, as it represents a sink of potentially useful resources. Solid human waste could instead be used as a feedstock for production of food and edible supplements, as well as nutrients/fertiliser for microbial or plant-based Life Support System (LSS) components (Fig. 1). Many physicochemical approaches to solid waste management, such as pyrolysis or incineration, are being proposed26. However, microbiologically supported processes could enhance human waste recycling by enhancing loop-closure. The European Space Agency (ESA) supported MELiSSA project (Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative) includes a series of interconnected bioreactors for LSS; it is a good example of how diverse types of waste-streams, including human metabolic end-products, could be upcycled using microorganisms5. Although anaerobic waste processing is usually considered less time-efficient than aerobic methods, it can achieve comparable degradation rates as physicochemical processes. A two-component system, which anaerobically converts liquid and solid human waste to protein- and lipid-rich microbial biomass for food production, has been developed28.Food production The ability to produce food in space will be of paramount importance to achieve sustainability and self-sufficiency on long-duration space missions and may be significantly enhanced by microbial biotechnology. For example, the plant microbiome will play a pivotal role in the success of crop production in space. As with the human microbiome, the plant-associated microbial community provides a multitude of benefits to the host, such as promoting plant growth, stimulating phytohormone production, controlling pathogens, regulating immune function, and alleviating abiotic and biotic stressors29. Symbiotic bacteria are also essential in solubilizing nutrients from the environment and converting them into bioavailable forms, and improving soil fertility29,30. Nitrogen recovery for food production can, for instance, be accomplished by microbial-mediated nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere, or nitrification of urine, mediated by synthetic microbial communities (see section ‘Human waste processing and reclamation’)31. For long-duration space travel, the use of agricultural probiotics should be considered to help grow robust, stable, and healthy crops in space. Agricultural probiotics are already used in farming on Earth as plant biostimulants32, as biofertilisers33 and for bioremediation to improve soil quality34. A better understanding of how the composition and function of the plant microbiome changes in spaceflight can help to customise probiotic supplements for space farming. For example, the concept of rhizobial inoculants is already in practice: seeds are inoculated with chosen strains of bacteria and fungi that can improve crop productivity and environmental sustainability35. Additional attributes of the inoculum geared towards spaceflight could also consist of bacteria/fungi that help maximise resource efficiency, thereby requiring less input for optimal growth. Algae and cyanobacteria may be cultivated not only for air revitalization, as discussed before, but also as a food source and to support plant growth9,20. For successful human outposts on the Moon or Mars, crews will have to produce their own food, taking advantage of local (in situ) resources, like regolith (see the section ‘Soil remediation’). Agricultural methods may include soil-based farming, hydroponics, cellular agriculture, etc. Creation of a greenhouse-like infrastructure, by the example of the ISS’ Advanced Plant Habitat36, and sufficient light, water supply, soil nutrients, and other necessary parameters for crop growth may enhance loop-closure. These and other resources could be obtained from other (biologically supported) LSS and ISRU compartments (Fig. 1).Pharmaceutical synthesis The idea of in situ manufacturing of drugs in space and taking advantage of microgravity has been around for decades37. The slower growth of crystals in the microgravity environment has enabled the discovery of new compounds38,39. The altered expression of microbial virulence and/or pathogenesis-related genes in space can elucidate the underlying mechanisms and assist with identifying new vaccines and treatments39,40. The space environment also brings physiological changes to astronauts during space flight39, providing accelerated models for aging and disease in drug discovery41. In the context of human exploration to the Moon or Mars, having a pharmaceutical foundry in space can remove the dependency on a supply of medicines from Earth and provide ways to manufacture drugs on demand39. Many of the carry-along pharmaceuticals will expire during a Mars-return mission of standard duration (1.5 or 2.7 years), or have reduced potency due to exposure to the space environment42, which tends to alter the active pharmaceutical ingredients and increases the concentrations of degradants or impurities42. To date, no studies have been reported on the stability of biological drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, versatile therapeutics capable of treating various space-relevant diseases, including osteoporosis, infections and inflammations. Microbes have long been used on Earth for the production of pharmaceuticals and high-value chemicals. Given the extreme conditions and limited resources in space environments, spore-forming bacteria (resisting radiation and/or desiccation), extremophiles and extremotolerants (resisting harsh environments), and photoautotrophs (surviving on inorganic carbon, e.g., cyanobacteria) have been sent to space to investigate their potential for application in biomanufacturing. Where necessary, microbes may also be engineered for the production of pharmaceuticals in space, which is not a trivial task, given the often complex biosynthetic routes to compounds of interest, as well as the diversity thereof. This also impacts downstream processing, given the stringent requirements for, e.g., purity, and because a one-fits-all solution rarely exists43. Computational and synthetic biology tools have been used to simplify the complicated metabolic pathways of conventional biotechnological drug production. For instance, acetaminophen, a versatile drug to treat infection and pain, was proposed to be synthesised by extending the shikimate (also known as chorismate) pathway of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 680344. Microbial recombinant protein expression may also be affected in space environments45. Some studies showed that protein production in Pichia pastoris, Escherichia coli, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae was higher in simulated microgravity than in Earth-gravity45. Given that the upcoming exploration missions will go beyond LEO, studies of space pharmaceutical synthesis are mainly focused on compounds or nutrients for countering microgravity-induced osteopenia and acute radiation syndrome43. Furthermore, there are efforts to investigate ways to compensate for the weakened immune system of astronauts during long-duration space missions, which can be addressed by the consumption of probiotics or prebiotics to maintain a healthy gut microbiome39,46. A source of microbes that is becoming increasingly relevant for pharmaceutical biosynthesis is the human gut microbiome. A recent metagenomic analysis from the Human Microbiome Project showed that human-associated bacteria encode the biosynthetic machinery to synthesise a vast array of secondary metabolites, such as small bioactive molecules (e.g. antibiotics). Many studies have investigated the changes in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome during spaceflight and in analogue studies47. The use of curated microbial communities (e.g. those that consist of non-pathogenic strains) could be considered to reduce the risk of infectious diseases48.Biomining Beyond LEO, the cost of the development of infrastructure increases dramatically. Therefore, a cost-effective supply of resources is required. One option is to harness in situ resources available at the destination through biomining44,49–51. Biomining, the use of microorganisms to extract valuable metals from crude minerals (e.g., regolith) and mine waste52, has seen extensive effort for adaptation to space applications50,51,53–56. Space biomining is primarily limited by economics: biologically mediated processes are often less expensive and less environmentally harmful than hydrometallurgical processes but can rarely provide the same high rates of separation. However, when taking into account the environmental and health costs associated with mining activities on Earth, biomining is already cost-effective for a variety of resources (copper, gold, nickel and cobalt extraction are all performed at a commercial scale)57. Chemolithoautotrophs (e.g., iron and/or sulphur-oxidizing microorganisms) could be suitable for biomining of sulphide minerals, occurring in a variety of settings on Mars or in asteroidal materials58. Microorganisms with other nutritional preferences (e.g., organotrophs), consortia, or bioengineering techniques could be used elsewhere: the Lunar surface is mainly composed of silica-saturated rocks, with a generally low sulphur content50,54. The need for organic nutrients to feed organotrophic microorganisms, which is limited by the availability of carbon in space environments, could be at least partially satisfied in a closed-loop system (Fig. 1). Microbial extraction of rare earth elements and vanadium from basalt54,55,58, and platinum group elements from L-chondrite meteoritic material has been demonstrated on the ISS55,56,59. However, further investigations are required to demonstrate the scalability of these systems, improve performance, and adapt the technology to other elements of interest (e.g., silicon, iron, aluminium). Water, oxygen, hydrogen as well as other critical molecules and elements could also be obtained via biomining50. These are essential compounds not only from the biotechnological perspective but indeed for any human activity. Knowledge of the ability to perform biomining under Lunar and Martian conditions is scarce or of theoretical character50,51 and efforts toward advancing bioleaching capability from extra-terrestrial regolith under space conditions, and toward the development of bioengineering and synthetic biology approaches, are critical to mature technologies. While prospecting is inherently not sustainable in the long run because of the inevitable depletion of resources (i.e., the ores, in the case of mining), biomining is generally considered more environmentally friendly than traditional mining because it avoids the use of toxic inorganic reagents. This also matters for extra-terrestrial applications, as it could reduce the need of auxiliary resources. It has been proposed that a biomining reactor could be added to a bioregenerative LSS50, hence contributing to loop-closure and ISRU (Fig. 1).Structural biomanufacturing: bioconcrete, myco-architecture Construction and maintenance of infrastructure beyond Earth is a necessary yet daunting task considering the scarce resource availability. Conventional methods of construction utilise large amounts of raw materials and require steady maintenance. To make construction and infrastructure maintenance more sustainable, prioritizing repair over a replacement will be essential and can be facilitated by biological self-healing materials. Concrete and cement are essential on Earth for construction and binding materials. While likely not being used to the same extent in space due to mass constraints, surface structures may to some degree require the binding of minerals for construction. Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP), for example, is a biogeochemical process whereby microorganisms precipitate calcium carbonate (CaCO3)60, which can be used as a binding agent61. Additionally, MICP can also help in the bioremediation of toxic compounds and CO2 sequestration62,63. Microbial-electrolytic carbon capture could be utilised to sequester CO2, and it has been estimated that in the United States, 68 million tons of CO2 per year could be captured by this process64. Impact events pulverise regolith on planetary surfaces over time, forming extremely fine dust that can hinder equipment function and cause harm to humans65. Bacteria with MICP capability could be used to bind and harden regolith, consolidating the dust66. Similarly, cyanobacterial biofilms may be useful to control and bind fine regolith67. Byproducts of urea degradation-based MICP, such as ammonium and nitrate, could be further upcycled into a closed-loop system (Fig. 1). However, when the release of toxic byproducts must be avoided68, alternative microorganisms for calcium carbonate precipitation can be used (e.g., the methane-oxidizing bacterium Methylocystis parvus)69. Fungi-based biotechnologies may provide another opportunity to produce sturdy and resistant structures for space applications. Myco-architecture refers to the production of rigid structural components and surfaces using fungi. Fungal mycelia can form dense networks that combine with other materials, like e.g. regolith, to form mycelium-based composites. These are commonly used in various industries on Earth70. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has explored this solution for space exploration, by utilizing mycelia as a means to construct rugged furniture and habitat shells for the Martian and Lunar surfaces71. While research for space applications is in its infancy, the extraordinary resilience of fungi has even been a subject of investigation for radioprotection72. This potentially provides for in situ manufacturing of robust and self-regenerating structures, and engineered living materials, thus avoiding the need for excessive re-supply, and improving the sustainability of space exploration by mitigating the supply chain from Earth.Biological collection and storage of energy Energy collection and storage (e.g., of fuels) is a critical challenge in any remote environment and is particularly dependent on supply chain consistency. Certain anaerobic bacteria (so-called ‘electricigens’, e.g., Desulfuromonas, Geobacter, etc.) can reduce organic waste to generate electric current. Specifically, microbial fuel cells (MFC) utilise microbes to convert chemically bound energy into electricity73. Harnessing the reducing power of organic waste to generate electricity, MFC could be coupled with in situ flow-through waste remediation systems44. Such microbial systems can be categorised into dark-fermentation and photobiological processes, and they can use wet biomass from, for example, waste streams74,75. In a similar fashion, and quasi-opposed to MFC, microbial electrosynthesis (MES) can be used to convert electricity (back) into chemical compounds for e.g., energy storage, to bridge intermittent availability and demand76. Some evidence also indicates the possibility of generating hydrogen through nanoparticle production from Lunar regolith77,78. Hydrogen, methane, and other biofuels can also be produced from other in situ resources, such as water and inorganic carbon, photo- or lithoautotrophically (e.g., with cyanobacteria and various algae species), to generate stable energy carriers6,78. These could be liquid compounds with high energy density, such as butanediol, as means for storage of energy, to supplement or complement chemically derived bipropellants (hydrogen/methane and oxygen)76,78. In many cases, using electricigens, hydrogenic, methanogenic, and biofuel-producing microorganisms, waste products and in situ resources can be upcycled for conversion, collection and storage of energy with a higher yield and lower energy input than traditional mechano-chemical approaches.Recycling of electronics, plastics and other waste streams Currently, most efforts of developing highly efficient systems for loop-closure focus on recycling and upcycling of biological waste (e.g., food, black/grey/yellow water)79, while solutions for synthetic waste (e.g., electronic waste, plastics, consumables) are largely unexplored, and its current management is unviable in long-term missions26. Valuable metals (Fe, Cu, rare earth elements, Al, Si, Zn), including precious metals (Au, Pt and platinum group elements), as well as certain non-metals (Cl, P, N and even O) can be recovered from metallic structures and electronic devices with biology80. Reclaiming metals from electronic waste (e.g., computer components, switchboards, solar panels) could reduce the need for resupply and/or the more effortful sourcing from in situ resources through e.g., biomining (see section 'Biomining')50,54. Physicochemical processes are available; however, bioleaching technologies are considered more environmentally friendly and sustainable, in terms of costs and energy requirements81. The biochemical reactions implicated in these processes are analogous to those involved in biomining (see the section 'Biomining'), hence similar microorganisms and biotechnologies could be used to recycle electronic waste82. Plastics have become indispensable in our everyday life on Earth being used, for instance, in the construction, packaging and manufacturing industries. Beyond the common Earth-analogue applications, plastics, particularly those with high strength and durability, play a key role in supporting human activities in space, as components of spacecraft and spacesuits16. Most plastics are composed of organic polymers derived from non-renewable fossil fuels83. In an environment such as space, where fossil fuels are not available, recycling and upcycling of plastics will be important to (i) obtain feedstock for manufacturing to produce new consumables, (ii) re-use and recycle resources and thus close the loop on carbon-based feedstocks, and (iii) reduce waste disposal. Microorganisms have been shown to break down microplastics into metabolisable compounds that can support growth. The process, called biodegradation, offers exciting paths towards a circular bioeconomy83, and researchers at the UK Centre for Astrobiology (University of Edinburgh, UK) are exploring if these microbial processes could also be leveraged for waste recycling in space. Modern synthetic biology approaches could be used to programme microbial pathways/functions tailored to extra-terrestrial environments43,48, and use plastics as feedstock for upcycling and produce useful molecules84,85. Complementary to the microbial plastic biodegradation stands microbial production of plastics (e.g., bioplastics). Certain microorganisms can use a variety of feedstock, including CO2, CH4, or waste biomass, to produce bioplastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates4. These processes will enhance sustainability by means of loop-closure, also because bioplastics are more readily biodegradable than fossil-fuel-based polymers. While not direct functions of life-support (as is the production of e.g., food, oxygen, water), all the foregone microbial processes can support LSS and vice versa, making long-duration spaceflight more sustainable. For instance, metals deriving from electronic waste could feed LSS compartments containing plants or microorganisms, which in turn can enhance processes directly linked to LSS (Fig. 1)50.Soil remediation Heavy metals and toxic compounds, such as perchlorates, could be removed from the Lunar and Martian regolith, allowing it to be used in soil formation for food production86. To this aim, the removal of toxic compounds is necessary due to the potential risk that their accumulation in plant tissues poses for the crew87. As described above (see the section 'Biomining'), microorganisms can bind and mobilise specific elements from Lunar and Martian regolith53,88. This, together with the removal of toxic elements and compounds (bioremediation), can improve the quality of regolith as a plant-growth substrate89, drastically reducing the required resources for the continued operation of plant-based LSS. Ultimately, this circular approach combines key elements of the processes described so far while enabling the production of the food needed to sustain humans off-Earth and minimizing the resources that need to be transported from Earth. Bioremediation may be supported with proteobacteria, e.g., Sphingomonas, as well as fungi, such as Penicillium spp.90,91. Genetic engineering of these organisms or other species could enable the removal of perchlorates (e.g., conversion of perchlorates into molecular chloride and oxygen87), as well as heavy metals, radioactive species accumulation and conversion92, acids, salts, and organic pollutants from extra-terrestrial regolith. As microorganisms catalyse very specific reactions, their use can result in highly efficient use of resources, while leaving non-toxic compounds unaltered. In addition, the energy requirements for bioremediation are generally lower than physicochemical alternatives such as heat-treatment to decompose perchlorates. The last point might be offset by required nutrients, which are not guaranteed to be available in situ. However, these could be derived from the other biological LSS compartments, including those described above. Current knowledge on the applicability of these processes in space is limited, therefore a better understanding of the mechanisms of bioremediation, microbial behaviour in the space environment and its potential for soil formation is desirable.Technology needs and future research A common technological denominator across most of the applications discussed thus far is the need to provide a controlled environment for the microbes and the functions they support or enable. Microbial processes depend on temperature, pressure, oxygen availability (or absence), pH, gravitational and radiation conditions, and other factors93,94. These aspects drive (i) the technological need for bioreactors tailored to providing the appropriate environment for specific processes, and (ii) the research needed to understand the effects of the space environment on these processes, to identify the conditions that maximise yield while minimising resources, engineering, and operational requirements. From a technological perspective, the importance of developing space-ready bioreactors is paramount. These will likely need to be specialised for the application they support, although commonalities among them are expected, which include: (i) providing and maintaining a controlled environment (temperature, pressure, liquid/gas composition), (ii) the ability for data collection in terms of the viability of the engineered system and the microbes therein, as well as its performance (including the chemical and physical status of the bulk medium and gas as applicable), (iii) the presence of interfaces to provide precursors, receive products, and attach downstream processing equipment, (iv) the ability for on-demand sample collection, (v) the ability to operate autonomously, at least partially; and (vi) the appropriate level of containment to adhere to planetary protection guidelines, which is particularly relevant for future Martian settlements (notably, closed-loop systems have been identified as a potential solution from this perspective)95. There will be differences depending on the application, for example, the surface area to volume ratio (SAVR), e.g., microbiologically supported direct air-capture of CO2 with photoautotrophs requires high SAVR to maximise the molar ratio of CO2 to microbes and cellular exposure to light96. In contrast, some pharmaceutical synthesis processes may be performed anaerobically and hence may not depend on SAVR39. Another aspect that may vary in culture volume: applications requiring high-SAVR will likely generate design drivers with serpentine-like culturing volumes, particularly for phototrophic organisms (similar to high-performance heat-exchangers), while low-SAVR applications may be enabled with simpler cylindrical tanks. This, in turn, may drive the systems’ need for fluid flow and mixing94. There are multiple other aspects to consider that can also impact process efficacy, which is especially applicable in bioreactors without stirring. Namely, these refer to mass transport phenomena, both intra- and inter-phase (liquid–solid, gas–liquid, gas–solid), which are dependent upon concentration gradients, temperature, etc., and must be considered during bioreactor design. Two technological needs relevant across applications will be data acquisition and sample collection, which in several cases will require gas/liquid/solid separation. On the Lunar and Martian surfaces, this may occur naturally owing to the presence of (partial) gravity. Operations taking place in microgravity (e.g., space stations and Mars-transit vehicles), however, pose a more challenging engineering problem. Of particular interest from a biological perspective would be the development of automated and real-time monitoring systems (growth and production rate, titre and yield, pH, pO2, as well as inputs and outputs), to allow characterization of system performance. A requirement for any microbial-based biotechnology is liquid water97, one of the most critical commodities for any long-term space activity. On the ISS, water is currently obtained by the Water Recovery System, which is part of ECLSS18: urine, humidity condensate, and human waste are recycled to generate potable water, through multiple processes including distillation, filtration, high-temperature catalysis and chemical disinfection98. This may not be sufficient on long-duration missions and, ultimately, settlements. Therefore, water recovery must be improved by a more complete loop-closure (Fig. 1). Moreover, additional water could be obtained from different locations on the Moon and Mars, or from asteroids, by mechanic/physical processes and/or biomining (see the section 'Biomining')50. Additional technology needs include the compartmentalisation of applications requiring a certain level of containment and isolation from others. Some applications like MICP, soil-bioremediation and myco-architecture may require exclusively dedicated compartments to protect the rest of the surface base from otherwise unwanted microbial communities and the regolith, which can have detrimental effects on crew health and equipment, while others may be performed in the same habitat-section (Fig. 1). Space conditions, especially the high levels of radiation, showed to induce mutations, changing the genotype of microbial systems in a way that the phenotype was impacted93. These could affect the reliability and robustness of microbial processes in space. Hence, technologies should include radiation shielding where appropriate, strict and frequent control of phenotypes and genotypes, as well as redundancies (e.g., protected storage of the primary inoculum as backup). Each of the categories described in the section 'Habitat air bioremediation' requires research to increase their TRL to nine, as described in Fig. 2. This research will, in turn, need dedicated platforms to perform research, for instance, access to microgravity and partial gravities40,99, as well as space radiation. Research needs, in addition to what is described in the former section, include biofilm control strategies. Biofilm formation has been a problem in every space station from Salyut 6 to ISS and can cause operational disruption of ECLSS equipment. This has been addressed via resupply from Earth, which will not be possible for long-term missions beyond LEO100. Engineered systems hosting microbial cultures for desired applications will be naturally exposed to the risk of unwanted microbial biofilm formation (i.e., fouling). Fig. 2. Schematic representation of current technology readiness level (TRL) for the considered biotechnologies. Open in a new tab Arrows indicate the specific research and development needed to advance the TRL of each technology. TRL is defined as indicated by NASA.This discussion motivates the following set of open research questions: (i) how can microbial biotechnology enhance the sustainability of long-term deep-space exploration missions and settlements, waste-recycling, while preserving extra-terrestrial environments? (ii) How can these processes be conducted while adhering to planetary protection guidelines? (iii) What technologies are needed to monitor process efficiency? For each application: (iv) what microorganisms (including genetically modified) and cultivation conditions optimise the process in the relevant gravitational and radiation environment? (v) What are the bioreactor, operational, and infrastructure requirements applicable to implementing the process? (vi) How do we collect, extract, and refine aliquots and final products obtained from the processes?Benefits for Earth Space exploration has always been a catalyst and testbed for the development of new technologies with applications on Earth (e.g., spin-off technologies)101. Space science’s implications for solving terrestrial environmental issues are not new, either. In fact, space activities are recognised by the United Nations as “essential tools for realising the achievement of the SDGs”11,12. Further, space-based technologies are indispensable for monitoring weather and vegetation patterns (natural as well as anthropogenic), deforestation, water resources, plastic pollution, carbon emissions and climate change. More specifically, space biotechnologies listed in this work could provide powerful tools to support a number of specific SDGs, including ‘Zero Hunger’ (Goal 2), ‘Good Health and Well-Being’ (Goal 3), ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’ (Goal 6), ‘Affordable and Clean Energy’ (Goal 7), ‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’ (Goal 9), ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ (Goal 11), ‘Responsible Consumption and Production’ (Goal 12), and ‘Climate Action’ (Goal 13)11,12. In the future, terrestrial environmental issues may be addressed by using space biotechnologies deliberately designed to enhance sustainability: systems that allow tight loop-closure and near-ideal circular operation of resources on a small scale are exemplary for application at a global scale. This kind of tangible public benefit is key not only for justifying space exploration to funding agencies and governments but for motivating scientists to invest their time and energy in space exploration at a time when multiple overlapping crises threaten the stability of our civilization and its ecological support systems. Space agencies and organizations are aware of the significant potential of this concept. An increasing number of calls for proposals are being launched with the aim of developing strategies to tackle environmental problems on Earth by using space resources. In 2021, ESA (i.e., ‘ESA Circular Economy Kick-Start Competition’)102 and NASA (i.e., ‘Orbital Alchemy Challenge’)103 launched relevant competitions. In 2022, the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) announced the ‘Beyond Plastics’ sustainability challenge (i.e., ‘CASIS Beyond Plastics’)104, with the motto “What if the next great discovery to improve our planet came from research off the planet?”. Notably, two out of the three finalist projects, including the winner, involved the use of microorganisms. Many of the microbial-based space technologies and strategies presented here have the potential to be transferred and pose benefits to terrestrial applications. Soil remediation techniques developed for application on other terrestrial bodies could be used to help react to soil pollution on Earth, identifying or engineering organisms suitable for cleaning up and degrading specific contaminants, as well as desertification, using desiccation-resistant organisms. Similarly, technologies or plant/microbial genetic engineering could be used to allow for crops to grow in less space with limited resources and deliver comparable or higher yields. Increased bacterial virulence in space flight has the potential to help identifying new targets for combating drug resistance37. On-demand space manufacturing of pharmaceuticals could result in simpler (e.g., fewer steps) yet flexible drug production and purification than on Earth. This may transform the complex and hardly sustainable production processes currently in use, replacing them with biomanufacturing and reducing the cost of pharmaceuticals, thus enabling access to critical medication in remote locations with scarce resources. Carbon-capture and -sequestration technologies will have direct transfer potential for Earth application in the effort to counteract climate change. In the energy transition, hydrogen is considered a cornerstone for seasonal storage, industrial processes, and general grid balancing. Biologically production of hydrogen, utilised in the context of space technology, could advance the discovery of production pathways for green hydrogen on Earth75. Research in bio-concrete synthesis and myco-architecture will enhance the ways how microorganisms can be employed for the construction and maintenance of infrastructure. Like space, Earth also has various extreme conditions. Engineering microbes for infrastructure maintenance can solve problems in remote and austere locations. Improved and highly efficient waste recycling, including but not limited to organic/biological, plastic/consumable, and electronic waste, for space applications could be translated back for Earth applications to tackle terrestrial waste management issues, landfill overflow and environmental pollution.Conclusions With this work, we aimed to advocate the urgency of sustainable approaches for human space exploration, and the essential role microbial biotechnologies could play in this. It has been discussed how microbial biotechnologies may support several processes that, in turn, can help decrease supply chain dependency (from Earth) on long-duration deep-space exploration missions to eventually enable human footholds and settlements across the solar system. In parallel, several of these microbially-supported processes may also help close the loop on LSS and other systems, which can preserve resources and extra-terrestrial environments. These two aspects, independently and together, enable space exploration in a sustainable fashion. To provide appropriate conditions for the maturation of named biotechnologies and to open the field to a wider community, research and innovation are needed. Preliminary studies should be supported in laboratories on Earth, simulation platforms, and in LEO, and full investigations in cis-Lunar space and on the Lunar surface. Augmenting existing space-based facilities to increase the capacity for space experiments, in terms of sample replicates and experimental conditions, should also be considered to improve the impact of the preliminary studies. Funding should take into account the high cost (and time) of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, on which these technologies will likely heavily rely. Finally, the potential of these technologies for terrestrial benefits has been discussed, with specific reference to the United Nation SDGs. If ultra-efficient approaches to sustaining human life and economic activity off-Earth can be adapted towards meaningfully solving problems on our planet, space exploration will have yielded a manifold return on public investments and will thereby become more sustainable not only technologically, but also politically. The debate about the public benefits of space travel and exploration is healthy and necessary, but in the field of sustainability, space advocates may now have an opportunity to win this debate for a generation.Acknowledgements Publication fees were covered by the United Kingdom Science and Technology Facilities Council under grant ST/V000586/1.

    "abstract": "Significance Investigations of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans give powerful insights into fundamental biological processes that are conserved across species. Locomotion of this model organism is used to assess muscular and neural defects and score impacts of genetic mutations and pharmacological interventions. Existing analyses of the nematode gait have been focused on 2D locomotion, and 3D motion remains largely unexplored. We identify and mathematically describe a unique 3D behavioral pattern in burrowing and swimming—a roll maneuver—which, in combination with 2D turns, allows the nematode to explore bulk media. Our results provide important insights into 3D neuromuscular actuation and may be used to develop better assays for locomotion phenotype analysis. Keywords: Caenorhabdtis elegans, undulatory locomotion, 3D gait, maneuverability, behavior",

    "methods": "Materials and Methods Imaging of Swimming Nematodes Performing Rolls and Turns in Water. Wild-type C. elegans were used to record the 3D swimming. Worms were cultured in a nematode growth medium plate seeded with the bacteria Escherichia coli OP50 at 20 °C. A liquid pool was created for the swimming assay by adding 5–7 mL of M9 buffer into a 60-mm Petri dish. The pool height was ∼2 mm. The surface of the Petri dish was treated with 5% Pluoronic F127 for 5 min before adding M9 buffer. Individual young adults were manually transferred into a liquid pool of M9 buffer, using a worm pick. Swimming episodes were recorded at 30 frames per second using an SVSI camera and Zeiss Stemi 2000-C stereo microscope imaging system at 1.6× magnification with a pixel resolution of 0.21 pixels/μm. All imaging was carried out in a food-free environment at 20 °C. Assessing Buoyancy Effects in 3D Swimming. A mixed culture of worms (L1–L3 larvae and adults) was used to observe the voluntary 3D movement of sedimenting nematodes in water and in 10% dextran solution (Dextran 2000 from Leuconostoc spp.) of viscosity 50.2 cP at 20 °C. Settling of a mixed worm population was observed in a BrandTech Macro Cuvette. Worms were washed from a plate and concentrated in 200 μL of M9 solution. In each experiment, 50 μL of the worm solution (∼50–100 worms) was added at the top surface of the fluid in the cuvette and allowed to settle under the influence of gravity. Worms were recorded for the entire settling path (4.5 cm). We observed that in water the sedimentation velocity of adult worms was comparable to the active swimming velocity, and the nematodes settled toward the bottom of the cuvette. In contrast, many larvae did not settle and remained in the top layer of fluid even after 10 min. In the dextran solution the settling velocity was negligible for both adults and larvae. Nematodes changed the undulation plane using roll maneuvers every 2 to 3 undulations. The rate of planar turns was much slower (∼10 undulations per turn, consistent with results from ref. 34). No evidence of gravity-induced passive reorientations was found in either experiment; therefore we conclude that the effect of buoyancy forces on reorientation maneuvers is negligible. Description of Planar Nematode Postures. Based on our prior quantitative analysis of nematode shapes (28), in our turn and roll-rotation angle calculations we use qL=9 for the W-shaped basic crawling/burrowing gait and qL=5.5 for the C-shaped swimming gait. These values are within the range of wavelength variability reported in ref. 25. Since in crawling and burrowing without transverse slip the resistance forces are of the same magnitude, we assume that the 3D burrowing and crawling gaits have similar parameter values, consistent with the available experimental images of burrowing C. elegans (33). Modeling of Nematode Hydrodynamics. In our numerical simulations of swimming nematodes we use a 3D generalization of the bead-based model introduced in ref. 29. Accordingly, a swimming nematode is represented as an active chain of N hydrodynamically coupled spherical beads arranged along the nematode centerline. As the configuration of a chain submerged in a viscous fluid evolves, the beads i=1,…,N move with the linear and angular velocities 𝒖i=𝒖ia+𝒖irb, [7] 𝝎i=𝝎ia+𝝎rb, [8] which are decomposed into the active and passive components. The active linear velocity 𝒖ia corresponds to the sliding motion of the bead along the curve defined by the curvature and torsion waves, Eq. 2, 𝒖ia=vs𝒕^i, [9] where 𝒕^i is the unit tangent vector at the position of bead i, and vs is the velocity of the curvature wave propagating along the nematode body. The active angular bead velocity 𝝎ia=κ(si)𝒃^i+τ(si)𝒕^i [10] depends on the curvature κ, torsion τ, and the binormal unit vector 𝒃^i at the bead position si. The angular velocity Eq. 10 mimics the rotational motion of individual segments of the deforming nematode body. As explained in our previous paper (29), neglecting the active rotational contribution results in an overprediction of nematode swimming speed, especially for large qL. The passive linear and angular velocities of individual beads, 𝒖irb=𝒖rb+𝝎rb×𝑹i, [11] 𝝎irb=𝝎rb, [12] are associated with the rigid-body translation and rotation of the entire chain. The hydrodynamic torque, chain velocity 𝒖rb, and bead positions 𝑹i are evaluated relative to a prescribed center of rotation of the chain. The linear and angular chain velocities 𝒖rb and 𝝎rb are determined from the hydrodynamic force and torque balance, [𝑭a𝑻a]+[𝜻^tt𝜻^tr𝜻^rt𝜻^rr]⋅[𝒖rb𝝎rb]=0, [13] where 𝑭a and 𝑻a are the active torque and force required to produce the prescribed chain motion, Eqs. 9 and 10, and 𝜻^αβ (α,β=t,r) are translational (t) and rotational (r) hydrodynamic resistance tensors of the chain at a current configuration. Expressions for the active force 𝑭a, active torque 𝑻a, and the hydrodynamic resistance tensors 𝜻^αβ in terms of the hydrodynamic resistance and mobility tensors of a system of hydrodynamically coupled beads are given in ref. 29. The calculations presented in our paper were performed using a generalized Rotne–Prager–Yamakawa (RPY) approximation (56) for multiparticle hydrodynamic interactions. A limited set of calculations was also performed using a more accurate but computationally more expensive Hydromultipole algorithm (57); for our current problem, the RPY approximation produces fairly accurate results. The nematode body was modeled using a chain of N=30 beads. We note that in an independent study Berman et al. (42) also used a hydrodynamic bead-based model to investigate undulatory swimming of a nematode. Evaluation of the Roll Rotation Rate. The single-mode roll rotation rate per period of undulations, ωroll, was determined from the angle between the binormal vectors at s=0 and s=2π/q.",

    "discussion": "Discussion Torsional Roll Is a Unique Behavioral State That Is Essential for 3D Locomotion. Based on our investigation of available stereoscopic images and other experimental evidence, we have shown that C. elegans explore their 3D environment by combining planar turns with roll reorientation maneuvers. The rolls, during which the undulation plane of the worm rotates about the trajectory axis, constitute an important previously unrecognized behavioral pattern that is an essential component of 3D locomotion. To identify the roll maneuvers and describe their geometry, we have developed a mathematical representation of the 3D nematode gait. According to our analysis, the roll maneuvers combine harmonic curvature with a piecewise constant torsion that causes the undulation-plane reorientation. Our 3D model of roll maneuvers faithfully reproduces all key geometrical features of the observed roll behavior of a burrowing nematode and, when integrated with appropriate hydrodynamic calculations, replicates a rapid roll rotation observed in swimming. We have provided a physical explanation of this unexpected hydrodynamic enhancement effect in the 3D roll maneuver. Our modeling approach provides a powerful tool for investigating 3D locomotion of C. elegans, including initiation and execution of behavioral patterns associated with 3D reorientation. For example, our techniques can be applied to analyze chemotaxis strategies and escape responses, as well as to evaluate the effect of nematode health and age on locomotory abilities. In Application to Chemotaxis we describe a proof-of-concept calculation showing that the nematode can use a combination of turn and roll reorientation maneuvers to efficiently chemotax in 3D environments. To illustrate typical maneuvers in 3D space, we present two examples of numerical simulations of a nematode performing multiple turns and rolls (Movie S4 for burrowing and Movie S5 for swimming). Our analysis reveals that both the burrowing and swimming rolls involve a similar pattern of nematode movements defined by a curvature wave with nonzero torsion. Several recent experimental studies showed that the nematode gait is not significantly affected by the rheological properties of the suspending medium (48–51), for the system parameters investigated. Such results were documented for viscoelastic fluids (48), shear-thinning fluids (50), and entangled polymeric solutions (49). For nematodes swimming in a shear-thinning suspension (51), a moderate increase in the head-bending angle was observed, but even in this case, the overall form of undulations remained similar to the waveform observed in Newtonian fluids. Based on the above wide spectrum of systems in which rheological properties of the suspending medium do not affect the locomotory undulation pattern, we conclude that the same simple undulation waveform likely occurs for C. elegans moving in a variety of complex media present in its natural environment. Moreover, since roll maneuvers provide effective 3D reorientation and do not require complicated patterns of body actuation, we anticipate that similar rolls are performed by other undulatory burrowers and swimmers. Torsional Roll Maneuvers Help Sedimented Adult Nematodes Maintain Swimming Capabilities. Trajectories of swimming C. elegans are affected not only by active actuation but also by buoyancy forces. During the larval stages of development and for nematodes swimming in highly viscous aqueous solutions of organic matter (common in C. elegans habitat) the effect of buoyancy is negligible. Adult nematodes swimming in water, however, tend to settle down toward the bottom of the pool and reside close to the bottom surface, following its topology (52). As shown by Yuan et al. (52), the worms remain suspended due to the upward force that results from continuous head collisions with the bottom wall when the nematode body undulates in an approximately vertical plane. In our experiments, we find that during this near-the-bottom locomotion, nematodes perform frequent rolls (one roll of about 90° per several undulation periods), with the frequency similar to the roll frequency in a bulk fluid. The rolls allow the worms to repeatedly attain approximately vertical orientation of the undulation plane (Movie S6). Such a vertical orientation is necessary for the sedimenting worms to be able to generate the upward resuspending force through collisions with the bottom. We thus conclude that the roll maneuvers are used by C. elegans not only to change the direction of motion in 3D, but also to remain suspended near the bottom surface and, therefore, to maintain the swimming behavior in the presence of significant buoyancy forces. Muscular System of C. elegans Is Compatible with 3D Body Actuation, but Neural Control Mechanism Is Unknown. As an important application of this study, our results may shed light on subtle aspects of neuromuscular control of 3D locomotion of C. elegans. Body movements of C. elegans are actuated by a coordinated action of four quadrants of body muscles, which are arranged into double rows that span the entire nematode length (53). While this muscle anatomy is compatible with 3D body actuation, it is less clear how the neural system can activate differential muscle contractions needed to generate 3D body deformations out of the dorsoventral undulation plane. According to a detailed map of neural connections in C. elegans (53–55), the head and neck body muscles are innervated by the nerve ring motor neurons, which synapse onto cells in individual quadrants (and thus are capable to actuate each quadrant individually). In contrast, the remaining body muscles are innervated only by the ventral-cord motor neurons, which synapse onto muscles of either two ventral or two dorsal quadrants, consistent with 2D actuation. Based on this topology of neural connections, it is generally assumed that only the head and neck segments can perform 3D motion. However, the stereoscopic experiments by Kwon et al. (33) clearly show that burrowing nematodes can adopt a variety of 3D postures. The images clearly show that the entire body undergoes out-of-plane deformations. In the swimming case the evidence is less conclusive because stereoscopic images are not yet available. Nonetheless, 2D images of swimming nematodes (such as the one shown in Fig. 8A) agree with our 3D body posture model. Our hydrodynamic calculations of the roll dynamics further support a conclusion that the entire nematode body participates in generating the roll motion. We find that the torsional wave propagating throughout the entire body length can produce a 90° roll in less than one undulation period, consistent with rolls observed in our laboratory experiments using wild-type C. elegans. In contrast, a stroke in which only the head and neck segments are displaced out of the undulation plane produces significantly weaker rolls. The results of these additional simulations are presented in Analysis of a Roll Resulting from Out-of-Plane Displacements of the Nematode Head. We hypothesize that the generation of a nonzero torsion in the posterior part of the nematode body involves a 3D proprioceptive feedback, which enables propagation of the torsional wave from the head segment in the posterior direction. The existence of 2D proprioceptive feedback in C. elegans and its important role in generation of a planar undulation wave have been demonstrated by Wen et al. (4). Based on this result and building on their observation that individual neurons of C. elegans may have a high degree of functional complexity, we conjecture that 3D proprioception may give rise to asymmetric neural signals and differential muscular contractions that are needed to achieve well-controlled out-of-plane body movements during the torsional roll. We note that current evidence is not sufficient to rule out a passive, purely mechanical origin of propagation of 3D deformations along the portion of the nematode body outside the head and neck regions. In particular, the body shapes observed during burrowing (33) can, in principle, be generated by 3D actuation of the head and neck muscles, with the rest of the body passively sliding along the tunnel carved by the nematode head. Such motion, however, would be inefficient, especially in media with low-yield stress, in which transverse forces needed to passively deform the nematode body would result in undesirable transverse slip. Since C. elegans has a four-quadrant muscle arrangement that is anatomically capable of generating 3D body deformations, we expect that there is a compatible neuromuscular-control system that allows the nematode to fully use this (existing) muscle structure. Further analyses of 3D locomotion of C. elegans will help determine whether such a control system exists and how it may actuate the nematode body.",

Significance Investigations of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans give powerful insights into fundamental biological processes that are conserved across species. Locomotion of this model organism is used to assess muscular and neural defects and score impacts of genetic mutations and pharmacological interventions. Existing analyses of the nematode gait have been focused on 2D locomotion, and 3D motion remains largely unexplored. We identify and mathematically describe a unique 3D behavioral pattern in burrowing and swimming—a roll maneuver—which, in combination with 2D turns, allows the nematode to explore bulk media. Our results provide important insights into 3D neuromuscular actuation and may be used to develop better assays for locomotion phenotype analysis. Keywords: Caenorhabdtis elegans, undulatory locomotion, 3D gait, maneuverability, behaviorAbstract Locomotion of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a key observable used in investigations ranging from behavior to neuroscience to aging. However, while the natural environment of this model organism is 3D, quantitative investigations of its locomotion have been mostly limited to 2D motion. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of how the nematode reorients itself in 3D media. We identify a unique behavioral state of C. elegans—a roll maneuver—which is an essential component of 3D locomotion in burrowing and swimming. The rolls, associated with nonzero torsion of the nematode body, result in rotation of the plane of dorsoventral body undulations about the symmetry axis of the trajectory. When combined with planar turns in a new undulation plane, the rolls allow the nematode to reorient its body in any direction, thus enabling complete exploration of 3D space. The rolls observed in swimming are much faster than the ones in burrowing; we show that this difference stems from a purely hydrodynamic enhancement mechanism and not from a gait change or an increase in the body torsion. This result demonstrates that hydrodynamic viscous forces can enhance 3D reorientation in undulatory locomotion, in contrast to known hydrodynamic hindrance of both forward motion and planar turns. Investigations of locomotion of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can provide a wealth of knowledge on physiology, muscle biology, and neural control of movement and behavior. Locomotion depends on muscular strength (1–3), neuromuscular coordination (4, 5), and processing of information from sensory inputs (6, 7). Locomotory readouts are thus extensively used to quantify effects of genetic mutations (8–10), exercise, nutrition, and environmental factors (11–17) and to evaluate pharmacological impacts (18, 19). In its natural environment (soil rich in decaying organic matter), C. elegans interacts with a complex 3D surrounding medium that includes soft organic materials and rainwater (20, 21). Most studies of nematode locomotion, however, have focused on 2D motion (22–32), and little effort has been made to characterize worm motility in 3D environments. Only recently was 3D burrowing motion of C. elegans in soft substrates stereoscopically imaged (33) and a statistical analysis of basic locomotory parameters reported (34); it was also shown that a burrowing nematode can reorient itself in response to external stimuli (34, 35). Furthermore, feasibility of using 3D motion to assess genetic mutations (36) and to identify muscular dystrophy (34) was experimentally demonstrated. Such 3D methods of scoring C. elegans locomotory behavior can achieve better sensitivity than screens based on 2D observations alone. However, unleashing the full potential of these promising techniques requires complementary efforts to identify specific behavioral patterns associated with 3D reorientation maneuvers. A thorough quantitative understanding of 3D gait geometry and mechanics is also important for gaining insights into mechanisms of neuromuscular actuation of body movements and for development of next-generation software packages for automated tracking and analysis of nematode behavior. Active Spatial Reorientation Maneuvers of C. elegans: Planar Turns and 3D Rolls In our investigation of 3D locomotion of C. elegans in bulk media we focus on active body reorientation, in contrast to recently studied passive changes of locomotion direction produced by interactions of the nematode body with obstacles (37), boundaries (30), and/or external flow (31). Active reorientation maneuvers (29) have received, so far, much less attention, despite their importance for search behavior, chemotaxis, thermotaxis, and escape response. As illustrated in Fig. 1 for a swimming nematode (also corresponding Movies S1 and S2), C. elegans can reorient its body by combining 2D turns in the plane of dorsoventral undulations with 3D roll maneuvers that result in axial rotation of the undulation plane. Turns in 2D are executed by asymmetrically altering the amplitude of planar body undulations (28, 29, 34, 38), whereas rolls require nonplanar body postures. Our geometricalanalysis (presented in Torsional Roll Is a Unique 3D Behavioral State) of available stereoscopic nematode images (33) demonstrates that turns and rolls can also be observed for nematodes burrowing in soft gel-like media. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Typical reorientation maneuvers of swimming C. elegans. Shown are time-lapse images of a swimming C. elegans (A) performing a 2D turn and (B) rapidly switching the plane of undulations in a 3D roll maneuver. The nematode moves from right to left in both A and B. The arrows in B indicate the location of the ovary, helping to identify the nematode body orientation. (Magnification: 1.6×.)A combination of planar turns and 3D rolls allows C. elegans to reorient itself in any direction (schematically depicted in Fig. 2), whereas 2D turning maneuvers alone [e.g., Ω turns (6), loop/δ turns (28, 33, 39), and pirouettes (40)] restrict nematode movements to one plane. Thus, the roll maneuvers identified in this work constitute an important behavioral state; this crucial locomotion component enables C. elegans to explore 3D media in search for optimal environmental conditions. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Schematic illustrating nematode reorientation in 3D. The worm (A) undulates in the initial plane of motion, (B) executes a roll maneuver, and (C) performs a planar turn in the new plane of motion.Movie S1 and video images shown in Fig. 1A [and our prior study (29)] reveal that planar turns in swimming are shallower than no-slip turns in crawling or burrowing (analogous to the reduced forward progression in swimming). In contrast, swimming rolls (Movie S2 and Fig. 1B) can be significantly more rapid than those found for burrowing. The effectiveness of turn and roll maneuvers in burrowing and swimming is assessed by solving equations of motion for the nematode body moving in gels and fluids. Our calculations show that the same hydrodynamic resistance forces that reduce the swimming velocity (29, 41, 42) and planar turn angles (29) significantly enhance the roll rotation rate. This counterintuitive result of our theoretical analysis agrees well with experimental observations. The geometry of 3D nematode motion is significantly more involved than planar geometry. Therefore, to faithfully identify and interpret specific locomotory behavioral patterns of C. elegans and understand hydrodynamic mechanisms of enhancement of the roll maneuvers, we need adequate tools for describing body postures. To explain the geometry of nematode movements in 3D, we thus generalize the recently proposed piecewise harmonic curvature (PHC) model of planar nematode gait (28, 29) by introducing the curve torsion to the gait description.Geometrical Description of 3D Nematode Gait Three-Dimensional Nematode Gait Can Be Described Using Curvature and Torsion of the Nematode Body. Since the body of C. elegans is highly elongated, its postures can be faithfully represented by the body centerline (22, 28, 38, 42–44). In 3D the centerline configuration at time t is described by the local worm curvature κw(s′,t) and torsion τw(s′,t), where s′ is the arc-length coordinate along the body (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Description of body postures and trails of C. elegans in 3D. (A) Definition of the trail coordinate s and the worm coordinate s′. (B) Rotation of the Serret–Frenet basis (𝒕^,𝒏^,𝒃^) as it moves along the curve. The curvature κ is associated with rotation around the binormal unit vector 𝒃^; deformations resulting from nonzero curvature thus occur in the 𝒕^–𝒏^ plane. Torsion τ is associated with rotation around the tangent unit vector 𝒕^; a nonzero torsion results in out-of-plane curve deformation, because the local deformation plane (𝒕^,𝒏^) changes its orientation.The body configuration can be reconstructed from the curvature and torsion functions, κw and τw, by solving the Serret–Frenet equations (45) d𝒕^ds′=κw𝒏^, [1a] d𝒏^ds′=−κw𝒕^+τw𝒃^, [1b] d𝒃^ds′=−τw𝒏^ [1c] with the boundary condition corresponding to a given position and orientation of the nematode tail or head. Here 𝒏^, 𝒕^, and 𝒃^=𝒕^×𝒏^ are the normal, tangent, and binormal unit vectors at a local position s′ along the nematode body. The curvature and torsion correspond to rotation of the Serret–Frenet basis (𝒕^,𝒏^,𝒃^) about the binormal and tangent directions; the geometrical interpretation of these parameters is illustrated in Fig. 3B. In what follows we analyze the curvature and torsion of the nematode body to identify behavioral patterns of C. elegans moving in 3D.Curvature and Torsion Waveform Is Similar in Motion With and Without Transverse Slip. Due to large transverse mechanical resistance provided by the environment, burrowing or crawling C. elegans often move with no transverse slip of body segments. Therefore, all segments follow a single curvilinear trail. The trail geometry can be described using the trail curvature and torsion, κ(s) and τ(s), where s is the arc-length coordinate measured from the beginning of the trail. Since at any given time t the configuration of the nematode body coincides with a trail segment (Fig. 3A), the worm curvature and torsion and trail curvature and torsion are directly related, κ(s)=κw(s′,t), [2a] τ(s)=τw(s′,t), [2b] where s=s′+vst, and vs is the worm velocity along the trail. Accordingly, the curvature and torsion waves propagate along the nematode body without changing their waveform. In fluid media where transverse slip does occur, and the nematode body segments do not follow the same path because of their transverse displacements, the worm curvature and torsion functions κw(s′,t) and τw(s′,t) are not geometrically constrained to obey the propagating-wave relations, Eq. 2. Nonetheless, our earlier analysis of the 2D gait of C. elegans swimming in water indicates that even in a fluid environment the curvature-wave relation, Eq. 2a, is preserved with good accuracy (28), despite a significant transverse motion. Since this behavior is a signature of the proprioceptive coupling (4) that allows the nematode to maintain properly formed propulsive body undulations in media with different mechanical properties, we assume that the curvature and torsion propagating-wave relations, Eq. 2, are satisfied both in no-slip burrowing and in 3D swimming. Moreover, as discussed below, the waveform κ(s) and τ(s) of body undulations is essentially the same in different media (although the wavelength of the undulations varies).Key Elements of 2D Locomotion Since identification of 3D behavioral patterns of C. elegans relies on prior understanding of planar locomotion, we summarize here the relevant key results of our previous studies of the geometry of 2D motion (28, 29, 46). Harmonic Curvature Undulations Describe a Variety of Elementary Body Postures. In 2D environments, C. elegans generally restrict their locomotion patterns to dorsoventral planar undulations. A quantitative analysis presented in our previous work (28) shows that a variety of planar nematode body postures can be accurately described by the harmonic curvature function κ(s)=Acos(qs+ϕ), [3] where A is the wave amplitude, q=2π/λ is the wavevector, and ϕ is the phase angle. Fig. 4 shows some typical crawling and swimming 2D postures that can be represented by the harmonic curvature. Typical crawling and swimming body configurations associated with forward motion are characterized by moderate values of the dimensionless amplitude A/q≈1 (Fig. 4 A, i and iii and B, i and iii); higher amplitudes correspond to commonly observed Ω shapes (Fig. 4 A, ii and iv and B, ii and iv) and loops (Fig. 4 A, v and B, v). The distinction between swimming and crawling postures stems primarily from a difference in normalized wavelength λ/L; swimming C-shaped postures generally exhibit larger λ/L compared with crawling (25) and burrowing (34) W-shaped postures.

(B) Family of approximately matching curves reproduced from harmonic curvature, Eq. 3, for normalized amplitude A/q as labeled. The green and blue arrows are the unit tangent and normal vectors, respectively. The body of a nematode moving along the curves is represented by thick line segments of normalized length qL.Two-Dimensional Turns Are Associated with Harmonic Mode Transitions. A moving C. elegans does not maintain a single harmonic-curvature mode; instead, it stochastically varies mode parameters, which results in changes of the moving direction. A quantitative analysis of crawling trajectories (28) indicates that entire trails of crawling C. elegans can be accurately represented by the harmonic function, Eq. 3, with discontinuously varying wave parameters A, q, and ϕ between harmonic-curvature intervals. In this PHC representation sharp turns associated with strongly curved Ω or loop body postures correspond to harmonic-curvature intervals characterized by a large normalized curvature amplitude A/q.Three-Dimensional Torsional Roll Maneuvers in No-Slip Burrowing C. elegans burrowing through a soft gel-like substrate (such as agar) often move without transverse slip of the body with respect to the surrounding medium, because the finite yield stress of the gel prevents transverse displacements. In this section we consider no-slip 3D locomotion along a curvilinear path carved in the gel. Recently Beron et al. (34) and Vidal-Gadea et al. (35) investigated nonplanar motion of C. elegans in a gel showing that the nematode can actively reorient itself in 3D in response to external stimuli. While they measured the frequency of out-of-plane changes of direction, their studies have not supplied sufficient data for unambiguous identification of stereotyped behavioral patterns associated with 3D reorientation maneuvers. Quantitative data on 3D nematode shapes and motion have been provided by Kwon et al. (33), who presented stereoscopic images of 3D burrowing C. elegans. Our thorough analysis of these images allows us to identify a specific behavioral pattern—the roll maneuver—that the nematode uses in 3D locomotion. One-Mode Roll Maneuver: Nonzero Torsion Results in Rotation of the Undulation Plane. Before we proceed to our analysis of the observed 3D nematode gait, we first examine the effect of nonzero torsion on harmonic-curvature undulations. Fig. 5A shows numerical solutions of Serret–Frenet equations for a curve with harmonic curvature, Eq. 3, and constant torsion τ(s)=τ0. [4] The results are shown for the default curvature-wave amplitude A/q=1 and several values of the torsion τ0. Fig. 5.

(C) A crawling nematode undergoing a nonplanar body deformation. The lifted body segment is indicated by the arrow. Reprinted with permission from ref. 47; www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09252312. The thick line segment shown for τ0/q=0.075 in A represents a nematode shape approximately matching the image depicted in C.The plots indicate that for moderate values of τ0, the undulatory character of nematode motion is preserved, and the undulation plane rotates when the nematode moves forward. Geometrically, this torsion-induced reorientation stems from the rotation of the deformation plane 𝒕^–𝒏^ about the tangent vector 𝒕^ when the Serret–Frenet basis moves along the nematode trail (schematically depicted in Fig. 3B). We call the gait defined by Eqs. 3 and 4 a (one-mode) torsional roll. The results of our calculations for the roll-rotation rate per undulation period ωroll are presented in Fig. 5B. First, we point out that a calculated body configuration depicted by the thick line segment in Fig. 5A (for τ0/q=0.075) resembles the reported (47) nonplanar posture of a crawling nematode that lifts a body segment from the underlying agar surface; the reported image (47) is reproduced in Fig. 5C. Second, our detailed analysis of stereoscopic images (33) of a burrowing nematode, discussed next, demonstrates that C. elegans use the torsional-roll maneuver for 3D reorientation.The Three-Mode Torsional Roll Model Accurately Describes Observed 3D Motion of Burrowing C. elegans. The video images reproduced from ref. 33 (Fig. 6A) show that during its forward motion the depicted nematode is gradually changing the orientation of the plane of undulations, consistent with the general shape of the constant-torsion lines shown in Fig. 5A. In the initial frame of Fig. 6A the entire nematode body undulates in the y–z plane, which indicates that at time t=0s the roll maneuver has not yet started. Subsequently, the nematode begins the roll maneuver, and an increasing portion of the body-wave plane is reorienting. At time t=2s, the anterior part is already significantly reoriented (by ∼45∘), but the undulations in the posterior portion still remain oriented in the y–z plane. Fig. 6.

(B) A matching time-lapse set of simulated postures of a nematode performing a three-mode torsional roll, Eq. 5. The simulation parameters are curvature amplitude A/q=1, worm length qL=10.2, torsion τ0/q=0.15, and torsional-mode length qΔsτ=6. Similar to the experimental images, the calculated postures are equally spaced in time. The region of nonzero torsion is shaded in blue.To describe the observed behavior, we introduce a three-mode torsional-roll model, τ(s)={0, s<s1τ,τ0, s1τ<s<s2τ,0, s2τ<s, [5] where for s<s1τ and s>s2τ the nematode undergoes planar undulations, and it performs the roll only in the spatiotemporal interval s1τ<s<s2τ of finite length Δsτ=s2τ−s1τ. During the entire three-mode roll maneuver, the body undulations are described by a single harmonic-curvature mode, Eq. 3, and the propagating body curvature and torsion waves are given by Eq. 2.Torsional Roll Is a Unique 3D Behavioral State. As shown in Fig. 6, our three-mode roll model, Eq. 5, is in excellent agreement with the stereoscopic nematode-tracking images by Kwon et al. (33). All key features of the nematode gait are correctly reproduced for the entire 2-s time interval, including the fact that an increasing part of the body undergoes the roll, but the rest remains planar. The calculated body postures shown in Fig. 6B were obtained from a single continuous simulation; these are not separate fits to individual body postures. Our model faithfully describes the entire behavioral pattern (a 3D roll). We conclude that we have identified and mathematically described a unique behavioral state of C. elegans.Maneuverability of Swimming C. elegans in Bulk Fluids In environments with different mechanical properties typical body postures of C. elegans are distinct because the undulation wavelength λ differs relative to the body length L (Fig. 4); however, the harmonic-curvature undulation waveform described by Eqs. 1–3 is preserved (28). In particular, the geometrical similarity between the swimming and crawling gaits is corroborated by the important observation by Fang-Yen et al. (25) that the wavelength of undulations in swimming continuously decreases with increasing fluid viscosity, and in highly viscous fluids the swimming gait is very similar to the crawling gait. Thus, fluid viscosity affects the undulation wavelength, but the waveform is unaffected. Swimming Trajectories Depend on the Gait Geometry and Hydrodynamic Force and Torque Balance. Based on the above observations, we conclude that the gait description developed in the previous sections to elucidate no-slip locomotion yields a suitable framework for inquiry into the mechanics of reorientation maneuvers of swimming C. elegans. Accordingly, we assume that the waveform Eq. 2 of the propagating curvature and torsion is maintained in fluids, and we decompose the motion of a swimming nematode into the geometrical component i and dynamical component ii, where i is the progression along the curvilinear path determined by the curvature and torsion functions κ(s) and τ(s), and ii is the rigid-body translation and rotation resulting from the hydrodynamic force and torque balance on the entire nematode body. Due to the presence of the translational and rotational motion ii, the trajectories of swimming nematodes differ from those of crawling/burrowing nematodes using the same sequence of body postures and moving along a no-slip path. Moreover, in swimming the trajectories depend not only on the form of the curvature and torsion waves, but also on the normalized undulation wavelength λ/L, whereas the no-slip path i is independent of this parameter. The above decomposition into i and ii is particularly useful in the linear creeping-flow regime (considered here), because in this case there are no inertial effects, and the total hydrodynamic force and torque can be evaluated by superposing the forces and torques associated with the component velocities i and ii. Our bead-based technique for calculating hydrodynamic forces acting on a nematode is described in Materials and Methods and in our previous study of 2D undulatory locomotion (29).Planar Turn Angles in Swimming Are Reduced Compared with No-Slip Motion. As shown in Fig. 1A and the corresponding Movie S1, crawling and swimming nematodes perform planar turns by asymmetrically increasing their undulation amplitude for short time intervals. To assess the effectiveness of such turning maneuvers, we consider three-mode PHC turns, κ(s)={A1cos(qs), s<s1c,A2cos(qs), s1c<s<s2c,A1cos(qs), s2c<s, [6] in which the nematode initially moves using the default locomotion mode with the amplitude A1/q≈1, then at a position s1c switches to the turning mode with a higher amplitude A2>A1, and finally at a position s2c returns to the default locomotion mode (Fig. 7A). For simplicity, we focus on maneuvers in which only the amplitude of the harmonic curvature varies. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Effectiveness of three-mode planar turns in crawling/burrowing and swimming. (A) Definition of the turn angle θturn and positions of the turn mode-switching points s1c and s2c=s1c+Δsc for the PHC maneuvers shown. We use qs1c=3π/2, qΔsc=0.6, and default mode amplitude A1/q=1 for all calculations shown.

(C) A sequence of simulation snapshots of a swimming C-shaped nematode (qL=5.5) performing a three-mode PHC turn, with the turning mode amplitude as labeled. (D) Comparison of the dependence of the turn angle θturn (in degrees) on the turning-mode amplitude A2/q for motion without transverse slip (dashed line) and swimming (solid line). The three circles for each case correspond to the shown trajectories and snapshots.Fig. 7 presents a comparison between calculated trajectories for nematodes executing a three-mode planar turn in crawling/burrowing without transverse slip (Fig. 7B) and swimming (Fig. 7C). The swimming nematodes undergo the same sequence of body postures as the crawling/burrowing ones, but their corresponding trajectories differ because of the translational and rotational velocity component ii that is present only in swimming. Fig. 7D shows the dependence of the turn angle on the turning-mode amplitude A2/q for both cases. Consistent with the experimental results (Fig. 1A and Movie S1), the turn angles in swimming are relatively shallow, as a result of the hydrodynamically induced rotation. The swimming angles are always significantly smaller than the corresponding angles for crawling (or burrowing); this hydrodynamic hindrance is especially pronounced for small turning-mode amplitudes. A swimming nematode usually needs to perform several turns to significantly change its locomotion direction. A typical case of such a combined multimode turning maneuver is presented in Movie S1, which shows a turn of a swimming wild-type C. elegans along with a matching hydrodynamic simulation.Roll Rotation Rate in Swimming Is Increased Compared with No-Slip Motion. As shown in Fig. 1B and the corresponding Movie S2, a swimming nematode can quickly change the plane of undulations by performing a roll maneuver. Our experimental observations indicate that a roll by 90° often occurs in one undulation period, and faster rolls are not unusual. This rotation is much more rapid than the rotation observed in burrowing (Fig. 6). Our images of swimming C. elegans undergoing undulation-plane reorientation indicate that the nematode body postures are nonplanar, similar to the corresponding behavior in burrowing. These 3D swimming postures closely resemble the torsional-roll configurations defined by Eqs. 3 and 4, as depicted in Fig. 8 A and B. While the out-of-plane deformation of the nematode body shown in Fig. 8A seems quite small, our hydrodynamic simulations indicate that even such a relatively minor out-of-plane torsional distortion can result in a rapid reorientation of the undulation plane. Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Three-mode torsional roll of a swimming C. elegans. (A and B) A recorded nonplanar body posture (A) and a matching calculated body shape (B) with harmonic curvature and constant torsion. Normalized curvature amplitude A/q=1, wavevector qL=5.5, and torsion τ0/q=0.16 (which is equivalent to τ0L=0.9). (Magnification: 1.6×.) (C) Stereoscopic views of a simulated nematode performing a three-mode swimming roll maneuver (projection planes as labeled). At times t1 and t4 the nematode performs planar undulations; at t2 and t3 it performs a roll with gait parameters corresponding to the posture shown in B; the total length of the torsional roll mode is qΔsτ=2π. The roll results in a change of the undulation plane by ∼90∘.Such rapid axial reorientation is illustrated by the hydrodynamic simulations of three-mode roll maneuvers presented in Fig. 8C and in Movie S3. In both cases the nematode undergoes a roll rotation of ∼90∘ in less than one period of undulations, in agreement with our experimental observations. The effectiveness of roll reorientation in fluids is quantitatively assessed in Fig. 9A for C-shaped gait and in Fig. 9B for W-shaped gait in terms of the roll rotation rate ωroll per undulation period. Since the hydrodynamic component of the rolling rate is affected by the nematode length L, the results are shown versus τ0L, that is, the torsion normalized by L. Similar to the corresponding result for the no-slip roll of a burrowing nematode (Fig. 5B), the roll rotation rate in swimming decreases with the normalized curvature-wave amplitude A/q. However, the relation between ωroll and the torsion is nonlinear, and the dependence on the normalized undulation amplitude A/q is significantly weaker, due to hydrodynamic effects. The roll rotation for C-shaped and W-shaped gaits has a similar magnitude for given values of A/q and τ0L. Fig. 9. Open in a new tab Hydrodynamic enhancement of roll rotation rate. (A and B) The roll rotation rate per undulation ωroll (in degrees) in swimming is shown vs. normalized body torsion τ0L, for normalized curvature-wave amplitude A/q=0.8,1,1.2,1.4,1.6,1.8 (from above) for (A) C-shaped (qL=5.5) and (B) W-shaped (qL=9) swimming nematodes. Examples of nematode shapes are shown in respective Insets. (C) Comparison of roll rotation rate per undulation period, ωroll (in degrees), between nematodes performing one-mode roll in swimming (solid lines) and burrowing (dashed lines), shown vs. normalized magnitude of body torsion τ0/q. Results are presented for C-shaped and W-shaped gaits (as labeled) and normalized harmonic-curvature amplitude A/q=1.A Comparison of Roll Rotation Rate in Burrowing and Swimming Provides Evidence for a Significant Hydrodynamic Enhancement. To directly compare the swimming roll rotation rate ωroll shown in Fig. 9 A and B with the corresponding purely geometrical no-slip result (Fig. 5B), the swimming and no-slip simulation data are replotted in Fig. 9C using the same scaling of the torsion τ0/q for both datasets. The results indicate that hydrodynamic forces in swimming can enhance the rotation rate in a very significant way. Compared with the values in the no-slip burrowing case (for the same sequence of nematode body motions), the roll rotation rate ωroll in swimming increases by a factor ranging from approximately 2 (for C-shaped gait) to even 3 (for W-shaped gait). For example, a swimming nematode using a W-shaped gait [e.g., C. elegans swimming in a highly viscous dextran solution (25)] would rotate at a rate ωroll≈120∘ per undulation period for body torsion τ0/q=0.15. A burrowing nematode with a similar gait (e.g., Fig. 6) would have a rotation rate of only ωroll≈40∘.The Mechanisms of Hydrodynamic Hindrance and Enhancement As illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11, both the hindrance of planar locomotion and the 3D roll enhancement result from the longitudinal resistance forces (acting parallel to local body segments). These longitudinal resistance forces counteract the propulsive transverse forces that drive the nematode forward when the undulatory wave propagates backward along the body. In burrowing, the longitudinal resistance is too weak (compared with the transverse resistance) to produce any significant body displacements; thus the nematode moves along the purely geometrical no-slip path i, defined by the curvature and torsion wave. In swimming, the force and torque associated with the longitudinal resistance produce additional translation and rotation of the nematode body ii (indicated by blue arrows in Figs. 10 and 11). Fig. 10. Open in a new tab Mechanism of hydrodynamic hindrance of planar motion. A and B show no-slip paths (thin dashed line) and nematode positions (thick lines) in no-slip crawling/burrowing and swimming. The initial body configurations (0) are marked by the thick gray line. The body configurations after two undulation periods, marked with 2, are shown in no-slip crawling/burrowing by the gray line with black border and the corresponding body configurations in swimming (2H) by a thick black line. In forward locomotion (A), the longitudinal hydrodynamic resistance (indicated for the initial configuration by red arrows) produces a net hydrodynamic force causing backward nematode displacement (indicated by the blue arrow); it slows the nematode down. Similarly, during a planar turn (B) the net hydrodynamic torque produces rotation that reduces the overall turn angle of the nematode.Fig. 11. Open in a new tab Mechanism of hydrodynamic enhancement of axial roll rotation. A shows a side view and B and C a front view of nematode trajectories in a roll maneuver. The labeling convention follows that of Fig. 10. In B and C the axis of motion (toward the viewer) is indicated by the symbol ⊙. In forward locomotion (A) the longitudinal hydrodynamic resistance 𝐅H (red arrows) slows the nematode down. During the torsional roll (B and C), the net torque TH (magenta arrows in C) associated with 𝐅H (red arrows) produces hydrodynamic rotation (blue arrow in B) in the same direction as the geometrical rotation of the undulation plane (progression 0→1→2).Force and Torque Associated with Longitudinal Hydrodynamic Resistance Hinder Forward Motion and 2D Turns. In forward locomotion, the longitudinal resistance force always acts in the direction opposite to the direction of nematode motion (Fig. 10A). In swimming this force thus results in reduction of locomotion velocity (29, 41). Similarly, the torque acting on the nematode body undergoing a deep asymmetric undulation during a planar turn is oriented opposite to the turn direction, thus hindering the turn (Fig. 10B).Axial Torque Produced by the Longitudinal Hydrodynamic Resistance Enhances Roll Rotation. The analysis of the effect of hydrodynamic interactions in torsional roll is more subtle. To elucidate the interplay of the gait geometry and the longitudinal hydrodynamic friction, we show two views of the nematode trajectory: the side view (Fig. 11A) and the front view (Fig. 11 B and C). Fig. 11 indicates that, as a result of torsional distortion of the nematode body, the undulation plane in no-slip motion [i.e., along the path i before the hydrodynamic displacement ii is included] gradually changes its orientation. Therefore, it can be observed that the trajectory spirals around its axis (Fig. 11B). In the projections of the no-slip path shown in Fig. 11 B and C, the nematode moves in the clockwise direction around the trajectory axis (which points toward the viewer). In contrast, the undulation plane geometrically rotates anticlockwise (determined from the orientation of this plane in subsequent periods). This anticlockwise rotation of the undulation plane arises from the star-like topology of the calculated path projection. The clockwise nematode motion produces the oppositely oriented hydrodynamically induced resistance 𝐅H (Fig. 11C), which in our example results in an anticlockwise axial torque TH and the corresponding hydrodynamic rotation of the nematode in the anticlockwise direction about the trajectory axis. Since the geometrical and hydrodynamic contributions to ωroll have the same orientation (anticlockwise in the particular case analyzed), they add up, which leads to a significant enhancement of the roll rotation in swimming, consistent with our experimental observations and the numerical results shown in Fig. 9C.Discussion Torsional Roll Is a Unique Behavioral State That Is Essential for 3D Locomotion. Based on our investigation of available stereoscopic images and other experimental evidence, we have shown that C. elegans explore their 3D environment by combining planar turns with roll reorientation maneuvers. The rolls, during which the undulation plane of the worm rotates about the trajectory axis, constitute an important previously unrecognized behavioral pattern that is an essential component of 3D locomotion. To identify the roll maneuvers and describe their geometry, we have developed a mathematical representation of the 3D nematode gait. According to our analysis, the roll maneuvers combine harmonic curvature with a piecewise constant torsion that causes the undulation-plane reorientation. Our 3D model of roll maneuvers faithfully reproduces all key geometrical features of the observed roll behavior of a burrowing nematode and, when integrated with appropriate hydrodynamic calculations, replicates a rapid roll rotation observed in swimming. We have provided a physical explanation of this unexpected hydrodynamic enhancement effect in the 3D roll maneuver. Our modeling approach provides a powerful tool for investigating 3D locomotion of C. elegans, including initiation and execution of behavioral patterns associated with 3D reorientation. For example, our techniques can be applied to analyze chemotaxis strategies and escape responses, as well as to evaluate the effect of nematode health and age on locomotory abilities. In Application to Chemotaxis we describe a proof-of-concept calculation showing that the nematode can use a combination of turn and roll reorientation maneuvers to efficiently chemotax in 3D environments. To illustrate typical maneuvers in 3D space, we present two examples of numerical simulations of a nematode performing multiple turns and rolls (Movie S4 for burrowing and Movie S5 for swimming). Our analysis reveals that both the burrowing and swimming rolls involve a similar pattern of nematode movements defined by a curvature wave with nonzero torsion. Several recent experimental studies showed that the nematode gait is not significantly affected by the rheological properties of the suspending medium (48–51), for the system parameters investigated. Such results were documented for viscoelastic fluids (48), shear-thinning fluids (50), and entangled polymeric solutions (49). For nematodes swimming in a shear-thinning suspension (51), a moderate increase in the head-bending angle was observed, but even in this case, the overall form of undulations remained similar to the waveform observed in Newtonian fluids. Based on the above wide spectrum of systems in which rheological properties of the suspending medium do not affect the locomotory undulation pattern, we conclude that the same simple undulation waveform likely occurs for C. elegans moving in a variety of complex media present in its natural environment. Moreover, since roll maneuvers provide effective 3D reorientation and do not require complicated patterns of body actuation, we anticipate that similar rolls are performed by other undulatory burrowers and swimmers.Torsional Roll Maneuvers Help Sedimented Adult Nematodes Maintain Swimming Capabilities. Trajectories of swimming C. elegans are affected not only by active actuation but also by buoyancy forces. During the larval stages of development and for nematodes swimming in highly viscous aqueous solutions of organic matter (common in C. elegans habitat) the effect of buoyancy is negligible. Adult nematodes swimming in water, however, tend to settle down toward the bottom of the pool and reside close to the bottom surface, following its topology (52). As shown by Yuan et al. (52), the worms remain suspended due to the upward force that results from continuous head collisions with the bottom wall when the nematode body undulates in an approximately vertical plane. In our experiments, we find that during this near-the-bottom locomotion, nematodes perform frequent rolls (one roll of about 90° per several undulation periods), with the frequency similar to the roll frequency in a bulk fluid. The rolls allow the worms to repeatedly attain approximately vertical orientation of the undulation plane (Movie S6). Such a vertical orientation is necessary for the sedimenting worms to be able to generate the upward resuspending force through collisions with the bottom. We thus conclude that the roll maneuvers are used by C. elegans not only to change the direction of motion in 3D, but also to remain suspended near the bottom surface and, therefore, to maintain the swimming behavior in the presence of significant buoyancy forces.Muscular System of C. elegans Is Compatible with 3D Body Actuation, but Neural Control Mechanism Is Unknown. As an important application of this study, our results may shed light on subtle aspects of neuromuscular control of 3D locomotion of C. elegans. Body movements of C. elegans are actuated by a coordinated action of four quadrants of body muscles, which are arranged into double rows that span the entire nematode length (53). While this muscle anatomy is compatible with 3D body actuation, it is less clear how the neural system can activate differential muscle contractions needed to generate 3D body deformations out of the dorsoventral undulation plane. According to a detailed map of neural connections in C. elegans (53–55), the head and neck body muscles are innervated by the nerve ring motor neurons, which synapse onto cells in individual quadrants (and thus are capable to actuate each quadrant individually). In contrast, the remaining body muscles are innervated only by the ventral-cord motor neurons, which synapse onto muscles of either two ventral or two dorsal quadrants, consistent with 2D actuation. Based on this topology of neural connections, it is generally assumed that only the head and neck segments can perform 3D motion. However, the stereoscopic experiments by Kwon et al. (33) clearly show that burrowing nematodes can adopt a variety of 3D postures. The images clearly show that the entire body undergoes out-of-plane deformations. In the swimming case the evidence is less conclusive because stereoscopic images are not yet available. Nonetheless, 2D images of swimming nematodes (such as the one shown in Fig. 8A) agree with our 3D body posture model. Our hydrodynamic calculations of the roll dynamics further support a conclusion that the entire nematode body participates in generating the roll motion. We find that the torsional wave propagating throughout the entire body length can produce a 90° roll in less than one undulation period, consistent with rolls observed in our laboratory experiments using wild-type C. elegans. In contrast, a stroke in which only the head and neck segments are displaced out of the undulation plane produces significantly weaker rolls. The results of these additional simulations are presented in Analysis of a Roll Resulting from Out-of-Plane Displacements of the Nematode Head. We hypothesize that the generation of a nonzero torsion in the posterior part of the nematode body involves a 3D proprioceptive feedback, which enables propagation of the torsional wave from the head segment in the posterior direction. The existence of 2D proprioceptive feedback in C. elegans and its important role in generation of a planar undulation wave have been demonstrated by Wen et al. (4). Based on this result and building on their observation that individual neurons of C. elegans may have a high degree of functional complexity, we conjecture that 3D proprioception may give rise to asymmetric neural signals and differential muscular contractions that are needed to achieve well-controlled out-of-plane body movements during the torsional roll. We note that current evidence is not sufficient to rule out a passive, purely mechanical origin of propagation of 3D deformations along the portion of the nematode body outside the head and neck regions. In particular, the body shapes observed during burrowing (33) can, in principle, be generated by 3D actuation of the head and neck muscles, with the rest of the body passively sliding along the tunnel carved by the nematode head. Such motion, however, would be inefficient, especially in media with low-yield stress, in which transverse forces needed to passively deform the nematode body would result in undesirable transverse slip. Since C. elegans has a four-quadrant muscle arrangement that is anatomically capable of generating 3D body deformations, we expect that there is a compatible neuromuscular-control system that allows the nematode to fully use this (existing) muscle structure. Further analyses of 3D locomotion of C. elegans will help determine whether such a control system exists and how it may actuate the nematode body.Materials and Methods Imaging of Swimming Nematodes Performing Rolls and Turns in Water. Wild-type C. elegans were used to record the 3D swimming. Worms were cultured in a nematode growth medium plate seeded with the bacteria Escherichia coli OP50 at 20 °C. A liquid pool was created for the swimming assay by adding 5–7 mL of M9 buffer into a 60-mm Petri dish. The pool height was ∼2 mm. The surface of the Petri dish was treated with 5% Pluoronic F127 for 5 min before adding M9 buffer. Individual young adults were manually transferred into a liquid pool of M9 buffer, using a worm pick. Swimming episodes were recorded at 30 frames per second using an SVSI camera and Zeiss Stemi 2000-C stereo microscope imaging system at 1.6× magnification with a pixel resolution of 0.21 pixels/μm. All imaging was carried out in a food-free environment at 20 °C.Assessing Buoyancy Effects in 3D Swimming. A mixed culture of worms (L1–L3 larvae and adults) was used to observe the voluntary 3D movement of sedimenting nematodes in water and in 10% dextran solution (Dextran 2000 from Leuconostoc spp.) of viscosity 50.2 cP at 20 °C. Settling of a mixed worm population was observed in a BrandTech Macro Cuvette. Worms were washed from a plate and concentrated in 200 μL of M9 solution. In each experiment, 50 μL of the worm solution (∼50–100 worms) was added at the top surface of the fluid in the cuvette and allowed to settle under the influence of gravity. Worms were recorded for the entire settling path (4.5 cm). We observed that in water the sedimentation velocity of adult worms was comparable to the active swimming velocity, and the nematodes settled toward the bottom of the cuvette. In contrast, many larvae did not settle and remained in the top layer of fluid even after 10 min. In the dextran solution the settling velocity was negligible for both adults and larvae. Nematodes changed the undulation plane using roll maneuvers every 2 to 3 undulations. The rate of planar turns was much slower (∼10 undulations per turn, consistent with results from ref. 34). No evidence of gravity-induced passive reorientations was found in either experiment; therefore we conclude that the effect of buoyancy forces on reorientation maneuvers is negligible.Description of Planar Nematode Postures. Based on our prior quantitative analysis of nematode shapes (28), in our turn and roll-rotation angle calculations we use qL=9 for the W-shaped basic crawling/burrowing gait and qL=5.5 for the C-shaped swimming gait. These values are within the range of wavelength variability reported in ref. 25. Since in crawling and burrowing without transverse slip the resistance forces are of the same magnitude, we assume that the 3D burrowing and crawling gaits have similar parameter values, consistent with the available experimental images of burrowing C. elegans (33).Modeling of Nematode Hydrodynamics. In our numerical simulations of swimming nematodes we use a 3D generalization of the bead-based model introduced in ref. 29. Accordingly, a swimming nematode is represented as an active chain of N hydrodynamically coupled spherical beads arranged along the nematode centerline. As the configuration of a chain submerged in a viscous fluid evolves, the beads i=1,…,N move with the linear and angular velocities 𝒖i=𝒖ia+𝒖irb, [7] 𝝎i=𝝎ia+𝝎rb, [8] which are decomposed into the active and passive components. The active linear velocity 𝒖ia corresponds to the sliding motion of the bead along the curve defined by the curvature and torsion waves, Eq. 2, 𝒖ia=vs𝒕^i, [9] where 𝒕^i is the unit tangent vector at the position of bead i, and vs is the velocity of the curvature wave propagating along the nematode body. The active angular bead velocity 𝝎ia=κ(si)𝒃^i+τ(si)𝒕^i [10] depends on the curvature κ, torsion τ, and the binormal unit vector 𝒃^i at the bead position si. The angular velocity Eq. 10 mimics the rotational motion of individual segments of the deforming nematode body. As explained in our previous paper (29), neglecting the active rotational contribution results in an overprediction of nematode swimming speed, especially for large qL. The passive linear and angular velocities of individual beads, 𝒖irb=𝒖rb+𝝎rb×𝑹i, [11] 𝝎irb=𝝎rb, [12] are associated with the rigid-body translation and rotation of the entire chain. The hydrodynamic torque, chain velocity 𝒖rb, and bead positions 𝑹i are evaluated relative to a prescribed center of rotation of the chain. The linear and angular chain velocities 𝒖rb and 𝝎rb are determined from the hydrodynamic force and torque balance, [𝑭a𝑻a]+[𝜻^tt𝜻^tr𝜻^rt𝜻^rr]⋅[𝒖rb𝝎rb]=0, [13] where 𝑭a and 𝑻a are the active torque and force required to produce the prescribed chain motion, Eqs. 9 and 10, and 𝜻^αβ (α,β=t,r) are translational (t) and rotational (r) hydrodynamic resistance tensors of the chain at a current configuration. Expressions for the active force 𝑭a, active torque 𝑻a, and the hydrodynamic resistance tensors 𝜻^αβ in terms of the hydrodynamic resistance and mobility tensors of a system of hydrodynamically coupled beads are given in ref. 29. The calculations presented in our paper were performed using a generalized Rotne–Prager–Yamakawa (RPY) approximation (56) for multiparticle hydrodynamic interactions. A limited set of calculations was also performed using a more accurate but computationally more expensive Hydromultipole algorithm (57); for our current problem, the RPY approximation produces fairly accurate results. The nematode body was modeled using a chain of N=30 beads. We note that in an independent study Berman et al. (42) also used a hydrodynamic bead-based model to investigate undulatory swimming of a nematode.Evaluation of the Roll Rotation Rate. The single-mode roll rotation rate per period of undulations, ωroll, was determined from the angle between the binormal vectors at s=0 and s=2π/q.Supplementary Material Supplementary File Download video file (631.2KB, mp4) Supplementary File Download video file (2MB, mp4) Supplementary File Download video file (1.2MB, mp4) Supplementary File pnas.201706754SI.pdf (741.8KB, pdf) Supplementary File Download video file (1.2MB, mp4) Supplementary File Download video file (3.4MB, mp4) Supplementary File Download video file (1.9MB, mp4) Acknowledgments We thank Dr. N.

    "abstract": "Abstract The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been routinely used to study gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. Most experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific developmental stage. Bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the embryos. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices. Importantly, filtration has no deleterious effects on downstream larval development assays. In conclusion, we have exploited the differences in the sizes of C. elegans developmental stages to isolate embryo cultures suitable for use in high-throughput assays.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis are an ideal system to study genes, genetic interactions, and evolutionary conserved signaling pathways. The most studied organism of this group is Caenorhabditis elegans, because of its short life cycle, hermaphroditic mating system, cost-effective cultivation, small size, transparency, small genome, and the simplicity of genetic modification and functional testing in a laboratory setting [1]. C. elegans develop through four morphologically distinct larval stages (L1 - L4), before progressing into adults. Most experiments require the nematodes to be at a specific developmental stage because of the distinct morphologies, behaviors, and gene expression patterns of each stage. High-throughput assays such as RNA sequencing, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), drug screens, proteomics, and behavioral assays require a large number of animals at a particular stage. The standard method of obtaining nematodes at a specific developmental stage is by collecting embryos and allowing them to hatch into L1 larvae that are arrested when starved. The synchronous population of L1 larvae is fed and then incubated at the desired temperature until the animals grow to the target developmental stage. Embryos are obtained from the uterus of gravid adults by dissolving the hypodermis using a hypochlorite (bleach) solution (Fig 1). However, different parameters such as the bleaching time and temperature of the bleach solution affect the survival of the embryos [2]. To control for the variability in the numbers of viable, unaffected animals after bleach synchronization, three independent replicates are typically performed for high-throughput assays, making the process time-consuming [3–5]. Fig 1. Comparison of bleach and filtration techniques to collect embryos. Open in a new tab Bleach synchronization involves dissolving the hypodermis of gravid adults and releasing the embryos. Filtration involves using size-specific filters to separate the embryos from the adults. The figure was created using BioRender. To overcome the limitations of bleach synchronization, microfluidic devices can sort animals based on the size differences of each developmental stage [6,7]. Such devices enable precise control of parameters such as liquid flow, pressure, and temperature enabling effective sorting [8]. However, the major drawbacks of such devices are their high cost, lack of scalability to many independent strains, and the requirement to build them, making them inaccessible to many groups. Mesh filters of different sizes are a cheaper alternative to microfluidic devices. Separation of C. elegans stages by size has been done using filters of different mesh sizes that allow specific stages to pass through and some stages to be retained on top of the mesh (Fig 1), [9]. Filters with different pore sizes are commercially available. For example, Wilson sieves of 5 µm mesh size were used to separate L1 or L2 populations [10], plate-based nylon mesh filters of 11 µm from Millipore MultiScreen were used to purify the L1 stage [11], pluriSelect filters were used to isolate L4 and young adult stages of C. elegans [9], mesh filters have also been used to separate males from hermaphrodites [12], and in-house filters were also constructed with 50 mL conical tubes and monofilament mesh of the required pore size to recover the L4 stage (on 20 µm filters) and day-one adults (on 50 µm filters) [13]. The examples highlight using mesh filters to isolate specific developmental stages of C. elegans. However, these other size filtration methods are less efficient when scaling beyond one or a small number of strains. Additionally, the small differences in length and width between consecutive larval stages make it difficult to get a 100% pure culture of a specific stage. For example, the difference in width between the L1 and L2 stages, and L2 and L3 stages is approximately 5.3 µm and 5.1 µm respectively (approximate widths of L1, L2, L3, and L4 larvae are 11.7 µm, 17 µm, 22.1 µm, and 29.5 µm, respectively) [6]. In contrast, the dimensions of the embryos (50 µm in length and 30 µm in diameter) make it easier to separate from other developmental stages [14]. Once isolated, the embryos can be cultured to obtain a synchronous population of L1 larvae that can be grown to a synchronized stage-specific population. We used filters from pluriSelect to specifically isolate embryos that were laid on an OP50-seeded plate. Based on the widths of the different developmental stages, we conducted sequential filtration using filters of two mesh sizes, 40 µm and 20 µm. The 40 µm filter retained adults and debris. The embryos and larval stages, which are smaller in width, passed through the 40 µm mesh and were collected on the 20 µm mesh. The 20 µm mesh further allowed the smaller larval stages to pass through and the embryos to be retained. Using our technique, we recovered approximately 9,500 embryos from one 6 cm OP50-seeded plate, compared to approximately 5,000 embryos by bleach synchronization, using the C. elegans N2 laboratory-adapted strain. To further increase the embryo yield per plate, we incorporated polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the M9 buffer (3% w/v) changing the osmolarity and improving embryo pelleting by three-fold. PEG has been used previously in M9 buffers without adverse effects on C. elegans [15]. Additionally, PEG has been employed for the encapsulation of various organisms, including C. elegans, with no harmful side effects [16]. We further showed that the embryos obtained by filtration developed into healthier larvae compared to the larvae obtained by bleach synchronization. Furthermore, we found similar or longer (indicating less of an effect) animal lengths after 48 hours of growth from the L1 stage when embryos were collected using filtration compared to bleach and exposed to albendazole, an anthelmintic compound known to inhibit animal development [17]. In summary, we have developed a protocol to obtain synchronized embryos that improves upon the traditional method of bleach synchronization.",

    "results": "Results and discussion One of the major challenges of conducting high-throughput C. elegans assays is collecting a large number of embryos. Traditionally, bleach synchronization has been used to harvest embryos. However, the process is time-consuming and introduces high variability [3–5]. To overcome the challenges of bleach synchronization, we demonstrated the use of commercially available mesh filters to collect a large number of embryos with high purity. We set up the filtration apparatus as shown (Fig 2). Briefly, a connector ring was attached to a 50 mL conical tube. A 20 µm filter (green color) was attached on top of the connector ring. A 40 µm filter (blue color) was added on top of the 20 µm filter. A funnel was attached to the 40 µm filter. Optimization of filtration conditions The G1 offspring recovered from the 20 µM mesh filter were 94–100% (data collected from up to 50 filtrations) embryos with rare L1 larvae contaminants. To get 100% G1 embryo cultures, we sought to kill the L1 larvae by exposing the recovered mixed-stage population to a bleach solution. We optimized the bleach concentration and exposure time so that it was sufficient to kill the larvae without any damaging effects on the G1 embryos. We tested three different concentrations of bleach solution (10%, 20%, and 25% in M9 buffer) with varying exposure times (30, 60, 120, and 150 seconds) to identify the optimal condition that killed the larvae (identified by lack of movement) with minimal impact on embryos. Treating the recovered population with 25% bleach solution for 30 seconds killed the larvae with minimal impact on embryonic lethality as measured after 24 hours of recovery (S1 Table). For our initial experiments, we used M9 buffer as the wash solution for all subsequent washes. However, embryos might be lost during each M9 buffer wash. To reduce the potential for loss, we altered the osmolarity of the M9 buffer using PEG. We used PEG at four different concentrations (0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% w/v) in M9 buffer and obtained the highest yield with 3% PEG. Consequently, we used 3% PEG in M9 buffer for all subsequent washes. We recovered two times more embryos from a single 6 cm OP50-seeded plate when 3% PEG was incorporated with M9 buffer in the wash solution (average embryo yield was 12,539 ± 5,727 SD with 3% PEG in M9 buffer compared to an average embryonic yield of 6,821 ± 5,364 SD with M9 buffer) (S2A Fig). To ensure that PEG did not affect the hatching of embryos, we assessed the embryonic lethality after 24 hours. The average embryonic lethality of embryos that were washed with 3% PEG was similar to the embryonic lethality of embryos that were washed with M9 buffer (4.5% for 3% PEG in M9 buffer and 3.8% for M9), indicating that the use of PEG does not damage the embryos (S2B Fig). Filtration yields a higher number of embryos compared to bleach synchronization To determine the efficacy of embryo filtration, we collected embryos using bleach synchronization and filtration techniques in parallel. We used the same number of 6 cm OP50-seeded plates that had an equivalent number of P0 adults. We recovered an average of 4,946 (SD ± 3360) G1 embryos by bleach synchronization, compared to an average of 9,474 (SD ± 6764) G1 embryos by filtration (Fig 5). To account for variability that might be introduced by different experimentalists performing the protocols, we employed three experimentalists to conduct the filtration and bleach protocols to collect the G1 embryos. We did not find a significant difference between any two experimentalists for either of the two protocols (p = 0.217 for the bleach synchronization protocol, and p = 0.706 for the filtration protocol, Kruskall-Wallis rank-sum test). Fig 5. A higher number of G1 embryos were recovered from filtration than by bleach synchronization. Open in a new tab Box plot showing G1 embryonic yield per plate obtained by bleach synchronization or filtration protocols. The median is represented by the solid horizontal line with the 75th and 25th quartiles on the top and bottom of the box, respectively. Whiskers extend from the box to the maximum and minimum values that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range above and below the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. The three different colors of the points indicate three experimentalists. A significantly higher number of G1 embryos were collected by filtration (p = 0.00064, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Eight replicates were tested by each experimentalist for each method. Embryos obtained by filtration develop comparably to the embryos obtained by bleach synchronization We aimed to understand differences in the development of G1 embryos collected by bleach and filtration protocols, so we harvested embryos using bleach synchronization and filtration protocols in parallel and measured the lengths of the animals after 48 hours of growth using a liquid-based larval development assay [3,5,22,23]. We used length as an indicator of development because nematodes get longer as they proceed through development. The G1 embryos obtained by filtration grew to longer animals compared to the lengths of animals that developed from G1 embryos collected by bleaching (p = 0.0025; Wilcoxon test), indicating that filtration is healthier compared to bleaching (Fig 6). We conducted a Kruskall-Wallis test to assess the variance explained by the different replicates. A p-value of 2 × 10-16 indicated a large difference in the variance between replicates. Fig 6. Embryos obtained by filtration developed comparably to the embryos obtained by bleach. Open in a new tab The box plot shows the length of L4 animals that developed from G1 embryos collected by bleach or filtration protocols. Median is represented by the solid horizontal line with the 75th and 25th quartiles on the top and bottom of the box, respectively. Whiskers extend from the box to the maximum and minimum values that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range above and below the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. Each point is the summarized measurement of an individual well containing between five and 30 animals. G1 embryos collected by filtration grew into animals with longer lengths compared to lengths of animals that developed from G1 embryos collected using bleach synchronization (p = 0.0025; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The assay was carried out in three replicates independently by three experimentalists (represented by the three different colored points). G1 embryos collected by filtration develop similarly to the G1 embryos obtained by bleach synchronization when exposed to an anthelmintic compound We aimed to assess whether embryos collected by filtration exhibit a similar response to an anthelmintic drug as the embryos collected by bleach synchronization. We exposed six C. elegans strains to albendazole, a benzimidazole drug used to treat parasitic nematode infections in veterinary animals and humans [24–26]. Benzimidazole drugs act by inhibiting the formation of microtubules, which slows the development of C. elegans and can be measured by differences in body length as we have done previously [3,5,27,28]. Animal length was measured as an indicator of developmental rate. As we have shown previously [3,17], anthelmintics delay or stop development. Because C. elegans grows longer as it proceeds through development and ABZ slows development, length is a quantitative measure of the effects of drugs. C. elegans strains sensitive to albendazole display a shorter body length compared to the resistant strains when exposed to the drug during development [3,17]. Natural variation in C. elegans response to albendazole has been observed [17]. Of the six strains that we selected, four were sensitive and two were resistant to albendazole [17]. We determined if the results could be replicated using embryos prepared using filtration. For all six strains, the normalized animal lengths for larvae that developed from G1 embryos collected by filtration were similar or significantly longer to the normalized animal lengths for larvae that developed from G1 embryos recovered by bleach synchronization for both the control (DMSO exposed) and albendazole-exposed conditions (Fig 7). Additionally, the sensitivity of the strains to the drug remained consistent between the bleach and filtration methods. Specifically, the CB4856, ECA36, JU775, and N2 strains were sensitive to the drug using both bleach and filtration methods (S3 Fig). Fig 7. G1 embryos collected by filtration developed similarly to the G1 embryos obtained by bleach synchronization when exposed to an anthelmintic compound. Open in a new tab Box plots showing normalized animal length for larvae developed from G1 embryos obtained by bleach synchronization or filtration protocols for six C. elegans strains. Median animal lengths of strains exposed to 30 μM albendazole were normalized to the mean of all median animal lengths for the control condition. The median is represented by the solid horizontal line with the 75th and 25th quartiles on the top and bottom of each box, respectively. Whiskers extend from each box to the maximum and minimum values that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range above and below the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. Each point is the summarized measurement of an individual well containing between five and 30 animals. The box plot is faceted by condition (control and drug). The normalized animal length of larvae that developed from G1 embryos collected by filtration is comparable or significantly longer compared to the normalized animal lengths of larvae that developed from G1 embryos collected by bleach, as indicated by the p-values (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) in each facet. The grey background color emphasizes the strains that are sensitive to ABZ. The assay was replicated three times, as indicated by the colors of the points.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusion Bleach synchronization has been routinely used to obtain a synchronized population of embryos. However, because of the harsh chemical nature of bleach, many parameters need to be carefully controlled to ensure the maximum survival of embryos [2]. By contrast, filtration takes advantage of the size differences among developmental stages, allowing the separation of embryos with minimal exposure to chemical stress. We have demonstrated that filtration is a better alternative to bleaching to scale up preparations of staged C. elegans embryos in terms of embryonic yield per plate and with no deleterious effects on larval development. We optimized our pre-filtration conditions based on the C. elegans reference strain N2 and obtained the highest yield of G1 embryos by incubating 450 P0 embryos at 21.5°C for three days [29]. However, wild strains and mutants have different egg-laying rates and brood sizes, so the number of P0 embryos to start the assay might need to be adjusted for other strains. We tested two bacterial strains and found OP50 to be the stickiest to help retain the embryos. Other bacteria might be stickier and should be tested in the future. All our assays were done on 6 cm plates. Higher embryo yields can be obtained by using 10 cm or larger plates. We have applied our technique to harvest embryos from C. elegans. However, embryos from other Caenorhabditis species that have similar dimensions to C. elegans (e.g., C. briggsae) can also be isolated. Additionally, the technique could also be adapted to isolate embryos with smaller or larger dimensions by altering the mesh sizes. In summary, our technique provides a robust way of collecting large numbers of C. elegans embryos with high purity without the need to subject the animals to bleach.",

Copyright notice ID: 12021249 PMID: 40273127 Abstract The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been routinely used to study gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. Most experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific developmental stage. Bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the embryos. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices. Importantly, filtration has no deleterious effects on downstream larval development assays. In conclusion, we have exploited the differences in the sizes of C. elegans developmental stages to isolate embryo cultures suitable for use in high-throughput assays.Introduction Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis are an ideal system to study genes, genetic interactions, and evolutionary conserved signaling pathways. The most studied organism of this group is Caenorhabditis elegans, because of its short life cycle, hermaphroditic mating system, cost-effective cultivation, small size, transparency, small genome, and the simplicity of genetic modification and functional testing in a laboratory setting [1]. C. elegans develop through four morphologically distinct larval stages (L1 - L4), before progressing into adults. Most experiments require the nematodes to be at a specific developmental stage because of the distinct morphologies, behaviors, and gene expression patterns of each stage. High-throughput assays such as RNA sequencing, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), drug screens, proteomics, and behavioral assays require a large number of animals at a particular stage. The standard method of obtaining nematodes at a specific developmental stage is by collecting embryos and allowing them to hatch into L1 larvae that are arrested when starved. The synchronous population of L1 larvae is fed and then incubated at the desired temperature until the animals grow to the target developmental stage. Embryos are obtained from the uterus of gravid adults by dissolving the hypodermis using a hypochlorite (bleach) solution (Fig 1). However, different parameters such as the bleaching time and temperature of the bleach solution affect the survival of the embryos [2]. To control for the variability in the numbers of viable, unaffected animals after bleach synchronization, three independent replicates are typically performed for high-throughput assays, making the process time-consuming [3–5]. Fig 1. Comparison of bleach and filtration techniques to collect embryos. Open in a new tab Bleach synchronization involves dissolving the hypodermis of gravid adults and releasing the embryos. Filtration involves using size-specific filters to separate the embryos from the adults. The figure was created using BioRender.To overcome the limitations of bleach synchronization, microfluidic devices can sort animals based on the size differences of each developmental stage [6,7]. Such devices enable precise control of parameters such as liquid flow, pressure, and temperature enabling effective sorting [8]. However, the major drawbacks of such devices are their high cost, lack of scalability to many independent strains, and the requirement to build them, making them inaccessible to many groups. Mesh filters of different sizes are a cheaper alternative to microfluidic devices. Separation of C. elegans stages by size has been done using filters of different mesh sizes that allow specific stages to pass through and some stages to be retained on top of the mesh (Fig 1), [9]. Filters with different pore sizes are commercially available. For example, Wilson sieves of 5 µm mesh size were used to separate L1 or L2 populations [10], plate-based nylon mesh filters of 11 µm from Millipore MultiScreen were used to purify the L1 stage [11], pluriSelect filters were used to isolate L4 and young adult stages of C. elegans [9], mesh filters have also been used to separate males from hermaphrodites [12], and in-house filters were also constructed with 50 mL conical tubes and monofilament mesh of the required pore size to recover the L4 stage (on 20 µm filters) and day-one adults (on 50 µm filters) [13]. The examples highlight using mesh filters to isolate specific developmental stages of C. elegans. However, these other size filtration methods are less efficient when scaling beyond one or a small number of strains. Additionally, the small differences in length and width between consecutive larval stages make it difficult to get a 100% pure culture of a specific stage. For example, the difference in width between the L1 and L2 stages, and L2 and L3 stages is approximately 5.3 µm and 5.1 µm respectively (approximate widths of L1, L2, L3, and L4 larvae are 11.7 µm, 17 µm, 22.1 µm, and 29.5 µm, respectively) [6]. In contrast, the dimensions of the embryos (50 µm in length and 30 µm in diameter) make it easier to separate from other developmental stages [14]. Once isolated, the embryos can be cultured to obtain a synchronous population of L1 larvae that can be grown to a synchronized stage-specific population. We used filters from pluriSelect to specifically isolate embryos that were laid on an OP50-seeded plate. Based on the widths of the different developmental stages, we conducted sequential filtration using filters of two mesh sizes, 40 µm and 20 µm. The 40 µm filter retained adults and debris. The embryos and larval stages, which are smaller in width, passed through the 40 µm mesh and were collected on the 20 µm mesh. The 20 µm mesh further allowed the smaller larval stages to pass through and the embryos to be retained. Using our technique, we recovered approximately 9,500 embryos from one 6 cm OP50-seeded plate, compared to approximately 5,000 embryos by bleach synchronization, using the C. elegans N2 laboratory-adapted strain. To further increase the embryo yield per plate, we incorporated polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the M9 buffer (3% w/v) changing the osmolarity and improving embryo pelleting by three-fold. PEG has been used previously in M9 buffers without adverse effects on C. elegans [15]. Additionally, PEG has been employed for the encapsulation of various organisms, including C. elegans, with no harmful side effects [16]. We further showed that the embryos obtained by filtration developed into healthier larvae compared to the larvae obtained by bleach synchronization. Furthermore, we found similar or longer (indicating less of an effect) animal lengths after 48 hours of growth from the L1 stage when embryos were collected using filtration compared to bleach and exposed to albendazole, an anthelmintic compound known to inhibit animal development [17]. In summary, we have developed a protocol to obtain synchronized embryos that improves upon the traditional method of bleach synchronization.Materials and methods Nematode culture maintenance The strains used for the assays were N2, CB4856, CX11271, ECA36, JU775, and MY16. All strains were from the Caenorhabditis Natural Diversity Resource (CaeNDR) [18]. Animals were maintained at 20°C for three generations before starting any assay. Modified nematode growth medium (NGMA), which consists of 1% agar and 0.7% agarose was used to grow the strains on 6 cm plates [19]. Escherichia coli strains OP50 and HB101 were used as food sources.Conical bleach (bleach synchronization) to obtain embryos Five L4-staged hermaphrodites were transferred to a 6 cm OP50-seeded plate and incubated at 21.5°C for four days. On the fourth day, the animals were washed with M9 buffer (3 g of KH2PO4, 6 g of Na2HPO4, and 5 g of NaCl in 1 L Milli-Q water), collected in a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and pelleted by centrifuging at 254 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute. The supernatant was discarded and 6 mL of bleach solution (2 mL of NaOCl and 0.2 g of NaOH in 10 mL Milli-Q water) was added. The tubes were shaken vigorously for four minutes to dissolve the hypodermis. As soon as broken animal bodies were observed under the microscope, the tubes were centrifuged at 254 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for 30 seconds. The supernatant was discarded and approximately 10 mL of M9 buffer was added to the tube and centrifuged at 254 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute. The supernatant was discarded and approximately 10 mL of K medium (51 mM NaCl, 32 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl2, and 3 mM MgSO4 in Milli-Q water) was added to the tube and centrifuged at 254 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute. After the final wash, the embryo pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of K medium. The embryo titer was determined by counting the number of embryos in five replicates of 3 µL aliquots.Optimization of pre-filtration conditions Our aim was to harvest laid embryos from a 6 cm bacteria-seeded plate. We began this process by plating a fixed number of embryos (P0) to ensure that they would develop and lay embryos (G1), which could be collected for filtration without the next generation exhausting the bacterial food (strain OP50) on the plate. P0 embryos were obtained by bleaching day-one gravid hermaphrodites. The embryo titer was determined by counting the number of embryos in five replicates of 3 µL aliquots. Different numbers of P0 embryos (250, 300, 400, 450, and 500) were added to 6 cm OP50-seeded plates. After incubating the plates at 21.5°C for three days, we observed that adding 450 P0 embryos yielded the highest number of G1 embryos without food exhaustion. We used 450 P0 embryos for all subsequent assays. Next, we sought to determine which E. coli bacterial strain enabled most of the G1 embryos to remain stuck after P0 adults were washed away using M9 buffer. We tested two different E. coli bacterial strains - OP50 and HB101 by plating 450 P0 embryos onto 6 cm plates seeded with one of the two bacteria strains grown at 21.5°C for three days, after which M9 buffer was added to the plates to wash away the adults. Most G1 embryos were washed away along with the P0 adults from HB101-seeded plates (S1A and B Figs). In contrast, most of the G1 embryos were retained on the plate seeded with OP50 (S1C and D Figs). Based on the results, OP50-seeded plates were used for all subsequent assays. In summary, we optimized the pre-filtration conditions by using OP50 as the bacterial food and plating 450 P0 embryos for maximum G1 embryo yield from one 6 cm OP50-seeded plate. This procedure can be optimised using different numbers of P0 embryos if smaller or larger NGMA plates are needed.Filtration to obtain embryos We followed the protocol that we previously published on protocols.io. (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.e6nvwbb29vmk/v1) with one modification. The protocol uses two 40 µm filters, and we used one 40 µm filter. The filters and supplementary materials were purchased from pluriSelect, U.S.A. A connector ring (SKU 41–50000) was attached to a 50 mL conical tube. Above the connector ring, a filter stack consisting of a 20 µm filter (green color) (SKU 43–50020) at the bottom and a 40 µm filter (blue color) (SKU 43–50040) at the top was added. A funnel (SKU 42–50000) was attached to the 40 µm filter (Fig 2). Fig 2. Set up of filtration apparatus. Open in a new tab (1) A funnel is used to pour the embryo solution. (2) 40 µm mesh filter to retain adults. (3) 20 µm mesh filter to retain embryos. (4) Connector ring to connect to a vacuum to allow the embryo solution to pass through. (5) A collection tube is used to collect the flow through, which consists of the majority of larvae.P0 embryos were collected using the conical bleach protocol (refer to Conical bleach to obtain embryos above). After obtaining an average embryo count, the volume of resuspension solution containing 450 P0 embryos was added to 6 cm OP50-seeded plates and incubated at 21.5°C for three days. After three days, the P0 adults were washed from the plates by adding 2 mL M9 buffer, gently swirling the plates, and discarding the solution (Fig 3A). The step was repeated once more. The step ensured that most of the P0 adults and G1 larvae stuck to the OP50 bacteria were washed away (Fig 3B). The G1 embryos retained on the OP50 bacteria lawn were collected by adding 2 mL M9 buffer and gently scraping off the embryos using a rubber policeman (Fig 3C). The M9 buffer containing the G1 embryos was collected in a 15 mL centrifuge tube and passed through the filtration apparatus. Fig 3. Collection of embryos for filtration. Open in a new tab (A) A 6 cm OP50-seeded plate with P0 adults and G1 embryos. (B) A 6 cm OP50-seeded plate after the P0 adults have been washed away with M9 buffer. (C) An OP50-seeded plate after the G1 embryos have been scraped off in M9 buffer with a rubber policeman. The figure was created using BioRender.The 15 mL tube containing G1 embryos in M9 buffer was inverted 5–6 times to ensure that the embryos were in suspension and added to the funnel of the filtration apparatus (Figs 3C and 4). The connector ring was opened and connected to a vacuum to help the embryo solution pass through the filters. Once all the solution had passed through the filters, the filtration apparatus was disassembled by removing the funnel, connector ring, and 40 µm filter. The 40 µm filter retained the P0 adults and debris, and the G1 embryos and larval stages passed through the filter. The 20 µm filter retained the G1 embryos and a few larvae, while most of the larvae passed through the filter. The 20 µm filter, containing most of the G1 embryos and a few larvae was inverted and added on top of a clean, labeled 50 mL conical tube. The top of the 20 µm filter now faced the inside of the conical tube (Fig 4). 4 mL of 25% bleach solution (1 mL of bleach solution + 3 mL of M9 buffer) was added to the reversed side of the 20 µm filter and incubated for 30 seconds. The addition of 25% bleach killed the few G1 larvae that were retained on the 20 µm filter. After 30 seconds, 6 mL of 3% PEG (PEG3350) (Millipore sigma, Catalog # P4338) in M9 buffer (3 g of PEG in 100 mL of M9 buffer) was added to the filter. After the solution had passed through the filter, the contents of the 50 mL conical tube were transferred to a clean 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 3197 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute. The supernatant was discarded and approximately 10 mL of 3% PEG in M9 buffer was added. The tube was centrifuged at 3197 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute and the supernatant was discarded. The wash step was repeated once more. After the final wash, the embryos were resuspended in 3 mL of K medium. G1 embryo titer was determined by counting the number of embryos in five 3 µL aliquots. Fig 4. Set up of the filtration apparatus. Open in a new tab (1) The G1 embryo solution collected in Fig 3C was poured through the filtration apparatus. (2) The connector ring was connected to a vacuum to allow the solution to pass. (3) After the solution had passed, the filtration apparatus was disassembled. (4) The 20 µm filter was inverted and placed on top of a clean 50 mL labeled tube. (5) A 25% bleach solution was added to the inverted 20 µm filter for 30 seconds to kill any G1 larvae. The figure was created using BioRender.Albendazole (ABZ) stock preparation Albendazole (Source: Fulka; CAS number: 54965-21-8; Catalog number: A4673-10G) was prepared at a stock concentration of 100 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and aliquoted in microcentrifuge tubes in 50 µL aliquots that were stored at −20°C. The aliquots were thawed on the day of the assay and discarded after use.High-throughput phenotyping assay (HTA) HTA was carried out as described previously [3]. For the developmental analysis, three independent replicates were performed by three experimentalists. For the drug response assay, three independent replicates were performed by one experimentalist. After letting the strains grow for three generations to account for the starvation effects, conical bleach and filtration were carried out to obtain embryos. The embryos were resuspended in K medium to a final concentration of 0.6 embryos per μL, and 50 μL of the embryo solution (containing 30 embryos) was added into each well of a 96-well plate [20]. For developmental analysis, 36 wells were prepared for embryos obtained by each protocol (conical bleach and filtration) and by each experimentalist. For the drug assay, 64 wells were prepared for embryos obtained by each protocol (conical bleach and filtration) for all strains. The embryos were incubated at 20°C overnight in K medium with no food and with shaking at 180 rpm to get a synchronized L1 population. The following day, frozen HB101 aliquots at OD600 100 were thawed and diluted to OD600 30 using K medium. HB101 at a concentration of OD600 100 was prepared as previously described [5]. 150 μM kanamycin was added to prevent bacterial growth and contamination. For the developmental assay, all 36 wells were treated with control (1% DMSO). For the drug assay, half the wells (32 wells) were treated with 1% DMSO, and the other half were treated with 30 μM albendazole in 1% DMSO. The L1 larvae were allowed to grow for 48 hours at 20°C with shaking at 180 rpm. After 48 hours, the 96-well plates were exposed to 50 mM sodium azide in M9 buffer for 10 minutes to straighten and paralyze the animals. Images of each plate were captured using a 2X objective in a Molecular Devices ImageXpress Nano microscope (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) [3]. The images were further processed using the CellProfiler, easyXpress, and R Studio pipelines (see Data processing and analysis in the methods section) to quantify the development of the animals.Data processing and analysis The raw images were processed using the CellProfiler software (version 4.2.8). The GitHub repository for the pipeline can be found at (https://github.com/AndersenLab/cellprofiler-nf). The software uses four worm models to extract animal measurements - three of which are designed for the larval stages (L1, L2-L3, and L4) and a “multi-drug high dose” (MDHD) to identify animals with abnormal length caused by extreme drug responses. Next, the processed images generated by CellProfiler were cleaned and further processed using the custom R package easyXpress as previously described [3,21]. R Studio (version 4.2.1) was used to perform all statistical analysis and figure generation. For developmental analysis, median animal lengths were calculated for each well. For each strain in the drug assay, the median animal length after exposure to ABZ for 48 hours was normalized to the control (DMSO-exposed wells). We normalized animal lengths to understand the effect of the drug independent of the differences in the growth in control conditions. A normalized animal length value of the drug condition close to the control condition value corresponds to resistance to the drug, and a negative value corresponds to sensitivity to the drug [3,5,22,23].Results and discussion One of the major challenges of conducting high-throughput C. elegans assays is collecting a large number of embryos. Traditionally, bleach synchronization has been used to harvest embryos. However, the process is time-consuming and introduces high variability [3–5]. To overcome the challenges of bleach synchronization, we demonstrated the use of commercially available mesh filters to collect a large number of embryos with high purity. We set up the filtration apparatus as shown (Fig 2). Briefly, a connector ring was attached to a 50 mL conical tube. A 20 µm filter (green color) was attached on top of the connector ring. A 40 µm filter (blue color) was added on top of the 20 µm filter. A funnel was attached to the 40 µm filter. Optimization of filtration conditions The G1 offspring recovered from the 20 µM mesh filter were 94–100% (data collected from up to 50 filtrations) embryos with rare L1 larvae contaminants. To get 100% G1 embryo cultures, we sought to kill the L1 larvae by exposing the recovered mixed-stage population to a bleach solution. We optimized the bleach concentration and exposure time so that it was sufficient to kill the larvae without any damaging effects on the G1 embryos. We tested three different concentrations of bleach solution (10%, 20%, and 25% in M9 buffer) with varying exposure times (30, 60, 120, and 150 seconds) to identify the optimal condition that killed the larvae (identified by lack of movement) with minimal impact on embryos. Treating the recovered population with 25% bleach solution for 30 seconds killed the larvae with minimal impact on embryonic lethality as measured after 24 hours of recovery (S1 Table). For our initial experiments, we used M9 buffer as the wash solution for all subsequent washes. However, embryos might be lost during each M9 buffer wash. To reduce the potential for loss, we altered the osmolarity of the M9 buffer using PEG. We used PEG at four different concentrations (0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% w/v) in M9 buffer and obtained the highest yield with 3% PEG. Consequently, we used 3% PEG in M9 buffer for all subsequent washes. We recovered two times more embryos from a single 6 cm OP50-seeded plate when 3% PEG was incorporated with M9 buffer in the wash solution (average embryo yield was 12,539 ± 5,727 SD with 3% PEG in M9 buffer compared to an average embryonic yield of 6,821 ± 5,364 SD with M9 buffer) (S2A Fig). To ensure that PEG did not affect the hatching of embryos, we assessed the embryonic lethality after 24 hours. The average embryonic lethality of embryos that were washed with 3% PEG was similar to the embryonic lethality of embryos that were washed with M9 buffer (4.5% for 3% PEG in M9 buffer and 3.8% for M9), indicating that the use of PEG does not damage the embryos (S2B Fig).Filtration yields a higher number of embryos compared to bleach synchronization To determine the efficacy of embryo filtration, we collected embryos using bleach synchronization and filtration techniques in parallel. We used the same number of 6 cm OP50-seeded plates that had an equivalent number of P0 adults. We recovered an average of 4,946 (SD ± 3360) G1 embryos by bleach synchronization, compared to an average of 9,474 (SD ± 6764) G1 embryos by filtration (Fig 5). To account for variability that might be introduced by different experimentalists performing the protocols, we employed three experimentalists to conduct the filtration and bleach protocols to collect the G1 embryos. We did not find a significant difference between any two experimentalists for either of the two protocols (p = 0.217 for the bleach synchronization protocol, and p = 0.706 for the filtration protocol, Kruskall-Wallis rank-sum test). Fig 5. A higher number of G1 embryos were recovered from filtration than by bleach synchronization. Open in a new tab Box plot showing G1 embryonic yield per plate obtained by bleach synchronization or filtration protocols. The median is represented by the solid horizontal line with the 75th and 25th quartiles on the top and bottom of the box, respectively. Whiskers extend from the box to the maximum and minimum values that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range above and below the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. The three different colors of the points indicate three experimentalists. A significantly higher number of G1 embryos were collected by filtration (p = 0.00064, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Eight replicates were tested by each experimentalist for each method.Embryos obtained by filtration develop comparably to the embryos obtained by bleach synchronization We aimed to understand differences in the development of G1 embryos collected by bleach and filtration protocols, so we harvested embryos using bleach synchronization and filtration protocols in parallel and measured the lengths of the animals after 48 hours of growth using a liquid-based larval development assay [3,5,22,23]. We used length as an indicator of development because nematodes get longer as they proceed through development. The G1 embryos obtained by filtration grew to longer animals compared to the lengths of animals that developed from G1 embryos collected by bleaching (p = 0.0025; Wilcoxon test), indicating that filtration is healthier compared to bleaching (Fig 6). We conducted a Kruskall-Wallis test to assess the variance explained by the different replicates. A p-value of 2 × 10-16 indicated a large difference in the variance between replicates. Fig 6. Embryos obtained by filtration developed comparably to the embryos obtained by bleach. Open in a new tab The box plot shows the length of L4 animals that developed from G1 embryos collected by bleach or filtration protocols. Median is represented by the solid horizontal line with the 75th and 25th quartiles on the top and bottom of the box, respectively. Whiskers extend from the box to the maximum and minimum values that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range above and below the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. Each point is the summarized measurement of an individual well containing between five and 30 animals. G1 embryos collected by filtration grew into animals with longer lengths compared to lengths of animals that developed from G1 embryos collected using bleach synchronization (p = 0.0025; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The assay was carried out in three replicates independently by three experimentalists (represented by the three different colored points).G1 embryos collected by filtration develop similarly to the G1 embryos obtained by bleach synchronization when exposed to an anthelmintic compound We aimed to assess whether embryos collected by filtration exhibit a similar response to an anthelmintic drug as the embryos collected by bleach synchronization. We exposed six C. elegans strains to albendazole, a benzimidazole drug used to treat parasitic nematode infections in veterinary animals and humans [24–26]. Benzimidazole drugs act by inhibiting the formation of microtubules, which slows the development of C. elegans and can be measured by differences in body length as we have done previously [3,5,27,28]. Animal length was measured as an indicator of developmental rate. As we have shown previously [3,17], anthelmintics delay or stop development. Because C. elegans grows longer as it proceeds through development and ABZ slows development, length is a quantitative measure of the effects of drugs. C. elegans strains sensitive to albendazole display a shorter body length compared to the resistant strains when exposed to the drug during development [3,17]. Natural variation in C. elegans response to albendazole has been observed [17]. Of the six strains that we selected, four were sensitive and two were resistant to albendazole [17]. We determined if the results could be replicated using embryos prepared using filtration. For all six strains, the normalized animal lengths for larvae that developed from G1 embryos collected by filtration were similar or significantly longer to the normalized animal lengths for larvae that developed from G1 embryos recovered by bleach synchronization for both the control (DMSO exposed) and albendazole-exposed conditions (Fig 7). Additionally, the sensitivity of the strains to the drug remained consistent between the bleach and filtration methods. Specifically, the CB4856, ECA36, JU775, and N2 strains were sensitive to the drug using both bleach and filtration methods (S3 Fig). Fig 7.

Median animal lengths of strains exposed to 30 μM albendazole were normalized to the mean of all median animal lengths for the control condition. The median is represented by the solid horizontal line with the 75th and 25th quartiles on the top and bottom of each box, respectively. Whiskers extend from each box to the maximum and minimum values that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range above and below the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. Each point is the summarized measurement of an individual well containing between five and 30 animals. The box plot is faceted by condition (control and drug). The normalized animal length of larvae that developed from G1 embryos collected by filtration is comparable or significantly longer compared to the normalized animal lengths of larvae that developed from G1 embryos collected by bleach, as indicated by the p-values (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) in each facet. The grey background color emphasizes the strains that are sensitive to ABZ. The assay was replicated three times, as indicated by the colors of the points.Conclusion Bleach synchronization has been routinely used to obtain a synchronized population of embryos. However, because of the harsh chemical nature of bleach, many parameters need to be carefully controlled to ensure the maximum survival of embryos [2]. By contrast, filtration takes advantage of the size differences among developmental stages, allowing the separation of embryos with minimal exposure to chemical stress. We have demonstrated that filtration is a better alternative to bleaching to scale up preparations of staged C. elegans embryos in terms of embryonic yield per plate and with no deleterious effects on larval development. We optimized our pre-filtration conditions based on the C. elegans reference strain N2 and obtained the highest yield of G1 embryos by incubating 450 P0 embryos at 21.5°C for three days [29]. However, wild strains and mutants have different egg-laying rates and brood sizes, so the number of P0 embryos to start the assay might need to be adjusted for other strains. We tested two bacterial strains and found OP50 to be the stickiest to help retain the embryos. Other bacteria might be stickier and should be tested in the future. All our assays were done on 6 cm plates. Higher embryo yields can be obtained by using 10 cm or larger plates. We have applied our technique to harvest embryos from C. elegans. However, embryos from other Caenorhabditis species that have similar dimensions to C. elegans (e.g., C. briggsae) can also be isolated. Additionally, the technique could also be adapted to isolate embryos with smaller or larger dimensions by altering the mesh sizes. In summary, our technique provides a robust way of collecting large numbers of C. elegans embryos with high purity without the need to subject the animals to bleach.Supporting information S1 Fig. OP50-seeded plates retained most of the G1 embryos after a wash with M9 buffer to remove P0 adults.(A) A 6 cm HB101-seeded plate before washing with M9 buffer.

    "abstract": "Abstract Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model C. elegans is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have not been recapitulated in the C. elegans model since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement that we call ‘NemaFlex’, based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength in C. elegans. Additionally, we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.",
    "introduction": "I. Introduction Skeletal muscle provides the contractile system critical for animal locomotion across phyla. The conserved biology of muscle includes sarcomere composition and organization, the calcium-initiated contractile mechanism, and the ATP-driven translocation of actin and myosin for force generation1, 2. A powerful indicator of muscle health is strength —a measure of maximum force that can be voluntarily exerted for a given task. Diagnosis of muscle degenerative disorders such as muscular dystrophy relies on strength and physical performance tests in the clinic3, 4. Similar diagnostic evaluation is crucial for, sarcopenia and dynapenia, the age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and muscle strength, respectively5, 6. Additionally, muscle atrophy and strength declines are a major impediment for manned deep space exploration7. Given conservation of basic muscle biology, simple genetic models such as Drosophila melanogaster8 and the 959-celled Caenorhabditis elegans9, 10 constitute attractive platforms with which to decipher the molecular mechanisms of age-10,11, disease-12, or microgravity-13 associated muscle decline. For example, studies in C. elegans have led to important new insights into the assembly, maintenance, and regulation of striated muscle10, 14–16, with the loss-of-function mutants in sarcomeric proteins showing reduced capacity to swim or crawl17–19. These model organisms also offer a powerful means with which to investigate how diet, exercise protocols, and drug interventions may combat muscle dysfunction. Still, the notion of muscle strength and its measurement in these simple models has remained elusive. A technical challenge in reporting muscle strength in invertebrate models is that its definition crucially depends on system geometry and measurement protocol. As a result, even though forces on the order of microNewtons have been reported to be exerted by C. elegans20–26; the approaches used yield different values of forces due to worm locomotion, body posture, and behavior. Without a measurement protocol that is reproducible and system geometry that is validated, fluctuating forces cannot be used to extract a meaningful metric for strength. Additionally, the influence of animal size on force production has not been established, even though it is well recognized that animals from the same culture as well as mutants can have different body sizes. Thus, force measures that reveal muscular strength independent of animal behavior and approaches to compensate forces for variations in animal size, have not been established in the C. elegans model. In humans, precisely defined strength metrics such as maximum voluntary force (MVF) and one repetition maximum (1RM) are absolutely essential to quantitate and compare subjects, which constitutes the clinical basis of muscle physiology investigations27 (Fig. 1a). Here, MVF is defined as the peak force recorded for a particular set of muscle (leg extensor, elbow extensor etc.) during one trial28, 29, and 1RM is defined as the maximum weight that a person can lift for one repetition30. It is imperative to recapitulate analogous metrics and standardize them in the C. elegans model for the field to move forward with genetic studies on problems ranging from Duchenne muscular dystrophy to muscle wasting due to aging to metabolic disorders. Figure 1. Muscle strength measurement in humans and the NemaFlex system for force measurement in C. elegans. Open in a new tab (a) Human muscle function is measured in terms of maximum voluntary force (MVF) during a standardized knee extensor test, where the peak force exerted by the quadriceps muscle is recorded using a force sensor.

The pillar is deflected due to the action of the body wall muscles (shown in red and green). Parameters defined in Eqn. (1) are shown with actual values being a = 38.3 ± 0.4, h = 71.8 ± 2.9, c = 27.6 ± 2.9 and D = 50 -70 μm (for WT, age = 60 – 84 hrs). Here we define a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement in nematodes by pillar deflection that we call “NemaFlex” (Fig. 1b-d). We study the effects of micropillar forest design and animal behavior to identify robust measurement conditions that define maximum exertable force (MEF) as a measure that is reproducible and insensitive to animal locomotion and behavior. Our force-velocity analysis in animals experiencing different confinements and validation studies using a muscle contracting agent mutants indeed show that MEF is analogous to MVF measured in humans. We also report a scaling factor to correct MEF for animal size, thus establishing NemaFlex as a quantitative and reproducible system for measurement of muscle strength among individual worms, mutants, and/or prospectively in an individual worm with age or experimental intervention. Our findings establish the means to exploit drug, genetic, and experiential outcomes that may define molecular and cellular circuits of muscle use and maintenance, which in turn might inspire therapies for extended muscle healthspan.",

    "results": "III. Results and Discussion Basic principle of NemaFlex and force analysis At the core of the NemaFlex technology is a liquid-filled microfluidic chamber containing elastic micropillars dangling from the chamber roof that can be deformed by a nematode push (Fig. 1c, d). As C. elegans threads through the pillars, the individual pillar deflections Δ are quantified using a microscope-camera system and image analysis (see Supplementary Movie 2). The force F causing the observed pillar deflection is calculated using the Timoshenko theory for an elastic rod22, 34, F=Δ(l33EI+a2(1+γ)l4EI+l2(h−l)2EI) (1) In Eqn. (1), a, h, and I are the diameter, height, and moment of inertia of the cylindrical pillar respectively. E and γ are the elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillar respectively. The point of contact of the worm with the pillar edge is denoted by l = h – (D-c)/2, which is calculated knowing the worm diameter D at mid-length and the clearance c between the pillar edge and the bottom surface of the chamber. The values used for the different parameters in Eqn. (1) as well as its validity for force measurement are discussed in Supplementary Note 2. In general, we find that the magnitude of the pillar forces depends on the contact point along the nematode body, body configuration, and behavioral characteristics of C. elegans. Given this probabilistic nature of pillar forces exerted by the worm, we sought to establish a robust and reproducible procedure for quantifying animal strength. Fig. 4a-d shows this procedure in which we typically record a 30 second behavioral episode per animal. In every image of the acquired video, we identify the pillar with the maximal deflection (labeled red in Fig. 4a among all the candidate pillars), allowing us to extract an instantaneous maximal force value from each frame (Fig. 4b). We bin all the instantaneous maximal force values and generate a cumulative force distribution curve that defines a probability for exerting a maximal force lower than or equal to a given value (Fig. 4c). From this distribution, we define the maximal force corresponding to 95% cumulative probability, f95, as the maximum exertable force (MEF) of C. elegans (Fig. 4d). Our error in force detection, measured from pillars that are not in animal contact, is markedly lower than the maximal forces exerted by the nematode (Fig. 4b), with a cumulative measurement error of 2.5 μN in the f95 value (c.f. Fig. 3). Figure 4. Data analysis workflow for NemaFlex strength measurement. Open in a new tab (a) Stack of images showing the worm interacting with different pillars during a locomotory episode. The deflected pillars are circled in blue, and the red circle denotes the pillar that experiences the maximum force. Scale bar, 200 μm. (b) Variation of maximal force over time due to a worm interacting with pillars (in red). The black curve shows force variation from the pillars that are not in contact with the worm – giving an estimate of error in our force measurement. (c) Cumulative probability distribution curves of maximal forces for different worms (age = 60 hrs) showing the variability between individuals (n = 14). The red trace represents the cumulative force distribution curve for the population. (d) From the cumulative force distribution curve, the maximum exertable force, f95, is defined as the maximal force at 95% cumulative probability.Our approach allows defining the MEF at the level of an individual or a population, depending on whether the data constitute maximal forces from a single worm or a collection of worms. The cumulative force distribution curve for individuals typically consists of 200 data points, and for a population at least 2000. Fig. 4c shows the cumulative force distribution curve for wild-type (WT, age = 60 hrs) individuals. We find variability in the f95 values between individuals suggesting that some animals are naturally stronger than others, even though their body diameters are very similar (5% variation of mean body diameter). Resistance to locomotion in the pillar arena determines maximal forces The purpose of our study is to establish a reliable measure for C. elegans strength that is equivalent to maximum voluntary force in humans. To achieve this, we sought to identify micropillar forest designs that create high mechanical resistance to locomotion. Analogous to human strength evaluation where strong forces are registered when resistance to motion is high (c.f. Fig. 1a), we expect that animals in tight pillar arenas experience strong resistance to locomotion and produce large forces. Below we show results supporting that animals produce strong forces in highly resistive arenas and discuss the existence of different regimes of resistance to locomotion based on the size of nematode relative to gap between pillars. Highly resistive pillar environment is characterized by low velocity and strong forces To identify an arena geometry that induces high resistance to locomotion and makes C. elegans produce maximal forces frequently we fabricated a composite arena (Fig. 5a) that contained three regions (A1, A2, and A3) with distinct pillar diameters (in the range of a ≈ 40 – 60 μm) and gap between pillars (s ≈ 100 – 60 μm) (Supplementary Note 3). Regions A1, A2 and A3 produced confinement levels of D/s ≈ 0.67, 0.85, and 1.16 for wild type adults respectively (Fig. 5b). The composite arena is unique as it allowed us to investigate the dependence of force-velocity correlation and gait parameters on animal confinement. Figure 5.

The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours.Pooling data from individuals (WT, age = 84 hrs), in Fig. 5c-e we show the maximal pillar force (from each image) versus the instantaneous animal velocity in the three arenas. We observe that in the moderately confined A1 arena, animals move at velocities as large as 600 μm/s and rarely exert forces more than 80 μN (Fig. 5c). In contrast, animals in the strongly confining A3 arena move at much slower velocities and often exert forces > 80 μN (Fig. 5e). Such large forces occur less frequently in arena A2 (Fig. 5d). Scoring the forward crawling locomotion, we find that between A1 and A3 arenas, the body wavelength reduces by 12% and amplitude varies by 3%, suggesting that in the moderate-strong confinement regime the force-velocity correlation is much more strongly affected than the forward crawling gait. Frequent exertion of maximal forces in A3 arena can be understood from the high mechanical resistance to locomotion provided by this tight pillar arena where the nematode muscles push against the pillar, but its body cannot adjust its position in response to reaction forces due to the body being constrained simultaneously by multiple pillars. Evidence for the strong mechanical resistance is exemplified by the high frequency of turns and reversals in the highly resistive A3 and A2 arenas compared to A1 (Fig. 6). Figure 6. Behavioral phenotyping of C. elegans in pillar arenas with different confinements. Open in a new tab The frequency of reversals and turns is higher under tighter confinement due to strong mechanical resistance of the pillar environment. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours.Identification of different regimes of resistance to locomotion Our experimental results thus far and previous work in pillar environments22–24, 35–38 (see Supplementary Table 2 for description of pillar geometries used in prior works), paint the following general picture; depending on the body size and pillar forest geometry, C. elegans locomotion between microfluidic pillars can be classified as non-resistive, moderately resistive or highly resistive. The existence of such regimes has been previously unrecognized. In the non-resistive regime, the submerged nematode is typically in contact with one or two pillars (Fig. 7a). The forces would be low here because the nematode translates and rotates in response to a body contact with a pillar, exhibiting swimming-like behavior. An example of this regime was shown by Majmudar et al., where for D/s = 0.17, nematode swim trajectories were observed to be diverted by mechanical interactions with the pillars38. Figure 7. Schematic illustrating the effect of animal confinement on mechanical resistance and force generation in pillar environments. Open in a new tab The nematode experiences increasing confinement (D/s) from left to right due to increasing density of pillars. (a) Weak resistance, D/s = 0.2, (b) moderate resistance, D/s = 0.6, and (c) strong resistance, D/s = 1.0. Large forces are expected under strong confinement due to enhanced mechanical resistance and constrained body shapes. The operating confinement regime of our NemaFlex system is highlighted.In the moderately resistive regime, frequent contacts with more than two pillars occur (Fig. 7b) and the body wave conveniently fits into the space between pillars; the velocity is high because pillars provide transverse resistance enabling efficient forward locomotion. Forces are moderate because the nematode can fit in the available space with only minor adjustment of body posture. This picture is consistent with our results in A1 arena and further supported by the work of Ryu and coworkers36 who showed that when D/s ≈ 0.35 – 0.5 C. elegans swimming speed is enhanced. In the highly-resistive regime which corresponds to our arenas A2 and A3, frequent contacts with multiple pillars occur (Fig. 7c). Animal velocity is low and forces are high because of the incompatibility between nematode gait and pillar configuration. Our observations are in agreement with the work by Johari et al. and Khare et al., who used arenas with D/s = 0.86 -1.6 and showed that animals exert strong forces23, 24. The existence of these regimes indicates that NemaFlex device needs to operate in the highly resistive regime to score MEF. However, even in this highly resistive regime, individual pillar forces fluctuate from low to high as evidenced by our cumulative force distribution curves, thus requiring robust measurement and data analysis protocols for standardized strength measurement. Previous works have been unable to establish behavior- and gait-independent measures of strength that are indicative of MVF in C. elegans. Maximum exertable force f95 is a reliable measure to score muscle strength in C. elegans In this section, we show that MEF, our proposed metric of C. elegans strength, yields consistent values in highly resistive pillar arenas and that it is independent of gait and behavior. By using a drug that contracts muscles we confirm that MEF due to induced muscle contractions is the same as that calculated from force distribution due to voluntary muscle action. Finally, we demonstrate that MEF can be used to reliably score neuromuscular weakness in mutants. Optimized pillar arena produces consistent readout of MEF Given that even in the highly resistive pillar environments forces fluctuate, we asked whether MEF for the same individual changes due to different degrees of confinement in A1, A2, and A3 arenas. Our hypothesis was that if MEF is truly indicative of the maximum voluntary force then in the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 we should obtain the same values for MEF. In Fig. 8a, we show the results for individual wild-type animals and find that the MEF in arenas A2 and A3 show a near-perfect correlation ( f95A2≅f95A3, calculated slope = 1.01 ± 0.05) while MEF is lower in A1 arena with a slope = 0.46 ± 0.07 shown in Fig. 8b. Thus f95 is consistent between the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas. Figure 8. Highly resistive pillar arenas produce consistent maximum exertable force. Open in a new tab A comparison between maximum exertable force f95 measured for WT individuals in (a) section A2 and section A3 (n = 14, slope = 1.01 ± 0.05, r2 = 0.65) and (b) in section A1 and section A3 (n=13, slope = 0.46 ± 0.07, r2 = -0.55). A similar comparison is shown for unc-112 animals (n=13 individuals) in (c) A2 and A3 (n = 12, slope 0.99 ± 0.04, r2 = 0.67) and (d) A1 and A3 (n= 10, slope = 0.81 ± 0.07, r2 = -0.25). Comparison for lon-2 animals (n=10 individuals) in (e) A2 and A3 (n=9, slope=0.98± 0.05, r2 = 0.72) and (f) A1 and A3 (n= 8, slope = 0.75 ± 0.07, r2 = 0.67). The red line is the best-fit curve to the data, and the dashed black line has a slope of unity and passes through origin. The blue lines demarcate the 95% confidence interval region.We also tested unc-112, a mutant that is weaker due to muscle defects26 and lon-2, a mutant that grows approximately 1.5 times longer than wild type. For unc-112, we find that the correlation of MEF values in arenas A1 and A3 is off from unity (slope = 0.81 ± 0.07), but in A2 and A3 we again observe a near-perfect correlation with slope 0.99 ± 0.04 (Fig. 8c, d). We find similar results for lon-2 which shows a correlation with slope 0.98 ± 0.05 in arenas A2 and A3 (Fig. 8e, f). Thus, in WT, unc-112 and lon-2 we obtain consistent f95 in the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas. Previously Johari et al.23 and Khare et al.24 computed the time-average of the pillar forces favg to characterize C. elegans muscle force. We checked to see how well this measure correlates from the force data of individuals in A1, A2 and A3 arenas. We find that favg from different arenas are inconsistent in WT animals and unc-112 mutant (see Supplementary Note 4), suggesting that f95 is a much more reliable metric of strength. Thus, our results from the composite arena provide compelling evidence that both the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 maximize force exertion, and our strength metric f95 is invariant for a given individual as long as animals are confined to 0.85 < D/s < 1.16. We settled on using A3 arena for the NemaFlex device since maximal forces are more frequent in this arena than A2 arena (Fig. 5d,e) and smaller body-sized animals fit better in A3. The actual dimensions of the NemaFlex device are: a = 38.3 μm ± 0.4 μm, s = 61.7 μm ± 2.9 μm, h =71.8 ± 2.9 μm, with the pillars arranged in a square lattice within a ≈ 1 cm2 oval shaped arena (Fig. 1b). It is possible that the limits of validity of confinement that we have established here to obtain consistent MEF readout may vary, for example for C. elegans of different sizes or mutants. In such cases, the composite-arena approach with individuals that we have demonstrated here is a useful means to identify the optimal confinement range for maximum force exertion.MEF is independent of locomotory gait To address whether the locomotory gait impacts MEF in the NemaFlex device we isolated episodes from our videos where the animal (WT, age = 60 hrs) was making a forward crawl or omega turn or reversal (Fig. 9a-d). We note that the forward crawl involved either a long-wave or a short-wave body posture with the short-wave being less frequent (Fig. 9a,b). The cumulative probability force distributions corresponding to each of these locomotory modes is shown in Fig. 9e. We find that the omega turns and reversals produce larger average force; however, the MEF estimates are very similar: f95 (long wave) = 20.98 μN, f95 (short wave) = 21.04 μN, f95 (reversal) = 22.38 μN, and f95 (omega) = 21.32 μN. Thus, the strength measure MEF provided by NemaFlex is not strongly dependent on animal gait. Figure 9. NemaFlex quantitates maximum exertable force independent of C. elegans gait. Open in a new tab (a) Images showing the different gaits exhibited by crawling WT C. elegans in the pillar arena of the NemaFlex device. The arrows show direction of the animal motion. (b) The cumulative force distribution for the different gaits shown in (a). The horizontal dashed line indicates 95% probability, and the vertical bar highlights that the f95 values for each gait are very similar. Animal age = 60 hrs and D/s = 0.87 – 0.98.MEF is insensitive to time-variation of behavior Next, we evaluated whether MEF is sensitive to time variation of behavior by recording behavioral episodes of individuals. In a 30-second behavioral episode we typically observed forward crawls, omega turns, and reversals (c.f. Fig. 6). We analyzed contiguous images of 30-second duration with a random starting point in the video. In complementary sampling, we scored non-repeating, discrete images randomly (totaling 30-second duration) from the full behavioral episode. The f95 of individuals calculated either from contiguous or random sampling of the behavior is shown in Fig. 10a,b. We find that in both contiguous and discrete sampling f95 typically varied by less than 10% of the mean value. This less than 10% variation is commensurate with the error in force measurement shown in Fig. 3 indicating therefore that MEF is insensitive to short-time variation in behavior. Figure 10. Maximum exertable force is independent of C. elegans behavior in the NemaFlex pillar arena. Open in a new tab (a) MEF of WT individuals obtained from analyzing contiguous frames of 30-second duration with a randomly sampled starting point in the movie (movie length is 85 – 120 seconds). Data is shown as mean ± SD from N = 5 sampling trials. 17 individuals showed SD < 10%, while three showed SD between 10 - 16%. (b) MEF values obtained from non-repeating randomly sampled discrete frames. The movie sets are the same as in (a). Data is shown as mean ± SD from N = 5 trials. In this case all 20 individuals showed SD < 10%. (c) MEF of individuals evaluated at three time points: 0, 2, and 2.5 hours. Here a 2-minute episode was captured for each worm and a contiguous 30-second episode was analyzed to obtain MEF. Animal age = 60 hrs and D/s = 0.85 – 0.95.We also sampled the behavior of an individual after a long time interval (0, 2, 2.5 hrs), and in this case the f95 values change by less than 10% between the three time points (Fig. 10c). Thus, the MEF is also unaffected by long-time variation in behavior. Together, these results suggest that sampling a 30-second behavioral episode is sufficient to determine the MEF of C. elegans and does not rely strongly on the details of behavior. We note that for some mutants it is possible that longer behavioral episodes may need to be tracked to achieve a statistically invariant MEF.MEF before and after drug-induced muscle contractions is the same As an important test to assess whether MEF measure corresponds to the maximum muscular strength, we induced muscle contractions by exposing each animal to the cholinergic agonist levamisole and comparing its f95 scores before and after drug treatment (Fig. 11a). Levamisole is known to bind to acetylcholine receptors in the body wall muscle of C. elegans, causing prolonged excitation of the muscles, shortening of body length, and eventually paralysis39. As shown in Fig. 11b, we indeed observe appreciable reduction in body length due to levamisole exposure (Supplementary Movie 4a & b). Figure 11. NemaFlex quantitates maximum muscular strength in C. elegans. Open in a new tab (a) A brief protocol for imaging and inducing muscle contraction on individual wild-type C. elegans with 1 mM levamisole. A 60-second episode is captured for each animal before levamisole treatment, and capturing continues for 60 to 200 seconds after the induction. (b) Levamisole treatment-induced muscle contraction causes the body length to decrease by 10.4 ± 3.2%. (age = 60 – 84 hrs, n=51, p < 0.0005). (c) Maximum strength of individual animals before and after the levamisole treatment for three different age groups – 60 hrs (n = 15), 76 hrs (n = 14) and 84 hrs (n = 20). The red line is a linear best fit of the pooled data: slope =1.09 +/− 0.06, intercept = -0.006, and r2 =0.89. Dashed blue lines show the 95% level confidence interval (n =49). The dashed black line represents f95lev+ = f95lev- (slope of 1 and intercept at origin). A two sample t-test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring the maximum muscular strength of the animal (p =0.24). For this data set, D/s = 0.95 - 1.02. (d) Comparison of population-level force distribution for wild type (n=20, N=3,475 data points) and three C. elegans muscular or neuromuscular mutants unc-52 (n=12, N=14,883 data points), unc-112 (n=5, N=2,992 data points), and unc-17 (n=20, N=6,997 data points). Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring neuromuscular weakness (p > 0.005). For this data set, D/s = 0.85 - 0.92.In Fig. 11c, we show the force data for individual animals of three different ages (60, 76, and 84 hours) and find that the f95 value after levamisole treatment shows an excellent linear correlation with the f95 score of untreated crawling worms, i.e. f95lev+ ≅ f95lev- (slope for 60 hrs = 0.89 ± 0.19, slope for 76 hrs = 0.85 ± 0.13, and slope for 84 hrs = 1.08 ± 0.16), supporting that MEF quantitates the maximum muscular strength of C. elegans. It is remarkable that even though some animals are weak or strong to begin with due to differences in age or individual variability, the f95 after drug exposure correlates well for both the weak and strong animals, highlighting the robustness of our strength measure.MEF detects muscle strength weakness in mutants Given that NemaFlex measures the maximum strength of C. elegans, we tested its capability to detect strength changes due to genetic defects in body wall muscles and neuromuscular signaling. We measured strength in the muscle mutants unc-112 and unc-52, which have impaired production of the sarcomere proteins kindlin and perlecan respectively9, 40, 41. We also tested the mutant unc-17, which has decreased levels of acetylcholine, one of the major neurotransmitters responsible for muscle contractions39, 42. In all three mutants, we found that force production decreased compared to wild-type animals (f95 =11.92, 16.61, 22.74 μN, and 28.43 μN for unc-112, unc-52, unc-17, and wild-type respectively; Fig. 11d), confirming that the NemaFlex method can reveal neuromuscular weakness. Influence of body size on muscular strength in C. elegans Harnessing the full capability of NemaFlex for applications ranging from dissecting developmental biology to understanding neuromuscular disorders and aging requires evaluation of how C. elegans’ body size affects its muscular strength. For example, individuals from a synchronized culture of WT animals have differences in body size (Supplementary Figure 5), raising the question of whether some animals appear stronger simply because of their larger size. A similar question arises during mutant screenings in which some mutants may be smaller than WT or might develop more slowly than WT and therefore might be smaller at the time of comparison. In aging studies, it is also essential to decouple the strength changes due to frailty from those that might be attributed to animal size, which can change during adult life43. Muscular strength depends strongly on body diameter but not length To address the influence of body size, we measured the mid-body diameter, length, and strength of at least 80 age-matched individuals of WT and lon-2 mutants, which are longer than wild type (Fig. 12a-d). We find that even though the mean length of lon-2 mutants is ≈1.3 times that of wild-type animals (Fig. 12a, b), the muscular strength of these two populations is not statistically different (Fig. 12c), suggesting that the worm body length does not significantly influence the muscle strength recorded by NemaFlex. In striking contrast, we observe a strong increase of muscle strength with the worm body diameter (Fig. 12d). The data fit to the scaling relationship f95 ~ Dm, with m = 3.32 ± 0.48 and 3.04 ± 0.30 for WT and lon-2 animals respectively. Figure 12. Influence of body size on C. elegans muscle strength. Open in a new tab (a) Influence of the body length was evaluated by comparing the force production of wild type (top image) and a lon-2 mutant (bottom image). Scale bar, 200 μm. (b) Distribution of the body lengths of wild type (n = 89) and lon-2 (n = 37) at a single time point (48 hours) for similar diameter worms. The lon-2 worms are ≈ 1.3 times longer than wild type. (c) The strength distributions of wild-type and lon-2 worms are statistically similar. Animal populations are the same as in (b). (d) Both wild type (n = 94) and lon-2 (n = 84) show approximately a cubic dependency of strength on body diameter. MEF data for each population was binned using bin widths of 2.5 μm. Data shown is mean ± SD. (e) Active bending of worm body curvature produces pillar forces. The vector sum of the pillar forces (red arrows) is zero in (i). The nematode pushes pillars when trying to (ii) increase or (iii) decrease its curvature. Increase of the curvature is induced by tension from contracting muscles (red in (ii), green shows relaxing muscle). Similarly, decrease of the curvature is initiated by transferring the tension to the other pair of muscles (red in (iii)) by initiating contraction in the relaxed muscle section. Scale bar, 200 μm. (f) Bending moment analysis in the human muscle arm that is lifting a weight. See main text for description of the symbols. (g) A schematic of the worm body segment under active bending where muscles are shown as (i) springs resembling the contraction and relaxation of muscles. T is the muscle tension in the worm, D is the body diameter, F is the pillar force and s is the pillar spacing. (ii) Animals with larger diameters have more muscle cross-sectional area and therefore produce more force.To understand the relationship between worm body diameter and muscular strength, we consider active bending of the worm body that produces pillar forces whose vector sum is nearly zero (Fig. 12e, i). These pillar forces are produced by C. elegans due to changes in body curvature induced by contraction or relaxation of its muscles. For the example shown in Fig. 12e, the curvature increase is induced by tension in the dorsal contracting muscle (Fig. 12e, ii), and it is decreased during dorsal relaxation (Fig. 12e, iii). The reason why thick animals exert higher forces is analogous to why thick elastic rods require more force to bend than thin rods. This qualitative argument may explain the influence of body diameter on C. elegans’ maximal muscle strength measures.A biomechanics model explains D3 scaling To develop a simple model that incorporates the effect of body diameter, we consider the bending moment (M) induced in the muscles of a human arm that is lifting a weight (F), i.e. M = F×L, where L is the lever arm (Fig. 12f). Applying this analogy to the bending moment introduced in the worm muscles while pushing against pillars, we get M = F×L ~ T×D, where T is the muscle tension in the worm body (Fig. 12g). Assuming the muscle tension is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the muscle (Am) and the lever arm is equivalent to pillar spacing, we have F ~ Am×D/s. Since Am is proportional to the worm body cross-section, i.e. Am ~ D2, we finally have F~D3/s (2) Eqn. (2) suggests that f95 should scale as the cube of worm body diameter and is inversely proportional to the pillar spacing. We tested the relation F ~ D3, by considering wild-type animals of different age and three mutants (Table 2). We find that the data agrees reasonably well with the predicted cubic dependence on worm body diameter in all the tested cases. Interestingly, we observe that even in animals (WT, age = 48, 55 hrs) that have confinement less than our optimal range of 0.85 – 1.16, the exponent is close to 3. Furthermore, the fact that the f95 values of individuals were lower in arena A1, which has larger pillar spacing than arenas A2 and A3 is consistent with Eqn. (2). Indeed, we find that the ratios of f95 in A3 and A1 are approximately inversely proportional to the pillar spacing in the respective arena sections, supporting our simple scaling analysis. Table 2.

In such cases deviations from D3 scaling can be potentially corrected by knowing the detailed anatomy of the muscle cross-sectional area. If deviations still exist then it might indicate intrinsic differences in the tension of the muscle fibers in the nematode. Investigation of such differences resulting from genetic defects or age is one of the main motivations for the development of the NemaFlex system.",
    "discussion": "III. Results and Discussion Basic principle of NemaFlex and force analysis At the core of the NemaFlex technology is a liquid-filled microfluidic chamber containing elastic micropillars dangling from the chamber roof that can be deformed by a nematode push (Fig. 1c, d). As C. elegans threads through the pillars, the individual pillar deflections Δ are quantified using a microscope-camera system and image analysis (see Supplementary Movie 2). The force F causing the observed pillar deflection is calculated using the Timoshenko theory for an elastic rod22, 34, F=Δ(l33EI+a2(1+γ)l4EI+l2(h−l)2EI) (1) In Eqn. (1), a, h, and I are the diameter, height, and moment of inertia of the cylindrical pillar respectively. E and γ are the elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillar respectively. The point of contact of the worm with the pillar edge is denoted by l = h – (D-c)/2, which is calculated knowing the worm diameter D at mid-length and the clearance c between the pillar edge and the bottom surface of the chamber. The values used for the different parameters in Eqn. (1) as well as its validity for force measurement are discussed in Supplementary Note 2. In general, we find that the magnitude of the pillar forces depends on the contact point along the nematode body, body configuration, and behavioral characteristics of C. elegans. Given this probabilistic nature of pillar forces exerted by the worm, we sought to establish a robust and reproducible procedure for quantifying animal strength. Fig. 4a-d shows this procedure in which we typically record a 30 second behavioral episode per animal. In every image of the acquired video, we identify the pillar with the maximal deflection (labeled red in Fig. 4a among all the candidate pillars), allowing us to extract an instantaneous maximal force value from each frame (Fig. 4b). We bin all the instantaneous maximal force values and generate a cumulative force distribution curve that defines a probability for exerting a maximal force lower than or equal to a given value (Fig. 4c). From this distribution, we define the maximal force corresponding to 95% cumulative probability, f95, as the maximum exertable force (MEF) of C. elegans (Fig. 4d). Our error in force detection, measured from pillars that are not in animal contact, is markedly lower than the maximal forces exerted by the nematode (Fig. 4b), with a cumulative measurement error of 2.5 μN in the f95 value (c.f. Fig. 3). Figure 4. Data analysis workflow for NemaFlex strength measurement. Open in a new tab (a) Stack of images showing the worm interacting with different pillars during a locomotory episode. The deflected pillars are circled in blue, and the red circle denotes the pillar that experiences the maximum force. Scale bar, 200 μm. (b) Variation of maximal force over time due to a worm interacting with pillars (in red). The black curve shows force variation from the pillars that are not in contact with the worm – giving an estimate of error in our force measurement. (c) Cumulative probability distribution curves of maximal forces for different worms (age = 60 hrs) showing the variability between individuals (n = 14). The red trace represents the cumulative force distribution curve for the population. (d) From the cumulative force distribution curve, the maximum exertable force, f95, is defined as the maximal force at 95% cumulative probability.Our approach allows defining the MEF at the level of an individual or a population, depending on whether the data constitute maximal forces from a single worm or a collection of worms. The cumulative force distribution curve for individuals typically consists of 200 data points, and for a population at least 2000. Fig. 4c shows the cumulative force distribution curve for wild-type (WT, age = 60 hrs) individuals. We find variability in the f95 values between individuals suggesting that some animals are naturally stronger than others, even though their body diameters are very similar (5% variation of mean body diameter). Resistance to locomotion in the pillar arena determines maximal forces The purpose of our study is to establish a reliable measure for C. elegans strength that is equivalent to maximum voluntary force in humans. To achieve this, we sought to identify micropillar forest designs that create high mechanical resistance to locomotion. Analogous to human strength evaluation where strong forces are registered when resistance to motion is high (c.f. Fig. 1a), we expect that animals in tight pillar arenas experience strong resistance to locomotion and produce large forces. Below we show results supporting that animals produce strong forces in highly resistive arenas and discuss the existence of different regimes of resistance to locomotion based on the size of nematode relative to gap between pillars. Highly resistive pillar environment is characterized by low velocity and strong forces To identify an arena geometry that induces high resistance to locomotion and makes C. elegans produce maximal forces frequently we fabricated a composite arena (Fig. 5a) that contained three regions (A1, A2, and A3) with distinct pillar diameters (in the range of a ≈ 40 – 60 μm) and gap between pillars (s ≈ 100 – 60 μm) (Supplementary Note 3). Regions A1, A2 and A3 produced confinement levels of D/s ≈ 0.67, 0.85, and 1.16 for wild type adults respectively (Fig. 5b). The composite arena is unique as it allowed us to investigate the dependence of force-velocity correlation and gait parameters on animal confinement. Figure 5. Resistance to locomotion determines maximal forces. Open in a new tab (a) A composite micropillar arena containing sections A1, A2, and A3 with different pillar spacings to investigate the influence of animal confinement on force generation. Scale bar, 5 mm. (b) The same nematode shown in the three different arenas. The level of confinement (D/s) increases as the worm crawls from arena A1 to A3. Scale bar, 100 μm. The force-velocity data for animals in (c) A1, (d) A2, and (e) A3 arenas. The lines indicate force-velocity cut-offs of 80 μN and 600 μm/s. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours.Pooling data from individuals (WT, age = 84 hrs), in Fig. 5c-e we show the maximal pillar force (from each image) versus the instantaneous animal velocity in the three arenas. We observe that in the moderately confined A1 arena, animals move at velocities as large as 600 μm/s and rarely exert forces more than 80 μN (Fig. 5c). In contrast, animals in the strongly confining A3 arena move at much slower velocities and often exert forces > 80 μN (Fig. 5e). Such large forces occur less frequently in arena A2 (Fig. 5d). Scoring the forward crawling locomotion, we find that between A1 and A3 arenas, the body wavelength reduces by 12% and amplitude varies by 3%, suggesting that in the moderate-strong confinement regime the force-velocity correlation is much more strongly affected than the forward crawling gait. Frequent exertion of maximal forces in A3 arena can be understood from the high mechanical resistance to locomotion provided by this tight pillar arena where the nematode muscles push against the pillar, but its body cannot adjust its position in response to reaction forces due to the body being constrained simultaneously by multiple pillars. Evidence for the strong mechanical resistance is exemplified by the high frequency of turns and reversals in the highly resistive A3 and A2 arenas compared to A1 (Fig. 6). Figure 6. Behavioral phenotyping of C. elegans in pillar arenas with different confinements. Open in a new tab The frequency of reversals and turns is higher under tighter confinement due to strong mechanical resistance of the pillar environment. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours.Identification of different regimes of resistance to locomotion Our experimental results thus far and previous work in pillar environments22–24, 35–38 (see Supplementary Table 2 for description of pillar geometries used in prior works), paint the following general picture; depending on the body size and pillar forest geometry, C. elegans locomotion between microfluidic pillars can be classified as non-resistive, moderately resistive or highly resistive. The existence of such regimes has been previously unrecognized. In the non-resistive regime, the submerged nematode is typically in contact with one or two pillars (Fig. 7a). The forces would be low here because the nematode translates and rotates in response to a body contact with a pillar, exhibiting swimming-like behavior. An example of this regime was shown by Majmudar et al., where for D/s = 0.17, nematode swim trajectories were observed to be diverted by mechanical interactions with the pillars38. Figure 7. Schematic illustrating the effect of animal confinement on mechanical resistance and force generation in pillar environments. Open in a new tab The nematode experiences increasing confinement (D/s) from left to right due to increasing density of pillars. (a) Weak resistance, D/s = 0.2, (b) moderate resistance, D/s = 0.6, and (c) strong resistance, D/s = 1.0. Large forces are expected under strong confinement due to enhanced mechanical resistance and constrained body shapes. The operating confinement regime of our NemaFlex system is highlighted.In the moderately resistive regime, frequent contacts with more than two pillars occur (Fig. 7b) and the body wave conveniently fits into the space between pillars; the velocity is high because pillars provide transverse resistance enabling efficient forward locomotion. Forces are moderate because the nematode can fit in the available space with only minor adjustment of body posture. This picture is consistent with our results in A1 arena and further supported by the work of Ryu and coworkers36 who showed that when D/s ≈ 0.35 – 0.5 C. elegans swimming speed is enhanced. In the highly-resistive regime which corresponds to our arenas A2 and A3, frequent contacts with multiple pillars occur (Fig. 7c). Animal velocity is low and forces are high because of the incompatibility between nematode gait and pillar configuration. Our observations are in agreement with the work by Johari et al. and Khare et al., who used arenas with D/s = 0.86 -1.6 and showed that animals exert strong forces23, 24. The existence of these regimes indicates that NemaFlex device needs to operate in the highly resistive regime to score MEF. However, even in this highly resistive regime, individual pillar forces fluctuate from low to high as evidenced by our cumulative force distribution curves, thus requiring robust measurement and data analysis protocols for standardized strength measurement. Previous works have been unable to establish behavior- and gait-independent measures of strength that are indicative of MVF in C. elegans. Maximum exertable force f95 is a reliable measure to score muscle strength in C. elegans In this section, we show that MEF, our proposed metric of C. elegans strength, yields consistent values in highly resistive pillar arenas and that it is independent of gait and behavior. By using a drug that contracts muscles we confirm that MEF due to induced muscle contractions is the same as that calculated from force distribution due to voluntary muscle action. Finally, we demonstrate that MEF can be used to reliably score neuromuscular weakness in mutants. Optimized pillar arena produces consistent readout of MEF Given that even in the highly resistive pillar environments forces fluctuate, we asked whether MEF for the same individual changes due to different degrees of confinement in A1, A2, and A3 arenas. Our hypothesis was that if MEF is truly indicative of the maximum voluntary force then in the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 we should obtain the same values for MEF. In Fig. 8a, we show the results for individual wild-type animals and find that the MEF in arenas A2 and A3 show a near-perfect correlation ( f95A2≅f95A3, calculated slope = 1.01 ± 0.05) while MEF is lower in A1 arena with a slope = 0.46 ± 0.07 shown in Fig. 8b. Thus f95 is consistent between the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas. Figure 8. Highly resistive pillar arenas produce consistent maximum exertable force. Open in a new tab A comparison between maximum exertable force f95 measured for WT individuals in (a) section A2 and section A3 (n = 14, slope = 1.01 ± 0.05, r2 = 0.65) and (b) in section A1 and section A3 (n=13, slope = 0.46 ± 0.07, r2 = -0.55). A similar comparison is shown for unc-112 animals (n=13 individuals) in (c) A2 and A3 (n = 12, slope 0.99 ± 0.04, r2 = 0.67) and (d) A1 and A3 (n= 10, slope = 0.81 ± 0.07, r2 = -0.25). Comparison for lon-2 animals (n=10 individuals) in (e) A2 and A3 (n=9, slope=0.98± 0.05, r2 = 0.72) and (f) A1 and A3 (n= 8, slope = 0.75 ± 0.07, r2 = 0.67). The red line is the best-fit curve to the data, and the dashed black line has a slope of unity and passes through origin. The blue lines demarcate the 95% confidence interval region.We also tested unc-112, a mutant that is weaker due to muscle defects26 and lon-2, a mutant that grows approximately 1.5 times longer than wild type. For unc-112, we find that the correlation of MEF values in arenas A1 and A3 is off from unity (slope = 0.81 ± 0.07), but in A2 and A3 we again observe a near-perfect correlation with slope 0.99 ± 0.04 (Fig. 8c, d). We find similar results for lon-2 which shows a correlation with slope 0.98 ± 0.05 in arenas A2 and A3 (Fig. 8e, f). Thus, in WT, unc-112 and lon-2 we obtain consistent f95 in the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas. Previously Johari et al.23 and Khare et al.24 computed the time-average of the pillar forces favg to characterize C. elegans muscle force. We checked to see how well this measure correlates from the force data of individuals in A1, A2 and A3 arenas. We find that favg from different arenas are inconsistent in WT animals and unc-112 mutant (see Supplementary Note 4), suggesting that f95 is a much more reliable metric of strength. Thus, our results from the composite arena provide compelling evidence that both the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 maximize force exertion, and our strength metric f95 is invariant for a given individual as long as animals are confined to 0.85 < D/s < 1.16. We settled on using A3 arena for the NemaFlex device since maximal forces are more frequent in this arena than A2 arena (Fig. 5d,e) and smaller body-sized animals fit better in A3. The actual dimensions of the NemaFlex device are: a = 38.3 μm ± 0.4 μm, s = 61.7 μm ± 2.9 μm, h =71.8 ± 2.9 μm, with the pillars arranged in a square lattice within a ≈ 1 cm2 oval shaped arena (Fig. 1b). It is possible that the limits of validity of confinement that we have established here to obtain consistent MEF readout may vary, for example for C. elegans of different sizes or mutants. In such cases, the composite-arena approach with individuals that we have demonstrated here is a useful means to identify the optimal confinement range for maximum force exertion.MEF is independent of locomotory gait To address whether the locomotory gait impacts MEF in the NemaFlex device we isolated episodes from our videos where the animal (WT, age = 60 hrs) was making a forward crawl or omega turn or reversal (Fig. 9a-d). We note that the forward crawl involved either a long-wave or a short-wave body posture with the short-wave being less frequent (Fig. 9a,b). The cumulative probability force distributions corresponding to each of these locomotory modes is shown in Fig. 9e. We find that the omega turns and reversals produce larger average force; however, the MEF estimates are very similar: f95 (long wave) = 20.98 μN, f95 (short wave) = 21.04 μN, f95 (reversal) = 22.38 μN, and f95 (omega) = 21.32 μN. Thus, the strength measure MEF provided by NemaFlex is not strongly dependent on animal gait. Figure 9. NemaFlex quantitates maximum exertable force independent of C. elegans gait. Open in a new tab (a) Images showing the different gaits exhibited by crawling WT C. elegans in the pillar arena of the NemaFlex device. The arrows show direction of the animal motion. (b) The cumulative force distribution for the different gaits shown in (a). The horizontal dashed line indicates 95% probability, and the vertical bar highlights that the f95 values for each gait are very similar. Animal age = 60 hrs and D/s = 0.87 – 0.98.MEF is insensitive to time-variation of behavior Next, we evaluated whether MEF is sensitive to time variation of behavior by recording behavioral episodes of individuals. In a 30-second behavioral episode we typically observed forward crawls, omega turns, and reversals (c.f. Fig. 6). We analyzed contiguous images of 30-second duration with a random starting point in the video. In complementary sampling, we scored non-repeating, discrete images randomly (totaling 30-second duration) from the full behavioral episode. The f95 of individuals calculated either from contiguous or random sampling of the behavior is shown in Fig. 10a,b. We find that in both contiguous and discrete sampling f95 typically varied by less than 10% of the mean value. This less than 10% variation is commensurate with the error in force measurement shown in Fig. 3 indicating therefore that MEF is insensitive to short-time variation in behavior. Figure 10. Maximum exertable force is independent of C. elegans behavior in the NemaFlex pillar arena. Open in a new tab (a) MEF of WT individuals obtained from analyzing contiguous frames of 30-second duration with a randomly sampled starting point in the movie (movie length is 85 – 120 seconds). Data is shown as mean ± SD from N = 5 sampling trials. 17 individuals showed SD < 10%, while three showed SD between 10 - 16%. (b) MEF values obtained from non-repeating randomly sampled discrete frames. The movie sets are the same as in (a). Data is shown as mean ± SD from N = 5 trials. In this case all 20 individuals showed SD < 10%. (c) MEF of individuals evaluated at three time points: 0, 2, and 2.5 hours. Here a 2-minute episode was captured for each worm and a contiguous 30-second episode was analyzed to obtain MEF. Animal age = 60 hrs and D/s = 0.85 – 0.95.We also sampled the behavior of an individual after a long time interval (0, 2, 2.5 hrs), and in this case the f95 values change by less than 10% between the three time points (Fig. 10c). Thus, the MEF is also unaffected by long-time variation in behavior. Together, these results suggest that sampling a 30-second behavioral episode is sufficient to determine the MEF of C. elegans and does not rely strongly on the details of behavior. We note that for some mutants it is possible that longer behavioral episodes may need to be tracked to achieve a statistically invariant MEF.MEF before and after drug-induced muscle contractions is the same As an important test to assess whether MEF measure corresponds to the maximum muscular strength, we induced muscle contractions by exposing each animal to the cholinergic agonist levamisole and comparing its f95 scores before and after drug treatment (Fig. 11a). Levamisole is known to bind to acetylcholine receptors in the body wall muscle of C. elegans, causing prolonged excitation of the muscles, shortening of body length, and eventually paralysis39. As shown in Fig. 11b, we indeed observe appreciable reduction in body length due to levamisole exposure (Supplementary Movie 4a & b). Figure 11. NemaFlex quantitates maximum muscular strength in C. elegans. Open in a new tab (a) A brief protocol for imaging and inducing muscle contraction on individual wild-type C. elegans with 1 mM levamisole. A 60-second episode is captured for each animal before levamisole treatment, and capturing continues for 60 to 200 seconds after the induction. (b) Levamisole treatment-induced muscle contraction causes the body length to decrease by 10.4 ± 3.2%. (age = 60 – 84 hrs, n=51, p < 0.0005). (c) Maximum strength of individual animals before and after the levamisole treatment for three different age groups – 60 hrs (n = 15), 76 hrs (n = 14) and 84 hrs (n = 20). The red line is a linear best fit of the pooled data: slope =1.09 +/− 0.06, intercept = -0.006, and r2 =0.89. Dashed blue lines show the 95% level confidence interval (n =49). The dashed black line represents f95lev+ = f95lev- (slope of 1 and intercept at origin). A two sample t-test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring the maximum muscular strength of the animal (p =0.24). For this data set, D/s = 0.95 - 1.02. (d) Comparison of population-level force distribution for wild type (n=20, N=3,475 data points) and three C. elegans muscular or neuromuscular mutants unc-52 (n=12, N=14,883 data points), unc-112 (n=5, N=2,992 data points), and unc-17 (n=20, N=6,997 data points). Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring neuromuscular weakness (p > 0.005). For this data set, D/s = 0.85 - 0.92.In Fig. 11c, we show the force data for individual animals of three different ages (60, 76, and 84 hours) and find that the f95 value after levamisole treatment shows an excellent linear correlation with the f95 score of untreated crawling worms, i.e. f95lev+ ≅ f95lev- (slope for 60 hrs = 0.89 ± 0.19, slope for 76 hrs = 0.85 ± 0.13, and slope for 84 hrs = 1.08 ± 0.16), supporting that MEF quantitates the maximum muscular strength of C. elegans. It is remarkable that even though some animals are weak or strong to begin with due to differences in age or individual variability, the f95 after drug exposure correlates well for both the weak and strong animals, highlighting the robustness of our strength measure.MEF detects muscle strength weakness in mutants Given that NemaFlex measures the maximum strength of C. elegans, we tested its capability to detect strength changes due to genetic defects in body wall muscles and neuromuscular signaling. We measured strength in the muscle mutants unc-112 and unc-52, which have impaired production of the sarcomere proteins kindlin and perlecan respectively9, 40, 41. We also tested the mutant unc-17, which has decreased levels of acetylcholine, one of the major neurotransmitters responsible for muscle contractions39, 42. In all three mutants, we found that force production decreased compared to wild-type animals (f95 =11.92, 16.61, 22.74 μN, and 28.43 μN for unc-112, unc-52, unc-17, and wild-type respectively; Fig. 11d), confirming that the NemaFlex method can reveal neuromuscular weakness. Influence of body size on muscular strength in C. elegans Harnessing the full capability of NemaFlex for applications ranging from dissecting developmental biology to understanding neuromuscular disorders and aging requires evaluation of how C. elegans’ body size affects its muscular strength. For example, individuals from a synchronized culture of WT animals have differences in body size (Supplementary Figure 5), raising the question of whether some animals appear stronger simply because of their larger size. A similar question arises during mutant screenings in which some mutants may be smaller than WT or might develop more slowly than WT and therefore might be smaller at the time of comparison. In aging studies, it is also essential to decouple the strength changes due to frailty from those that might be attributed to animal size, which can change during adult life43. Muscular strength depends strongly on body diameter but not length To address the influence of body size, we measured the mid-body diameter, length, and strength of at least 80 age-matched individuals of WT and lon-2 mutants, which are longer than wild type (Fig. 12a-d). We find that even though the mean length of lon-2 mutants is ≈1.3 times that of wild-type animals (Fig. 12a, b), the muscular strength of these two populations is not statistically different (Fig. 12c), suggesting that the worm body length does not significantly influence the muscle strength recorded by NemaFlex. In striking contrast, we observe a strong increase of muscle strength with the worm body diameter (Fig. 12d). The data fit to the scaling relationship f95 ~ Dm, with m = 3.32 ± 0.48 and 3.04 ± 0.30 for WT and lon-2 animals respectively. Figure 12. Influence of body size on C. elegans muscle strength. Open in a new tab (a) Influence of the body length was evaluated by comparing the force production of wild type (top image) and a lon-2 mutant (bottom image). Scale bar, 200 μm. (b) Distribution of the body lengths of wild type (n = 89) and lon-2 (n = 37) at a single time point (48 hours) for similar diameter worms. The lon-2 worms are ≈ 1.3 times longer than wild type. (c) The strength distributions of wild-type and lon-2 worms are statistically similar. Animal populations are the same as in (b). (d) Both wild type (n = 94) and lon-2 (n = 84) show approximately a cubic dependency of strength on body diameter. MEF data for each population was binned using bin widths of 2.5 μm. Data shown is mean ± SD. (e) Active bending of worm body curvature produces pillar forces. The vector sum of the pillar forces (red arrows) is zero in (i). The nematode pushes pillars when trying to (ii) increase or (iii) decrease its curvature. Increase of the curvature is induced by tension from contracting muscles (red in (ii), green shows relaxing muscle). Similarly, decrease of the curvature is initiated by transferring the tension to the other pair of muscles (red in (iii)) by initiating contraction in the relaxed muscle section. Scale bar, 200 μm. (f) Bending moment analysis in the human muscle arm that is lifting a weight. See main text for description of the symbols. (g) A schematic of the worm body segment under active bending where muscles are shown as (i) springs resembling the contraction and relaxation of muscles. T is the muscle tension in the worm, D is the body diameter, F is the pillar force and s is the pillar spacing. (ii) Animals with larger diameters have more muscle cross-sectional area and therefore produce more force.To understand the relationship between worm body diameter and muscular strength, we consider active bending of the worm body that produces pillar forces whose vector sum is nearly zero (Fig. 12e, i). These pillar forces are produced by C. elegans due to changes in body curvature induced by contraction or relaxation of its muscles. For the example shown in Fig. 12e, the curvature increase is induced by tension in the dorsal contracting muscle (Fig. 12e, ii), and it is decreased during dorsal relaxation (Fig. 12e, iii). The reason why thick animals exert higher forces is analogous to why thick elastic rods require more force to bend than thin rods. This qualitative argument may explain the influence of body diameter on C. elegans’ maximal muscle strength measures.A biomechanics model explains D3 scaling To develop a simple model that incorporates the effect of body diameter, we consider the bending moment (M) induced in the muscles of a human arm that is lifting a weight (F), i.e. M = F×L, where L is the lever arm (Fig. 12f). Applying this analogy to the bending moment introduced in the worm muscles while pushing against pillars, we get M = F×L ~ T×D, where T is the muscle tension in the worm body (Fig. 12g). Assuming the muscle tension is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the muscle (Am) and the lever arm is equivalent to pillar spacing, we have F ~ Am×D/s. Since Am is proportional to the worm body cross-section, i.e. Am ~ D2, we finally have F~D3/s (2) Eqn. (2) suggests that f95 should scale as the cube of worm body diameter and is inversely proportional to the pillar spacing. We tested the relation F ~ D3, by considering wild-type animals of different age and three mutants (Table 2). We find that the data agrees reasonably well with the predicted cubic dependence on worm body diameter in all the tested cases. Interestingly, we observe that even in animals (WT, age = 48, 55 hrs) that have confinement less than our optimal range of 0.85 – 1.16, the exponent is close to 3. Furthermore, the fact that the f95 values of individuals were lower in arena A1, which has larger pillar spacing than arenas A2 and A3 is consistent with Eqn. (2). Indeed, we find that the ratios of f95 in A3 and A1 are approximately inversely proportional to the pillar spacing in the respective arena sections, supporting our simple scaling analysis. Table 2.

In such cases deviations from D3 scaling can be potentially corrected by knowing the detailed anatomy of the muscle cross-sectional area. If deviations still exist then it might indicate intrinsic differences in the tension of the muscle fibers in the nematode. Investigation of such differences resulting from genetic defects or age is one of the main motivations for the development of the NemaFlex system.",
    "conclusion": "IV. Conclusions and Outlook C. elegans is a powerful genetic model with conserved muscle biology, and over the last few decades new insights have been gained into the assembly, maintenance, and regulation of striated muscle that are usually applicable to all animals. Kinematic measures, for example swim frequency or crawling speed, derived from locomotory assays have been typically used to assess neuromuscular function in C. elegans44. More recently, propulsive forces have been determined by tracking velocity fields and body kinematics during swimming45 by challenging worms to swim up inclined surfaces46 and by measuring drag coefficients of crawling animals47. In a parallel effort, building on advances in microfluidics48, important attempts for measuring forces generated by moving C. elegans have been made using piezoresistance sensors20 and deformable pillars22–26. However, these prior efforts reported forces that vary depending on pillar arena geometry, worm velocity, and body posture;thus, none of these yields a maximum force that is independent of animal behavior and accounts for variations in animal size. Without a behavior- and size-independent strength measurement, it is difficult to standardize muscle force investigations in C. elegans. Here we have optimized the micropillar forest design, defined the measurement conditions, and fine-tuned the workflow analysis so that NemaFlex can reliably score the maximum exertable force in C. elegans. To confirm that NemaFlex indeed reports behavior-independent strength, we evaluated different pillar spacings and duration of behavioral episodes and showed that animals push as hard as they can once they reach a certain level of confinement; a behavioral episode as low as 30 seconds is sufficient to capture a statistically invariant MEF for young adults. The force measures before and after levamisole-induced full muscle contractions were found to be similar, which supports our metric of maximum force. Indeed, the levamisole experiment shows that C. elegans MEF is similar to human MVF - a critical advance for the ability to compare experimental data across muscle studies. Recognizing that animals from the same culture might have different body sizes or that mutations may cause variation in body size, we investigated the influence of body size on MEF. We showed that MEF is independent of the body length, but it strongly depends on body diameter. Importantly, we uncovered a relationship of strength with C. elegans diameter that is consistent with a scaling analysis in which bending moments due to maximum external force and internal muscle tension balance each other. Thus, we have produced a compensation factor for body size that enables animals of different age, genetic makeup, or experience to be fairly compared. In humans, relative strength is a compelling indicator of muscle homeostasis, physical training, and disease. As we model these conditions in invertebrates, there is a critical need to establish standardized measures of strength that have relevance in human muscle physiology. The NemaFlex technology addresses this gap by providing a robust analog of MVF in vertebrates. With current throughput of strength evaluation being ~10 min/worm (loading, imaging, image analysis, and validation), the NemaFlex system is well equipped for targeted investigations on disease conditions that can be modeled in C. elegans. High throughput genetic and drug screens are also possible with NemaFlex, although this would require further microfluidic automation and parallelized analysis. At a more fundamental level, NemaFlex may help in defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function49.",

Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model C. elegans is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have not been recapitulated in the C. elegans model since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement that we call ‘NemaFlex’, based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength in C. elegans. Additionally, we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.Graphical abstract I. Introduction Skeletal muscle provides the contractile system critical for animal locomotion across phyla. The conserved biology of muscle includes sarcomere composition and organization, the calcium-initiated contractile mechanism, and the ATP-driven translocation of actin and myosin for force generation1, 2. A powerful indicator of muscle health is strength —a measure of maximum force that can be voluntarily exerted for a given task. Diagnosis of muscle degenerative disorders such as muscular dystrophy relies on strength and physical performance tests in the clinic3, 4. Similar diagnostic evaluation is crucial for, sarcopenia and dynapenia, the age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and muscle strength, respectively5, 6. Additionally, muscle atrophy and strength declines are a major impediment for manned deep space exploration7. Given conservation of basic muscle biology, simple genetic models such as Drosophila melanogaster8 and the 959-celled Caenorhabditis elegans9, 10 constitute attractive platforms with which to decipher the molecular mechanisms of age-10,11, disease-12, or microgravity-13 associated muscle decline. For example, studies in C. elegans have led to important new insights into the assembly, maintenance, and regulation of striated muscle10, 14–16, with the loss-of-function mutants in sarcomeric proteins showing reduced capacity to swim or crawl17–19. These model organisms also offer a powerful means with which to investigate how diet, exercise protocols, and drug interventions may combat muscle dysfunction. Still, the notion of muscle strength and its measurement in these simple models has remained elusive. A technical challenge in reporting muscle strength in invertebrate models is that its definition crucially depends on system geometry and measurement protocol. As a result, even though forces on the order of microNewtons have been reported to be exerted by C. elegans20–26; the approaches used yield different values of forces due to worm locomotion, body posture, and behavior. Without a measurement protocol that is reproducible and system geometry that is validated, fluctuating forces cannot be used to extract a meaningful metric for strength. Additionally, the influence of animal size on force production has not been established, even though it is well recognized that animals from the same culture as well as mutants can have different body sizes. Thus, force measures that reveal muscular strength independent of animal behavior and approaches to compensate forces for variations in animal size, have not been established in the C. elegans model. In humans, precisely defined strength metrics such as maximum voluntary force (MVF) and one repetition maximum (1RM) are absolutely essential to quantitate and compare subjects, which constitutes the clinical basis of muscle physiology investigations27 (Fig. 1a). Here, MVF is defined as the peak force recorded for a particular set of muscle (leg extensor, elbow extensor etc.) during one trial28, 29, and 1RM is defined as the maximum weight that a person can lift for one repetition30. It is imperative to recapitulate analogous metrics and standardize them in the C. elegans model for the field to move forward with genetic studies on problems ranging from Duchenne muscular dystrophy to muscle wasting due to aging to metabolic disorders.

Open in a new tab (a) Human muscle function is measured in terms of maximum voluntary force (MVF) during a standardized knee extensor test, where the peak force exerted by the quadriceps muscle is recorded using a force sensor.

The pillar is deflected due to the action of the body wall muscles (shown in red and green). Parameters defined in Eqn. (1) are shown with actual values being a = 38.3 ± 0.4, h = 71.8 ± 2.9, c = 27.6 ± 2.9 and D = 50 -70 μm (for WT, age = 60 – 84 hrs).Here we define a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement in nematodes by pillar deflection that we call “NemaFlex” (Fig. 1b-d). We study the effects of micropillar forest design and animal behavior to identify robust measurement conditions that define maximum exertable force (MEF) as a measure that is reproducible and insensitive to animal locomotion and behavior. Our force-velocity analysis in animals experiencing different confinements and validation studies using a muscle contracting agent mutants indeed show that MEF is analogous to MVF measured in humans. We also report a scaling factor to correct MEF for animal size, thus establishing NemaFlex as a quantitative and reproducible system for measurement of muscle strength among individual worms, mutants, and/or prospectively in an individual worm with age or experimental intervention. Our findings establish the means to exploit drug, genetic, and experiential outcomes that may define molecular and cellular circuits of muscle use and maintenance, which in turn might inspire therapies for extended muscle healthspan.II. Experimental Strains and worm preparation C. elegans were maintained on E. coli OP50 bacterial lawns using standard protocol31. Wild-type (WT) animals were Bristol isolate (N2). Other strains used in this study were unc-52(e669), unc-112(r367ts)V, unc-17(e245), and lon-2(e678)X. Age synchronized, well-fed young adult animals were used for all force measurement experiments unless otherwise indicated. Age synchronized populations were obtained using a standard protocol. Approximately 20 gravid adult animals were transferred to a NGM plate (previously seeded with bacteria E. coli OP50) by hand picking and allowed to lay eggs on the bacteria lawn for 3 hours. After 3 hours, gravid adults were removed from the plate. Hatched worms were cultured at 20°C. The age of animals whose strength was evaluated is mentioned in either the main text or figure captions and is given as the time from hatching.Microfluidic device fabrication The micropillar-based NemaFlex force measurement device, shown in Fig. 1b, was fabricated using soft lithography32. Two master molds were used in this study. The first is a composite arena design that contains three concentric circular regions (A1, A2, and A3) with varying pillar diameters and spacing. This mold was used to optimize arena geometry for evaluation of maximum exertable forces produced by a crawling worm. The measured dimensions of the pillars in the A1, A2, and A3 regions are provided in Table 1. The second mold referred to as “NemaFlex” in Table 1 is an arena containing pillar matrix with geometrical dimensions very similar to region A3. We used this mold in all the post-optimization studies. Table 1. Geometrical details of the composite arena and measured gait and velocity in different regions of the arena. Here D = 65.1 ± 3.2 μm. Age of the worm is 84 hours after hatching. The height of the pillars in the composite arena is 83.6 ± 1.8 μm. Composite Arena Pillar diameter, a (μm) Confinement, D/s Crawling amplitude, A (μm) Crawling wavelength, λ (μm) Speed, v (μm/s) A1 63.5 ± 1.0 0.67 ± 0.03 88.1 ± 4.6 579.4 ± 25.6 264.1 ± 147.1 A2 53.8 ± 1.2 0.85 ± 0.04 92.6 ± 3.5 526.0± 19.4 177.4 ± 66.0 A3 44.1 ± 0.9 1.16 ± 0.06 85.0 ± 3.5 508.2 ± 32.6 127.7 ± 45.6 Open in a new tabAll the master molds used in this study were fabricated using the following procedure. A two-layer mold was fabricated in SU-8 2050 negative photoresist (Microchem) on a 3\" silicon wafer as substrate (University Wafer)22. First, a 25-μm-tall, oval-shaped flat layer was fabricated, which forms the boundary of the arena. On top of this layer, a second layer of 75-μm height was fabricated with cylindrical holes that form the micropillars. This two-layer approach provides a total chamber depth of approximately 100 μm and creates dangling (deformable) pillars of height 75 μm (Fig. 1c,d). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices were casted (Sylgard 184 Part A (base) and Part B (curing agent) 10:1 by weight; Dow Corning) over the SU-8 mold by curing for ~2 hours at 75°C. The PDMS replica was then treated in an air-plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY) for 1 minute and bonded to a 1×3\" glass slide. Bonding was done ensuring the pillars did not collapse or deform. Inlet and outlet holes were cored with a 1mm hole puncher (Accuderm) before bonding.Device preparation and worm loading into the device Bonded and cleaned microfluidic pillar arenas were prepared by surface treating with 5 wt% Pluronic F127 solution. Pluronic solution was loaded into the device through one of the inlets and incubated for 30 minutes, followed by washing with M9 buffer. The pluronic treatment minimizes protein/bacterial fouling and also helps to reduce bubble formation during worm loading33. Immediately before each strength experiment, plates were flooded with 3-4 mL of M9 solution (approximately 100 animals/mL). For individual worm loading, the worm solution from the M9-flooded culture plate was diluted to 10X (approximately 10 animals/mL). Single animals were loaded into the device by using a syringe connected to tubing. Individual loading can also be done by hand picking a single worm. Experiments involving the composite arena, levamisole drug treatment, and body size effects were carried out with individuals. Muscle strength of mutants was evaluated at a population level, in which case the identity of the worm is not preserved during imaging. For population studies, approximately 25-30 animals were gently injected into the NemaFlex using a 1 mL syringe. While retaining animals between pillar obstacles, residual bacteria were removed from the device by flow of M9 buffer. In both the individual and population experiments, animals were allowed to habituate in the arena for approximately 5 minutes before imaging in the food-free environment.Image acquisition The imaging was conducted on two sets of microscopes and camera combinations. Most of the initial trials and strength measurement of mutants were performed on an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus, Center Valley, PA) with image acquisition from a CCD camera (ImageEM, Hamamatsu, Japan). The magnification used was 6.4X with an image resolution of 2.52 μm/pixel. Imaging for experiments dealing with arena design optimization, forced contraction assay with levamisole, and influence of body size on strength were carried out using another microscope (IX70, Olympus, Center Valley, PA) instrumented with a CCD camera (Retiga R6, QImaging, Canada). The magnification used was 6X with an image resolution of 0.7 μm/pixel. Images were acquired at 5 fps for a duration of 30-120 s of one single worm with a field of view of 1880×1540 μm2. All imaging was conducted at a temperature of 20 ± 1°C.Image processing for quantitation of pillar displacements Movies were processed offline using custom routines written in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2014b). Worm diameters were measured manually using ImageJ 1.48v. Below, we outline the key steps in the procedure for quantitating pillar displacement from the original images of a crawling worm in the pillar arena (Fig. 2a). Pillar tracking algorithm and image processing steps are described in detail in Supplementary Note 1. Figure 2. Illustration of the steps in image processing to quantify pillar displacements. Open in a new tab (a) Original images of a crawling worm. (b) Foreground image and (c) background image from a stack of images in the preprocessing step. (d) Mask generation from the foreground.

(g) Grid verification and validation of pillar location. (h) A candidate pillar selected from a frame (see red arrows) for illustration of deflection measurement. (i) Determination of pillar base location and radius when the worm is not touching the pillar. (j) Measurement of pillar displacement.A median filter is applied to each image (Fig. 2a) to eliminate the outlier pixels. The maximum pixel value (i.e. brightest) at each pixel location across all frames provides the background image. Likewise, the minimum pixel value (i.e. darkest) at each pixel location yields the foreground image. As shown in Fig. 2b, these operations make the worm’s entire trajectory visible in the foreground image and absent from the background image. The background contains mostly pillars (see Fig. 2c) and extraneous objects not part of the worm’s trajectory. A “mask” is created from the foreground, which contains the worm trajectory with contiguous pillars only (Fig. 2b). The mask (Fig. 2d) is then applied to the background image to identify the candidate pillar (Fig. 2f) and candidate frames for tracking. In parallel, the background image (Fig. 2c) is used to identify pillars and their base locations (Fig. 2e) by using circular Hough-transform (CHT). A grid connecting the pillar locations (Fig. 2g) is used to eliminate spurious pillars due to dirt, air bubble etc. Verified candidate pillars are then subject to refined CHT, each one at a time (Fig. 2h-j), and displacements of the pillars are calculated from their base locations. Supplementary Movie 1 shows the output of our pillar tracking algorithm.Experimental error in the measurement of forces The error in measurement of forces results from uncertainties associated with quantifying the pillar deflection. Uncertainty in determining pillar deflection can result from several sources including improper fitting of the boundaries of the pillar (e.g. due to day-to-day variations in light intensity), minor heterogeneity in the size distribution of pillars during microfabrication, and mechanical drift in the microscope stage. To account for these different sources of error cumulatively, we tracked a single undeflected pillar from twenty different movies (of duration ≈ 30s) acquired during the study and binned the putative forces to produce a probability distribution (Fig. 3). This maximal force distribution has a mean at 0.9 μN, a standard deviation of 0.8 μN, and the force corresponding to 95% cumulative probability, f95 value, of 2.2 μN (see inset of Fig. 3). Given that the force values due to the stationary pillar can reach as high as 2.2 μN, we use ± 2.5 μN as a conservative estimate of the error in our force measurement. This error is less than 10% of the population-averaged strength of 60-hour-old wild-type animals, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. There is also zero overlap between the two force distributions, allowing clear distinction between true forces and errors. Figure 3. Estimation of error in force measurement. Open in a new tab False positive force detections in the system were determined by tracking a single undeflected pillar from twenty movies of wild-type worms (age = 60 hrs). The error distribution has a mean at 0.9 μN, a standard deviation of 0.8 μN, and an f95 value of 2.2 μN. Inset compares error distribution relative to the strength of the population. The f95 value of the error distribution is less than 10% of the f95 value for the worm population. There is also zero overlap between the two force distributions, allowing clear distinction between true forces and errors.Additional bias in strength measurement could be potentially introduced when the worm body diameter is larger than the pillar spacing, as in the region A3 in the composite arena where the worm confinement D/s = 1.16 (Table 1). Here D is the worm body diameter at mid-length and s is the edge-to-edge pillar spacing. In this case, a default force will be registered even when the worms are not active. These default forces are smaller than the maximal forces exerted by the worm. Since our strength calculation analysis only selects the maximal forces, the measured value is not affected by these default weak forces induced by higher confinement of the worm body in the pillar arena. To estimate the magnitude of the default force, we choose hypothetical worm body diameters that produce confinement above 1 and calculate the corresponding passive deflections (Δ) and forces (F). As shown in Supplementary Table 1, for all the cases considered, Δ < 5 μm and F < 12 μN. These values are smaller than the maximal deflections and forces experimentally observed for a wild-type animal of similar body size that is actively pushing the pillars (see for example, Supplementary Movie 2 which shows the large pillar deflections for a worm with confinement level of 1.07). Moreover, we observe that when the worm pushes the pillars on one side of the body, sufficient gap is created and therefore pillars on the other side of the body do not experience any push. Thus small forces due to passive deflections occur rarely in an actively crawling worm.Animal velocity and gait analysis To calculate the crawling speed of C. elegans, the displacement of the midpoint of the body skeleton was tracked in time. For force-velocity correlation, instantaneous velocity from two consecutive frames was calculated, and the correlation was plotted using the maximal force in the later frame. For characterizing the mean crawling speed, the entire episode was used, and displacements of the midpoint were measured in time. Gait analysis included measuring the wavelength and amplitude of the undulatory forward motion by determining the distance between two peaks in the body wave and the peak height, respectively. Data from ten animals was measured and averaged.Muscle contraction (levamisole) assay 20-30 animals were loaded into the micropillar chambers housing individual worms. Since the loading process can take 15-20 min, bacteria suspension of 100 mg E. coli OP50/mL of S-complete was added to each chamber after worm loading so that the individuals did not suffer from food deprivation. Imaging of each animal before exposure to levamisole was carried out after removing food with S-complete and allowing the animal to habituate for 5 minutes in the food-free environment. The muscle contraction experiment was carried out with 1 mM levamisole solution in S-complete. The levamisole solution was added to the individual chambers using a 1 mL syringe after the first round of imaging. Muscle contraction induced by levamisole (worm body length contraction) was captured 30 seconds after addition of levamisole solution and continued for 3 minutes or until the worm was paralyzed. ImageJ 1.48v was used to measure the length of the worm before and after the levamisole exposure.Force characterization during long-time variation in behavior Individual wild-type young adult worms were loaded into the pillar chambers. The first set of images was captured 2 minutes after loading, which is denoted as t = 0 hr. Food (100 mg E. coli OP50/mL of S-complete) was added at the 1-hour mark to avoid food limitation. The food was then removed at the 2-hour time point, and then 2 minutes after food removal the worm was imaged to obtain strength data at t = 2 hr and 2.5 hr time points.Data analysis All the data analysis was conducted in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2014b). Cumulative probability distributions were generated using Kernel Density Estimate (KDE). The bin size is estimated using the built-in asymptotic approximation. The force value at a cumulative probability of 95% (f95) is taken as the strength of the animal. A two-sample t-test was used to determine significance of data from muscle contraction assays. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test (WRST) was used to compare genetic mutants.III. Results and Discussion Basic principle of NemaFlex and force analysis At the core of the NemaFlex technology is a liquid-filled microfluidic chamber containing elastic micropillars dangling from the chamber roof that can be deformed by a nematode push (Fig. 1c, d). As C. elegans threads through the pillars, the individual pillar deflections Δ are quantified using a microscope-camera system and image analysis (see Supplementary Movie 2). The force F causing the observed pillar deflection is calculated using the Timoshenko theory for an elastic rod22, 34, F=Δ(l33EI+a2(1+γ)l4EI+l2(h−l)2EI) (1) In Eqn. (1), a, h, and I are the diameter, height, and moment of inertia of the cylindrical pillar respectively. E and γ are the elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillar respectively. The point of contact of the worm with the pillar edge is denoted by l = h – (D-c)/2, which is calculated knowing the worm diameter D at mid-length and the clearance c between the pillar edge and the bottom surface of the chamber. The values used for the different parameters in Eqn. (1) as well as its validity for force measurement are discussed in Supplementary Note 2. In general, we find that the magnitude of the pillar forces depends on the contact point along the nematode body, body configuration, and behavioral characteristics of C. elegans. Given this probabilistic nature of pillar forces exerted by the worm, we sought to establish a robust and reproducible procedure for quantifying animal strength. Fig. 4a-d shows this procedure in which we typically record a 30 second behavioral episode per animal. In every image of the acquired video, we identify the pillar with the maximal deflection (labeled red in Fig. 4a among all the candidate pillars), allowing us to extract an instantaneous maximal force value from each frame (Fig. 4b). We bin all the instantaneous maximal force values and generate a cumulative force distribution curve that defines a probability for exerting a maximal force lower than or equal to a given value (Fig. 4c). From this distribution, we define the maximal force corresponding to 95% cumulative probability, f95, as the maximum exertable force (MEF) of C. elegans (Fig. 4d). Our error in force detection, measured from pillars that are not in animal contact, is markedly lower than the maximal forces exerted by the nematode (Fig. 4b), with a cumulative measurement error of 2.5 μN in the f95 value (c.f. Fig. 3). Figure 4. Data analysis workflow for NemaFlex strength measurement. Open in a new tab (a) Stack of images showing the worm interacting with different pillars during a locomotory episode. The deflected pillars are circled in blue, and the red circle denotes the pillar that experiences the maximum force. Scale bar, 200 μm. (b) Variation of maximal force over time due to a worm interacting with pillars (in red). The black curve shows force variation from the pillars that are not in contact with the worm – giving an estimate of error in our force measurement. (c) Cumulative probability distribution curves of maximal forces for different worms (age = 60 hrs) showing the variability between individuals (n = 14). The red trace represents the cumulative force distribution curve for the population. (d) From the cumulative force distribution curve, the maximum exertable force, f95, is defined as the maximal force at 95% cumulative probability.Our approach allows defining the MEF at the level of an individual or a population, depending on whether the data constitute maximal forces from a single worm or a collection of worms. The cumulative force distribution curve for individuals typically consists of 200 data points, and for a population at least 2000. Fig. 4c shows the cumulative force distribution curve for wild-type (WT, age = 60 hrs) individuals. We find variability in the f95 values between individuals suggesting that some animals are naturally stronger than others, even though their body diameters are very similar (5% variation of mean body diameter).Resistance to locomotion in the pillar arena determines maximal forces The purpose of our study is to establish a reliable measure for C. elegans strength that is equivalent to maximum voluntary force in humans. To achieve this, we sought to identify micropillar forest designs that create high mechanical resistance to locomotion. Analogous to human strength evaluation where strong forces are registered when resistance to motion is high (c.f. Fig. 1a), we expect that animals in tight pillar arenas experience strong resistance to locomotion and produce large forces. Below we show results supporting that animals produce strong forces in highly resistive arenas and discuss the existence of different regimes of resistance to locomotion based on the size of nematode relative to gap between pillars. Highly resistive pillar environment is characterized by low velocity and strong forces To identify an arena geometry that induces high resistance to locomotion and makes C. elegans produce maximal forces frequently we fabricated a composite arena (Fig. 5a) that contained three regions (A1, A2, and A3) with distinct pillar diameters (in the range of a ≈ 40 – 60 μm) and gap between pillars (s ≈ 100 – 60 μm) (Supplementary Note 3). Regions A1, A2 and A3 produced confinement levels of D/s ≈ 0.67, 0.85, and 1.16 for wild type adults respectively (Fig. 5b). The composite arena is unique as it allowed us to investigate the dependence of force-velocity correlation and gait parameters on animal confinement. Figure 5. Resistance to locomotion determines maximal forces. Open in a new tab (a) A composite micropillar arena containing sections A1, A2, and A3 with different pillar spacings to investigate the influence of animal confinement on force generation. Scale bar, 5 mm. (b) The same nematode shown in the three different arenas. The level of confinement (D/s) increases as the worm crawls from arena A1 to A3. Scale bar, 100 μm. The force-velocity data for animals in (c) A1, (d) A2, and (e) A3 arenas. The lines indicate force-velocity cut-offs of 80 μN and 600 μm/s. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours.Pooling data from individuals (WT, age = 84 hrs), in Fig. 5c-e we show the maximal pillar force (from each image) versus the instantaneous animal velocity in the three arenas. We observe that in the moderately confined A1 arena, animals move at velocities as large as 600 μm/s and rarely exert forces more than 80 μN (Fig. 5c). In contrast, animals in the strongly confining A3 arena move at much slower velocities and often exert forces > 80 μN (Fig. 5e). Such large forces occur less frequently in arena A2 (Fig. 5d). Scoring the forward crawling locomotion, we find that between A1 and A3 arenas, the body wavelength reduces by 12% and amplitude varies by 3%, suggesting that in the moderate-strong confinement regime the force-velocity correlation is much more strongly affected than the forward crawling gait. Frequent exertion of maximal forces in A3 arena can be understood from the high mechanical resistance to locomotion provided by this tight pillar arena where the nematode muscles push against the pillar, but its body cannot adjust its position in response to reaction forces due to the body being constrained simultaneously by multiple pillars. Evidence for the strong mechanical resistance is exemplified by the high frequency of turns and reversals in the highly resistive A3 and A2 arenas compared to A1 (Fig. 6). Figure 6. Behavioral phenotyping of C. elegans in pillar arenas with different confinements. Open in a new tab The frequency of reversals and turns is higher under tighter confinement due to strong mechanical resistance of the pillar environment. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours.Identification of different regimes of resistance to locomotion Our experimental results thus far and previous work in pillar environments22–24, 35–38 (see Supplementary Table 2 for description of pillar geometries used in prior works), paint the following general picture; depending on the body size and pillar forest geometry, C. elegans locomotion between microfluidic pillars can be classified as non-resistive, moderately resistive or highly resistive. The existence of such regimes has been previously unrecognized. In the non-resistive regime, the submerged nematode is typically in contact with one or two pillars (Fig. 7a). The forces would be low here because the nematode translates and rotates in response to a body contact with a pillar, exhibiting swimming-like behavior. An example of this regime was shown by Majmudar et al., where for D/s = 0.17, nematode swim trajectories were observed to be diverted by mechanical interactions with the pillars38. Figure 7. Schematic illustrating the effect of animal confinement on mechanical resistance and force generation in pillar environments. Open in a new tab The nematode experiences increasing confinement (D/s) from left to right due to increasing density of pillars. (a) Weak resistance, D/s = 0.2, (b) moderate resistance, D/s = 0.6, and (c) strong resistance, D/s = 1.0. Large forces are expected under strong confinement due to enhanced mechanical resistance and constrained body shapes. The operating confinement regime of our NemaFlex system is highlighted.In the moderately resistive regime, frequent contacts with more than two pillars occur (Fig. 7b) and the body wave conveniently fits into the space between pillars; the velocity is high because pillars provide transverse resistance enabling efficient forward locomotion. Forces are moderate because the nematode can fit in the available space with only minor adjustment of body posture. This picture is consistent with our results in A1 arena and further supported by the work of Ryu and coworkers36 who showed that when D/s ≈ 0.35 – 0.5 C. elegans swimming speed is enhanced. In the highly-resistive regime which corresponds to our arenas A2 and A3, frequent contacts with multiple pillars occur (Fig. 7c). Animal velocity is low and forces are high because of the incompatibility between nematode gait and pillar configuration. Our observations are in agreement with the work by Johari et al. and Khare et al., who used arenas with D/s = 0.86 -1.6 and showed that animals exert strong forces23, 24. The existence of these regimes indicates that NemaFlex device needs to operate in the highly resistive regime to score MEF. However, even in this highly resistive regime, individual pillar forces fluctuate from low to high as evidenced by our cumulative force distribution curves, thus requiring robust measurement and data analysis protocols for standardized strength measurement. Previous works have been unable to establish behavior- and gait-independent measures of strength that are indicative of MVF in C. elegans.Maximum exertable force f95 is a reliable measure to score muscle strength in C. elegans In this section, we show that MEF, our proposed metric of C. elegans strength, yields consistent values in highly resistive pillar arenas and that it is independent of gait and behavior. By using a drug that contracts muscles we confirm that MEF due to induced muscle contractions is the same as that calculated from force distribution due to voluntary muscle action. Finally, we demonstrate that MEF can be used to reliably score neuromuscular weakness in mutants. Optimized pillar arena produces consistent readout of MEF Given that even in the highly resistive pillar environments forces fluctuate, we asked whether MEF for the same individual changes due to different degrees of confinement in A1, A2, and A3 arenas. Our hypothesis was that if MEF is truly indicative of the maximum voluntary force then in the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 we should obtain the same values for MEF. In Fig. 8a, we show the results for individual wild-type animals and find that the MEF in arenas A2 and A3 show a near-perfect correlation ( f95A2≅f95A3, calculated slope = 1.01 ± 0.05) while MEF is lower in A1 arena with a slope = 0.46 ± 0.07 shown in Fig. 8b. Thus f95 is consistent between the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas. Figure 8. Highly resistive pillar arenas produce consistent maximum exertable force. Open in a new tab A comparison between maximum exertable force f95 measured for WT individuals in (a) section A2 and section A3 (n = 14, slope = 1.01 ± 0.05, r2 = 0.65) and (b) in section A1 and section A3 (n=13, slope = 0.46 ± 0.07, r2 = -0.55). A similar comparison is shown for unc-112 animals (n=13 individuals) in (c) A2 and A3 (n = 12, slope 0.99 ± 0.04, r2 = 0.67) and (d) A1 and A3 (n= 10, slope = 0.81 ± 0.07, r2 = -0.25). Comparison for lon-2 animals (n=10 individuals) in (e) A2 and A3 (n=9, slope=0.98± 0.05, r2 = 0.72) and (f) A1 and A3 (n= 8, slope = 0.75 ± 0.07, r2 = 0.67). The red line is the best-fit curve to the data, and the dashed black line has a slope of unity and passes through origin. The blue lines demarcate the 95% confidence interval region.We also tested unc-112, a mutant that is weaker due to muscle defects26 and lon-2, a mutant that grows approximately 1.5 times longer than wild type. For unc-112, we find that the correlation of MEF values in arenas A1 and A3 is off from unity (slope = 0.81 ± 0.07), but in A2 and A3 we again observe a near-perfect correlation with slope 0.99 ± 0.04 (Fig. 8c, d). We find similar results for lon-2 which shows a correlation with slope 0.98 ± 0.05 in arenas A2 and A3 (Fig. 8e, f). Thus, in WT, unc-112 and lon-2 we obtain consistent f95 in the highly resistive A2 and A3 arenas. Previously Johari et al.23 and Khare et al.24 computed the time-average of the pillar forces favg to characterize C. elegans muscle force. We checked to see how well this measure correlates from the force data of individuals in A1, A2 and A3 arenas. We find that favg from different arenas are inconsistent in WT animals and unc-112 mutant (see Supplementary Note 4), suggesting that f95 is a much more reliable metric of strength. Thus, our results from the composite arena provide compelling evidence that both the highly resistive arenas A2 and A3 maximize force exertion, and our strength metric f95 is invariant for a given individual as long as animals are confined to 0.85 < D/s < 1.16. We settled on using A3 arena for the NemaFlex device since maximal forces are more frequent in this arena than A2 arena (Fig. 5d,e) and smaller body-sized animals fit better in A3. The actual dimensions of the NemaFlex device are: a = 38.3 μm ± 0.4 μm, s = 61.7 μm ± 2.9 μm, h =71.8 ± 2.9 μm, with the pillars arranged in a square lattice within a ≈ 1 cm2 oval shaped arena (Fig. 1b). It is possible that the limits of validity of confinement that we have established here to obtain consistent MEF readout may vary, for example for C. elegans of different sizes or mutants. In such cases, the composite-arena approach with individuals that we have demonstrated here is a useful means to identify the optimal confinement range for maximum force exertion.MEF is independent of locomotory gait To address whether the locomotory gait impacts MEF in the NemaFlex device we isolated episodes from our videos where the animal (WT, age = 60 hrs) was making a forward crawl or omega turn or reversal (Fig. 9a-d). We note that the forward crawl involved either a long-wave or a short-wave body posture with the short-wave being less frequent (Fig. 9a,b). The cumulative probability force distributions corresponding to each of these locomotory modes is shown in Fig. 9e. We find that the omega turns and reversals produce larger average force; however, the MEF estimates are very similar: f95 (long wave) = 20.98 μN, f95 (short wave) = 21.04 μN, f95 (reversal) = 22.38 μN, and f95 (omega) = 21.32 μN. Thus, the strength measure MEF provided by NemaFlex is not strongly dependent on animal gait. Figure 9. NemaFlex quantitates maximum exertable force independent of C. elegans gait. Open in a new tab (a) Images showing the different gaits exhibited by crawling WT C. elegans in the pillar arena of the NemaFlex device. The arrows show direction of the animal motion. (b) The cumulative force distribution for the different gaits shown in (a). The horizontal dashed line indicates 95% probability, and the vertical bar highlights that the f95 values for each gait are very similar. Animal age = 60 hrs and D/s = 0.87 – 0.98.MEF is insensitive to time-variation of behavior Next, we evaluated whether MEF is sensitive to time variation of behavior by recording behavioral episodes of individuals. In a 30-second behavioral episode we typically observed forward crawls, omega turns, and reversals (c.f. Fig. 6). We analyzed contiguous images of 30-second duration with a random starting point in the video. In complementary sampling, we scored non-repeating, discrete images randomly (totaling 30-second duration) from the full behavioral episode. The f95 of individuals calculated either from contiguous or random sampling of the behavior is shown in Fig. 10a,b. We find that in both contiguous and discrete sampling f95 typically varied by less than 10% of the mean value. This less than 10% variation is commensurate with the error in force measurement shown in Fig. 3 indicating therefore that MEF is insensitive to short-time variation in behavior. Figure 10. Maximum exertable force is independent of C. elegans behavior in the NemaFlex pillar arena. Open in a new tab (a) MEF of WT individuals obtained from analyzing contiguous frames of 30-second duration with a randomly sampled starting point in the movie (movie length is 85 – 120 seconds). Data is shown as mean ± SD from N = 5 sampling trials. 17 individuals showed SD < 10%, while three showed SD between 10 - 16%. (b) MEF values obtained from non-repeating randomly sampled discrete frames. The movie sets are the same as in (a). Data is shown as mean ± SD from N = 5 trials. In this case all 20 individuals showed SD < 10%. (c) MEF of individuals evaluated at three time points: 0, 2, and 2.5 hours. Here a 2-minute episode was captured for each worm and a contiguous 30-second episode was analyzed to obtain MEF. Animal age = 60 hrs and D/s = 0.85 – 0.95.We also sampled the behavior of an individual after a long time interval (0, 2, 2.5 hrs), and in this case the f95 values change by less than 10% between the three time points (Fig. 10c). Thus, the MEF is also unaffected by long-time variation in behavior. Together, these results suggest that sampling a 30-second behavioral episode is sufficient to determine the MEF of C. elegans and does not rely strongly on the details of behavior. We note that for some mutants it is possible that longer behavioral episodes may need to be tracked to achieve a statistically invariant MEF.MEF before and after drug-induced muscle contractions is the same As an important test to assess whether MEF measure corresponds to the maximum muscular strength, we induced muscle contractions by exposing each animal to the cholinergic agonist levamisole and comparing its f95 scores before and after drug treatment (Fig. 11a). Levamisole is known to bind to acetylcholine receptors in the body wall muscle of C. elegans, causing prolonged excitation of the muscles, shortening of body length, and eventually paralysis39. As shown in Fig. 11b, we indeed observe appreciable reduction in body length due to levamisole exposure (Supplementary Movie 4a & b). Figure 11. NemaFlex quantitates maximum muscular strength in C. elegans. Open in a new tab (a) A brief protocol for imaging and inducing muscle contraction on individual wild-type C. elegans with 1 mM levamisole. A 60-second episode is captured for each animal before levamisole treatment, and capturing continues for 60 to 200 seconds after the induction. (b) Levamisole treatment-induced muscle contraction causes the body length to decrease by 10.4 ± 3.2%. (age = 60 – 84 hrs, n=51, p < 0.0005). (c) Maximum strength of individual animals before and after the levamisole treatment for three different age groups – 60 hrs (n = 15), 76 hrs (n = 14) and 84 hrs (n = 20). The red line is a linear best fit of the pooled data: slope =1.09 +/− 0.06, intercept = -0.006, and r2 =0.89. Dashed blue lines show the 95% level confidence interval (n =49). The dashed black line represents f95lev+ = f95lev- (slope of 1 and intercept at origin). A two sample t-test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring the maximum muscular strength of the animal (p =0.24). For this data set, D/s = 0.95 - 1.02. (d) Comparison of population-level force distribution for wild type (n=20, N=3,475 data points) and three C. elegans muscular or neuromuscular mutants unc-52 (n=12, N=14,883 data points), unc-112 (n=5, N=2,992 data points), and unc-17 (n=20, N=6,997 data points). Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring neuromuscular weakness (p > 0.005). For this data set, D/s = 0.85 - 0.92.In Fig. 11c, we show the force data for individual animals of three different ages (60, 76, and 84 hours) and find that the f95 value after levamisole treatment shows an excellent linear correlation with the f95 score of untreated crawling worms, i.e. f95lev+ ≅ f95lev- (slope for 60 hrs = 0.89 ± 0.19, slope for 76 hrs = 0.85 ± 0.13, and slope for 84 hrs = 1.08 ± 0.16), supporting that MEF quantitates the maximum muscular strength of C. elegans. It is remarkable that even though some animals are weak or strong to begin with due to differences in age or individual variability, the f95 after drug exposure correlates well for both the weak and strong animals, highlighting the robustness of our strength measure.MEF detects muscle strength weakness in mutants Given that NemaFlex measures the maximum strength of C. elegans, we tested its capability to detect strength changes due to genetic defects in body wall muscles and neuromuscular signaling. We measured strength in the muscle mutants unc-112 and unc-52, which have impaired production of the sarcomere proteins kindlin and perlecan respectively9, 40, 41. We also tested the mutant unc-17, which has decreased levels of acetylcholine, one of the major neurotransmitters responsible for muscle contractions39, 42. In all three mutants, we found that force production decreased compared to wild-type animals (f95 =11.92, 16.61, 22.74 μN, and 28.43 μN for unc-112, unc-52, unc-17, and wild-type respectively; Fig. 11d), confirming that the NemaFlex method can reveal neuromuscular weakness.Influence of body size on muscular strength in C. elegans Harnessing the full capability of NemaFlex for applications ranging from dissecting developmental biology to understanding neuromuscular disorders and aging requires evaluation of how C. elegans’ body size affects its muscular strength. For example, individuals from a synchronized culture of WT animals have differences in body size (Supplementary Figure 5), raising the question of whether some animals appear stronger simply because of their larger size. A similar question arises during mutant screenings in which some mutants may be smaller than WT or might develop more slowly than WT and therefore might be smaller at the time of comparison. In aging studies, it is also essential to decouple the strength changes due to frailty from those that might be attributed to animal size, which can change during adult life43. Muscular strength depends strongly on body diameter but not length To address the influence of body size, we measured the mid-body diameter, length, and strength of at least 80 age-matched individuals of WT and lon-2 mutants, which are longer than wild type (Fig. 12a-d). We find that even though the mean length of lon-2 mutants is ≈1.3 times that of wild-type animals (Fig. 12a, b), the muscular strength of these two populations is not statistically different (Fig. 12c), suggesting that the worm body length does not significantly influence the muscle strength recorded by NemaFlex. In striking contrast, we observe a strong increase of muscle strength with the worm body diameter (Fig. 12d). The data fit to the scaling relationship f95 ~ Dm, with m = 3.32 ± 0.48 and 3.04 ± 0.30 for WT and lon-2 animals respectively. Figure 12. Influence of body size on C. elegans muscle strength. Open in a new tab (a) Influence of the body length was evaluated by comparing the force production of wild type (top image) and a lon-2 mutant (bottom image). Scale bar, 200 μm. (b) Distribution of the body lengths of wild type (n = 89) and lon-2 (n = 37) at a single time point (48 hours) for similar diameter worms. The lon-2 worms are ≈ 1.3 times longer than wild type. (c) The strength distributions of wild-type and lon-2 worms are statistically similar. Animal populations are the same as in (b). (d) Both wild type (n = 94) and lon-2 (n = 84) show approximately a cubic dependency of strength on body diameter. MEF data for each population was binned using bin widths of 2.5 μm. Data shown is mean ± SD. (e) Active bending of worm body curvature produces pillar forces. The vector sum of the pillar forces (red arrows) is zero in (i). The nematode pushes pillars when trying to (ii) increase or (iii) decrease its curvature. Increase of the curvature is induced by tension from contracting muscles (red in (ii), green shows relaxing muscle). Similarly, decrease of the curvature is initiated by transferring the tension to the other pair of muscles (red in (iii)) by initiating contraction in the relaxed muscle section. Scale bar, 200 μm. (f) Bending moment analysis in the human muscle arm that is lifting a weight. See main text for description of the symbols. (g) A schematic of the worm body segment under active bending where muscles are shown as (i) springs resembling the contraction and relaxation of muscles. T is the muscle tension in the worm, D is the body diameter, F is the pillar force and s is the pillar spacing. (ii) Animals with larger diameters have more muscle cross-sectional area and therefore produce more force.To understand the relationship between worm body diameter and muscular strength, we consider active bending of the worm body that produces pillar forces whose vector sum is nearly zero (Fig. 12e, i). These pillar forces are produced by C. elegans due to changes in body curvature induced by contraction or relaxation of its muscles. For the example shown in Fig. 12e, the curvature increase is induced by tension in the dorsal contracting muscle (Fig. 12e, ii), and it is decreased during dorsal relaxation (Fig. 12e, iii). The reason why thick animals exert higher forces is analogous to why thick elastic rods require more force to bend than thin rods. This qualitative argument may explain the influence of body diameter on C. elegans’ maximal muscle strength measures.A biomechanics model explains D3 scaling To develop a simple model that incorporates the effect of body diameter, we consider the bending moment (M) induced in the muscles of a human arm that is lifting a weight (F), i.e. M = F×L, where L is the lever arm (Fig. 12f). Applying this analogy to the bending moment introduced in the worm muscles while pushing against pillars, we get M = F×L ~ T×D, where T is the muscle tension in the worm body (Fig. 12g). Assuming the muscle tension is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the muscle (Am) and the lever arm is equivalent to pillar spacing, we have F ~ Am×D/s. Since Am is proportional to the worm body cross-section, i.e. Am ~ D2, we finally have F~D3/s (2) Eqn. (2) suggests that f95 should scale as the cube of worm body diameter and is inversely proportional to the pillar spacing. We tested the relation F ~ D3, by considering wild-type animals of different age and three mutants (Table 2). We find that the data agrees reasonably well with the predicted cubic dependence on worm body diameter in all the tested cases. Interestingly, we observe that even in animals (WT, age = 48, 55 hrs) that have confinement less than our optimal range of 0.85 – 1.16, the exponent is close to 3. Furthermore, the fact that the f95 values of individuals were lower in arena A1, which has larger pillar spacing than arenas A2 and A3 is consistent with Eqn. (2). Indeed, we find that the ratios of f95 in A3 and A1 are approximately inversely proportional to the pillar spacing in the respective arena sections, supporting our simple scaling analysis. Table 2.

In such cases deviations from D3 scaling can be potentially corrected by knowing the detailed anatomy of the muscle cross-sectional area. If deviations still exist then it might indicate intrinsic differences in the tension of the muscle fibers in the nematode. Investigation of such differences resulting from genetic defects or age is one of the main motivations for the development of the NemaFlex system.IV. Conclusions and Outlook C. elegans is a powerful genetic model with conserved muscle biology, and over the last few decades new insights have been gained into the assembly, maintenance, and regulation of striated muscle that are usually applicable to all animals. Kinematic measures, for example swim frequency or crawling speed, derived from locomotory assays have been typically used to assess neuromuscular function in C. elegans44. More recently, propulsive forces have been determined by tracking velocity fields and body kinematics during swimming45 by challenging worms to swim up inclined surfaces46 and by measuring drag coefficients of crawling animals47. In a parallel effort, building on advances in microfluidics48, important attempts for measuring forces generated by moving C. elegans have been made using piezoresistance sensors20 and deformable pillars22–26. However, these prior efforts reported forces that vary depending on pillar arena geometry, worm velocity, and body posture;thus, none of these yields a maximum force that is independent of animal behavior and accounts for variations in animal size. Without a behavior- and size-independent strength measurement, it is difficult to standardize muscle force investigations in C. elegans. Here we have optimized the micropillar forest design, defined the measurement conditions, and fine-tuned the workflow analysis so that NemaFlex can reliably score the maximum exertable force in C. elegans. To confirm that NemaFlex indeed reports behavior-independent strength, we evaluated different pillar spacings and duration of behavioral episodes and showed that animals push as hard as they can once they reach a certain level of confinement; a behavioral episode as low as 30 seconds is sufficient to capture a statistically invariant MEF for young adults. The force measures before and after levamisole-induced full muscle contractions were found to be similar, which supports our metric of maximum force. Indeed, the levamisole experiment shows that C. elegans MEF is similar to human MVF - a critical advance for the ability to compare experimental data across muscle studies. Recognizing that animals from the same culture might have different body sizes or that mutations may cause variation in body size, we investigated the influence of body size on MEF. We showed that MEF is independent of the body length, but it strongly depends on body diameter. Importantly, we uncovered a relationship of strength with C. elegans diameter that is consistent with a scaling analysis in which bending moments due to maximum external force and internal muscle tension balance each other. Thus, we have produced a compensation factor for body size that enables animals of different age, genetic makeup, or experience to be fairly compared. In humans, relative strength is a compelling indicator of muscle homeostasis, physical training, and disease. As we model these conditions in invertebrates, there is a critical need to establish standardized measures of strength that have relevance in human muscle physiology. The NemaFlex technology addresses this gap by providing a robust analog of MVF in vertebrates. With current throughput of strength evaluation being ~10 min/worm (loading, imaging, image analysis, and validation), the NemaFlex system is well equipped for targeted investigations on disease conditions that can be modeled in C. elegans. High throughput genetic and drug screens are also possible with NemaFlex, although this would require further microfluidic automation and parallelized analysis. At a more fundamental level, NemaFlex may help in defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function49.Supplementary Material esi MS974538-supplement-esi.pdf (1.9MB, pdf) movie1 Download video file (6.7MB, avi) movie2 Download video file (7.3MB, avi) movie3 Download video file (3.9MB, avi) movie4 Download video file (3.6MB, avi) movie5 Download video file (5.4MB, avi) movie6 Download video file (6.3MB, avi) Acknowledgments This work was partially supported by funding from NASA (Grant No. NNX15AL16G),  (Grant Nos.
