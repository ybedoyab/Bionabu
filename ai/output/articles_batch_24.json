    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The difficulty in re-growing and mineralizing new bone after severe fracture can result in loss of ambulation or limb. Here we describe the sequential roles of FGF-2 in inducing gene expression, cell growth and BMP-2 in gene expression and mineralization of bone.Materials and methods The regulation of gene expression was determined using real-time RTPCR (qRTPCR) and cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation or fluorescent analysis of DNA content in MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like cells. Photomicroscopy was used to identify newly mineralized tissue and fluorescence was used to quantify mineralization.Results Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) had the greatest ability to induce proliferation after 24 hours of treatment when compared to transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). We found that FGF-2 caused the most significant induction of expression of early growth response-1 (egr-1), fgf-2, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2), tgfβ and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp-3) associated with proliferation and expression of angiogenic genes like vascular endothelial growth factor A (vegfA) and its receptor vegfr1. We found that FGF-2 significantly reduced gene expression associated with mineralization, e.g. collagen type-1 (col1a1), fibronectin (fn), osteocalcin (oc), IGF-1, noggin, bone morphogenic protein (bmp-2) and alkaline phosphatase (alp). In contrast, BMP-2 significantly stimulated expression of the mineralization associated genes but had little or no effect on gene expression associated with growth.Conclusions The ability of FGF-2 to re-program a mineralizing gene expression profile to one of proliferation suggests that FGF-2 plays a critical role of osteoblast growth in early fracture repair while BMP-2 is instrumental in stimulating mineralization.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The mechanisms that regulate bone growth and mineralization remain poorly understood. The cellular events involved in bone formation include chemotaxis of osteoblast precursors, growth factor (GF) production, proliferation of committed osteoblast precursors, and the differentiation (mineralization) of osteoblasts. Bone formation requires expression of structural proteins such as collagen type I, osteocalcin, noggin and runx2 during mineralization [1]. Numerous studies suggest that a variety of growth factors such as FGF-2, TGFβ, IGF-1, PDGF and PGE2 act as autocrine and paracrine hormones to regulate bone cell proliferation [2]. FGF-2 is an important modulator of bone formation in vitro and in vivo [3,4]. FGF-2 is tightly bound to the bone matrix and can be extracted as a biologically active GF [5] and is thought to play a major role in wound healing [6,7]. To evaluate the physiological activity of FGF-2 and other growth factors, we studied their relative ability to influence proliferation of osteoblasts at a site of injury in a mineralized culture. MC3T3-E1 is a cloned mouse osteoblast-like cell line that retains synthetic functions of bone. When treated with differentiation media, these cultured osteoblasts have the ability to differentiate, including synthesis of alkaline phosphatase [8], type I collagen [9], osteocalcin [10,11] and mineralized matrix containing hydroxyapatite crystals [12]. We have previously reported that FGF-2 is induced by mechanical stress [13,14] and causes proliferation after mechanical stress. FGF-2 is an immediate-early gene that is regulated by both PKA and MAPK signal transduction pathways [15]. Here we report that FGF-2 induces expression of growth-related genes and down-regulates genes responsible for differentiation and mineralization. In addition, BMP-2 is considerably more effective than FGF-2 in inducing new mineralization.",

TGFβ stimulated thymidine incorporation more than 2 fold while FGF-2 and PGE2 increased DNA synthesis more than 4.5 and 3.3 fold respectively. Table 1.

Regulation of FGF-2 induced gene expression Using qRTPCR, we found that FGF-2 dramatically induced egf-1, fgf-2, cox-2, tgfβ, mmp3, vegfA and vegfr1 over a 24 hour period each displaying a different sequential temporal pattern of gene induction (Figure 1). VegfA and vegfr1 are associated with angiogenesis while mmp3, is associated with increased migration. Tgfβ, fgf-2, egr-1 and cox-2 are key genes in regulation of osteoblast proliferation. Figure 1. Open in a new tab qRTPCR analysis of gene induction of proliferation and angiogenesis; qRTPCR analysis of gene reduction of genes over 24 hours of treatment with FGF-2 shows a significant increase in genes associated with proliferation and angiogenesis.

(*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 with two-tail student t-test compared to 0 hour of each gene)Interestingly, we found that FGF-2 also significantly decreased expression of other genes associated with mineralization including col1a1, fn, bmp-2, oc, run-x, and noggin. IGF-1, a known differentiation factor, was significantly decreased by FGF-2 treatment. (Figure 2). Figure 2.

(*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 with two-tail student t-test compare to 0 hour of each gene.) Relative abundance of genes regulated by FGF-2 and BMP-2 Since FGF-2 increased growth associated genes, we used BMP-2, a known promoter of mineralization, to study relative abundance of gene expression in mineralizing cells after 24 hours of treatment. As seen in Table 2, we found that BMP-2 treatment caused significant increases in genes associated with mineralization including cola1, fn, noggin and oc. Moreover, BMP-2 treatment caused little or no changes in expression of genes associated with angiogenesis and migration e.g. VEGF and MMP3. When compared with relative gene abundance of FGF-2 treated cells (Figure 3) we found that in general, BMP-2 maintained the mineralizing RNA profile of igf-1, alp, and bmp-2 and significantly increased expression of other genes associated with mineralization like col1a1, fn, ilgf-1, noggin and oc. Fgf-2, on the other hand, significantly suppressed expression of mineralizing genes. Table 2. Relative abundance of gene expression in FGF-2 and BMP-2 treated cells.

Once cells were confluent, media was changed to 5% NM or 5% mineralizing media with or without 5 ng/ml FGF-2 or 50 ng/ml BMP-2. Two days after treatment, media was removed and cells were fixed in 10% formalin and stored at 4°C until subsequent analysis. Cells were stained for calcium with 2% Alizarin Red for 10 minutes and visualized under 20× objectives for photography. Many areas of mineralization, as seen by bright red staining, were present in the cells treated with 5% MM plus 50 ng/ml BMP-2 (FIG. 11). Little to no mineralization was seen with other 5 treatments.Table 3.

    "discussion": "Discussion Bone formation during injury repair is a multi-step series of events modulated by an integrated cascade of gene expression that initially supports the proliferation stage. The later mineralization stage is associated with the sequential expression of genes that support biosynthesis, organization and mineralization of the bone extracellular matrix. Mineralization requires expression of structural proteins such as collagen type I, osteocalcin, as well as noggin and runx2 which aid in mineralization [1]. Transcriptional control defines the regulatory events necessary for both stages of bone formation [23]. There is a general consensus that during injury GFs are released from the wounded bone matrix and promote healing [24]. In this study, we have documented the relative efficiency of bone growth factors FGF-2, TGFβ, and PGE2 markedly enhanced the synthesis of the total protein content of the dishes (Table 1) Rate of proliferation was dependent on the specific GF. FGF-2, TGFβ and PGE2 significantly promote growth, with FGF-2 having the highest efficacy and the lowest dose. FGF-2 produced a distinct pattern of gene expression. FGF-2 down regulates genes associated with mineralization while it induces genes associated with proliferation and angiogenesis, a finding supported by observations of others [25]. Since cox-2 had a 27-fold induction by FGF-2, we examined the effect of the COX-2 product, PGE2 on proliferation. We found that PGE2 increased DNA synthesis by 3.3 fold significantly higher than TGFβ, IGF-1, PDGF, suggesting that its induction by FGF-2 helps complete the FGF-2 full induction of osteoblast growth. These data also suggest that FGF-2 may be an important regulator of migration, angiogenesis and proliferation during the first stage of healing a critical defect since it induces mmp3, vegfa and vegfr1 expression. In data not shown, FGF-2 had no effect on expression of mmp-1. Moreover, FGF-2 induced its own message as well as TGFβ, but significantly reduced expression of BMP-2, osteocalcin, noggin, runx2, collagen type I and IGF-1, genes which are associated with mineralization. As described by others, bone formation is divided into two phases, proliferation and mineralization [2,26-29]. These two stages are the result of a specific sequential regulation of gene expression from the early phase of osteoblast proliferation to the final steps of mineralization. Once the cells start mineralizing, cell division and DNA synthesis dramatically slow down and eventually cease. When an injury occurs in mineralized tissue, GFs like FGF-2 are released and start a new proliferation stage to heal the defect. The increase in cell replication in a mineralizing cell likely represents a de-differentiation from the mineralizing phase to the growing phase, and increases expression of GFs most likely induce proliferation. Treatment of the mineralized defect model with FGF-2 resulted in gene expression that corresponds to de-differentiation (e.g. significant increases in growth related genes egf-1, fgf-2, cox-2, TGFβ, vegfA, vegfr and mmp3 and down-regulation of mineralizing related genes). Vegf and vegfr1 are primary regulators of angiogenesis, while MMP3 is thought to play a major role on cell behaviors such as proliferation and migration [30] which may explain the ability of the FGF-2 to enable the cultured cells to fill the defect void efficiently. The fact that FGF-2 induces its own expression suggests that after injury, the FGF-2 released from the wound matrix could promote it's own expression, making it a feed-forward loop. Although Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate the relative FGF-2 regulation and sequential expression of growth, angiogenic and chemotactic genes and depresses expression of mineralization-related genes, these figures do not tell us the relative abundance of the genes. In Table 2, we determined the relative abundance of genes in three groups after 24 hours; with or without treatment with FGF-2 or BMP-2. FGF-2 caused a significant increase in abundance of genes associated with proliferation, chemotaxis and angiogenesis. Moreover, the addition of FGF-2 to the mineralized wounded cultures caused a marked decrease in abundance of col1a1 as well as fn, igf-1, noggin, oc, bmp-2 and alp message. In the early stages of mineralization, the major protein (greater than 20%) synthesized by the osteoblast is collagen, however collagen is not a major component of the proliferating cell, suggesting that FGF-2 stimulates proliferation partly through its ability to drastically reduce the relative abundance of a majority of the mineralizing-associated genes. The dramatic reduction of IGF-1 by FGF-2 suggests a role for IGF-1 in mineralization, this is in agreement with findings of others that demonstrated IGF-1 to be a major factor in bone mineralization [31-33] using the IGF-1 null mouse. In contrast, in cells treated with BMP-2, the relative abundance of col1a1, fn, oc, and tgfβ were dramatically induced while BMP-2 had no significant effect on genes related to growth, angiogenesis or chemotaxis. These data suggest that BMP-2 may be the best GF to use for the mineralization stage but not the proliferation stage of bone formation. This finding may help explain studies by others [34] who discovered that a delayed administration of BMP-2 to a fracture resulted in better repair of critical size defects. It is likely that the delay of BMP-2 treatment allowed a longer period of proliferation prior to BMP-2 promotion of mineralization. Our findings in Table 2, 3 and Figure 3 support the hypothesis that FGF-2 and BMP-2 are required at different stages of bone repair.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusions These data demonstrate the de-differentiation (reduction of mineralization genes) effect of FGF-2 likely plays a key role in osteoblast proliferation, the first stage of bone formation. Some have expressed concern that ex-vivo proliferation of human stem cells by a growth factor like FGF-2 might change the osteogenic characteristics of a pre-osteoblast; however others have shown that expansion of the population does not affect later osteogenic potential [35] of stem cells. Therefore, an expansion of osteoblast cells by FGF-2 might be an excellent strategy for first stage re-population of a critical defect since FGF-2 has the needed efficacy for promoting proliferation. These data also suggest that the final stage of bone repair is best accomplished with BMP-2 due to its promotion of differentiation and mineralization.",

MC3T3-E1 is a cloned mouse osteoblast-like cell line that retains synthetic functions of bone. When treated with differentiation media, these cultured osteoblasts have the ability to differentiate, including synthesis of alkaline phosphatase [8], type I collagen [9], osteocalcin [10,11] and mineralized matrix containing hydroxyapatite crystals [12]. We have previously reported that FGF-2 is induced by mechanical stress [13,14] and causes proliferation after mechanical stress. FGF-2 is an immediate-early gene that is regulated by both PKA and MAPK signal transduction pathways [15]. Here we report that FGF-2 induces expression of growth-related genes and down-regulates genes responsible for differentiation and mineralization. In addition, BMP-2 is considerably more effective than FGF-2 in inducing new mineralization.Materials and methods Materials We obtained GFs from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA. FGF-2 and IGF-1 from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. TGFβ, PDGF and dmPGE2 are from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Cell culture supplies (αMEM, fetal calf serum, trypsin and antibiotics) were obtained through the tissue culture facility at the University of California, San Francisco. Cell culture dishes were purchased from Corning, Corning, New York. Rhodamine-phalloidin is from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California. Tritiated thymidine and 35 S methionine are from Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL. All other materials came from standard laboratory suppliers. MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like cells, a cloned cell line, established by Kodama [8,12] were used in this study at early passage number.Methods We maintained cloned MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells in normal media (NM) consisting of alpha MEM medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% antibiotic solution and 1% glutamine solution and subcultured the cells every 3 to 4 days. The cells were subcultured by incubating with trypsin for five minutes and resuspending at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/ml. For experiments, we grew the cells in the NM above, using multi-well plates. After three days, the cells reach confluence and mineralization medium (MM) was added. MM is alpha MEM medium with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% antibiotic solution and 1% glutamine solution supplemented with ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) and β-glycerol phosphate (10 mM) to support mineralization. The cultures were then incubated for 1-2 more days for mineralization studies. We used at least triplicate independent biological samples in multiple experiments for data collection.Protein Assay Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol.Microscopy At the conclusion of the 24 or 48 hour incubation, the coverslip was removed. The specimen was rinsed five times in room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed. We then visualized the mineralizing cells with 2% Alizarin Red. After rinsing in distilled water and air drying the samples, we mounted the coverslips on microscope slides using Fluoromount and examined and photographed the cells on a Zeiss Axioskop using 20×.Tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA At the conclusion of the 24 hour incubation, the culture medium was removed and the cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C in 1 ml PBS containing tritiated thymidine (4 μCi/ml) as described previously [16]. Following this incubation, the PBS was removed and the cells were washed 3 times with ice cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA) followed by ice cold ethanol and allowed to air dry. Then 1 ml of sarkosyl lysing buffer was added to each well; all the cells were solubilized after 30 minutes. Finally, after mixing the resulting solution with a pipette, radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter and protein content was measured. The data was calculated and expressed as disintegrations per minute (DPM) per microgram protein.Alizarin Red visualization of mineralization Alizarin Red (2%) stained cells were incubated with 10% acetic acid for 30 minutes to release bound Alizarin Red into solution. The solution was neutralized with 10% ammonium hydroxide and the absorbance of Alizarin Red was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Data is expressed in absolute amounts according to a standard curve.RNA Isolation RNA were isolated through the use of the RNeasy™Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) or TriReagent™ according to the manufacturer's protocol. For RNeasy™ Mini kit RNA isolation, cells were seeded in 6-well plates with αMEM media supplemented with 10% FCS, then downregulated and activated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were lysed using 350 μl of buffer RLT (supplied in kit) containing 2-mercaptoethanol (Biorad, Hercules, CA). The lysate was then placed into QIAshredder homogenizer (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 2 minutes. 350 μl of 70% ethanol was added to the flow through, mixed, and centrifuged in the RNeasy™Mini column (supplied in kit) for 15 s at 20,000 rpm. Flow through was discarded and the column was washed with 700 μl of buffer RW1 (supplied in kit) for 15 s at 20,000 rpm. Two additional washes were performed with 500 μl of buffer RPE (supplied in kit) at 20,000 rpm for 15 s and 2 minutes, respectively. The flow through was discarded and the column placed in a sterile 1.5 ml collection tube. Depending on the expected yield, 20-50 μl RNase-free water is pipetted into the column and centrifuged for 1 minute at 20,000 rpm. The samples are then stored at -80°C until further analysis.Reverse Transcription (RT) 1.5 μg of RNA was added to 30 μl reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction buffer containing 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dNTPs, 2.5 μM oligo d(T) primer, 2.5 U/μl of MuLV, and 1 U/μl of RNase inhibitor. The RT reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, 42°C for 30 min, inactivated at 99°C for 5 min, and cooled at 5°C for 5 min.Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR Reaction (qRTPCR) 2 μl of cDNA from the RT reaction was added to 20 μl real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) mixture containing 10 μl of 2× SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 12 pmol oligonucleotide primers. PCRs were carried out in a Bio-Rad MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The thermal profile was 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min to activate the Taq polymerase, followed by 50 amplification cycles, consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min 40 s, annealing at 63°C for 1 min 10 s and elongation at 72°C for 1 min 40 s. Fluorescence was measured and used for quantitative purposes. At the end of the amplification period, melting curve analysis was performed to confirm the specificity of the amplicon. RNA samples were normalized to cyclophilin (CPHI) internal standard. Relative quantification of gene expression was calculated by using 2-(Ct gene T - Ct CPHI T)-(Ct gene 0 hr - Ct CPHI 0 hr) equation, where \"Ct gene T\" represents the calculated threshold cycle (Ct) of a time point of each sample other than 0 hr, or each treatment other than control. Relative gene absolute abundance was calculated using 2(Ct gene T - Ct CPHI T) as previously described [17] allows us to compare the abundance of the gene between other genes and experiments. The resulting numbers were then multiplied by 10,000 for better graphical presentation. Primer sequence information was previously published [18-22]. All data derived using qRTPCR was from multiple experiments with at least triplicate independent biological samples.Results Growth factor effect on cell proliferation DNA synthesis As seen in Table 1, in the absence of any added compounds there were small and unremarkable changes in DNA synthesis with IGF-1 and PDGF; in contrast, FGF-2, TGFβ and PGE2 significantly enhanced thymidine incorporation within 24 hours of treatment. TGFβ stimulated thymidine incorporation more than 2 fold while FGF-2 and PGE2 increased DNA synthesis more than 4.5 and 3.3 fold respectively. Table 1.

VegfA and vegfr1 are associated with angiogenesis while mmp3, is associated with increased migration. Tgfβ, fgf-2, egr-1 and cox-2 are key genes in regulation of osteoblast proliferation. Figure 1.

IGF-1, a known differentiation factor, was significantly decreased by FGF-2 treatment. (Figure 2). Figure 2.

(*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 with two-tail student t-test compare to 0 hour of each gene.)Relative abundance of genes regulated by FGF-2 and BMP-2 Since FGF-2 increased growth associated genes, we used BMP-2, a known promoter of mineralization, to study relative abundance of gene expression in mineralizing cells after 24 hours of treatment. As seen in Table 2, we found that BMP-2 treatment caused significant increases in genes associated with mineralization including cola1, fn, noggin and oc. Moreover, BMP-2 treatment caused little or no changes in expression of genes associated with angiogenesis and migration e.g. VEGF and MMP3. When compared with relative gene abundance of FGF-2 treated cells (Figure 3) we found that in general, BMP-2 maintained the mineralizing RNA profile of igf-1, alp, and bmp-2 and significantly increased expression of other genes associated with mineralization like col1a1, fn, ilgf-1, noggin and oc. Fgf-2, on the other hand, significantly suppressed expression of mineralizing genes. Table 2. Relative abundance of gene expression in FGF-2 and BMP-2 treated cells.

Once cells were confluent, media was changed to 5% NM or 5% mineralizing media with or without 5 ng/ml FGF-2 or 50 ng/ml BMP-2. Two days after treatment, media was removed and cells were fixed in 10% formalin and stored at 4°C until subsequent analysis. Cells were stained for calcium with 2% Alizarin Red for 10 minutes and visualized under 20× objectives for photography. Many areas of mineralization, as seen by bright red staining, were present in the cells treated with 5% MM plus 50 ng/ml BMP-2 (FIG. 11). Little to no mineralization was seen with other 5 treatments.Table 3.

The later mineralization stage is associated with the sequential expression of genes that support biosynthesis, organization and mineralization of the bone extracellular matrix. Mineralization requires expression of structural proteins such as collagen type I, osteocalcin, as well as noggin and runx2 which aid in mineralization [1]. Transcriptional control defines the regulatory events necessary for both stages of bone formation [23]. There is a general consensus that during injury GFs are released from the wounded bone matrix and promote healing [24]. In this study, we have documented the relative efficiency of bone growth factors FGF-2, TGFβ, and PGE2 markedly enhanced the synthesis of the total protein content of the dishes (Table 1) Rate of proliferation was dependent on the specific GF. FGF-2, TGFβ and PGE2 significantly promote growth, with FGF-2 having the highest efficacy and the lowest dose. FGF-2 produced a distinct pattern of gene expression. FGF-2 down regulates genes associated with mineralization while it induces genes associated with proliferation and angiogenesis, a finding supported by observations of others [25]. Since cox-2 had a 27-fold induction by FGF-2, we examined the effect of the COX-2 product, PGE2 on proliferation. We found that PGE2 increased DNA synthesis by 3.3 fold significantly higher than TGFβ, IGF-1, PDGF, suggesting that its induction by FGF-2 helps complete the FGF-2 full induction of osteoblast growth. These data also suggest that FGF-2 may be an important regulator of migration, angiogenesis and proliferation during the first stage of healing a critical defect since it induces mmp3, vegfa and vegfr1 expression. In data not shown, FGF-2 had no effect on expression of mmp-1. Moreover, FGF-2 induced its own message as well as TGFβ, but significantly reduced expression of BMP-2, osteocalcin, noggin, runx2, collagen type I and IGF-1, genes which are associated with mineralization. As described by others, bone formation is divided into two phases, proliferation and mineralization [2,26-29]. These two stages are the result of a specific sequential regulation of gene expression from the early phase of osteoblast proliferation to the final steps of mineralization. Once the cells start mineralizing, cell division and DNA synthesis dramatically slow down and eventually cease. When an injury occurs in mineralized tissue, GFs like FGF-2 are released and start a new proliferation stage to heal the defect. The increase in cell replication in a mineralizing cell likely represents a de-differentiation from the mineralizing phase to the growing phase, and increases expression of GFs most likely induce proliferation. Treatment of the mineralized defect model with FGF-2 resulted in gene expression that corresponds to de-differentiation (e.g. significant increases in growth related genes egf-1, fgf-2, cox-2, TGFβ, vegfA, vegfr and mmp3 and down-regulation of mineralizing related genes). Vegf and vegfr1 are primary regulators of angiogenesis, while MMP3 is thought to play a major role on cell behaviors such as proliferation and migration [30] which may explain the ability of the FGF-2 to enable the cultured cells to fill the defect void efficiently. The fact that FGF-2 induces its own expression suggests that after injury, the FGF-2 released from the wound matrix could promote it's own expression, making it a feed-forward loop. Although Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate the relative FGF-2 regulation and sequential expression of growth, angiogenic and chemotactic genes and depresses expression of mineralization-related genes, these figures do not tell us the relative abundance of the genes. In Table 2, we determined the relative abundance of genes in three groups after 24 hours; with or without treatment with FGF-2 or BMP-2. FGF-2 caused a significant increase in abundance of genes associated with proliferation, chemotaxis and angiogenesis. Moreover, the addition of FGF-2 to the mineralized wounded cultures caused a marked decrease in abundance of col1a1 as well as fn, igf-1, noggin, oc, bmp-2 and alp message. In the early stages of mineralization, the major protein (greater than 20%) synthesized by the osteoblast is collagen, however collagen is not a major component of the proliferating cell, suggesting that FGF-2 stimulates proliferation partly through its ability to drastically reduce the relative abundance of a majority of the mineralizing-associated genes. The dramatic reduction of IGF-1 by FGF-2 suggests a role for IGF-1 in mineralization, this is in agreement with findings of others that demonstrated IGF-1 to be a major factor in bone mineralization [31-33] using the IGF-1 null mouse. In contrast, in cells treated with BMP-2, the relative abundance of col1a1, fn, oc, and tgfβ were dramatically induced while BMP-2 had no significant effect on genes related to growth, angiogenesis or chemotaxis. These data suggest that BMP-2 may be the best GF to use for the mineralization stage but not the proliferation stage of bone formation. This finding may help explain studies by others [34] who discovered that a delayed administration of BMP-2 to a fracture resulted in better repair of critical size defects. It is likely that the delay of BMP-2 treatment allowed a longer period of proliferation prior to BMP-2 promotion of mineralization. Our findings in Table 2, 3 and Figure 3 support the hypothesis that FGF-2 and BMP-2 are required at different stages of bone repair.Conclusions These data demonstrate the de-differentiation (reduction of mineralization genes) effect of FGF-2 likely plays a key role in osteoblast proliferation, the first stage of bone formation. Some have expressed concern that ex-vivo proliferation of human stem cells by a growth factor like FGF-2 might change the osteogenic characteristics of a pre-osteoblast; however others have shown that expansion of the population does not affect later osteogenic potential [35] of stem cells. Therefore, an expansion of osteoblast cells by FGF-2 might be an excellent strategy for first stage re-population of a critical defect since FGF-2 has the needed efficacy for promoting proliferation. These data also suggest that the final stage of bone repair is best accomplished with BMP-2 due to its promotion of differentiation and mineralization.Competing interests The Department of Veterans Affairs has filed and owns a patent using some of the data found in this manuscript.Authors' contributions MHF conceived the study, designed the study, directed the research and wrote the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Nutritional factors are associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer progression, yet mechanisms remain unclear. We examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveillance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or fish oil supplements would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) gene expression, respectively, reflecting putative proliferation (IGF-1) and inflammatory (COX-2) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis.Methods We conducted a 3-month randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression profiles (assessed by qRT–PCR) among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day lycopene, 3 g/day fish oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acids) or placebo.Results Among 69 men (22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to fish, and 26 to placebo), there was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in IGF-1 expression level between the placebo and lycopene arms (p = 0.93) nor in COX-2 expression between the placebo and fish arms (p = 0.99).Conclusion Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil did not significantly change IGF-1 and COX-2 gene expression in the normal prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of global gene expression profiles may shed light on the bioactivity and relevance of these nutrients in prostate cancer.Keywords: Prostate cancer, Active surveillance, Fish oil, Lycopene, Randomized clinical trial",
    "introduction": "Introduction Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in US men (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), with 192,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2009 [1]. However, the natural history of this disease is remarkably heterogeneous and not completely understood. In the United States, 90% of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed when they are of local/regional stage [1], and the majority of cases are indicated for biopsy by an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level only [2]. Evidence suggests that a fair proportion of early stage low-grade tumors detected by PSA screening may be over-diagnosed “latent” cancers, and that patients could have equally good survival without immediate treatment, and avoid or delay morbidity associated with treatment [3]. Surgery or radiation remains the most common primary management strategies for early stage prostate cancer; however, both options are associated with decreases in urinary and sexual function [4]. Active surveillance (AS) (also called “delayed treatment”) is becoming recognized as an alternative for many patients with early stage low-grade disease (“low burden” disease). AS involves close monitoring via PSA tests, digital rectal examinations, and prostate biopsies, to delay or avoid definitive treatment and the associated comorbidities. Standard clinical interventions are offered at early signs of progression. Although data remain limited and randomized clinical trials are ongoing, some [3, 5] but not all [6] observational reports of populations followed with AS or delayed treatment indicate that men experienced comparable outcomes to those with similar stage and grade disease who elected treatment immediately, although further research with longer follow-up is needed [7]. Our collaborative group established a program for men with low-burden prostate cancer who opt for AS to be offered participation in diet and lifestyle intervention research [8–10]. Observational epidemiologic studies suggest that dietary factors may impact prostate cancer progression. We previously reported that greater intakes of fish and tomato sauce after diagnosis of prostate cancer were associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer recurrence/progression among 1,202 prostate cancer survivors [11]. Tomatoes are rich in the carotenoid lycopene, which may have antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory actions [12] and influence the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis [13–17] that has been implicated in prostate cancer [18]. Fish is rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that may have anti-inflammatory protective effects against prostate cancer, possibly through the inhibition of COX-2 [11, 19–23]. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that lycopene and fish oil supplements would beneficially affect gene expression in putative cancer-related pathways (IGF-1, IGF-1R, and COX-2) in normal prostate tissue of men on AS.",
    "methods": "Methods Study design The Molecular Effects of Nutritional Supplements Trial (MENS) was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 3-month clinical trial of lycopene and fish oil with each compared to a placebo. The three study arms were as follows: two 15 mg lycopene soft gel capsules daily (Lyc-O-Mato® donated by, Lycored, Israel); three 1 g fish oil capsules daily (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and 549 mg docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acid; manufactured by Perfect Source, Fullerton, CA with active ingredient donated by Roche Vitamins, Parsippany, NJ); or placebo (provided by the respective manufacturers of the active pills for lycopene and fish oil). The lycopene supplement was a whole-food supplement made from tomatoes and standardized to deliver 30 mg of lycopene in a soy oil base. The placebo for lycopene was isocaloric and contained soy oil but no lycopene. The placebo for the fish oil supplement was isocaloric and contained olive oil. Men received lycopene + placebo for fish oil (lycopene arm), fish oil + placebo for lycopene (fish oil arm), or placebo for lycopene + placebo for fish oil (placebo arm). All men were also given a standard daily multivitamin (that did not contain lycopene or fish oil; Dixon/Akyma) and instructed to refrain from any other types of vitamin or nutritional supplements during the intervention. Baseline self-reported data on usual tomato and fish intake were used to stratify patients to ensure a balanced distribution of initial dietary levels among the three study arms. Baseline intake of these foods was assessed using questions and category definitions from a validated food frequency questionnaire [24–27] that was also used in our prior observational study [11]. The four strata were defined by the combinations of low or high tomato and low or high fish intakes (i.e., >4 servings/week tomato products = high; >2 servings/week fish = high [11]). Study participants, eligibility criteria, and enrollment This study was conducted among men with low-burden prostate cancer, choosing AS for disease management, and who met the following criteria: histologically documented prostate adenocarcinoma, extended pattern biopsy within 2 years of enrollment with a Gleason sum six or lower with no pattern four or five, no more than 33% of biopsy cores positive for cancer, no more than 50% of the length of a tumor core involved by carcinoma, three serum PSA levels done at least 2 weeks apart over the year prior to randomization and all PSA levels <10 ng/ml, life expectancy >3 months, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance score <2, and the ability to understand and willingness to sign a consent document. The following a priori exceptions were allowed: PSA <15 ng/ml for men with concurrent benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis, having a Gleason score of four reported only in a microfocus of tumor (defined as <= 2 mm length) and having >33% positive biopsy cores due to a tumor microfocus. These criteria were consistent with the clinical standards of our institution for determining the candidates for AS and were approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). In a single case, one participant had an initial eligibility biopsy (14-cores) with 36% positive cores. With the patient’s consent we requested permission from our IRB to proceed with the first baseline study biopsy for final determination of eligibility. This participant had no evidence of cancer in his four-core research biopsy and was allowed to continue on the study. Exclusion criteria were as following: no prior or concurrent treatment for prostate cancer, patients with a PSA doubling time <3 months (PSA doubling time = ln2/slope of ln PSA over time, [28]), use of lycopene, fish oil or any other dietary or nutritional supplement within 4 weeks of study entry, use of Finasteride, Dutasteride, Saw Palmetto or any other herbal/nutritional preparation indicated to affect hormone levels within 4 weeks of study entry, use of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and/or aspirin for more than 7 days over the 1 month prior to study, history of allergic reactions attributed to tomatoes, fish, soybean or olive oil, gelatin capsules, or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to lycopene (carotenoids) or fish oil, and uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing infection, congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric condition that would limit compliance with study requirements. Men who wanted to participate but who were on a nutritional supplement or anti-inflammatory drug were assessed by their doctors regarding whether abstaining from the supplement or drug was deemed medically safe and if so they were asked to undergo a 4-week washout period before proceeding with the study. Compliance with the study protocol was assessed via self-report and review of the medical records and food diaries. Usage of any dietary or nutritional supplement, finasteride, dutasteride, or anti-inflammatory drug during the 3-month intervention was considered a protocol violation, and men were withdrawn from the study when such usage was discovered. All potentially eligible men were identified at the Urologic Oncology clinic at the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center by physician(s) and nurse practitioners. This trial was advertised via “Dear Doctor” letters to urologist colleagues in the Northern California region, local newspaper ads, brief radio announcements, and fliers handed out at local health-promotion, cancer- or prostate cancer-related outreach events. Clinical procedures and data collection Before the intervention, men provided medical history and underwent physical and digital rectal exams. The study urologist (KS) performed an ultrasound-guided four-core research biopsy to procure fresh tissue for RNA analysis. After the intervention, the study urologist performed a second research biopsy. All biopsies were reviewed by the study pathologist (JS) to determine grade/extent of disease and verify that patients still met the criteria for continuing AS. After the intervention, men were followed according to a standard AS protocol, including medical history, physical exam, digital rectal exam, and PSA test at three, six, nine, twelve, and 24 months. Participants also completed a validated [24] semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline and 12 months, and quality-of-life surveys at baseline and 3 months. To encourage and assess compliance, food diaries were also collected before each study biopsy and once during the midpoint of the intervention. Study outcome The two primary outcomes were changes in normal tissue gene expression between the baseline and 3-month biopsies in IGF-1 and in COX-2. Change in gene expression for each supplement arm was compared with change in the placebo arm. Our primary hypotheses were that lycopene supplement would decrease IGF-1 expression and that fish oil supplementation would decrease COX-2 expression, each compared to placebo. We also hypothesized (secondarily) that IGF-1R expression would be decreased by lycopene versus placebo. In exploratory analyses, change in PSA level after the intervention was also compared. Biopsy processing Core needle biopsies were collected at baseline and 3 months. Total RNA for RT–PCR and micro-array analyses were extracted from areas of normal prostate peripheral-zone tissue containing both stroma and epithelial cells. qRT-PCR was conducted at the end of the trial to minimize inter-assay variability. qRT-PCR Hundred nanogram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by using Quanta’s Qscript reverse transcription kit. PCR was conducted in triplicate (5 ng cDNA per reaction) with 20 ml reaction volumes of 1X Taqman buffer (1X Applied Biosystems PCR buffer, 20% glycerol, 2.5% gelatin, 60nM Rox as a passive reference), 5.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM each primer, 0.2 mM each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 200 nM probe, and 0.025 unit/ml AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) with 5 ng cDNA. The primers and probes were mixed together and added to the master mix and cDNA in the 384-well plate. PCR was conducted on the ABI 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycle parameters: 1 cycle of 95° for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95° for 15 s, 60° for 1 min. Analysis was carried out using the SDS software (version 2.3) supplied with the ABI 7900HT to determine the Ct values of each reaction. Ct values determined for triplicate reactions involving a test gene and a housekeeping gene (GUSB) were averaged and subtracted to obtain the ΔΔCt (ΔΔCt = ΔCt 3mo—ΔCt 0mo = (Ct test gene 3mo—Ct GUSB 3mo)-(Ct test gene 0mo—Ct GUSB 0mo)). Disease progression Disease progression was defined as a PSA doubling time of <12 months [28], any adverse pathological findings on biopsy (Gleason sum >6, any evidence of pattern 4 or 5, involvement of >50% of any core, or >50% cores positive) or other incidental evidence of clinical progression (i.e., positive bone scans or lymph node biopsies). Any patient exhibiting progression during the 24-month study was withdrawn and offered standard treatment. Patients could also withdraw from the protocol at any time for any reason and be treated off study. Statistical considerations Sample size To evaluate the two primary study hypotheses, patients were randomized with equal probability to one of the three study arms: lycopene, fish oil, or control. The stratification cohort was determined using the patients’ self-reported intake of tomato products (i.e., primary source of lycopene) and fish, and patients were randomized within each of the four strata (high or low level for each dietary factor). The study was designed to test for a 2-fold decrease in expression of IGF-1 and COX-2 following the 3-month intervention compared with placebo. Accrual of 29 patients to each of the three arms was sufficient to detect a 40% difference in the proportion of patients with a 2-fold decrease in the expression of the IGF-1 gene with lycopene or in the COX-2 gene with fish oil, each compared with placebo, using Fisher’s exact test. The power of each test was 0.81 with a directional level of significance of 0.025 to adjust for the two comparisons. In addition to comparing the proportion of patients displaying a decrease in the delta cycle threshold (ΔCT) for the two genes of interest, this sample size was sufficient to detect an effect size of at least 0.75 for the difference between arms in the ΔΔCT means using a t test with the same error assumptions. The total planned accrual of 97 patients allowed for a 10% loss by the 3 month biopsy.Methods for analysis Baseline characteristics were compared among the three study arms using analysis of variance methods (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. To test the two primary hypotheses to detect a decrease in the mean changes in IGF-1 (or COX-2) gene expression between the lycopene (or fish oil) and placebo arms a t statistic was used with significance set at a probability <0.025 to adjust for the two comparisons. The same method was used to test for a decrease in IGF-1R with the lycopene supplement without any adjustment for multiple testing. We used Fisher’s exact test to determine whether a greater proportion of patients on the supplement arm achieved at least a 2-fold decrease in IGF-1 (or COX-2) expression when compared with the placebo group. We conducted exploratory analyses using 2-way ANOVA methods to investigate the change in gene expression (pre to post-intervention) in ΔCT on the log2 scale due to the study arm (supplement or placebo), baseline tomato/fish intake (high or low) or their interaction. If statistical significance was observed, the Newman-Keuls post hoc test was used to identify which subsets were significantly different. Mean baseline and change from baseline results were presented on the log2 scale.",
    "results": "Results Between October 2003 and December 2007, 97 men were enrolled (Fig. 1). A total of 13 men were excluded from the primary analyses for the following reasons: never started protocol intervention (n = 2), ineligible (n = 5), protocol violation (taking nutritional supplements) (n = 1), opted for active treatment after randomization (n = 1), experienced disease progression prior to the 3-month follow-up biopsy (n = 2), and experienced disease progression based on the 3-month biopsy (n = 2) (Fig. 1). The remaining 84 participants comprised the current study sample. Three unexpected adverse events were observed during the intervention and classified as “possibly related” to study treatment. These occurred among participants randomized to lycopene and included indigestion (n = 2) and migraine headache (n = 1). Fig. 1.

Pre- and post-intervention RT-PCR analyses were performed for 69 patients with approximately one-third treated on each of the 3 study arms (22 lycopene; 21 fish; 26 placebo). These 69 men were similar to the 15 not analyzed with regard to baseline clinical and demographic characteristics (data not shown). We compared the baseline ΔCTs for IGF-1, COX-2, and IGF-1R among the three study arms and observed no significant differences and no pair-wise differences between the study arms (Table 2). The mean ΔCT at baseline for COX-2 for all subsets was noticeably higher compared with the other two genes. The supplement and placebo arms did not differ for all three genes when analyzed by the level of baseline tomato or fish intakes. As might be expected, if gene expression reflected nutritional intake, there was a significant difference in the ΔCTs between the high and low baseline tomato intake (p = 0.02) and for fish intake (p = 0.02) but there was no interaction between stratification level and study arm.

Overall, there was no difference in the change in IGF-1 levels with lycopene supplement compared with the placebo (ANOVA p = 0.72) but a significantly greater change on average was observed among those with an initial high tomato intake compared with a low intake (132.6 vs. 67.7 (anti-log), respectively; p = 0.01) (Fig. 2a). Even though a greater mean increase was observed for those with high tomato intake initially, there was no statistical difference between the low- and high-intake subsets in mean IGF-1 levels for each study arm (Newman-Keuls: Placebo p = 0.16; Lycopene p = 0.11). No differences between study arms or high/low tomato strata were observed for IGF-1R (data not shown). Similarly, no differences between the fish supplement and placebo arms in mean change in COX-2 levels occurred (ANOVA p = 0.78; Fig. 2b). This was also true when the baseline fish intake was low or high (Newman-Keuls p = 0.70 and p = 0.86, respectively) with a narrow range for the change among the four subsets, 57.4–97.5 on average. These results may reflect the possible limited magnitude of change that could be observed with the study fish oil supplement. Fig. 2.

    "discussion": "Discussion This novel randomized clinical trial demonstrated the feasibility and safety of studying the effects of nutritional supplements on the prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer on AS. These results indicated no decrease in the gene expression of IGF-I or IGF-1R with 3-month lycopene supplement compared with placebo and no evidence of a decrease in COX-2 gene expression for fish oil supplement versus placebo. Circulating lycopene, dietary lycopene, and tomato intake have been inversely associated with the risk of incident prostate cancer in most but not all observational epidemiologic studies [12]. Studies of lycopene or tomato intake in men with prostate cancer have also generally supported possible benefits. We previously reported that men who increased their post-diagnostic consumption of tomato sauce by two servings per week had an estimated 20% reduction in the risk of prostate cancer recurrence or progression (p value = 0.04), independent of baseline clinical features and primary treatment option [11]. Chen et al. reported favorable reductions in leukocyte and prostate tissue DNA oxidative damage and PSA levels among 32 men with prostate cancer who received 1 tomato sauce serving daily for 3 weeks [29]. Schroeder et al. observed a favorable PSA response among 49 men with prostate cancer and post-treatment rising PSA levels who then received a combination dietary supplement that included soy, isoflavones, lycopene, silymarin, and other antioxidants [30]. This latter study, however, was unable to distinguish if the effect was due to lycopene alone or other components of the supplement. Preclinical and some [13–17, 31] but not all [32–34] human studies have supported the hypothesis that at least one mechanism by which lycopene protects against prostate cancer is by affecting IGF-1 levels or the IGF- axis. Prior epidemiologic reports by us and others suggested a possible benefit of fish intake or marine omega-3 fatty acids on prostate cancer incidence, recurrence, or mortality [11, 35–37]; although several studies of fish intake have also observed null associations with prostate cancer [36, 38–42]. Several in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids, or a greater omega-3:omega-6 fatty acid ratio, may have inhibitory effects on prostate cancer cell growth or xenograft tumor weight and in some of these models, this was accompanied by an observed down-regulation of COX-2 [11, 19–23]. The hypothesis that fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids interact with or affect inflammatory pathways has gained some support from a few studies that observed a stronger effect of these foods or nutrients on prostate cancer risk among men with specific germ line variants in COX-2 [35, 37]. We observed no relationship between lycopene supplementation and IGF-1 expression or fish oil supplement and COX-2 expression in this study of men with low-risk prostate cancer. Possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy with other studies include differences in study design, population, specific doses and formulations used for the interventions, and different outcomes of interest. For example, we used 30 mg lycopene supplement, which may be less potent biologically than tomato sauce (used in Chen et al. [29]). Lycopene is a fat-soluble carotenoid, and studies demonstrate that its bioactivity may be enhanced by simultaneous consumption of fat or by heat processing. This study also focused on gene expression in normal prostate tissue in men with low-burden disease. Chen et al. focused on circulating and tissue DNA oxidative damage and was conducted among men who were surgical candidates who may have had slightly higher risk disease [29]. Additionally, our study focused on changes in the normal prostate microenvironment; it is possible that these nutrients may have greater effects on the tumor gene expression that were not assessed (i.e., less than one-third of biopsy samples had sufficient tumor tissue available for analysis). The 3-month intervention might also have been too short a duration to observe biologic effects in the prostate, although other studies with short nutritional interventions in men with prostate cancer have detected gene expression changes [29, 43, 44] including one conducted by our collaborative group in a similar population focused on a comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention [9]. These results do not rule out other potential important antitumor effects (e.g., antioxidant effects) of lycopene or fish oil, which are not modulated via IGF-1 or COX-2, respectively, or potential post-transcription effects on the IGF-1 or COX-2 pathways. The placebo used for the fish oil supplement was isocaloric but contained olive oil, and this may have obscured our ability to detect an effect of fish oil. It is worth noting, though, that the placebo group experienced a slight down-regulation of all the genes of interest similar to the supplement arms, and there may be beneficial effects of olive oil versus fish oil on IGF-1- or COX-2-related pathways that may warrant further investigation. Limitations of this clinical trial include the short-duration of the intervention, examination of only single doses of lycopene and fish oil supplement, inability to assess the changes in the tumor tissue, inability to consider gene expression differences by cell-type (e.g., stromal vs. epithelial), usage of only a single housekeeping gene, and relatively small sample sizes. Strengths include the novel study design and focus on a timely important study population. The population of men who might qualify for AS regimens is growing, and it remains important to investigate evidence-based lifestyle recommendations for these patients. In conclusion, 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil supplement had no effect on normal prostate expression of IGF-1 and COX-2 (respectively) among men on AS for low-burden prostate cancer.

Copyright notice ID: 3002170 PMID: 21103921 Abstract Background Nutritional factors are associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer progression, yet mechanisms remain unclear. We examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveillance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or fish oil supplements would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) gene expression, respectively, reflecting putative proliferation (IGF-1) and inflammatory (COX-2) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis.Methods We conducted a 3-month randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression profiles (assessed by qRT–PCR) among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day lycopene, 3 g/day fish oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acids) or placebo.Results Among 69 men (22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to fish, and 26 to placebo), there was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in IGF-1 expression level between the placebo and lycopene arms (p = 0.93) nor in COX-2 expression between the placebo and fish arms (p = 0.99).Conclusion Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil did not significantly change IGF-1 and COX-2 gene expression in the normal prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of global gene expression profiles may shed light on the bioactivity and relevance of these nutrients in prostate cancer.Keywords: Prostate cancer, Active surveillance, Fish oil, Lycopene, Randomized clinical trialIntroduction Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in US men (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), with 192,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2009 [1]. However, the natural history of this disease is remarkably heterogeneous and not completely understood. In the United States, 90% of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed when they are of local/regional stage [1], and the majority of cases are indicated for biopsy by an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level only [2]. Evidence suggests that a fair proportion of early stage low-grade tumors detected by PSA screening may be over-diagnosed “latent” cancers, and that patients could have equally good survival without immediate treatment, and avoid or delay morbidity associated with treatment [3]. Surgery or radiation remains the most common primary management strategies for early stage prostate cancer; however, both options are associated with decreases in urinary and sexual function [4]. Active surveillance (AS) (also called “delayed treatment”) is becoming recognized as an alternative for many patients with early stage low-grade disease (“low burden” disease). AS involves close monitoring via PSA tests, digital rectal examinations, and prostate biopsies, to delay or avoid definitive treatment and the associated comorbidities. Standard clinical interventions are offered at early signs of progression. Although data remain limited and randomized clinical trials are ongoing, some [3, 5] but not all [6] observational reports of populations followed with AS or delayed treatment indicate that men experienced comparable outcomes to those with similar stage and grade disease who elected treatment immediately, although further research with longer follow-up is needed [7]. Our collaborative group established a program for men with low-burden prostate cancer who opt for AS to be offered participation in diet and lifestyle intervention research [8–10]. Observational epidemiologic studies suggest that dietary factors may impact prostate cancer progression. We previously reported that greater intakes of fish and tomato sauce after diagnosis of prostate cancer were associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer recurrence/progression among 1,202 prostate cancer survivors [11]. Tomatoes are rich in the carotenoid lycopene, which may have antioxidant, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory actions [12] and influence the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis [13–17] that has been implicated in prostate cancer [18]. Fish is rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that may have anti-inflammatory protective effects against prostate cancer, possibly through the inhibition of COX-2 [11, 19–23]. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that lycopene and fish oil supplements would beneficially affect gene expression in putative cancer-related pathways (IGF-1, IGF-1R, and COX-2) in normal prostate tissue of men on AS.Methods Study design The Molecular Effects of Nutritional Supplements Trial (MENS) was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 3-month clinical trial of lycopene and fish oil with each compared to a placebo. The three study arms were as follows: two 15 mg lycopene soft gel capsules daily (Lyc-O-Mato® donated by, Lycored, Israel); three 1 g fish oil capsules daily (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and 549 mg docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acid; manufactured by Perfect Source, Fullerton, CA with active ingredient donated by Roche Vitamins, Parsippany, NJ); or placebo (provided by the respective manufacturers of the active pills for lycopene and fish oil). The lycopene supplement was a whole-food supplement made from tomatoes and standardized to deliver 30 mg of lycopene in a soy oil base. The placebo for lycopene was isocaloric and contained soy oil but no lycopene. The placebo for the fish oil supplement was isocaloric and contained olive oil. Men received lycopene + placebo for fish oil (lycopene arm), fish oil + placebo for lycopene (fish oil arm), or placebo for lycopene + placebo for fish oil (placebo arm). All men were also given a standard daily multivitamin (that did not contain lycopene or fish oil; Dixon/Akyma) and instructed to refrain from any other types of vitamin or nutritional supplements during the intervention. Baseline self-reported data on usual tomato and fish intake were used to stratify patients to ensure a balanced distribution of initial dietary levels among the three study arms. Baseline intake of these foods was assessed using questions and category definitions from a validated food frequency questionnaire [24–27] that was also used in our prior observational study [11]. The four strata were defined by the combinations of low or high tomato and low or high fish intakes (i.e., >4 servings/week tomato products = high; >2 servings/week fish = high [11]).Study participants, eligibility criteria, and enrollment This study was conducted among men with low-burden prostate cancer, choosing AS for disease management, and who met the following criteria: histologically documented prostate adenocarcinoma, extended pattern biopsy within 2 years of enrollment with a Gleason sum six or lower with no pattern four or five, no more than 33% of biopsy cores positive for cancer, no more than 50% of the length of a tumor core involved by carcinoma, three serum PSA levels done at least 2 weeks apart over the year prior to randomization and all PSA levels <10 ng/ml, life expectancy >3 months, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance score <2, and the ability to understand and willingness to sign a consent document. The following a priori exceptions were allowed: PSA <15 ng/ml for men with concurrent benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis, having a Gleason score of four reported only in a microfocus of tumor (defined as <= 2 mm length) and having >33% positive biopsy cores due to a tumor microfocus. These criteria were consistent with the clinical standards of our institution for determining the candidates for AS and were approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). In a single case, one participant had an initial eligibility biopsy (14-cores) with 36% positive cores. With the patient’s consent we requested permission from our IRB to proceed with the first baseline study biopsy for final determination of eligibility. This participant had no evidence of cancer in his four-core research biopsy and was allowed to continue on the study. Exclusion criteria were as following: no prior or concurrent treatment for prostate cancer, patients with a PSA doubling time <3 months (PSA doubling time = ln2/slope of ln PSA over time, [28]), use of lycopene, fish oil or any other dietary or nutritional supplement within 4 weeks of study entry, use of Finasteride, Dutasteride, Saw Palmetto or any other herbal/nutritional preparation indicated to affect hormone levels within 4 weeks of study entry, use of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and/or aspirin for more than 7 days over the 1 month prior to study, history of allergic reactions attributed to tomatoes, fish, soybean or olive oil, gelatin capsules, or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to lycopene (carotenoids) or fish oil, and uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing infection, congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric condition that would limit compliance with study requirements. Men who wanted to participate but who were on a nutritional supplement or anti-inflammatory drug were assessed by their doctors regarding whether abstaining from the supplement or drug was deemed medically safe and if so they were asked to undergo a 4-week washout period before proceeding with the study. Compliance with the study protocol was assessed via self-report and review of the medical records and food diaries. Usage of any dietary or nutritional supplement, finasteride, dutasteride, or anti-inflammatory drug during the 3-month intervention was considered a protocol violation, and men were withdrawn from the study when such usage was discovered. All potentially eligible men were identified at the Urologic Oncology clinic at the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center by physician(s) and nurse practitioners. This trial was advertised via “Dear Doctor” letters to urologist colleagues in the Northern California region, local newspaper ads, brief radio announcements, and fliers handed out at local health-promotion, cancer- or prostate cancer-related outreach events.Clinical procedures and data collection Before the intervention, men provided medical history and underwent physical and digital rectal exams. The study urologist (KS) performed an ultrasound-guided four-core research biopsy to procure fresh tissue for RNA analysis. After the intervention, the study urologist performed a second research biopsy. All biopsies were reviewed by the study pathologist (JS) to determine grade/extent of disease and verify that patients still met the criteria for continuing AS. After the intervention, men were followed according to a standard AS protocol, including medical history, physical exam, digital rectal exam, and PSA test at three, six, nine, twelve, and 24 months. Participants also completed a validated [24] semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline and 12 months, and quality-of-life surveys at baseline and 3 months. To encourage and assess compliance, food diaries were also collected before each study biopsy and once during the midpoint of the intervention.Study outcome The two primary outcomes were changes in normal tissue gene expression between the baseline and 3-month biopsies in IGF-1 and in COX-2. Change in gene expression for each supplement arm was compared with change in the placebo arm. Our primary hypotheses were that lycopene supplement would decrease IGF-1 expression and that fish oil supplementation would decrease COX-2 expression, each compared to placebo. We also hypothesized (secondarily) that IGF-1R expression would be decreased by lycopene versus placebo. In exploratory analyses, change in PSA level after the intervention was also compared.Biopsy processing Core needle biopsies were collected at baseline and 3 months. Total RNA for RT–PCR and micro-array analyses were extracted from areas of normal prostate peripheral-zone tissue containing both stroma and epithelial cells. qRT-PCR was conducted at the end of the trial to minimize inter-assay variability.qRT-PCR Hundred nanogram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by using Quanta’s Qscript reverse transcription kit. PCR was conducted in triplicate (5 ng cDNA per reaction) with 20 ml reaction volumes of 1X Taqman buffer (1X Applied Biosystems PCR buffer, 20% glycerol, 2.5% gelatin, 60nM Rox as a passive reference), 5.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM each primer, 0.2 mM each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 200 nM probe, and 0.025 unit/ml AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) with 5 ng cDNA. The primers and probes were mixed together and added to the master mix and cDNA in the 384-well plate. PCR was conducted on the ABI 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycle parameters: 1 cycle of 95° for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95° for 15 s, 60° for 1 min. Analysis was carried out using the SDS software (version 2.3) supplied with the ABI 7900HT to determine the Ct values of each reaction. Ct values determined for triplicate reactions involving a test gene and a housekeeping gene (GUSB) were averaged and subtracted to obtain the ΔΔCt (ΔΔCt = ΔCt 3mo—ΔCt 0mo = (Ct test gene 3mo—Ct GUSB 3mo)-(Ct test gene 0mo—Ct GUSB 0mo)).Disease progression Disease progression was defined as a PSA doubling time of <12 months [28], any adverse pathological findings on biopsy (Gleason sum >6, any evidence of pattern 4 or 5, involvement of >50% of any core, or >50% cores positive) or other incidental evidence of clinical progression (i.e., positive bone scans or lymph node biopsies). Any patient exhibiting progression during the 24-month study was withdrawn and offered standard treatment. Patients could also withdraw from the protocol at any time for any reason and be treated off study.Statistical considerations Sample size To evaluate the two primary study hypotheses, patients were randomized with equal probability to one of the three study arms: lycopene, fish oil, or control. The stratification cohort was determined using the patients’ self-reported intake of tomato products (i.e., primary source of lycopene) and fish, and patients were randomized within each of the four strata (high or low level for each dietary factor). The study was designed to test for a 2-fold decrease in expression of IGF-1 and COX-2 following the 3-month intervention compared with placebo. Accrual of 29 patients to each of the three arms was sufficient to detect a 40% difference in the proportion of patients with a 2-fold decrease in the expression of the IGF-1 gene with lycopene or in the COX-2 gene with fish oil, each compared with placebo, using Fisher’s exact test. The power of each test was 0.81 with a directional level of significance of 0.025 to adjust for the two comparisons. In addition to comparing the proportion of patients displaying a decrease in the delta cycle threshold (ΔCT) for the two genes of interest, this sample size was sufficient to detect an effect size of at least 0.75 for the difference between arms in the ΔΔCT means using a t test with the same error assumptions. The total planned accrual of 97 patients allowed for a 10% loss by the 3 month biopsy.Methods for analysis Baseline characteristics were compared among the three study arms using analysis of variance methods (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. To test the two primary hypotheses to detect a decrease in the mean changes in IGF-1 (or COX-2) gene expression between the lycopene (or fish oil) and placebo arms a t statistic was used with significance set at a probability <0.025 to adjust for the two comparisons. The same method was used to test for a decrease in IGF-1R with the lycopene supplement without any adjustment for multiple testing. We used Fisher’s exact test to determine whether a greater proportion of patients on the supplement arm achieved at least a 2-fold decrease in IGF-1 (or COX-2) expression when compared with the placebo group. We conducted exploratory analyses using 2-way ANOVA methods to investigate the change in gene expression (pre to post-intervention) in ΔCT on the log2 scale due to the study arm (supplement or placebo), baseline tomato/fish intake (high or low) or their interaction. If statistical significance was observed, the Newman-Keuls post hoc test was used to identify which subsets were significantly different. Mean baseline and change from baseline results were presented on the log2 scale.Results Between October 2003 and December 2007, 97 men were enrolled (Fig. 1). A total of 13 men were excluded from the primary analyses for the following reasons: never started protocol intervention (n = 2), ineligible (n = 5), protocol violation (taking nutritional supplements) (n = 1), opted for active treatment after randomization (n = 1), experienced disease progression prior to the 3-month follow-up biopsy (n = 2), and experienced disease progression based on the 3-month biopsy (n = 2) (Fig. 1). The remaining 84 participants comprised the current study sample. Three unexpected adverse events were observed during the intervention and classified as “possibly related” to study treatment. These occurred among participants randomized to lycopene and included indigestion (n = 2) and migraine headache (n = 1). Fig. 1.

Pre- and post-intervention RT-PCR analyses were performed for 69 patients with approximately one-third treated on each of the 3 study arms (22 lycopene; 21 fish; 26 placebo). These 69 men were similar to the 15 not analyzed with regard to baseline clinical and demographic characteristics (data not shown). We compared the baseline ΔCTs for IGF-1, COX-2, and IGF-1R among the three study arms and observed no significant differences and no pair-wise differences between the study arms (Table 2). The mean ΔCT at baseline for COX-2 for all subsets was noticeably higher compared with the other two genes. The supplement and placebo arms did not differ for all three genes when analyzed by the level of baseline tomato or fish intakes. As might be expected, if gene expression reflected nutritional intake, there was a significant difference in the ΔCTs between the high and low baseline tomato intake (p = 0.02) and for fish intake (p = 0.02) but there was no interaction between stratification level and study arm.

There was virtually no change in COX-2 expression for the placebo and fish oil supplement groups comparing the 3 month versus baseline levels (p = 0.99) (Table 3). Only 27% of the lycopene arm achieved a 2-fold decrease in IGF-1 compared with 23% for the placebo (p = 0.75). Thirty percent of the fish oil arm experienced a 2-fold decrease in COX-2 expression compared with 15% of the placebo group but this was not statistically significantly different (p = 0.29). Similarly, no difference in the proportion displaying a 2-fold decrease in IGF-1R expression occurred for the lycopene and placebo arms (14 and 8%, respectively; p = 0.65). Table 3.

Overall, there was no difference in the change in IGF-1 levels with lycopene supplement compared with the placebo (ANOVA p = 0.72) but a significantly greater change on average was observed among those with an initial high tomato intake compared with a low intake (132.6 vs. 67.7 (anti-log), respectively; p = 0.01) (Fig. 2a). Even though a greater mean increase was observed for those with high tomato intake initially, there was no statistical difference between the low- and high-intake subsets in mean IGF-1 levels for each study arm (Newman-Keuls: Placebo p = 0.16; Lycopene p = 0.11). No differences between study arms or high/low tomato strata were observed for IGF-1R (data not shown). Similarly, no differences between the fish supplement and placebo arms in mean change in COX-2 levels occurred (ANOVA p = 0.78; Fig. 2b). This was also true when the baseline fish intake was low or high (Newman-Keuls p = 0.70 and p = 0.86, respectively) with a narrow range for the change among the four subsets, 57.4–97.5 on average. These results may reflect the possible limited magnitude of change that could be observed with the study fish oil supplement. Fig. 2.

Probability values are determined for the post hoc Newman-Keuls testThere was no difference in the change in PSA level after the intervention, comparing the lycopene or fish oil arms versus the placebo group (mean change in PSA: −0.46 ng/ml for placebo, 0.53 ng/ml for lycopene; 0.20 ng/ml for fish; p value = 0.26 and 0.39, respectively).Discussion This novel randomized clinical trial demonstrated the feasibility and safety of studying the effects of nutritional supplements on the prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer on AS. These results indicated no decrease in the gene expression of IGF-I or IGF-1R with 3-month lycopene supplement compared with placebo and no evidence of a decrease in COX-2 gene expression for fish oil supplement versus placebo. Circulating lycopene, dietary lycopene, and tomato intake have been inversely associated with the risk of incident prostate cancer in most but not all observational epidemiologic studies [12]. Studies of lycopene or tomato intake in men with prostate cancer have also generally supported possible benefits. We previously reported that men who increased their post-diagnostic consumption of tomato sauce by two servings per week had an estimated 20% reduction in the risk of prostate cancer recurrence or progression (p value = 0.04), independent of baseline clinical features and primary treatment option [11]. Chen et al. reported favorable reductions in leukocyte and prostate tissue DNA oxidative damage and PSA levels among 32 men with prostate cancer who received 1 tomato sauce serving daily for 3 weeks [29]. Schroeder et al. observed a favorable PSA response among 49 men with prostate cancer and post-treatment rising PSA levels who then received a combination dietary supplement that included soy, isoflavones, lycopene, silymarin, and other antioxidants [30]. This latter study, however, was unable to distinguish if the effect was due to lycopene alone or other components of the supplement. Preclinical and some [13–17, 31] but not all [32–34] human studies have supported the hypothesis that at least one mechanism by which lycopene protects against prostate cancer is by affecting IGF-1 levels or the IGF- axis. Prior epidemiologic reports by us and others suggested a possible benefit of fish intake or marine omega-3 fatty acids on prostate cancer incidence, recurrence, or mortality [11, 35–37]; although several studies of fish intake have also observed null associations with prostate cancer [36, 38–42]. Several in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids, or a greater omega-3:omega-6 fatty acid ratio, may have inhibitory effects on prostate cancer cell growth or xenograft tumor weight and in some of these models, this was accompanied by an observed down-regulation of COX-2 [11, 19–23]. The hypothesis that fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids interact with or affect inflammatory pathways has gained some support from a few studies that observed a stronger effect of these foods or nutrients on prostate cancer risk among men with specific germ line variants in COX-2 [35, 37]. We observed no relationship between lycopene supplementation and IGF-1 expression or fish oil supplement and COX-2 expression in this study of men with low-risk prostate cancer. Possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy with other studies include differences in study design, population, specific doses and formulations used for the interventions, and different outcomes of interest. For example, we used 30 mg lycopene supplement, which may be less potent biologically than tomato sauce (used in Chen et al. [29]). Lycopene is a fat-soluble carotenoid, and studies demonstrate that its bioactivity may be enhanced by simultaneous consumption of fat or by heat processing. This study also focused on gene expression in normal prostate tissue in men with low-burden disease. Chen et al. focused on circulating and tissue DNA oxidative damage and was conducted among men who were surgical candidates who may have had slightly higher risk disease [29]. Additionally, our study focused on changes in the normal prostate microenvironment; it is possible that these nutrients may have greater effects on the tumor gene expression that were not assessed (i.e., less than one-third of biopsy samples had sufficient tumor tissue available for analysis). The 3-month intervention might also have been too short a duration to observe biologic effects in the prostate, although other studies with short nutritional interventions in men with prostate cancer have detected gene expression changes [29, 43, 44] including one conducted by our collaborative group in a similar population focused on a comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention [9]. These results do not rule out other potential important antitumor effects (e.g., antioxidant effects) of lycopene or fish oil, which are not modulated via IGF-1 or COX-2, respectively, or potential post-transcription effects on the IGF-1 or COX-2 pathways. The placebo used for the fish oil supplement was isocaloric but contained olive oil, and this may have obscured our ability to detect an effect of fish oil. It is worth noting, though, that the placebo group experienced a slight down-regulation of all the genes of interest similar to the supplement arms, and there may be beneficial effects of olive oil versus fish oil on IGF-1- or COX-2-related pathways that may warrant further investigation. Limitations of this clinical trial include the short-duration of the intervention, examination of only single doses of lycopene and fish oil supplement, inability to assess the changes in the tumor tissue, inability to consider gene expression differences by cell-type (e.g., stromal vs. epithelial), usage of only a single housekeeping gene, and relatively small sample sizes. Strengths include the novel study design and focus on a timely important study population. The population of men who might qualify for AS regimens is growing, and it remains important to investigate evidence-based lifestyle recommendations for these patients. In conclusion, 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil supplement had no effect on normal prostate expression of IGF-1 and COX-2 (respectively) among men on AS for low-burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of global gene expression profiles assessed using genome-wide microarrays may shed further light on the bioactivity of these nutrients in prostate cancer.Acknowledgments We thank all the participants for their invaluable contribution to this research.

G. Wells (First Men on the Moon, 1901; Fig. 2) were the starting point of science fiction and the dream of space exploration. Verne proposed a “projectile bullet capsule” shot from a long cannon named Columbiad as a means for 3 explorers to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave Earth's gravity (1). Even in 1865 there were concerns about humans' ability to survive extreme velocities. Verne made crude calculations on the length of cannon needed for a human to survive a launch to the moon. Almost 100 yrs later, the United States used a very similarly shaped Apollo capsule named Columbia to take 3 astronauts—Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin—to the moon and return to Earth. Figure 1.

Image courtesy Airmant Publishing Co., Inc.The vision of spaceflight began with science fiction literature, which was followed decades later by the science, engineering and other technological achievements that made it a reality. It took the momentum of war to further advance technology to a point where space travel was possible. After World War II, the United States and the USSR repurposed the spoils of war, transforming the once terrorizing German V-2 rocket program into new space programs. Some vehicles are specifically designed for suborbital (ballistic) flight; examples include crewed vehicles, such as the X-15 rocket plane, sounding rockets, and Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, and uncrewed rockets, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The first spaceflight was ballistic and reached an altitude of 17 nautical miles (31.5 km) above the earth. Ballistic flights, by definition, do not go into orbit and have only brief periods of microgravity (10−3 to 10−6 g). During ballistic flights, spaceflight microgravity lasts from a few seconds or minutes to a few hours before returning to the planet. This type of flight only offers short opportunities for scientific query. Orbital flights travel at ∼17,500 nautical miles per hour (∼32,400 km/h) around the planet and are on a different scale of experimental time since microgravity can last from days, weeks, and months to years. Orbital flights support a wide range of science investigations from signal transduction and gene expression to differentiation, physiology, and development. The height of the orbit around Earth depends on the spaceship: the shuttle orbited at ∼160 nautical miles (∼300 km), whereas the International Space Station (ISS) is in a near-circular orbit at ∼192 nautical miles (∼360 km). The U.S. military and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) award astronaut flight medals to crew members that fly ≥50 nautical miles above the earth. With the exception of the X-15 rocket plane and early Mercury flyers, most astronauts accomplished their required altitude on orbital flights. With the flight of the first human-made object into orbit on October 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 started the intense competition between the USSR and the United States, vying for the number-one spot in the Space Race. To determine whether animals could survive launch forces, both countries flew animals to test the sustainability of life during spaceflight and started the fields of gravitational and space biology. Nikita Khrushchev ordered the first orbital spaceflight of an animal after the successful flight of Sputnik 1. He wanted to have a spectacular launch on November 7, 1957, the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. In response to his request, Soviet planners and engineers came up with an orbital flight with a dog onboard. A stray, Laikia (Fig. 3), was picked to be the first dog in space because of her survival skills on the snowy streets of Moscow. Unfortunately, in the rush to make the deadline, there was no time to plan a sustainable environmental system or a reentry plan. Laikia, the first Earth being to orbit the planet, did not survive her flight. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Laika, the first animal to orbit the earth (1957). Image courtesy author's photo collection.Later spaceflights were used to study the effect of microgravity on living systems and the requirement of gravity for normal function of the body's systems. The Apollo missions were the first to show significant changes in multiple biological systems in spaceflight. These changes included vestibular disturbances, in-flight cardiac arrhythmia, reduced postflight orthostatic tolerance, postflight dehydration, and weight loss. Scientists also found a significant decrease in red blood cell mass (RBCM). Other major changes documented were the negative in-flight balance for nitrogen and a significant loss of calcium and bone (2–5). These observations helped guide NASA scientists to plan more detailed physiological studies during the Skylab era (1973–1974; Fig. 4). During the Skylab missions, scientists conducted the first detailed metabolic and immune studies. When Skylab crew members were tested for osteoporosis in the os calcis (the largest bone of the heel), bone loss was only apparent on the longer Skylab missions (5). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Skylab 3 (1973–1974), the first NASA space station. Image courtesy NASA.It was on the Skylab missions that the significant changes in the immune function were first studied in detail. Lymphocytes from the flight crew and the backup crew were tested for phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated growth preflight, on landing and then again 13 d later. There were no significant changes seen in immune response in the backup crew; however, the vast majority of the response of the T cell was lost in the flight crew on return to Earth. Immune function did not return until 13 d later (6). Skylab experiments also showed the benefits of vigorous exercise as a countermeasure to minimize cardiovascular deconditioning. The Skylab 4 mission was the first to study the occurrence of visual light flashes that had first been noted on Apollo 11. One astronaut counted a total of 168 flashes over 2 sessions. It was thought that the flashes seen after dark adaptation were due to ionization energy loss as a particle traversed retinal cells (7). On my flight in 1991, we were told that there was a solar flare; after I closed my eyes that night, I remember watching brilliant flashes of light—I fell to sleep before my count got to 20. In 1991, NASA flew the first dedicated medical mission, designated as Spacelab Life Sciences-1 (STS-40). The crew consisted of 7 members: 3 orbiter astronauts and 4 payload astronauts. The mission was designed to study the cause of the physiological changes that were previously observed during Apollo, Skylab, and the USSR programs. The physiological space adaptations discussed here are fluid shift (due to the lack of gravity pulling fluid the lower body) and space anemia (the loss of RBCM); space osteoporosis and loss of calcium; and immunosuppression in space. FLUID SHIFT AND SPACE ANEMIA During spaceflight, the volume in the lower limbs decreases by ∼10% due to a 1- to 2-L fluid shift from the legs to the upper body. The facial fullness and puffy appearance of the head and reduced volume in the lower limbs is referred to as “puffy face-bird leg” syndrome (8). Space studies of plasma volume showed a 22% decrease from the average plasma volume taken from preflight data. This loss of plasma volume occurred by d 2 of flight even though the crew was diligent in keeping a high state of hydration. On d 8 of flight, there was still a 12% decrease in plasma volume, and it took 6 d after landing for the crew's plasma volume to return to preflight levels. The reduction of plasma volume during spaceflight is most likely a result of the fluid shift that is sensed by the body and results in an increased diuresis (9). When plasma volume was reduced, there was a dramatic decrease in erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein made in the renal cortex. The study of the influence of spaceflight on the erythrokinetics in humans was found to be caused by the reduced plasma EPO that, in turn, affected various hormones, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP was reduced by 20% from d 1 of flight, with the nadir of ∼60% on d 8 of flight (10–13). The levels of serum ANP did not return to normal until 6 d after landing. Serum EPO levels decreased ∼40% by d 2 of flight and remained depressed until the day after landing, at which time it rebounded almost 2-fold compared to the preflight baseline levels. Alfrey et al. (11) found that RBC survival was reduced during spaceflight by apoptosis of RBCs due to insufficient sera levels of EPO during spaceflight. After this breakthrough finding from his space experiments, Alfrey continued studies of RBC regulation and has shown that red cell mass is decreased when the sera level of EPO is suppressed. This leads to the selective hemolysis of the youngest circulating RBCs, called neocytes. The process is now called neocytolysis and has been confirmed with a variety of physiological and pathophysiologic situations, including descent of high-altitude dwellers to sea level, the anemia in renal failure, and in a human model based on EPO administration and withdrawal (13–18).SPACE OSTEOPOROSIS Bone loss was also well documented on the Apollo and Skylab missions. Osteoporosis is currently one of the most serious health hazards of long-term spaceflight. There is continuous and progressive loss of calcium and weight-bearing bone (19) during exposure to microgravity. In an early review, it was shown that there is a loss of bone in both humans and animals after 1 wk to 237 d in microgravity (19). SLS-1 was the first opportunity to systematically measure parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium in serum samples from both male and female crew members during spaceflight. Arnaud and Cann (20) found a significant increase in serum-ionized calcium of ∼30% by d 2 of flight. Ionized serum calcium measured on d 8 was still elevated by ∼30%, measurements of PTH on the same days showed an ∼50% decrease in intact PTH (iPTH) during the mission. Even 16 d after landing, neither calcium nor iPTH values returned to normal (20). The loss of bone on the Apollo 14–16 missions was almost 2%, even though the spaceflights lasted only 9 to 12 d (5). Although the Apollo missions were short in duration, the Apollo astronauts spent much of their time strapped down in a small capsule and were relatively immobile. The first crewed Skylab mission (Skylab 2) was 28 d, but because of extensive crew activity, no significant bone loss was noted. However, when Skylab missions increased to 2 and 3 mo, a significant loss of bone was seen (5). On Skylab 3 (59 d) only the scientist pilot had significant bone loss; on Skylab 4 (84 d), both the scientist pilot and the pilot had high levels of bone loss, suggesting that the length of exposure to weightlessness was a causal factor in loss of bone homeostasis (5). The commanders had little to no change in bone density, most possibly due to the increased exercise required in their duties. The underlying cause of the bone loss is thought to be due to the loss of mechanical stress in microgravity and duration of flight (8, 21–23). Vico et al. (24) have reported up to a 24% loss of distal tibia trabecular bone in cosmonauts after 6 mo of spaceflight, as measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Six months after return, many of the cosmonauts did not show full recovery of bone mineral density (BMD). Lang et al. (25, 26) showed that over a 4- to 6-mo period of spaceflight, BMD was lost at rates of 0.9%/mo at the spine (P<0.001) and 1.4–1.5%/mo at the hip (P<0.001). They also measured the total, trabecular, and cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD) of the proximal femur. Spinal integral vBMD was lost at a rate of 0.9%/mo (P<0.001), and trabecular vBMD was lost at 0.7%/mo (P<0.05). In summary, their results show that ISS (Fig. 5) crew members, on average, experienced substantial and significant loss of both trabecular and cortical bone in the hip and somewhat smaller losses in the spine (25, 26). Later studies from ISS (25, 27–29) indicate that recovery of skeletal density after long-duration space missions may exceed 1 yr (27). It is of interest that bone loss occurred despite ∼2 h of daily exercise. This suggests that microgravity-induced bone loss may have an underlying cellular mechanism causing space osteoporosis. Studies of osteoblast-like cells showed a loss of cytoskeleton integrity in spaceflight as compared to ground (30) and 1-g flight controls (31). Others have found cytoskeleton changes in multiple cell types in simulated microgravity and spaceflight (32–36). Finally, osteoblastic cells were shown to have altered nuclear shape and reduced anabolic gene expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cpla2), osteocalcin (OC), c-myc, and fibroblast growth factor-2 (fgf-2) when compared to normal gravity (31). Further studies will determine whether gravity itself is required for normal bone growth. Figure 5. Open in a new tab International Space Station, a U.S. National Laboratory, as seen from STS-134.

The relatively high incidence of infection on Apollo was thought to be correlated with the elevated cortisol levels and sympathetic activation detected in blood and urine samples from astronauts. These findings led early investigators to propose a systemic cause of infection (6, 37). Studies by Cogoli et al. (38, 39) demonstrated that lymphocytes have blunted activation during spaceflight, thus implicating gravity as a necessary factor in normal immune function. Subsequent ground studies using gene arrays and quantative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that gravity was needed for normal T-cell activation (40). Using a random positioning machine to simulate microgravity, we surprisingly found that the induction of 91 genes depended on the presence of gravity. Gene induction is partially regulated by transcription factors on the promoter region at the 5′ end of the gene. Promoter region analysis found that the majority of genes down-regulated in microgravity were controlled by transcription factors NFκB, CREB, ELK, AP-1 and STAT—transcription factors that lie downstream of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling (40). New preliminary data from this laboratory (41) has shown that noncoding RNA is dysregulated in T cells activated in spaceflight on ISS as compared to 1-g onboard controls. This new level of regulation of immune cells in spaceflight offer new opportunities to study a new technology that can help identify unique pharmaceutical targets to treat immune disease. Although much is known about immune status immediately following spaceflight, the understanding of immunity during spaceflight is limited. The few in-flight studies that have been performed indicate that spaceflight may be specifically associated with the reactivation of latent herpes viruses and impairment of cell mediated immunity (42–48). Observations of astronaut immune status after landing have shown numerous changes in immune cell function, including altered distribution of circulating lymphocytes, altered production of cytokines, decreased function of granulocytes, and decreased activation of T cells (8). Cases of latent viral reactivation, altered viral specific immunity, and expression of early/late gene Epstein-Barr viruses have been noted in astronauts after flight (42, 45–48). Future studies of viral reactivation in spaceflight may also shed new light on viral regulation here on Earth. Studies with isolated human T cells in flight have demonstrated a loss of expression of early activation steps (38, 49–51). Recent studies of T cell activation of “astromouse” splenocytes after 16 d of spaceflight have demonstrated a reduction in expression of the same genes as seen in astronauts after landing. Analysis of flight and ground animals for gene expression of T cell activation markers interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2Rα, interferon-γ (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were significantly decreased 2- to 10-fold in the activated flight splenocytes as compared to ground controls. Expression of cyclophilin and VEGF was unchanged. Protein synthesis of chemokines and cytokines IL-2, IL-2Rα, IFNγ, CCL-3 and TNF-α were also decreased in the flight cell supernatants when compared to ground controls. The observed down-regulation of induced T cell activation genes combined with changes of synthesis of their proteins show that animal immune cells require gravity and that the spaceflight-induced changes in T cell function continue hours after landing (52). More important, these data correspond with previous findings of human immune function in astronauts after return to Earth and support the conclusion of a physiological dependence of the immune system on gravity. These data suggest that at least one mammalian system in two species require gravity for full function. Potential adverse clinical effects that may be related to prolonged dysfunction of the immune system and spaceflight include hypersensitivity, autoimmunity, and frequency of infectious diseases (8). There is mounting evidence that gravity is required for normal function of bone and immune cells. Since all of life developed in a gravity environment, it is not surprising that some biological systems may be dependent on gravity force. In mathematics, when a variable is removed from an equation, many times it can be solved. It is possible that the same is true for biological systems. Future studies of spaceflight-induced osteoporosis and immunosuppression may well yield new information and pharmaceutical targets to treat earthbound human diseases.THE FUTURE OF INFINITY The flight of STS-135 ended the Shuttle era. However, there are plans to use the SpaceX Falcon rocket and its capsule, Dragon, to deliver supplies and experiments to ISS in the near future. Recently, NASA gave out $92 million to Boeing to help its development of the commercial crew development (CCDev2) capsule, $80 million to the Sahara Nevada Corporation to design a shuttle-like Dream Chaser craft, and $75 million to SpaceX to make improvements in the Dragon capsule for delivery of crewmen to ISS. Considering that the U.S. government is now paying Russia $63 million per astronaut for a single trip to and from ISS, these are modest technological investments to enable the United States to have transportation to ISS. Will the United States fund space flight investigations on ISS to yield new medical discoveries and new technology? Will progress of science and technology advance during the next century as it did in the past 60 yr? It depends on funding; in 2003 ∼90% of NASA's science funding was “temporarily” cut after loss of spaceship Columbia; this essentially disabled all fields of space science at a time when ISS was becoming available for use. Reduced funding included cessation of student and graduate training, thereby severing the supply pipeline for the next generation of scientists. Unfortunately, that funding was never restored. Today, we are experiencing similar cuts in the National Institutes of Health budget that further limit medical research and training of new investigators. Our future depends on today's visionaries—our writers must envision the future, our politicians must vote to fund that vision, and our schools must educate new engineers and scientists. Those engineers and scientists must work to develop new technologies and businessmen must engage the new technologies and renew our economy. Will science go to infinity and beyond by creating new jobs and securing our future prosperity? I certainly hope so.Acknowledgments The author is a former NASA astronaut.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, the abnormal proliferate and differentiate ability of type II epithelial cells (AEC II) is the key to the pathological basis of BPD. Mechanisms regarding abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosis-related genes were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease characterized by immature lung development that affects almost half of extremely preterm infants [1]. Decreased alveolar number, simplified alveolar structure, and accompanying vascular lesions are features of BPD [2]. Hyperoxia can induce BPD phenotype and change the composition of cellular compartments [3]. Alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II) are the main stem cells of the lung and maintain normal lung function [4]. When the lung is damaged, AEC II have a role in replacing abnormal and damaged alveolar epithelial cells [5]. In particular, the abnormal ability of AEC II to proliferate and differentiate into AEC I is an important factor leading to this disease [6,7]. More and more evidence has shown that in addition to direct AEC II injury, other cell programmed cell death (PCD) including apoptosis [8], pyroptosis [9], autophagy [10] and ferroptosis [11] plays an important role in the molecular and biological mechanism of BPD and the further development of the disease [12]. Studies have shown that alveolar epithelial cell deaths are associated with lung injury, affecting alveolar development and participates in the pathological process of BPD [12]. Therefore, it is essential to explore the potential pathogenesis of AEC II in BPD for the development and treatment of BPD. At present, many studies have focused on the regulation of the immune microenvironment during lung development and disease [13]. The pathogenesis of BPD also includes changes in the proportion of immune cells [9]. In recent years, studies have mainly focused on the role of immune cells and immune responses in the pathogenesis of BPD, but the mechanism and role of different immune cells in BPD still unclear. Several recent discoveries have been made regarding how a particular subset of Natural killer T (NKT) cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, play a key role in chronic inflammation and fibrosis in lung [14] and liver diseases [15], iNKT cells activation is considered to be an important upstream event that promotes chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis [15,16]. iNKT cells are considered as a kind of innate T lymphocyte population, which are lymphocytes with the characteristics of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells, and serve as a bridge connecting the two immune responses, which can initiate or inhibit immune responses depending on the environment, account for the majority of NKT cells [17]. iNKT cells are tissue-resident and play an important role in tissue homeostasis and immunity in lung tissues, they patrol the lumen of pulmonary vascular and interstitial tissue until lung tissue becomes infected and signals danger, causing iNKT cells migrate to damaged sites containing glycolipid antigens and inducing iNKT cells to initiate early host defense mechanisms, preferentially locating in lung parenchyma [18]. The percentage of iNKT cells in lung tissue was higher than that of other lymphocytes in the lung [19]. Previous studies have shown that the number and function of iNKT cells are different in different lung diseases [14]. Pulmonary iNKT cells are involved in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including direct pathogenic effects through their cytokine secretion, or more indirectly by regulating the function of neighboring immune cells [14]. In particular, cytokine production by iNKT cells has been implicated in many lung diseases, including allergic asthma [20], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [21], pulmonary fibrosis [16], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [22], and others. iNKT cells are adaptive immune cells with innate functions that have been shown to play a role in the neonatal immune response, where they can be activated by proinflammatory cytokines or lipid antigens and trigger further cytokine production and activation by other immune cell populations [23]. It has been shown that iNKT cells play an important role in the neonatal response to sepsis, and loss of iNKT cells leads to improved survival in neonatal septic mice [24]. iNKT cells are involved in the deterioration of lung disease after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in neonatal mice [25]. Therefore, it may be particularly valuable to further investigate the role of pulmonary iNKT cells in respiratory diseases, which may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic targets. However, the role of iNKT cells in BPD remains unclear. IL-15 is a major cytokine responsible for NKT cells development, maturation, and survival [26]. In this study, we first downloaded microarray data from GEO database to analyze the peripheral blood IL-15 expression in BPD patients, and clinically examined peripheral blood NKT cells changes in BPD patients. Secondly, a mouse model of BPD was established by hyperoxia to investigate the effect of iNKT cells in lung tissue on lung differentiation. Finally, iNKT cells sorted by magnetic beads and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system were established in vitro under hyperoxia. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on AEC II under different incubation conditions to investigate the possible mechanisms by which iNKT cells affect AEC II.",
    "methods": "2. Methods 2.1. Microarray analysis of the NKT cells developmental factor IL-15 in BPD Since IL-15 is a major cytokine responsible for NKT cell development, maturation, and survival [26], we investigated changes in IL-15 expression in BPD patients. We screened the GEO database for microarray sequencing analysis data that met the following criteria: (1) studies containing preterm infants of less than 32 weeks gestational age and birth weight ≤1500 g, (2) studies with blood samples that were from infants on the 5th to 14th day of life for the assessment of gene expression. Based on the above criteria, one data set (GSE32472) [27] was obtained from the GEO database. A total of 111 preterm infants were included in this prospective study, conducted between September 1, 2008, and November 30, 2010. The GSE32472 of RNA sequencing in peripheral blood of BPD children was downloaded from  GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). These data were normalized and log2 transformed. Analyses were performed using the GEO2R tool. 2.2. Flow cytometry was used to detect NKT cells in peripheral blood of BPD patients Patients hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from September 2022 to January 2024, Twenty preterm infants (selected gestational age＜32 weeks and length of hospital stay＞14 d). Exclusion criteria: (1) complicated with severe congenital malformation; (2) combined with inherited metabolic diseases and/or chromosomal diseases; (3) withdrawal from treatment or death during hospitalization; (4) missing clinical data; (5) Informed consent was not obtained. According to the diagnostic criteria of BPD, they were divided into BPD group (n = 10) and non-BPD group (n = 10). BPD was diagnosed according to the 2018 BPD diagnostic criteria [28]. Whole blood (0.5 mL) was collected from the BPD patients and healthy controls using an anticoagulant tube, then 10 mL of ACK split red cell was added twice, and stained with CD45-PECy5.5, CD3 -FITC and CD56-PE (BioLegend, USA). NKT cells were labeled by CD45+CD3+CD56+ cells [21,29,30]. The activation of NKT cells was assessed by CD69 [21]. The expression of CD45+CD3+CD56+ and CD69 was detected by flow cytometry to observe the percentage and activation status of NKT cells. The basic information of the patient is shown in Table 1. This study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University (SWYXLL20200121-17). Table 1. Basic information of the patient. Characteristic Non-BPD BPD Number of cases 10 10 Birth weight 1658 ± 172 1351 ± 184 Gestational age 30.7 ± 1.0 28.9 ± 1.0 Sex, male/female 5/5 7/3 Chronologic age of premature infants 31 32 History of chorioamnionitis 2 3 Early onset sepsis 1 3 Open in a new tab 2.3. Establishment of BPD models Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Animal Center of Jiangsu University at embryonic day (E)15-E17. All pups were randomly assigned and allocated to two nursing mothers at P1 (P0 is the birth date) to obtain six or seven newborn mice per nursing mother. This study used a hyperoxia model: hyperoxia (85 % O2) from P1 to P14 according to the model establishment method in the research group [31], and the nursing mother mice were replaced every 12 h to avoid oxygen poisoning. To exclude the effect of sex, we used male mice. Mice were housed in specific pathogen free (SPF) grade animal feeding facilities, and a self-made hyperoxia device and oxygen making machine (Yuyue, China) were used and the procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jiangsu University (Grant no: UJS-IACUC-2022052501). 2.4. Pathological analysis and glycogen staining The overall technique used in mouse lung acquisition and analysis has been previously published by our group [31]. In brief, at P3, P7, P10 and P14, lungs were thoroughly perfused with PBS before harvesting, part of the lung tissue in 4 % paraformaldehyde was used for paraffin embedding, and part of the lung was flash frozen for protein and RNA isolation. All studies were performed in each experiment with 4–9 animals per group. Fixed tissue was cut into 5 μm thick sections and sections were used for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining morphometric analysis. To obtain a complete slide image, the slide was scanned. Lung volume measurements were performed by carefully drying the inflated and fixed lungs with soft tissue and assessed using the Archimedes principle [3]. At least 5 slides were assessed under a light microscope at 100× magnification from per mouse of each specimen. Images were from 10 randomly selected parenchymal fields, and regions with large airways or blood vessels were excluded. The structural and morphological changes of the lung tissue were observed under a light microscope at 400× magnification. Radial alveolar count (RAC) and mean linear intercept (MLI) were obtained using previously described methods [32]. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining was processed and examined as previously described [33]. 2.5. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis Pups were sacrificed on P14, with 2 volumes of 300 μL of cold 1 × PBS were instilled, gently aspirated, and pooled, BALF was collected via cannulation of the trachea and lung lavage. Cells were prepared by cytocentrifugation, and stained with Geimsa. The total number of immune cells was counted using a Neubauer-improved and expressed per milliliter of BALF. 2.6. iNKT cells in lung tissue of newborn mice were detected by flow cytometry To analyze iNKT cells in mouse lung tissues, we first collected lung tissues at P3, P7, P10, and P14 days after normoxia and hyperoxia exposure, filtered them through a 70 μm cell strainer, and stained with Fixable viability dye EF780 (eBioscience, USA) to distinguish viable cells. Finally, staining was performed with NK1.1-PE-Cy7, CD3-FITC, and CD69-PE antibodies (BioLegend, USA). CD3/NK1.1 double intermediate positive cells were defined as iNKT cells as previously described [34,35]. The activation status of iNKT cells was next assessed with CD69 [35]. 2.7. iNKT cells were blocked or specific activation in mice Newborn hyperoxia group mice were intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody (BioXCell, USA) to inhibit iNKT cells activation at P7(10 μg/g, once a day for 4 consecutive days, while mice in the control group were injected with IgG) [36]. To activate iNKT cells, mice were instilled with 2 μg α-Galcer (Aladdin, China) via nasal drip for 4 days [37]. Three days after the end of the intervention, which was 14 days after birth, lung tissue samples were collected. H&E staining was used to observe the pathological changes of the lung, PAS was used to observe the lung development, and the lung differentiation was evaluated by WB and immunofluorescence. 2.8. iNKT cells were sorted from mice lung tissue by magnetic beads iNKT cells in normal C57BL/6 mouse lung tissues were extracted from mouse tissues using the mouse NK1.1+ iNKT cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). iNKT cells were sorted by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell purity was detected by flow cytometry, purity greater than 95 % was used for subsequent experiments. The iNKT cells suspension was dropped on the slide, and the cell specimens on the slide were driven at a uniform speed to make cell smears. After natural drying, the slides were dropped with Wray-Giemsa composite staining solution (Solebo, China) for staining for 5 min, and buffer solution was added for staining for 5 min. After repeated washing, the slides were dried and fixed. Microscopic observation and photographs were taken by Leica microscope. 2.9. Adoptive transfer of lung tissue-derived iNKT cells Extraction of iNKT cells from normal mouse lung tissue 1 × 106 cells/ml were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium, counted and seeded in 6-well plates. DiR also known as Cy7 DiC18, was purchased from aladdin Biotech Co., LTD., in 2.5 mg/mL was dissolved in DMSO and stored at 4 °C, then DiR solution was diluted, added and incubated for half an hour at 37 °C, 5 % CO2. After washing with PBS, the cells suspension was centrifuged at 500 g, 5 min at 4 °C, washed, resuspended, and injected into P10 mice in the normoxia and hyperoxia group by tail vein injection technique (5 × 105 cells/mouse). The fluorescence labeling of cells was observed using a small animal in vivo imaging system, and pictures were taken at 0, 30 min, 12 h and 24 h. At different time points, the small animal in vivo imaging system was used to detect the changes in migration of iNKT cells after adoptive transfer in mice. Finally, the mice were sacrificed, and heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were harvested and imaged ex vivo. The effect of adoptive transfer of iNKT cells in mice on lung differentiation was also observed. 2.10. Cell culture and transwell AEC II-iNKT co-culture construction The MLE12 cell line was purchased from Servicebio. MLE12 cells have characteristics of type II alveolar epithelium and are commonly used as AEC II in mice [38]. AEC II were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium with 10 % FBS at 37 °C in 5 % CO2. AEC II-iNKT co-culture system: iNKT cells were seeded in 0.4 μm transwell chambers at the number of 1 × 104 cells/well, and AEC II were seeded uniformly in 24-well plates. After AEC II attachment, transwell inserts containing iNKT cells were moved into wells where AEC II was attached and incubated for 72 h under normoxia and hyperoxia conditions. In addition, AEC II was cultured under normoxia and hyperoxia alone for 72 h. In vitro, we used a hypoxia chamber device from billups-rothenberg Company. The treated well plate was placed into the middle layer and closed, the oxygen cylinder was connected, and the oxygen concentration was detected at the same time. The supernatant and lower layer were collected for subsequent detection. 2.11. RNA sequencing was performed on AEC II that were incubated with or without iNKT cells After 72 h of AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture, total RNA was extracted from AEC II by trizol reagent (Absin, China), and transcriptome sequencing was performed to analyze the possible mechanism of iNKT cells affecting AEC II differentiation. RNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina sequencing platform (Gene Denovo Biotechnology, China). Raw gene expression levels were normalized to fragments per kilobase transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). By filtering the edgeR gm benchmark (|log2fc|＞1.5, p＜0.05) were applied to the FPKM values to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). 2.12. Fe2+, IL-17A and IL-6 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Different groups of cells were detected according to the instructions, the contents of Fe2+ (Solarbio, China), IL-17A (Lianke Biological, China) and IL-6 (Vazyme, China) were determined by ELISA. 2.13. Lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde (MDA) The C11 biodipy fluorescent probe was added into the supernatant of cell culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μM and incubated for 40 min to detect lipid peroxidation levels in AEC II. To assess the level of concentration in each group, the concentration of MDA in cell lysates was assessed using an MDA assay kit (Beyotime, China). 2.14. The protein levels of surfactant protein C (SP–C) and podoplanin (PDPN/T1α), ferroptosis-related markers glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin heavy chain(FTH1) and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase2(PTGS2) were detected by western blot (WB) Different groups of cell or tissue lysates were extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) supplemented with protease inhibitor (NCM Biotech, China), total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). The cells were then treated with rapid blocking solution (NCM Biotech, China) for 10 min at room temperature. Blots were examined overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) conjugated to the HRP corresponding to the species were then introduced. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) were used to visualize the protein bands. Primary antibodies anti-SP-C, anti-T1α, anti-GPX4, anti-PTGS2, anti-FTH1 and β-actin were purchased from Abcam, Proteintech, Wanleibio and Santa Cruz. The goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG H&L (HRP)(secondary antibody) were purchased from Beyotime. 2.15. The expression of SP-C and T1α in lung tissue and cells were detected by immunofluorescence After paraffin block sectioning, deparaffinization, xylene treatment and alcohol gradient dehydration, antigen repair was performed in sodium citrate buffer (Biosharp, China), the lung tissue was marked with a histochemical pen (Biosharp, China). Cells needed to be seeded in well plates with cell slides (Biosharp, China), and the supernatant was uniformly discarded at the end point of collection, fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and washed with PBS. For tissue and cellular immunofluorescence, the blocking solution prepared by mixing BSA and Triton was added, placed at 4 °C for 30 min, rinsed with PBS, and diluted immunofluorescence antibody was added according to the instructions of the antibody anti-SP-C and anti-T1α. The secondary immunofluorescent antibody (Abcam, USA) was diluted with the dilution of immunofluorescent secondary antibody (Beyotime, China), and then placed at room temperature in a dark place for 1.5 h. After washing, DAPI Fluoromount-G® (SouthernBiotech, USA) was added, and the cells were observed and filmed under a Thunder fluorescence microscope (Leica, Japan). The number of AEC II/AEC I positive cells were determined by analyzing the fluorescence intensity of SP-C/T1α using image software. Image J software was used to analyze the co-localization of SP-C/T1α positive cells. 2.16. The ferroptosis-related markers GPX4, FTH1 and PTGS2 were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted by RNA Rapid purification kit (YiShan Biotechnology, China). cDNA was synthesized by PrimeScript RT Master Mix (TaKaRa, Japan). qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green qPCR kit (Vazyme, China). Relative gene expression was identified using the 2−ΔΔCt method and normalized to β-actin. The primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech. 2.17. AEC II morphology was observed by transmission electron microscope The AEC II of different groups were collected, the medium was discarded, fixed in electron microscope fixative(2.5 % glutaraldehyde), and the cell suspension was centrifuged into clusters. The ultrastructural changes of ferroptosis in AEC II were observed by transmission electron microscopy (Hitachi, Japan), which was performed by Servicebio Biotechnology. 2.18. Effect of ferroptosis on AEC II on the expression of SP-C and T1α To investigate the effect of ferroptosis on the expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia, 1 μM ferroptosis agonists Erastin (MCE, USA) and 0.1 μM ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostein-1(Fer-1, MCE, USA) were added respectively, then were divided into six groups: Hyperoxia + DMSO, Hyperoxia + iNKT cells + DMSO, Hyperoxia + Erastin, Hyperoxia + iNKT cells + Erastin, Hyperoxia + Fer-1, and Hyperoxia + iNKT cells + Fer-1, and the differentiation of AEC II were detected by WB. 2.19. Statistics GraphPad Prism 9.0 was used for statistical analysis. Inter-group variables were compared using Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). All experiments were repeated at least three times. All results were represented by mean ± standard deviation (SD), and statistical significance was determined by a p value of less than 0.05 (∗P＜0.05, ∗∗P＜0.01, ∗∗∗P＜0.001).",

Activation of NKT cells in peripheral blood of patients with BPD Since IL-15 is a major cytokine responsible for the development, maturation, and survival of NKT cells [26], we downloaded GEO data GSE32472 to explore IL-15 mRNA levels in peripheral blood on days 5 and 14 with BPD progression. The expression of IL-15 gradually increased with the progression of BPD (Fig. 1A). We first aimed to determine the percentage of NKT cells (CD45+CD56+CD3+) in peripheral blood (Fig. 1B). Patients with BPD had an increased percentage of NKT cells (Fig. 1C and D) and the △MFI of the activation markers CD69 relative to isotype controls was analyzed on NKT cells (CD3+CD56+) in BPD group and non-BPD group (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that: NKT cells may be involved in the pathological process of BPD. Fig. 1.

BPD mice were constructed, and there were disorders of lung development In this study, we constructed a mouse model of BPD induced by hyperoxia. The body size changes of mice under normoxia and hyperoxia at P3, P7, P10, and P14 were evaluated and compared. The body size development of hyperoxia group was lagging behind that of mice grown in normoxia group (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 1A). Relative to the normoxia group, the number of immune cells in BALF increased in hyperoxia group at P14 (Fig. 2B). To evaluate the pathological changes in lung tissue by H&E staining was used. Hyperoxia group mice had disordered alveolar structure with progressive thickening of alveolar walls, decreased number of alveoli, and simplified structure, lung volume decreased, RAC decreased, and MLI increased, (Fig. 2C–E). To assess lung development, we used PAS staining to detect glycogen in lung epithelial cells.We used tissue immunofluorescence and WB for the SP-C (AEC II-specific marker) and T1α (AEC I-specific marker). In the present study, pulmonary epithelial glycogen content was measured by PAS staining, the epithelial content of glycogen reflects the development and maturation of the lung [39], and it was found that hyperoxia group mice had increased glycogen content compared with normoxia group mice at P14 (Fig. 2F). Immunofluorescence double staining showed that the expression of both SP-C and T1α was decreased, and the number of T1α+ SP-C+ cells (% total SP-C+ cells) was decreased (Fig. 2G). WB results showed that the protein expressions of SP-C and T1α in lung tissue of hyperoxia group mice were lower than those of the normoxia group (Fig. 2H). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab BPD mice were constructed, and there were disorders of lung development A. Mouse pups were exposed to normoxia (21 % O2) or hyperoxia (85 % O2) from the day of birth.

Hyperoxia exposure promoted the accumulation and activation of iNKT cells in the lungs of mice The recruitment of CD45+ immune cells after hyperoxia exposure was increased (+20 %–30 %) compared with the normal group at P14 (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The percentage of iNKT cells in the lung increased after hyperoxia exposure (Fig. 3A–C). Meanwhile, the expression of CD69 (a marker of iNKT cells activation) on iNKT cells was continuously increased in hyperoxia group at P7 by flow cytometry (Fig. 3D). Hyperoxia exposure resulted in increased recruitment or a local expansion of activated iNKT cells in the lungs. Fig. 3.

Inhibition of iNKT cells activation alleviated abnormal lung development in BPD mice To determine whether iNKT cells contributed to the observed lung injury, hyperoxia mice were treated with anti-CD1d antibody (or isotype control antibody) to limit iNKT cells activation and reduce their numbers [36]. Treatment of mice in the hyperoxia group with anti-CD1d significantly reduced cell numbers in the BALF compared with the use of anti-IgG controls (Fig. 4A). Hyperoxia group mice were intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD1d antibody to inhibit iNKT cells activation and abundance, the alveolar structure tends to be regular, the number of alveoli increases, and the alveolar walls become thinner, RAC increased and MLI decreased (Fig. 4B–C). The glycogen content of the contrast lung epithelium was evaluated and decreased after administration of anti-CD1d in hyperoxia group by PAS staining (Fig. 4B–C). The results of immunofluorescence double staining showed that the expression of SP-C and T1α in lung tissues of hyperoxia group mice treated with anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody was increased at P14, and T1α+ SP-C+ cells (% total SP-C+ cells) were increased compared with hyperoxia group mice (Fig. 4D). WB results showed that the protein expression of SP-C and T1α in the lung tissue of the hyperoxia group was decreased, and SP-C and T1α were increased in hyperoxia group mice treated with anti-CD1d (Fig. 4E).

Specific activation of iNKT cells and increased number of iNKT cells aggravated lung disorders in BPD mice To understand the role of pulmonary iNKT cells in the pathogenesis of BPD, mice were given α-GalCer intranasal at P7 for 4 days and examined the features of BPD pathology at P14 (Fig. 5A). Repeated intranasal administration of α-GalCer to mice showed no abnormal appearance or behavior. α-GalCer significantly increased the number of iNKT cells detected by flow cytometry and the gene expression marker Vα14Jα18 in the lung (Supplementary Figs. 1C–D). As shown in Fig. 5B, observed in hyperoxia group mice with repeated administration of α-GalCer, H&E showed enlarged alveoli and marked cellular infiltrates in the lungs of mice given repeated α-GalCer, which were not found in the lungs of treated control IgG. The degree of impairment in lung parameters was increased compared with hyperoxia group mice, specifically, RAC decreased and MLI increased (Fig. 5B–C). The proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A were increased in the lungs of mice treated with α-GalCer compared with mice treated with control (Supplementary Figs. 1E–F). The epithelial content of contrast glycogen was evaluated, and glycogen staining increased after α-GalCer administration compared with hyperoxia group mice (Fig. 5B–C). To further verify the effect of the number and activation of iNKT cells on BPD mice, iNKT cells in the lungs of mice were sorted by magnetic beads, and their purity was identified by flow cytometry, its purity was more than 95 % (Supplementary Fig. 1G). After adoptive transfer of iNKT cells via tail vein, they were placed in the normoxia and hyperoxia environment respectively. DiR-labeled iNKT cells were detected by in vivo small animal imaging at the time of adoptive transfusion, 30 min, 12 h and 24 h. The iNKT cells were mainly concentrated in the liver and lung. Compared with the normoxia group, the hyperoxia group had stronger fluorescence intensity of DiR stained iNKT cells in vivo, and significantly increased fluorescence intensity in liver and lung, suggesting that hyperoxia could induce recruitment of iNKT cells in lung (Fig. 5D). At the same time, after adoptive transfer of iNKT cells to the hyperoxia group at P10, showed disordered alveolar structure, larger alveolar fusion, reduced number, simplified structure, thickened alveolar wall, and increased inflammatory cells compared with the control group at P14 (Fig. 5G–H). WB results showed that SP-C and T1α protein expression in the lung tissue of the hyperoxia group was decreased, and SP-C and T1α protein expression was significantly decreased in hyperoxia group mice adoptive transfer with iNKT cells (Fig. 5F). The results of immunofluorescence double staining showed that the expression of SP-C and T1α in the lung tissue of hyperoxia group mice adoptive transfer with iNKT cells detected at P14 was decreased, and T1α+SP-C+ cells (% total SP-C+ cells) were decreased compared with hyperoxia group mice (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that the pathological manifestations of BPD are aggravated after the use of iNKT cells-specific activators and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells. Fig. 5.

AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture and the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II under hyperoxia To investigate the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II, we established AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture model under normoxia and hyperoxia, respectively. iNKT cells were sorted by magnetic beads and stained by Wright-Giemsa staining. The cells were round in shape, consistent with the characteristics of lymphocytes (Fig. 6A). AEC II was cultured alone or with iNKT cells sorted by magnetic beads and exposed to normoxia and hyperoxia for 72 h, respectively (Fig. 6B). WB was used to detect the expression of SP-C and T1α in AEC II, after 72 h of exposure in compared with the normoxia group, the expression of SP-C in AEC II in hyperoxia group was significantly decreased, the expression level of T1α was increased. The expression of SP-C and T1α in AEC II + iNKT group was lower than the AEC II group under hyperoxia (Fig. 6C). Therefore, we performed immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression of SP-C was dominant in AEC II in normoxia group. However, the expression of SP-C was extremely low in hyperoxia group. SP-C and T1α were reduced, and colocalization was reduced in the AEC II + iNKT group compared with AEC II alone under hyperoxia (Fig. 6D). ELISA was used to detect increased IL-6 and IL-17A in the supernatant of iNKT cells co-cultured with AEC II (Supplementary Figs. 1H–I). Fig. 6.

P＜0.05 and | log2fc |＞1.5 genes were considered differentially expressed. Based on these, we find differentially expressed genes with programmed cell death in the GO database (http://www.geneontology.org/) related genes are compared, and ferroptosis was found the number of differentially expressed genes related to the highest in all genes associated with programmed cell death (Fig. 7A–B). Compared with AEC II under hyperoxia alone, the mRNA levels of GPX4 and FTH1 were significantly decreased and PTGS2 were increased in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia (Fig. 7C). In addition, WB showed a significant decrease in GPX4 and FTH1 levels and an increase in PTGS2 (Fig. 7D). Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased as detected by C11 bodipy staining (Fig. 7E). Hyperoxia led to increased Fe2+ and MDA levels in AEC II, which increased when co-cultured with iNKT cells compared with AEC II alone group (Fig. 7F–G). Fig. 7.

(∗P＜0.05, ∗∗P＜0.01, ∗∗∗P＜0.001).Fig. 7H showed the characteristics of ferroptosis by transmission electron microscope (TEM), suggested that after under hyperoxia, the AEC II showed that decrease the size of the mitochondria membrane density increase, mitochondrial cristae decreased, mitochondrial outer membrane rupture, after AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured under hyperoxia, the mitochondrial changes were even more pronounced. These results suggest that AEC II ferroptosis in hyperoxia may be associated with iNKT cells. 3.8. AEC II ferroptosis accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α AEC II culture alone under hyperoxia, we found that after added the ferroptosis activator Erastin, GPX4 was decreased, PTGS2 was elevated, and SP-C and T1α were decreased compared to the AEC II + DMSO group under hyperoxia, and when the ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 was added, GPX4 was elevated, PTGS2 was decreased, and SP-C and T1α were elevated compared to the AEC II + DMSO group under hyperoxia. In AEC II + iNKT cells group under hyperoxia, after added the ferroptosis activator Erastin, we found that GPX4 was decreased, PTGS2 was increased, and T1α and SP-C were decreased compared with AEC II + iNKT cells + DMSO group. In AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured system under hyperoxia, after add ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1, showed that GPX4 was increased, PTGS2 was decreased, and T1α and SP-C were increased compared with AEC II + iNKT cells + DMSO group (Fig. 8A–B).

    "discussion": "4. Discussion BPD is a common chronic lung disease in young preterm infants, and the main pathological change is alveolar dysfunction [40]. In our study, a classic neonatal mice model of BPD exposed to hyperoxia was used, H&E results showed that compared with the normoxia group, the hyperoxia group had simplified alveolar structure, reduced alveolar number, dilated alveolar space, and significantly thickened alveolar wall, this indicates that we have successfully established a mice model of BPD. At present, it is believed that AEC II injury is the key to lung epithelial injury and is the pathological basis of BPD [41]. AEC II is the main stem cell in the lung, which can differentiate into AEC I to maintain lung homeostasis. In the recent study, AEC II was labeled with SP-C and E-cadherin, and differentiation of AEC II was evaluated by qRT-PCR and immunostaining/western blot [42]. SP-C is a highly specific AEC II cell marker. T1α is AEC I cell marker. Differentiated AEC II and AEC I cells differ phenotypically and express different cell-specific marker. SP-C+/T1α+ cells refer to the co-expression situation of these two markers, suggesting that these cells may be in a transformed or partially differentiated state. Certainly, the expression of SP-C+/T1α+ may also be heterogeneous during the differentiation of AEC II into AEC I, this was also initially confirmed in previous study [43], however, SP-C+/T1α+ double labeling of AEC II can be used to determine the differentiation of AEC II into AEC I. We found that the proportion of SP-C and T1α double-stained cells was significantly lower in the hyperoxia group compared with the normoxia group, and a decrease in SP-C expression without a corresponding increase in T1α expression under hyperoxia by WB analysis of lung tissue. Glycogen is an important substance that reflects the maturity of ACE II [44]. With cell differentiation, glycogen is consumed and converted into alveolar surfactant phospholipids, so PAS staining can be used to assess pulmonary differentiation, we also found glycogen content was increased in the hyperoxia group compared with the normoxia group of littermates, these results suggested that hyperoxia reduced SP-C and T1α, and may related to abnormal AEC II differentiation. Recent studies have found that changes of iNKT cells in the number and function play an important role in lung diseases. Under normal physiological conditions, iNKT cells are most abundant in the liver, spleen and lung, when in inflammation or infection, such as in pulmonary asthma [45], acute hyperoxic lung injury [46], LPS-induced acute lung injury [47], COPD [21], ARDS [22] and sterile inflammation [48], iNKT cells can be significantly increased and activated in the lung to a certain extent, which is pathogenic. At present, the role of NKT in BPD is not clear. IL-15 is a developmental factor of NKT cells [26]. Microarray data analysis shows that BPD patients have a significant increase in IL-15, but it is not clear whether NKT cells activated and increased in BPD. Firstly, we examined the NKT cells in the peripheral blood of patients with BPD and found that NKT cells increased and activated in peripheral blood of patients with BPD, suggest that NKT cells may play a role in the development of BPD, but further studies are needed. So, we used hyperoxia to replicate the BPD model, and found that compared with the normoxia group, the percentage of iNKT cells in lung tissue was increased, and the CD69 representing their activation status was significantly increased, suggesting that NKT cells may be involved in the pathophysiological process of BPD. Studies suggested that iNKT cells activation is a key upstream event that promotes chronic inflammation and fibrosis, and it is involved in the type 1, type 2, and type 3 cytokine pathways to promote fibrosis [14]. iNKT cells activation has also been shown to play a key role in promoting Wnt signaling and promoting the transition of epithelial cells to myofibroblasts [15]. To further investigate whether the increase and activation of iNKT cells is associated with impaired lung differentiation in BPD, we used anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody interfering with iNKT cells activation status in BPD mice, the number of immune cells in BALF significantly reduced, H&E staining showed that as the activation status and abundance of iNKT cells decreased, the alveolar structure tended to be regular, the number of alveoli increased and alveoli cavity was more uniform, RAC increased and MLI decreased, PAS showed a decrease in glycogen, WB and tissue immunofluorescence showed that SP-C, T1α increased, and fluorescence localization showed that SP-C and T1α co-localization increased, these results suggested that the abnormal development in BPD mice was alleviated after using anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody. It has been shown that treatment with anti-human CD1d antibody in a primate inflammation model, significantly reduces the number of macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils in BALF. Previous studies have found that partial inhibition of iNKT cells activation by anti-CD1d antibody can reduce the release of cytokines in septic mice, thereby reducing the damage of organ function and ultimately reducing the mortality of septic mice [49]. Treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury model mice with anti-CD1d antibody alleviated lung dysfunction and inflammation [36], important features of COPD, such as inflammation and emphysema, were significantly suppressed in CD1d−/− lacking iNKT cells [21], CD1d deficiency has a protective effect on FA-induced renal fibrosis in mice [50,51]. The above studies suggest that blocking iNKT cell activation reduces alveolarization disorders in BPD and may be related to promoting lung differentiation. To further investigate whether iNKT cells activation exacerbates lung development disorder in BPD, in this study, we used nasal instillation of α-Galcer, a specific activator of iNKT cells [29], in addition to extract iNKT cells by magnetic beads and adoptive transfer into mice via the tail vein. We found that BPD mice treated with α-GalCer showed more disordered alveolar structure, larger alveolar fusion, reduced number, simplified structure, thickened alveolar wall, and increased inflammatory cells by H&E. PAS staining showed increased glycogen accumulation. We successfully sorted iNKT cells with a purity greater than 95 %, and after adoptive transfer into BPD mice, iNKT cells reached the lungs after 30 min of in vivo imaging observation. In a similar study to adoptive transfer, iNKT cells were found to first reach the lungs within 15 min [52]. Next, after successful adoptive transfer of iNKT cells, mice were exposed to hyperoxia for 4 days, and lung tissues were collected at P14. We found recruitment of iNKT cells in the lungs of the hyperoxia group, accompanied by an increase in glycogen by PAS staining, decreased expression of SP-C and T1α by WB and decreased co-localization of SP-C and T1α by immunofluorescence, these results showed that the lung disorder of BPD mice was aggravated after adoptive transfer iNKT cells. It has been suggested that repeated use of αGalCer to activate pulmonary iNKT cells can cause COPD-like symptoms [37], after adoptive transfer of iNKT cells in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, the lung injury score was increased by H&E [36]. The above studies suggest that iNKT cells activation and recruitment can aggravate lung injury, but whether it affects AEC II differentiation needs to be further studied. AEC II is the main stem cell in the lung, which can differentiate into AEC I [5]. In BPD, AEC II plays a central role in lung development arrest and injury repair. In our study, after 72 h of hyperoxia exposure, the expression of SP-C decreased, and T1α increased. The expression of T1α is different in vivo and in vitro under hyperoxia, which may be related to the following reasons: firstly, environment is not the same in vivo and in vitro, in vivo, cells are affected by many factors, including signal transduction between cells, immune response, etc., while in vitro culture, the cell environment is relatively simplified, may lead to different response patterns; secondly, the length of hyperoxia exposure is also different, 72 h of hyperoxia exposure is an acute lung injury, T1α compensatory increase. 14 days of hyperoxia exposure is a chronic lung injury, T1α decompensatory decrease, this is consistent with the results of Cao YX et al. [53] and Hou A et al. [54]; thirdly, Yee M et al., found that the increased T1α under hyperoxia is not differentiated from the labeled AEC II by special labeling of AEC II [55]. In future studies, tracing techniques for AEC II can be combined to better understand the functional changes of AEC II. To further clarify the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II, we verified it at the cellular level. We constructed AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system by transwell technology and under hyperoxia exposure. Immunofluorescence and WB results showed that SP-C decreased in the group of AEC II alone under hyperoxia, and the decrease of SP-C and T1α in the co-culture group of AEC II-iNKT cells was more significant under hyperoxia. Fluorescence localization showed that the co-localization of SP-C and T1α in AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured under hyperoxia was decreased, suggesting that iNKT cells aggravated abnormal AEC II under hyperoxia. Next, to explore the possible mechanisms underlying the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II, we performed RNA sequencing of AEC II in different groups, DEGs with PCD in the GO database related genes are compared, we found that among all PCD related differential genes, the number of DEGs related to ferroptosis was the highest. Ferroptosis is a form of PCD that is induced by lipid peroxidation and is iron-dependent [12,56,57], which plays an important role in the molecular and biological mechanism of BPD [58]. Previous studies have shown that hyperoxia induces ferroptosis and impairs lung development in neonatal mice, and features of ferroptosis are detected in mouse lung tissues and in vitro cell models under hyperoxia conditions [58]. Ferroptosis induces alveolar type II cell damage [59], induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar epithelial cells and promotes the process of fibrosis [60,61]. Recent studies also found that ferroptosis in AEC II causes pathological damage under hyperoxia and other stimuli. Additionally, ferroptosis is considered immune-regulated, and immune-derived cell death [62]. Gpx4 is the main core enzyme regulating the glutathione antioxidant system, and its reduction is an important marker for the occurrence of ferroptosis [56]. Our current study shows ferroptosis was changed both in AEC II cultured alone under hyperoxia and AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured under hyperoxia, but more pronounced in AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured group under hyperoxia, these changes included increased Fe2+, Lipid peroxidation, and MDA levels, as well as elevated expression of genes PTGS2, reduced expression of GPX4 and FTH1, and ferroptosis characteristics were more obvious in AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured group by transmission electron microscopy. However, whether iNKT cells recruitment and activation aggravates AEC II abnormal differentiation by ferroptosis need further study. To further demonstrate that iNKT cells aggravate AEC II damage by inducing ferroptosis under hyperoxia, ferroptosis activator Erastin and ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 were used. We found that T1α and SP-C were decreased when Erastin were added in iNKT + AEC II group, after add ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1, showed that T1α and SP-C were increased, these suggested that AEC II ferroptosis accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Previous studies have found that hyperoxia promotes AEC II ferroptosis, and increases the transdifferentiation of type II epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like cells [63]. Ferroptosis inhibitors liproxstatin - 1 (Lip) and deferoxamine (DFO) alleviated the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis [64]. These studies suggested that increased ferroptosis realates to differentation of AEC II. Our study mainly showed that iNKT cells aggravated the ferroptosis of AEC II under hyperoxia, but the specific mechanism still needs to be further studied. Previous studies have shown that IL-17A promotes airway epithelial ferroptosis in asthma [65], and it has been reported that IL-17A can cooperate with IL-6 to promote ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells under acute hyperoxia [66]. Previous study found that the pro-inflammatory effect of iNKT cells was mainly through the secretion of IL-17A and IL-6. Co-culture of AEC II and iNKT cells increased IL-17A levels than only AEC II cultured alone. Some studies reported the IL - 6 in the expression and significance of BPD environment [67]. After specifically activating iNKT cells, we found that inflammatory factor IL-6 and IL-17A were increased in vivo, IL-17A and IL-6 were also increased in the supernatant of AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured in vitro under hyperoxia. Therefore, we speculate that iNKT cells may also promote ferroptosis in AEC II by secreting IL-17A together with IL-6 present in the inflammatory environment. However, we have only initially explored the mechanism by which iNKT cells affect abnormal AEC II expression under hyperoxia. For this is just our speculation and some preliminary experimental verification, the follow-up still need further study. Nevertheless, there are still some limitations in this study. Our current study only found that iNKT cells affected the expression of AEC II and AEC I after hyperoxia, there is no direct evidence to support an association between the abundance and activation iNKT cells with impaired differentiation of AEC II into AEC I. Our study only used single gene to represent AEC II or AEC I to investigate the differentiation, we only use SP-C and T1α as the gene marker, if use multiple gene markers may be more rigorous. In future experiments, we will also employ lineage label to more clearly observe AEC II differentiation status in different pathological environments. Certainly, the most specific tool for iNKT cells in mice and humans are αGalCer/CD1d tetramers, it may be more specific if αGalCer/CD1d tetramers are employed. In addition, the main pathological manifestations of BPD are alveolarization disorder and abnormal pulmonary microvascular development, the interaction between NKT cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells under hyperoxia has not been explored. Studies have found that peripheral blood NKT cells are increased and activated, and inhibit the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), thereby inducing vascular injuries in diabetes [68]. S K et al. found that NKT cells induced by IL-4 leads to pulmonary artery wall thickening [69]. These studies suggested that abnormal activation of NKT cells may also affect microvascular endothelial cells, however, further studies are needed to determine whether NKT cells affects pulmonary microvascular development in BPD. Studies showed that iNKT cells accumulate mainly in microvasculature after moving from the thymus into circulation, and there is substantial evidence that iNKT cells migration into the lung tissue rapidly under various activation conditions, such as when the lung is stimulated by airborne antigens or infections [14]. Based on the above and our experimental results, can only presume hyperoxia lead to an increased recruitment or local expansion of activated iNKT cells in the lungs, which cannot be accurately determined as recruitment or tissue resident. In addition, CD69 in iNKT cells was detected to be elevated, and it is also one of the markers of early activation and tissue resident lymphocytes, however, an increase in CD69 alone does not represent tissue resident cells, may need to be confirmed by parabiosis experiments [70], so, we still need more in-depth research, and these will be further studied in the future. Our study found that hyperoxia leads to the recruitment and activation of iNKT cells in the lungs. Over-activated iNKT cells induces ferroptosis in AEC II, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. AEC II dysfunction leads to the obstruction of alveolarization and occurrence of BPD.",

Copyright notice ID: 11470607 PMID: 39342744 Abstract Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, the abnormal proliferate and differentiate ability of type II epithelial cells (AEC II) is the key to the pathological basis of BPD. Mechanisms regarding abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosis-related genes were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.

Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease characterized by immature lung development that affects almost half of extremely preterm infants [1]. Decreased alveolar number, simplified alveolar structure, and accompanying vascular lesions are features of BPD [2]. Hyperoxia can induce BPD phenotype and change the composition of cellular compartments [3]. Alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II) are the main stem cells of the lung and maintain normal lung function [4]. When the lung is damaged, AEC II have a role in replacing abnormal and damaged alveolar epithelial cells [5]. In particular, the abnormal ability of AEC II to proliferate and differentiate into AEC I is an important factor leading to this disease [6,7]. More and more evidence has shown that in addition to direct AEC II injury, other cell programmed cell death (PCD) including apoptosis [8], pyroptosis [9], autophagy [10] and ferroptosis [11] plays an important role in the molecular and biological mechanism of BPD and the further development of the disease [12]. Studies have shown that alveolar epithelial cell deaths are associated with lung injury, affecting alveolar development and participates in the pathological process of BPD [12]. Therefore, it is essential to explore the potential pathogenesis of AEC II in BPD for the development and treatment of BPD. At present, many studies have focused on the regulation of the immune microenvironment during lung development and disease [13]. The pathogenesis of BPD also includes changes in the proportion of immune cells [9]. In recent years, studies have mainly focused on the role of immune cells and immune responses in the pathogenesis of BPD, but the mechanism and role of different immune cells in BPD still unclear. Several recent discoveries have been made regarding how a particular subset of Natural killer T (NKT) cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, play a key role in chronic inflammation and fibrosis in lung [14] and liver diseases [15], iNKT cells activation is considered to be an important upstream event that promotes chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis [15,16]. iNKT cells are considered as a kind of innate T lymphocyte population, which are lymphocytes with the characteristics of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells, and serve as a bridge connecting the two immune responses, which can initiate or inhibit immune responses depending on the environment, account for the majority of NKT cells [17]. iNKT cells are tissue-resident and play an important role in tissue homeostasis and immunity in lung tissues, they patrol the lumen of pulmonary vascular and interstitial tissue until lung tissue becomes infected and signals danger, causing iNKT cells migrate to damaged sites containing glycolipid antigens and inducing iNKT cells to initiate early host defense mechanisms, preferentially locating in lung parenchyma [18]. The percentage of iNKT cells in lung tissue was higher than that of other lymphocytes in the lung [19]. Previous studies have shown that the number and function of iNKT cells are different in different lung diseases [14]. Pulmonary iNKT cells are involved in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including direct pathogenic effects through their cytokine secretion, or more indirectly by regulating the function of neighboring immune cells [14]. In particular, cytokine production by iNKT cells has been implicated in many lung diseases, including allergic asthma [20], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [21], pulmonary fibrosis [16], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [22], and others. iNKT cells are adaptive immune cells with innate functions that have been shown to play a role in the neonatal immune response, where they can be activated by proinflammatory cytokines or lipid antigens and trigger further cytokine production and activation by other immune cell populations [23]. It has been shown that iNKT cells play an important role in the neonatal response to sepsis, and loss of iNKT cells leads to improved survival in neonatal septic mice [24]. iNKT cells are involved in the deterioration of lung disease after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in neonatal mice [25]. Therefore, it may be particularly valuable to further investigate the role of pulmonary iNKT cells in respiratory diseases, which may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic targets. However, the role of iNKT cells in BPD remains unclear. IL-15 is a major cytokine responsible for NKT cells development, maturation, and survival [26]. In this study, we first downloaded microarray data from GEO database to analyze the peripheral blood IL-15 expression in BPD patients, and clinically examined peripheral blood NKT cells changes in BPD patients. Secondly, a mouse model of BPD was established by hyperoxia to investigate the effect of iNKT cells in lung tissue on lung differentiation. Finally, iNKT cells sorted by magnetic beads and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system were established in vitro under hyperoxia. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on AEC II under different incubation conditions to investigate the possible mechanisms by which iNKT cells affect AEC II.2. Methods 2.1. Microarray analysis of the NKT cells developmental factor IL-15 in BPD Since IL-15 is a major cytokine responsible for NKT cell development, maturation, and survival [26], we investigated changes in IL-15 expression in BPD patients. We screened the GEO database for microarray sequencing analysis data that met the following criteria: (1) studies containing preterm infants of less than 32 weeks gestational age and birth weight ≤1500 g, (2) studies with blood samples that were from infants on the 5th to 14th day of life for the assessment of gene expression. Based on the above criteria, one data set (GSE32472) [27] was obtained from the GEO database. A total of 111 preterm infants were included in this prospective study, conducted between September 1, 2008, and November 30, 2010. The GSE32472 of RNA sequencing in peripheral blood of BPD children was downloaded from  GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). These data were normalized and log2 transformed. Analyses were performed using the GEO2R tool.2.2. Flow cytometry was used to detect NKT cells in peripheral blood of BPD patients Patients hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from September 2022 to January 2024, Twenty preterm infants (selected gestational age＜32 weeks and length of hospital stay＞14 d). Exclusion criteria: (1) complicated with severe congenital malformation; (2) combined with inherited metabolic diseases and/or chromosomal diseases; (3) withdrawal from treatment or death during hospitalization; (4) missing clinical data; (5) Informed consent was not obtained. According to the diagnostic criteria of BPD, they were divided into BPD group (n = 10) and non-BPD group (n = 10). BPD was diagnosed according to the 2018 BPD diagnostic criteria [28]. Whole blood (0.5 mL) was collected from the BPD patients and healthy controls using an anticoagulant tube, then 10 mL of ACK split red cell was added twice, and stained with CD45-PECy5.5, CD3 -FITC and CD56-PE (BioLegend, USA). NKT cells were labeled by CD45+CD3+CD56+ cells [21,29,30]. The activation of NKT cells was assessed by CD69 [21]. The expression of CD45+CD3+CD56+ and CD69 was detected by flow cytometry to observe the percentage and activation status of NKT cells. The basic information of the patient is shown in Table 1. This study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University (SWYXLL20200121-17). Table 1. Basic information of the patient.

Establishment of BPD models Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Animal Center of Jiangsu University at embryonic day (E)15-E17. All pups were randomly assigned and allocated to two nursing mothers at P1 (P0 is the birth date) to obtain six or seven newborn mice per nursing mother. This study used a hyperoxia model: hyperoxia (85 % O2) from P1 to P14 according to the model establishment method in the research group [31], and the nursing mother mice were replaced every 12 h to avoid oxygen poisoning. To exclude the effect of sex, we used male mice. Mice were housed in specific pathogen free (SPF) grade animal feeding facilities, and a self-made hyperoxia device and oxygen making machine (Yuyue, China) were used and the procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jiangsu University (Grant no: UJS-IACUC-2022052501).2.4. Pathological analysis and glycogen staining The overall technique used in mouse lung acquisition and analysis has been previously published by our group [31]. In brief, at P3, P7, P10 and P14, lungs were thoroughly perfused with PBS before harvesting, part of the lung tissue in 4 % paraformaldehyde was used for paraffin embedding, and part of the lung was flash frozen for protein and RNA isolation. All studies were performed in each experiment with 4–9 animals per group. Fixed tissue was cut into 5 μm thick sections and sections were used for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining morphometric analysis. To obtain a complete slide image, the slide was scanned. Lung volume measurements were performed by carefully drying the inflated and fixed lungs with soft tissue and assessed using the Archimedes principle [3]. At least 5 slides were assessed under a light microscope at 100× magnification from per mouse of each specimen. Images were from 10 randomly selected parenchymal fields, and regions with large airways or blood vessels were excluded. The structural and morphological changes of the lung tissue were observed under a light microscope at 400× magnification. Radial alveolar count (RAC) and mean linear intercept (MLI) were obtained using previously described methods [32]. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining was processed and examined as previously described [33].2.5. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis Pups were sacrificed on P14, with 2 volumes of 300 μL of cold 1 × PBS were instilled, gently aspirated, and pooled, BALF was collected via cannulation of the trachea and lung lavage. Cells were prepared by cytocentrifugation, and stained with Geimsa. The total number of immune cells was counted using a Neubauer-improved and expressed per milliliter of BALF.2.6. iNKT cells in lung tissue of newborn mice were detected by flow cytometry To analyze iNKT cells in mouse lung tissues, we first collected lung tissues at P3, P7, P10, and P14 days after normoxia and hyperoxia exposure, filtered them through a 70 μm cell strainer, and stained with Fixable viability dye EF780 (eBioscience, USA) to distinguish viable cells. Finally, staining was performed with NK1.1-PE-Cy7, CD3-FITC, and CD69-PE antibodies (BioLegend, USA). CD3/NK1.1 double intermediate positive cells were defined as iNKT cells as previously described [34,35]. The activation status of iNKT cells was next assessed with CD69 [35].2.7. iNKT cells were blocked or specific activation in mice Newborn hyperoxia group mice were intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody (BioXCell, USA) to inhibit iNKT cells activation at P7(10 μg/g, once a day for 4 consecutive days, while mice in the control group were injected with IgG) [36]. To activate iNKT cells, mice were instilled with 2 μg α-Galcer (Aladdin, China) via nasal drip for 4 days [37]. Three days after the end of the intervention, which was 14 days after birth, lung tissue samples were collected. H&E staining was used to observe the pathological changes of the lung, PAS was used to observe the lung development, and the lung differentiation was evaluated by WB and immunofluorescence.2.8. iNKT cells were sorted from mice lung tissue by magnetic beads iNKT cells in normal C57BL/6 mouse lung tissues were extracted from mouse tissues using the mouse NK1.1+ iNKT cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). iNKT cells were sorted by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell purity was detected by flow cytometry, purity greater than 95 % was used for subsequent experiments. The iNKT cells suspension was dropped on the slide, and the cell specimens on the slide were driven at a uniform speed to make cell smears. After natural drying, the slides were dropped with Wray-Giemsa composite staining solution (Solebo, China) for staining for 5 min, and buffer solution was added for staining for 5 min. After repeated washing, the slides were dried and fixed. Microscopic observation and photographs were taken by Leica microscope.2.9. Adoptive transfer of lung tissue-derived iNKT cells Extraction of iNKT cells from normal mouse lung tissue 1 × 106 cells/ml were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium, counted and seeded in 6-well plates. DiR also known as Cy7 DiC18, was purchased from aladdin Biotech Co., LTD., in 2.5 mg/mL was dissolved in DMSO and stored at 4 °C, then DiR solution was diluted, added and incubated for half an hour at 37 °C, 5 % CO2. After washing with PBS, the cells suspension was centrifuged at 500 g, 5 min at 4 °C, washed, resuspended, and injected into P10 mice in the normoxia and hyperoxia group by tail vein injection technique (5 × 105 cells/mouse). The fluorescence labeling of cells was observed using a small animal in vivo imaging system, and pictures were taken at 0, 30 min, 12 h and 24 h. At different time points, the small animal in vivo imaging system was used to detect the changes in migration of iNKT cells after adoptive transfer in mice. Finally, the mice were sacrificed, and heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were harvested and imaged ex vivo. The effect of adoptive transfer of iNKT cells in mice on lung differentiation was also observed.2.10. Cell culture and transwell AEC II-iNKT co-culture construction The MLE12 cell line was purchased from Servicebio. MLE12 cells have characteristics of type II alveolar epithelium and are commonly used as AEC II in mice [38]. AEC II were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium with 10 % FBS at 37 °C in 5 % CO2. AEC II-iNKT co-culture system: iNKT cells were seeded in 0.4 μm transwell chambers at the number of 1 × 104 cells/well, and AEC II were seeded uniformly in 24-well plates. After AEC II attachment, transwell inserts containing iNKT cells were moved into wells where AEC II was attached and incubated for 72 h under normoxia and hyperoxia conditions. In addition, AEC II was cultured under normoxia and hyperoxia alone for 72 h. In vitro, we used a hypoxia chamber device from billups-rothenberg Company. The treated well plate was placed into the middle layer and closed, the oxygen cylinder was connected, and the oxygen concentration was detected at the same time. The supernatant and lower layer were collected for subsequent detection.2.11. RNA sequencing was performed on AEC II that were incubated with or without iNKT cells After 72 h of AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture, total RNA was extracted from AEC II by trizol reagent (Absin, China), and transcriptome sequencing was performed to analyze the possible mechanism of iNKT cells affecting AEC II differentiation. RNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina sequencing platform (Gene Denovo Biotechnology, China). Raw gene expression levels were normalized to fragments per kilobase transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). By filtering the edgeR gm benchmark (|log2fc|＞1.5, p＜0.05) were applied to the FPKM values to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).2.12. Fe2+, IL-17A and IL-6 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Different groups of cells were detected according to the instructions, the contents of Fe2+ (Solarbio, China), IL-17A (Lianke Biological, China) and IL-6 (Vazyme, China) were determined by ELISA.2.13. Lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde (MDA) The C11 biodipy fluorescent probe was added into the supernatant of cell culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μM and incubated for 40 min to detect lipid peroxidation levels in AEC II. To assess the level of concentration in each group, the concentration of MDA in cell lysates was assessed using an MDA assay kit (Beyotime, China).2.14. The protein levels of surfactant protein C (SP–C) and podoplanin (PDPN/T1α), ferroptosis-related markers glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin heavy chain(FTH1) and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase2(PTGS2) were detected by western blot (WB) Different groups of cell or tissue lysates were extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) supplemented with protease inhibitor (NCM Biotech, China), total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). The cells were then treated with rapid blocking solution (NCM Biotech, China) for 10 min at room temperature. Blots were examined overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) conjugated to the HRP corresponding to the species were then introduced. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) were used to visualize the protein bands. Primary antibodies anti-SP-C, anti-T1α, anti-GPX4, anti-PTGS2, anti-FTH1 and β-actin were purchased from Abcam, Proteintech, Wanleibio and Santa Cruz. The goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG H&L (HRP)(secondary antibody) were purchased from Beyotime.2.15. The expression of SP-C and T1α in lung tissue and cells were detected by immunofluorescence After paraffin block sectioning, deparaffinization, xylene treatment and alcohol gradient dehydration, antigen repair was performed in sodium citrate buffer (Biosharp, China), the lung tissue was marked with a histochemical pen (Biosharp, China). Cells needed to be seeded in well plates with cell slides (Biosharp, China), and the supernatant was uniformly discarded at the end point of collection, fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and washed with PBS. For tissue and cellular immunofluorescence, the blocking solution prepared by mixing BSA and Triton was added, placed at 4 °C for 30 min, rinsed with PBS, and diluted immunofluorescence antibody was added according to the instructions of the antibody anti-SP-C and anti-T1α. The secondary immunofluorescent antibody (Abcam, USA) was diluted with the dilution of immunofluorescent secondary antibody (Beyotime, China), and then placed at room temperature in a dark place for 1.5 h. After washing, DAPI Fluoromount-G® (SouthernBiotech, USA) was added, and the cells were observed and filmed under a Thunder fluorescence microscope (Leica, Japan). The number of AEC II/AEC I positive cells were determined by analyzing the fluorescence intensity of SP-C/T1α using image software. Image J software was used to analyze the co-localization of SP-C/T1α positive cells.2.16. The ferroptosis-related markers GPX4, FTH1 and PTGS2 were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted by RNA Rapid purification kit (YiShan Biotechnology, China). cDNA was synthesized by PrimeScript RT Master Mix (TaKaRa, Japan). qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green qPCR kit (Vazyme, China). Relative gene expression was identified using the 2−ΔΔCt method and normalized to β-actin. The primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech.2.17. AEC II morphology was observed by transmission electron microscope The AEC II of different groups were collected, the medium was discarded, fixed in electron microscope fixative(2.5 % glutaraldehyde), and the cell suspension was centrifuged into clusters. The ultrastructural changes of ferroptosis in AEC II were observed by transmission electron microscopy (Hitachi, Japan), which was performed by Servicebio Biotechnology.2.18. Effect of ferroptosis on AEC II on the expression of SP-C and T1α To investigate the effect of ferroptosis on the expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia, 1 μM ferroptosis agonists Erastin (MCE, USA) and 0.1 μM ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostein-1(Fer-1, MCE, USA) were added respectively, then were divided into six groups: Hyperoxia + DMSO, Hyperoxia + iNKT cells + DMSO, Hyperoxia + Erastin, Hyperoxia + iNKT cells + Erastin, Hyperoxia + Fer-1, and Hyperoxia + iNKT cells + Fer-1, and the differentiation of AEC II were detected by WB.2.19. Statistics GraphPad Prism 9.0 was used for statistical analysis. Inter-group variables were compared using Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). All experiments were repeated at least three times. All results were represented by mean ± standard deviation (SD), and statistical significance was determined by a p value of less than 0.05 (∗P＜0.05, ∗∗P＜0.01, ∗∗∗P＜0.001).3. Results 3.1. Activation of NKT cells in peripheral blood of patients with BPD Since IL-15 is a major cytokine responsible for the development, maturation, and survival of NKT cells [26], we downloaded GEO data GSE32472 to explore IL-15 mRNA levels in peripheral blood on days 5 and 14 with BPD progression. The expression of IL-15 gradually increased with the progression of BPD (Fig. 1A). We first aimed to determine the percentage of NKT cells (CD45+CD56+CD3+) in peripheral blood (Fig. 1B). Patients with BPD had an increased percentage of NKT cells (Fig. 1C and D) and the △MFI of the activation markers CD69 relative to isotype controls was analyzed on NKT cells (CD3+CD56+) in BPD group and non-BPD group (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that: NKT cells may be involved in the pathological process of BPD. Fig. 1.

BPD mice were constructed, and there were disorders of lung development In this study, we constructed a mouse model of BPD induced by hyperoxia. The body size changes of mice under normoxia and hyperoxia at P3, P7, P10, and P14 were evaluated and compared. The body size development of hyperoxia group was lagging behind that of mice grown in normoxia group (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 1A). Relative to the normoxia group, the number of immune cells in BALF increased in hyperoxia group at P14 (Fig. 2B). To evaluate the pathological changes in lung tissue by H&E staining was used. Hyperoxia group mice had disordered alveolar structure with progressive thickening of alveolar walls, decreased number of alveoli, and simplified structure, lung volume decreased, RAC decreased, and MLI increased, (Fig. 2C–E). To assess lung development, we used PAS staining to detect glycogen in lung epithelial cells.We used tissue immunofluorescence and WB for the SP-C (AEC II-specific marker) and T1α (AEC I-specific marker). In the present study, pulmonary epithelial glycogen content was measured by PAS staining, the epithelial content of glycogen reflects the development and maturation of the lung [39], and it was found that hyperoxia group mice had increased glycogen content compared with normoxia group mice at P14 (Fig. 2F). Immunofluorescence double staining showed that the expression of both SP-C and T1α was decreased, and the number of T1α+ SP-C+ cells (% total SP-C+ cells) was decreased (Fig. 2G). WB results showed that the protein expressions of SP-C and T1α in lung tissue of hyperoxia group mice were lower than those of the normoxia group (Fig. 2H). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab BPD mice were constructed, and there were disorders of lung development A. Mouse pups were exposed to normoxia (21 % O2) or hyperoxia (85 % O2) from the day of birth.

Hyperoxia exposure promoted the accumulation and activation of iNKT cells in the lungs of mice The recruitment of CD45+ immune cells after hyperoxia exposure was increased (+20 %–30 %) compared with the normal group at P14 (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The percentage of iNKT cells in the lung increased after hyperoxia exposure (Fig. 3A–C). Meanwhile, the expression of CD69 (a marker of iNKT cells activation) on iNKT cells was continuously increased in hyperoxia group at P7 by flow cytometry (Fig. 3D). Hyperoxia exposure resulted in increased recruitment or a local expansion of activated iNKT cells in the lungs. Fig. 3.

Inhibition of iNKT cells activation alleviated abnormal lung development in BPD mice To determine whether iNKT cells contributed to the observed lung injury, hyperoxia mice were treated with anti-CD1d antibody (or isotype control antibody) to limit iNKT cells activation and reduce their numbers [36]. Treatment of mice in the hyperoxia group with anti-CD1d significantly reduced cell numbers in the BALF compared with the use of anti-IgG controls (Fig. 4A). Hyperoxia group mice were intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD1d antibody to inhibit iNKT cells activation and abundance, the alveolar structure tends to be regular, the number of alveoli increases, and the alveolar walls become thinner, RAC increased and MLI decreased (Fig. 4B–C). The glycogen content of the contrast lung epithelium was evaluated and decreased after administration of anti-CD1d in hyperoxia group by PAS staining (Fig. 4B–C). The results of immunofluorescence double staining showed that the expression of SP-C and T1α in lung tissues of hyperoxia group mice treated with anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody was increased at P14, and T1α+ SP-C+ cells (% total SP-C+ cells) were increased compared with hyperoxia group mice (Fig. 4D). WB results showed that the protein expression of SP-C and T1α in the lung tissue of the hyperoxia group was decreased, and SP-C and T1α were increased in hyperoxia group mice treated with anti-CD1d (Fig. 4E). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Inhibition of iNKT cells activation alleviates abnormal lung development in BPD mice A.

Specific activation of iNKT cells and increased number of iNKT cells aggravated lung disorders in BPD mice To understand the role of pulmonary iNKT cells in the pathogenesis of BPD, mice were given α-GalCer intranasal at P7 for 4 days and examined the features of BPD pathology at P14 (Fig. 5A). Repeated intranasal administration of α-GalCer to mice showed no abnormal appearance or behavior. α-GalCer significantly increased the number of iNKT cells detected by flow cytometry and the gene expression marker Vα14Jα18 in the lung (Supplementary Figs. 1C–D). As shown in Fig. 5B, observed in hyperoxia group mice with repeated administration of α-GalCer, H&E showed enlarged alveoli and marked cellular infiltrates in the lungs of mice given repeated α-GalCer, which were not found in the lungs of treated control IgG. The degree of impairment in lung parameters was increased compared with hyperoxia group mice, specifically, RAC decreased and MLI increased (Fig. 5B–C). The proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A were increased in the lungs of mice treated with α-GalCer compared with mice treated with control (Supplementary Figs. 1E–F). The epithelial content of contrast glycogen was evaluated, and glycogen staining increased after α-GalCer administration compared with hyperoxia group mice (Fig. 5B–C). To further verify the effect of the number and activation of iNKT cells on BPD mice, iNKT cells in the lungs of mice were sorted by magnetic beads, and their purity was identified by flow cytometry, its purity was more than 95 % (Supplementary Fig. 1G). After adoptive transfer of iNKT cells via tail vein, they were placed in the normoxia and hyperoxia environment respectively. DiR-labeled iNKT cells were detected by in vivo small animal imaging at the time of adoptive transfusion, 30 min, 12 h and 24 h. The iNKT cells were mainly concentrated in the liver and lung. Compared with the normoxia group, the hyperoxia group had stronger fluorescence intensity of DiR stained iNKT cells in vivo, and significantly increased fluorescence intensity in liver and lung, suggesting that hyperoxia could induce recruitment of iNKT cells in lung (Fig. 5D). At the same time, after adoptive transfer of iNKT cells to the hyperoxia group at P10, showed disordered alveolar structure, larger alveolar fusion, reduced number, simplified structure, thickened alveolar wall, and increased inflammatory cells compared with the control group at P14 (Fig. 5G–H). WB results showed that SP-C and T1α protein expression in the lung tissue of the hyperoxia group was decreased, and SP-C and T1α protein expression was significantly decreased in hyperoxia group mice adoptive transfer with iNKT cells (Fig. 5F). The results of immunofluorescence double staining showed that the expression of SP-C and T1α in the lung tissue of hyperoxia group mice adoptive transfer with iNKT cells detected at P14 was decreased, and T1α+SP-C+ cells (% total SP-C+ cells) were decreased compared with hyperoxia group mice (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that the pathological manifestations of BPD are aggravated after the use of iNKT cells-specific activators and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells. Fig. 5.

AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture and the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II under hyperoxia To investigate the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II, we established AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture model under normoxia and hyperoxia, respectively. iNKT cells were sorted by magnetic beads and stained by Wright-Giemsa staining. The cells were round in shape, consistent with the characteristics of lymphocytes (Fig. 6A). AEC II was cultured alone or with iNKT cells sorted by magnetic beads and exposed to normoxia and hyperoxia for 72 h, respectively (Fig. 6B). WB was used to detect the expression of SP-C and T1α in AEC II, after 72 h of exposure in compared with the normoxia group, the expression of SP-C in AEC II in hyperoxia group was significantly decreased, the expression level of T1α was increased. The expression of SP-C and T1α in AEC II + iNKT group was lower than the AEC II group under hyperoxia (Fig. 6C). Therefore, we performed immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression of SP-C was dominant in AEC II in normoxia group. However, the expression of SP-C was extremely low in hyperoxia group. SP-C and T1α were reduced, and colocalization was reduced in the AEC II + iNKT group compared with AEC II alone under hyperoxia (Fig. 6D). ELISA was used to detect increased IL-6 and IL-17A in the supernatant of iNKT cells co-cultured with AEC II (Supplementary Figs. 1H–I). Fig. 6.

P＜0.05 and | log2fc |＞1.5 genes were considered differentially expressed. Based on these, we find differentially expressed genes with programmed cell death in the GO database (http://www.geneontology.org/) related genes are compared, and ferroptosis was found the number of differentially expressed genes related to the highest in all genes associated with programmed cell death (Fig. 7A–B). Compared with AEC II under hyperoxia alone, the mRNA levels of GPX4 and FTH1 were significantly decreased and PTGS2 were increased in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia (Fig. 7C). In addition, WB showed a significant decrease in GPX4 and FTH1 levels and an increase in PTGS2 (Fig. 7D). Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased as detected by C11 bodipy staining (Fig. 7E). Hyperoxia led to increased Fe2+ and MDA levels in AEC II, which increased when co-cultured with iNKT cells compared with AEC II alone group (Fig. 7F–G). Fig. 7.

(∗P＜0.05, ∗∗P＜0.01, ∗∗∗P＜0.001).Fig. 7H showed the characteristics of ferroptosis by transmission electron microscope (TEM), suggested that after under hyperoxia, the AEC II showed that decrease the size of the mitochondria membrane density increase, mitochondrial cristae decreased, mitochondrial outer membrane rupture, after AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured under hyperoxia, the mitochondrial changes were even more pronounced. These results suggest that AEC II ferroptosis in hyperoxia may be associated with iNKT cells.3.8. AEC II ferroptosis accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α AEC II culture alone under hyperoxia, we found that after added the ferroptosis activator Erastin, GPX4 was decreased, PTGS2 was elevated, and SP-C and T1α were decreased compared to the AEC II + DMSO group under hyperoxia, and when the ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 was added, GPX4 was elevated, PTGS2 was decreased, and SP-C and T1α were elevated compared to the AEC II + DMSO group under hyperoxia. In AEC II + iNKT cells group under hyperoxia, after added the ferroptosis activator Erastin, we found that GPX4 was decreased, PTGS2 was increased, and T1α and SP-C were decreased compared with AEC II + iNKT cells + DMSO group. In AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured system under hyperoxia, after add ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1, showed that GPX4 was increased, PTGS2 was decreased, and T1α and SP-C were increased compared with AEC II + iNKT cells + DMSO group (Fig. 8A–B). Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Ferroptosis relates to decreased SP-C and T1α A-B. The protein expressions of PTGS2,GPX4, T1α, SP-C in each group were detected by WB. (∗∗P＜0.01, ∗∗∗P＜0.001).4. Discussion BPD is a common chronic lung disease in young preterm infants, and the main pathological change is alveolar dysfunction [40]. In our study, a classic neonatal mice model of BPD exposed to hyperoxia was used, H&E results showed that compared with the normoxia group, the hyperoxia group had simplified alveolar structure, reduced alveolar number, dilated alveolar space, and significantly thickened alveolar wall, this indicates that we have successfully established a mice model of BPD. At present, it is believed that AEC II injury is the key to lung epithelial injury and is the pathological basis of BPD [41]. AEC II is the main stem cell in the lung, which can differentiate into AEC I to maintain lung homeostasis. In the recent study, AEC II was labeled with SP-C and E-cadherin, and differentiation of AEC II was evaluated by qRT-PCR and immunostaining/western blot [42]. SP-C is a highly specific AEC II cell marker. T1α is AEC I cell marker. Differentiated AEC II and AEC I cells differ phenotypically and express different cell-specific marker. SP-C+/T1α+ cells refer to the co-expression situation of these two markers, suggesting that these cells may be in a transformed or partially differentiated state. Certainly, the expression of SP-C+/T1α+ may also be heterogeneous during the differentiation of AEC II into AEC I, this was also initially confirmed in previous study [43], however, SP-C+/T1α+ double labeling of AEC II can be used to determine the differentiation of AEC II into AEC I. We found that the proportion of SP-C and T1α double-stained cells was significantly lower in the hyperoxia group compared with the normoxia group, and a decrease in SP-C expression without a corresponding increase in T1α expression under hyperoxia by WB analysis of lung tissue. Glycogen is an important substance that reflects the maturity of ACE II [44]. With cell differentiation, glycogen is consumed and converted into alveolar surfactant phospholipids, so PAS staining can be used to assess pulmonary differentiation, we also found glycogen content was increased in the hyperoxia group compared with the normoxia group of littermates, these results suggested that hyperoxia reduced SP-C and T1α, and may related to abnormal AEC II differentiation. Recent studies have found that changes of iNKT cells in the number and function play an important role in lung diseases. Under normal physiological conditions, iNKT cells are most abundant in the liver, spleen and lung, when in inflammation or infection, such as in pulmonary asthma [45], acute hyperoxic lung injury [46], LPS-induced acute lung injury [47], COPD [21], ARDS [22] and sterile inflammation [48], iNKT cells can be significantly increased and activated in the lung to a certain extent, which is pathogenic. At present, the role of NKT in BPD is not clear. IL-15 is a developmental factor of NKT cells [26]. Microarray data analysis shows that BPD patients have a significant increase in IL-15, but it is not clear whether NKT cells activated and increased in BPD. Firstly, we examined the NKT cells in the peripheral blood of patients with BPD and found that NKT cells increased and activated in peripheral blood of patients with BPD, suggest that NKT cells may play a role in the development of BPD, but further studies are needed. So, we used hyperoxia to replicate the BPD model, and found that compared with the normoxia group, the percentage of iNKT cells in lung tissue was increased, and the CD69 representing their activation status was significantly increased, suggesting that NKT cells may be involved in the pathophysiological process of BPD. Studies suggested that iNKT cells activation is a key upstream event that promotes chronic inflammation and fibrosis, and it is involved in the type 1, type 2, and type 3 cytokine pathways to promote fibrosis [14]. iNKT cells activation has also been shown to play a key role in promoting Wnt signaling and promoting the transition of epithelial cells to myofibroblasts [15]. To further investigate whether the increase and activation of iNKT cells is associated with impaired lung differentiation in BPD, we used anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody interfering with iNKT cells activation status in BPD mice, the number of immune cells in BALF significantly reduced, H&E staining showed that as the activation status and abundance of iNKT cells decreased, the alveolar structure tended to be regular, the number of alveoli increased and alveoli cavity was more uniform, RAC increased and MLI decreased, PAS showed a decrease in glycogen, WB and tissue immunofluorescence showed that SP-C, T1α increased, and fluorescence localization showed that SP-C and T1α co-localization increased, these results suggested that the abnormal development in BPD mice was alleviated after using anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody. It has been shown that treatment with anti-human CD1d antibody in a primate inflammation model, significantly reduces the number of macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils in BALF. Previous studies have found that partial inhibition of iNKT cells activation by anti-CD1d antibody can reduce the release of cytokines in septic mice, thereby reducing the damage of organ function and ultimately reducing the mortality of septic mice [49]. Treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury model mice with anti-CD1d antibody alleviated lung dysfunction and inflammation [36], important features of COPD, such as inflammation and emphysema, were significantly suppressed in CD1d−/− lacking iNKT cells [21], CD1d deficiency has a protective effect on FA-induced renal fibrosis in mice [50,51]. The above studies suggest that blocking iNKT cell activation reduces alveolarization disorders in BPD and may be related to promoting lung differentiation. To further investigate whether iNKT cells activation exacerbates lung development disorder in BPD, in this study, we used nasal instillation of α-Galcer, a specific activator of iNKT cells [29], in addition to extract iNKT cells by magnetic beads and adoptive transfer into mice via the tail vein. We found that BPD mice treated with α-GalCer showed more disordered alveolar structure, larger alveolar fusion, reduced number, simplified structure, thickened alveolar wall, and increased inflammatory cells by H&E. PAS staining showed increased glycogen accumulation. We successfully sorted iNKT cells with a purity greater than 95 %, and after adoptive transfer into BPD mice, iNKT cells reached the lungs after 30 min of in vivo imaging observation. In a similar study to adoptive transfer, iNKT cells were found to first reach the lungs within 15 min [52]. Next, after successful adoptive transfer of iNKT cells, mice were exposed to hyperoxia for 4 days, and lung tissues were collected at P14. We found recruitment of iNKT cells in the lungs of the hyperoxia group, accompanied by an increase in glycogen by PAS staining, decreased expression of SP-C and T1α by WB and decreased co-localization of SP-C and T1α by immunofluorescence, these results showed that the lung disorder of BPD mice was aggravated after adoptive transfer iNKT cells. It has been suggested that repeated use of αGalCer to activate pulmonary iNKT cells can cause COPD-like symptoms [37], after adoptive transfer of iNKT cells in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, the lung injury score was increased by H&E [36]. The above studies suggest that iNKT cells activation and recruitment can aggravate lung injury, but whether it affects AEC II differentiation needs to be further studied. AEC II is the main stem cell in the lung, which can differentiate into AEC I [5]. In BPD, AEC II plays a central role in lung development arrest and injury repair. In our study, after 72 h of hyperoxia exposure, the expression of SP-C decreased, and T1α increased. The expression of T1α is different in vivo and in vitro under hyperoxia, which may be related to the following reasons: firstly, environment is not the same in vivo and in vitro, in vivo, cells are affected by many factors, including signal transduction between cells, immune response, etc., while in vitro culture, the cell environment is relatively simplified, may lead to different response patterns; secondly, the length of hyperoxia exposure is also different, 72 h of hyperoxia exposure is an acute lung injury, T1α compensatory increase. 14 days of hyperoxia exposure is a chronic lung injury, T1α decompensatory decrease, this is consistent with the results of Cao YX et al. [53] and Hou A et al. [54]; thirdly, Yee M et al., found that the increased T1α under hyperoxia is not differentiated from the labeled AEC II by special labeling of AEC II [55]. In future studies, tracing techniques for AEC II can be combined to better understand the functional changes of AEC II. To further clarify the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II, we verified it at the cellular level. We constructed AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system by transwell technology and under hyperoxia exposure. Immunofluorescence and WB results showed that SP-C decreased in the group of AEC II alone under hyperoxia, and the decrease of SP-C and T1α in the co-culture group of AEC II-iNKT cells was more significant under hyperoxia. Fluorescence localization showed that the co-localization of SP-C and T1α in AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured under hyperoxia was decreased, suggesting that iNKT cells aggravated abnormal AEC II under hyperoxia. Next, to explore the possible mechanisms underlying the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II, we performed RNA sequencing of AEC II in different groups, DEGs with PCD in the GO database related genes are compared, we found that among all PCD related differential genes, the number of DEGs related to ferroptosis was the highest. Ferroptosis is a form of PCD that is induced by lipid peroxidation and is iron-dependent [12,56,57], which plays an important role in the molecular and biological mechanism of BPD [58]. Previous studies have shown that hyperoxia induces ferroptosis and impairs lung development in neonatal mice, and features of ferroptosis are detected in mouse lung tissues and in vitro cell models under hyperoxia conditions [58]. Ferroptosis induces alveolar type II cell damage [59], induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar epithelial cells and promotes the process of fibrosis [60,61]. Recent studies also found that ferroptosis in AEC II causes pathological damage under hyperoxia and other stimuli. Additionally, ferroptosis is considered immune-regulated, and immune-derived cell death [62]. Gpx4 is the main core enzyme regulating the glutathione antioxidant system, and its reduction is an important marker for the occurrence of ferroptosis [56]. Our current study shows ferroptosis was changed both in AEC II cultured alone under hyperoxia and AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured under hyperoxia, but more pronounced in AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured group under hyperoxia, these changes included increased Fe2+, Lipid peroxidation, and MDA levels, as well as elevated expression of genes PTGS2, reduced expression of GPX4 and FTH1, and ferroptosis characteristics were more obvious in AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured group by transmission electron microscopy. However, whether iNKT cells recruitment and activation aggravates AEC II abnormal differentiation by ferroptosis need further study. To further demonstrate that iNKT cells aggravate AEC II damage by inducing ferroptosis under hyperoxia, ferroptosis activator Erastin and ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 were used. We found that T1α and SP-C were decreased when Erastin were added in iNKT + AEC II group, after add ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1, showed that T1α and SP-C were increased, these suggested that AEC II ferroptosis accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Previous studies have found that hyperoxia promotes AEC II ferroptosis, and increases the transdifferentiation of type II epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like cells [63]. Ferroptosis inhibitors liproxstatin - 1 (Lip) and deferoxamine (DFO) alleviated the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis [64]. These studies suggested that increased ferroptosis realates to differentation of AEC II. Our study mainly showed that iNKT cells aggravated the ferroptosis of AEC II under hyperoxia, but the specific mechanism still needs to be further studied. Previous studies have shown that IL-17A promotes airway epithelial ferroptosis in asthma [65], and it has been reported that IL-17A can cooperate with IL-6 to promote ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells under acute hyperoxia [66]. Previous study found that the pro-inflammatory effect of iNKT cells was mainly through the secretion of IL-17A and IL-6. Co-culture of AEC II and iNKT cells increased IL-17A levels than only AEC II cultured alone. Some studies reported the IL - 6 in the expression and significance of BPD environment [67]. After specifically activating iNKT cells, we found that inflammatory factor IL-6 and IL-17A were increased in vivo, IL-17A and IL-6 were also increased in the supernatant of AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured in vitro under hyperoxia. Therefore, we speculate that iNKT cells may also promote ferroptosis in AEC II by secreting IL-17A together with IL-6 present in the inflammatory environment. However, we have only initially explored the mechanism by which iNKT cells affect abnormal AEC II expression under hyperoxia. For this is just our speculation and some preliminary experimental verification, the follow-up still need further study. Nevertheless, there are still some limitations in this study. Our current study only found that iNKT cells affected the expression of AEC II and AEC I after hyperoxia, there is no direct evidence to support an association between the abundance and activation iNKT cells with impaired differentiation of AEC II into AEC I. Our study only used single gene to represent AEC II or AEC I to investigate the differentiation, we only use SP-C and T1α as the gene marker, if use multiple gene markers may be more rigorous. In future experiments, we will also employ lineage label to more clearly observe AEC II differentiation status in different pathological environments. Certainly, the most specific tool for iNKT cells in mice and humans are αGalCer/CD1d tetramers, it may be more specific if αGalCer/CD1d tetramers are employed. In addition, the main pathological manifestations of BPD are alveolarization disorder and abnormal pulmonary microvascular development, the interaction between NKT cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells under hyperoxia has not been explored. Studies have found that peripheral blood NKT cells are increased and activated, and inhibit the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), thereby inducing vascular injuries in diabetes [68]. S K et al. found that NKT cells induced by IL-4 leads to pulmonary artery wall thickening [69]. These studies suggested that abnormal activation of NKT cells may also affect microvascular endothelial cells, however, further studies are needed to determine whether NKT cells affects pulmonary microvascular development in BPD. Studies showed that iNKT cells accumulate mainly in microvasculature after moving from the thymus into circulation, and there is substantial evidence that iNKT cells migration into the lung tissue rapidly under various activation conditions, such as when the lung is stimulated by airborne antigens or infections [14]. Based on the above and our experimental results, can only presume hyperoxia lead to an increased recruitment or local expansion of activated iNKT cells in the lungs, which cannot be accurately determined as recruitment or tissue resident. In addition, CD69 in iNKT cells was detected to be elevated, and it is also one of the markers of early activation and tissue resident lymphocytes, however, an increase in CD69 alone does not represent tissue resident cells, may need to be confirmed by parabiosis experiments [70], so, we still need more in-depth research, and these will be further studied in the future. Our study found that hyperoxia leads to the recruitment and activation of iNKT cells in the lungs. Over-activated iNKT cells induces ferroptosis in AEC II, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. AEC II dysfunction leads to the obstruction of alveolarization and occurrence of BPD.Ethics approval and consent to participate The study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University (SWYXLL20200121-17).

    "abstract": "Abstract Mechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell (ECs) function, and have been implicated in vascular disease as well as physiologic changes associated with low gravity environments. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function.",

    "methods": "Methods Cell culture Human Umbilical Vascular Endothelial Cells (HUVECs; HUVECs Clonetics, Lonza) were cultured at 37°C/5% CO2 in EBM®-2 Endothelial Cell Basal Medium-2 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2% (v/v) Gentamicin Sulfate and Amphotericin-B, 0.2% (v/v) Heparin, 0.2% (v/v) Hydrocortison, 0.2% (v/v) rhVEGF, 0.2% (v/v) rhEGF, 0.2% (v/v) rIGF1 and 0.4% (v/v) rhFGF-β (Lonza, Walkersville, MD USA). Medium was changed the day after seeding and every other day thereafter. The HUVECs were used up to passage 12. Confluent HUVECs were trypsinized and seeded at 2 million cells per 25 cm2 cell culture treated flasks with no underlying substrate. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were cultured in EBM®-2 Endothelial Cell Basal Medium-2 supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 0.05% (v/v) gentamicin sulfate and amphotericin-B, 0.05% (v/v) Heparin, 0.05% (v/v) Hydrocortison, 0.05% (v/v) rhVEGF, 0.05% (v/v) rhEGF, 0.05% (v/v) rIGF1and 0.1% (v/v) rhFGF-β. HEPES buffer was added to the medium at a concentration of 1.2% (v/v) to compensate for the lack of CO2 and avoid pH changes. Each group contained five biologically independent samples. The control group was maintained at 37°C in the CO2 incubator for 24 hours or 48 hours. The mechanical unloaded (MU) group was placed in a Random Positioning Machine (RPM, see below) for 24 hours or 48 hours. The mechanical loaded (ML) group was placed in the RPM for 24 hours and was exposed to a 30 minutes load period of mechanical stress (hypergravity) with centrifugal forces of 12 G at the 4, 8 and 23.5-hour time points. For the control and MU groups cultured for 48 hours, the serum concentration was increased at 2% at the 24 hours time point, while growth factor additives were at ¼ normal concentration. At 24 hours or 48 hours, all groups were harvested and stored at -80°C for RNA isolation or fixed for immunofluorescent labeling. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) Hydrochloride (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI USA) was added to the medium at a concentration of 10 mM at the beginning of the 24 hours. Nitrite concentration was measured in the cell media collected at the end of the experiment using the Ultrasensitive Colorimetric NOS Assay Kit (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Random Positioning Machine (Mechanical Unloading) and Cellular g-loading apparatus (Mechanical Loading) In order to mechanically unload cells, a random positioning machine (RPM) was used to minimize the gravitational gradient mechanically sensed by ECs. A desktop RPM described by Huijser55 and manufactured by Fokker Space was used to provide mechanical unloading. The RPM is 30 × 30 × 30 cm that was placed into an incubator at 37°C. The RPM has inner and outer frames that are independently controlled by two different motors and is operated in random modes of speed and direction (0.1–2 rad/s) via a computer user interface with dedicated control. The cell culture flasks were mounted on the center of the platform located on the inner frame. Under this experimental condition, the cells were exposed to mechanical unloading conditions ranging from 0.02 and 0.05 g. For static 1-g controls, cell culture flasks seeded at the same time as the mechanically unloaded flasks were placed into the same incubator as the RPM samples. A cellular g-loading apparatus was used for mechanical hyperloading as already described56. Damon/IEC model UV centrifuge (Needham Heights, MA, USA) was modified to become the cellular g-load apparatus. A micro-stepping drive system (SmartStep Microstepping Drive; Industrial Devices Corp.) coupled to a spindle and using timing belt and pulleys with a 3.14:1 gear ratio replaced the original centrifuge drive. Vibrations caused by S-23 stepper motor operation were minimized using pads made from sheet rubber mounted on the motor to the aluminum plate. The centrifuge was fitted with a SmartStep-23 keypad and control unit (Industrial Devices Corp., Petaluma, CA, USA). Using Ideal Commands (version 1.1; Industrial Devices Corp.), the drive system was programmed to generate the effective centrifugal force (ECF) desired (ECF = 1+ teGs, where teGs = 1.118 × 10−5 × cm × rpm2 and rotor length is 19.28 cm). Animal Model: Hind limb Suspension The mouse model of hind limb suspension was used to simulate mechanical unloading in vivo57,58. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center San Francisco. Three months old FVB/NJ mice were used. Hindlimbs of 8 mice were lifted approximately 0.5–1 cm off of the floor and beared no weight. The tail was cleaned with alcohol and sprayed with tincture of benzoin to make it sticky. Skin-trac pre-attached to a plastic bar with a small hook was then applied to the tail length-wise. Filament tape was used to wrap the tail to prevent the Skin-trac from loosening. The hook on the tail of the animal was finaly attached to a fish swivel and a rolling bar system that permited the animal free movement around its cage and free access to food and water. The animals were hung no more than 30 degrees (as calculated by the angle of spine of animal to the floor with forelimbs extended) to minimize discomfort. Eight control animals were kept in identical cages to the experimental animals but without hind limbs suspension. After 14 days of hindlimb suspension procedure, the animals were sacrificed, their thoracic aorta dissected, placed in RNA later and stored at –80°C. Quantitative Real-time-Polymerase Chain Reaction Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Scrapped cells or minced thoracic aortas were resuspended in buffer RLT and homogenized using QIA shredder homogenizer (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA). Oligo d(T) primed cDNA was synthesized from 300 ng of total RNA using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using 2× SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA) in a Bio-Rad MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA USA). Gene expression level were quantified using the primers listed in Table 1 and were normalized to cyclophilin (CPHI) internal standard. Five independent biological samples were used. Table 1.

Immediately after the experiments, the cells were fixed with 3.7% Formaldehyde for 30 minutes, then blocked and permeabilized in PBS with 1%BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human-E-selectin (20 ug/mL, Abcam, Cambridge, MA USA) or Rabbit polyclonal anti-human-VCAM-1 (dilution 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA USA) or Rabbit polyclonal anti-human-Caveolin-1 (dilution 1:250, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) were used in combination with Hoecht dye (2 μg/ml) and Rhodamine Phalloidin (2 U/ml) (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR USA). After 3 washes in PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fuor 488 Anti Rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:1000, Invitrogen Eugene, OR USA) during 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were mounted using Permount histological mounting medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and imaged using a Zeiss Axioscope Fluorescent Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) camera and a (Hamamatsu Corporation, Bridge-water, NJ USA) fluorescent microscope. Flow Cytometry Upon completion of the experiments, cells were washed 2 times with PBS. Cells were detached from the 25 cm2 flasks using 5 mM EDTA in PBS containing Ca2+/Mg2+, resuspended in ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS and filtered with a 40 uM cell strainer. Cells were blocked in PBS with 2% FBS containing 10% antibody host serum and 1% lgG/Fc Block (Sigma, St. Louis, MO USA). Cells were washed with PBS 2 times and then incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-human FITC-Conjugated ICAM-1/CD54 (dilution 1:100), Monoclonal mouse Anti-human Phycoerythrin-Conjugated VCAM-1/CD106 (dilution 1:100, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN USA) and monoclonal mouse anti-human PE-Cy5-Conjugated E-Selectin/CD62E (dilution 1:100, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA USA). Cells were washed, resuspended in 200 uL of PBS with 2% FBS and analyzed using a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star).",
    "results": "Results Effects of mechanical unloading on adhesion molecules and inflammation To assess if exposure of endothelial cells to simulated MU has a significant impact on expression of adhesion molecules or inflammatory and angiogenic factors, we used quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry to measure the levels of gene expression and presence at the cell surface respectively. We found that 24 hours of MU leads to a significant decrease in the expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin as well as inflammatory mediators IL-6 and TNF-α (Figure 1a). This response remained similar after 48 hours of exposure to MU (Figure 1a). Reflecting changes in gene expression, the presence on the cell surface of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin were also significantly decreased by MU at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 1b). Figure 1. Gene and Surface Expression of Adhesion Molecules with Mechanical Unloading.

Bars represent mean ± SD. (n = 5, * p ≤ 0.05; with two-tailed Student's t test against control samples). Effects of gravitational mechanical unloading on eNOS and caveolins In order to investigate a possible pathway involved in the regulation of gene expression of inflammatory and adhesion molecules in ECs, we studied endothelial NOS (eNOS), caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 expression levels. There was an increase in eNOS, Caveolin-1, Caveolin-2 gene expression after 24 h of MU (Figure 2a). This was also coupled with a significant increase in nitrite concentration in the media (Figure 2b). Figure 2.

Open in a new tab (a) Quantitative analysis by qRT-PCR of gene expression of cultured Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) placed in Random Positioning Machine (RPM) simulating Mechanical Unloading (MU) vs. ground controls (1 G) after 24 hours.

(n = 5, * p ≤ 0.05; with two-tailed Student's t test against control samples). Inhibition of NOS activity does not reverse the effects of mechanical unloading To assess if an increase of NOS activity could underlie the changes in expression levels of adhesion molecules and inflammatory factors triggered by MU, we treated the HUVECs with the selective inhibitor of NO synthesis L-NAME. Interestingly, the inhibition of NOS activity did not reverse the changes associated with MU (Figure 3), suggesting that NO production is not responsible for the decrease of adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory gene expression in this model. Compare to MU alone, the addition of L-NAME to MU led to a decrease in eNOS and Cav-1 (although not a complete return to the levels seen with control) and an increase in Cav-2. Figure 3.

Strikingly, three short periods of ML during 24 hours of MU were sufficient to completely reverse the changes seen in adhesion molecules, inflammatory mediators, eNOS and caveolins (Figure 4).

(a) Expressions of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin), cytokines (IL-6 and TNFα) decrease significantly when exposed to MU but were not significantly decreased by the MU + ML conditions.

Cytoskeletal changes associated with MU MU significantly affected the morphology of HUVECs. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU (Figure 5a). There appeared to be disorganization of the F-actin network with clustering of the fibers around the nucleus. Addition of L-NAME did not return the shape of the cells to baseline. However, paralleling changes in gene expression, addition of ML in the MU environment tended to reverse the shape of the cells towards 1 G conditions. Figure 5.

(a) Both cell dimensions width and length significantly decrease under Mechanical Unloading (MU) conditions with and without L-Name (L-N), more so when cells are both mechanically unloaded and treated with L-N.

Scale bars: 50 μm.Using immunofluorescent labeling, we found that caveolin-1 are less associated to the plasma membrane and adopt a perinuclear localization under MU compared to the 1 G conditions (Figure 5b). Interestingly, the translocation of Cav-1 from caveolae to the Golgi apparatus has been shown to be responsible for an increase of eNOS activity in vascular ECs33,34. The exact localization of Cav-1 under MU and a direct link with the increase of eNOS activity need to be established. However, the disruption of the actin cytoskeletal organization by MU could impair the translocation of Cav-1 to the caveolae, and together with the increase of eNOS expression, could contribute to the increase of NOS activity. Addition of L-NAME during the MU exposure had no effect on Caveolin-1 distribution, which remains perinuclear, however ML seemed to change towards 1 G conditions. The results of the immunofluorescent labeling of VCAM-1 (Figure 5c) and E-selectin (Figure 5d) are consistent with the analysis by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry (Figure 1) and show a decrease of their presence at the cell surface under MU condition. Interestingly, the process tended to go back to 1 G conditions with the addition of ML. Hindlimb suspension: Effects on caveolins Consistent with our in vitro cellular model, simulation of MU by hindlimb suspension led to a significant increase in eNOS and Caveolin-1 and -2 expression in mouse aortas (Figure 6). IL-6 also significantly decreased. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in E-Selectin expression. However, expression of other inflammatory or adhesion molecules did not decrease significantly with hindlimb suspension and ICAM-1 expression was significantly increased. Figure 6.

    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we demonstrated that MU changes the morphology of cells and leads to a decrease in inflammatory gene expression (i.e. IL-6, TNF-α), adhesion molecule gene expression and cell-surface expression (i.e. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-Selectin) as well as an increase in eNOS, nitrite concentration and an increase in Caveolin-1 and Caveolin-2 expression. We also demonstrated reversal of the morphology and gene expression towards baseline with three short periods of mechanical loading. Since alterations in gene expression were accompanied by changes in the cytoskeleton and both cell morphology and gene expression returned to baseline with the addition of hypergravity, our findings suggest that ECs gene expression and cytoarchitecture are tightly linked to gravitational mechanical forces, with a possible role for the caveolins35,36. The present study demonstrates that microgravity alters the cytoskeleton of ECs. It appears that the actin filaments become disorganized and redistributed within the cells, with as a possible consequence an inability to transport molecules to the outside of the cells, such as the caveolins to the caveolae at the plasma membrane. Cells are known to stabilize their structure and shape by means of interconnected network of cytoskeletal components including microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. In vitro, when subjected to shear stress in a flow-loading device, net cellular movement happens orienting them in the direction of the shear stress9, a phenomenon accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization with actin filaments rearranged into bundles of stress fibers and aligned in the direction of the shear stress10,11,12. In microgravity, cytoarchitectural alterations of different endothelial cell lines have been reported to occur. Buravkova et al demonstrated changes in the cytoskeleton of HUVECs within 1–2 hours of simulated microgravity with actin filament thinning and their redistribution to cell borders (with the central area becoming practically free of actin fibers while there was formation of continuous F-actin band at the intercellular contact area)37. Siamwala demonstrated that 2 hours of simulated microgravity in EAhy926 ECs lead to actin rearrangements and increase in nitric oxide production38. Versari et al also showed that HUVECs in microgravity for 96 hours had disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and a decrease in the total amount of actin30. Infanger et al.39 showed that EA.hy926 cells in microgravity had altered cytoskeletal components and the formation of cell aggregates in the monolayer after 12 hours. Carlsson et al also demonstrated disorganization of the actin fibers with clustering of the fibers around the nucleus up to 96 hr in simulated microgravity, then disappearing after 144 hours40. Grimm et al41 showed that EA.hy926 cells in microgravity formed tubular structures that actually had an increased amount of actin that covered the entire surface of the tubular structure. It appears that expression and localization of key integrins that mediate EC attachment and spreading, such as the vitronectin and fibronectin receptors, could likely be involved in the changes seen in the cytoskeleton. For example, integrins have been shown to be decreased during parabolic flight in HUVECs42. The expression of fibronectin has been found to be increased with simulated microgravity in EA.hy.92643. Tube-shaped structures of EA.hy.926 forming after 2 weeks of simulated microgravity produced more fibronectin. Although not demonstrated in endothelial cells to our knowledge, Rho GAP expression has been found to be increased two fold with spaceflight in rat osteoblasts, suggesting that microgravity suppress Rho signals regulating actin filament rearrangement44. Since the cytoskeleton plays an important role in shear-stress-induced NO production and ICAM-1 gene expression by ECs with shear stress15,16, it could then be expected that MU also alters expression of eNOS, inflammatory and adhesion molecules. We demonstrated in this study a decrease in IL-6 and TNF-α expression with MU, which was reversed by hypergravity. This was coupled with a decrease in adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin, also reversed with hypergravity. Investigators have reported different effects of mechanical unloading or microgravity in the literature. For example, IL-6 was found to be increased45, decreased31, and unchanged46 in separate studies, which may be related to different conditions. IL-8 was also found to be increased45 and unchanged46 in separate studies. Buravkova et al found that 12-24 hours of simulated microgravity increased ICAM-1 in HUVECs but not VCAM-1 or E-Selectin- in fact microgravity had opposite effects on ICAM-1 compared to VCAM-1 and E-Selectin47. In this study, we found that mechanical unloading led to an increase in Caveolin-1 and -2 gene expression. This correlated with an increase in eNOS expression and nitrite concentration. Our results are overall consistent with the forming body of knowledge on the effects of simulated microgravity on endothelial cells. For example, Spisni et al.48 found that caveolin-1 protein expression was increased with 24 hours of microgravity. With regards to NO production, two studies showed an increase in eNOS protein levels and increased NO production at 48 hours and 72 hours respectively30,31. However, Spisni et al.49 found no change in eNOS or iNOS protein levels yet an increase in NO production at 24 hours. Ulbrich et al.45 actually found decreased eNOS gene expression at 24 hours. Finally, Wang et al.50 found increased iNOS protein levels at 24 hours. Recently, Shi et al reported that HUVECs exposed to 24 hours of simulated microgravity using a 2-D clinostat had an enhanced eNOS activity and promoted angiogenesis51. It is likely that the changes seen in inflammation, adhesion molecules expression, eNOS and caveolins are mediated through a change in the cytoskeleton since the cytoskeleton is altered by MU and returns toward baseline with ML, along with gene expression. This study has important implications for spaceflight. It is well known that astronauts suffer from orthostatic intolerance (OI) upon returning to a gravity environment after spaceflight. It has been suggested that the nitric oxide system may be involved4. Our findings support a role of increased NO production in the pathophysiology of post-spaceflight OI but more importantly, suggest that this variable may be improved by the addition of artificial gravity since 3 periods of 30 minutes of hypergravity in this study reversed the changes seen in microgravity. In addition to the implications of our findings to OI, it is interesting to note that the changes seen would be considered “anti-inflammatory” and possibly protective for early atherogenesis (Figure 7). This opens the way to explore new therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases by manipulation of cell phenotype using gravitational forces. Although the significance of the findings with regards to an overall “dysregulation” of the cells compared to a true change towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype need to be further assessed, our findings would suggest that microgravity may have a beneficial impact on the health of blood vessels. It has been of important interest to know that astronauts are more at risk of immune dysfunction52,53,54. The changes in the vascular ECs could therefore be involved in the overall changes in the immune system seen with spaceflight. Our findings support the fact that the cells respond to altered gravitational environments, which could have an important impact on organ physiology. Figure 7. Proposed Model for the Effects of Microgravity on Endothelial Cells. Open in a new tab Proposed model by which microgravity leads to changes in inflammation, adhesion molecules, caveolins and eNOS. Those changes are thought to be mediated through a change in the cytoskeleton. In summary, gravitational mechanical unloading affects inflammatory and adhesion molecules expression in ECs towards an “anti-inflammatory” phenotype. This is coupled with an increase in eNOS and caveolin gene expression. In view of the changes seen in the cytoskeleton and the reversal of both gene expression and morphology with exposure to ML, it is highly likely that this “anti-inflammatory” phenotype is mediated through changes in the cytoskeleton. Our findings further support a role for caveolae as gravity-sensing elements and demonstrate plasticity of changes with gravitational mechanical forces.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function. Alterations in endothelial function has been involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases on Earth through angiogenesis, vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis1,2,3. Changes in endothelial hemostasis have also been associated with post-spaceflight orthostatic intolerance4. Hence understanding functioning of the vascular endothelium becomes critical for different diseases pathogenesis. The healthy endothelium maintains a critical relationship with the outside environment through the blood and hemodynamic forces. This relationship is governed by a well-studied frictional force: shear stress5,6. Regulation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) responses to shear stress involve a complex cascades of gene responses with different temporal profiles and shear stress impacts ECs morphology, function and gene expression, the latter taking place transcriptionally and/or post-trancriptionally7. In fact, DNA microarray analysis has demonstrated that 3% of all genes responded to shear stress8. If ECs express 20,000 genes, then approximately 600 would be responsive to shear stress. The cytoskeleton is at the center of the ECs responses to shear stress. The cells respond to rapid laminar flow by becoming spindle-shaped and aligned with their long axis parallel to the direction of blood flow9. This is accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization with actin filaments rearranged into bundles of stress fibers and aligned in the direction of the shear stress10,11,12. When flow is turbulent or stagnant, the cells become rounder in shape and do not have a uniform orientation13,14. Hence, the cytoskeleton is critical in sensing mechanical forces, with a change in their morphology leading to changes in inflammation and atherogenesis15,16. Although shear stress has been studied extensively, mechanotransduction, that is the mechanisms by which cells convert mechanical stimulus into chemical activity are not fully understood. It is thought that “sensing” of mechanical forces and shear stress signal transduction through the cytoskeleton take place, at least partially through caveolae17,18,19. The caveolae are membrane microdomains measuring approximately 50–10 nm in length that are visible as flask-shaped invaginations below the surface of cells, containing many signaling molecules20. In response to increased flow, calcium gradients develop close to caveolae and propagate through the entire cell in the form of a calcium wave21. The calcium increase close to caveolae causes the caveolae to rapidly liberate the nitric oxide (NO) synthase eNOS into the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the production of NO. Caveolins have also been reported to be involved in the early phases of atherosclerosis22 with absence of caveolin-1 in mice characterized by impaired blood-flow-dependent vascular remodeling and vasodilator responses23. In-vitro techniques used to study mechanotransduction have included fluid flow (sheer stress), four-point bending, substrate stretch, as well as gravity force, vibration, magnetic fields, atomic forces and shockwaves24. The effects of gravitational forces on mechanotransduction in ECs responses have been the matter of only a few investigations and remain largely unknown. It is well known that astronauts experience cardiovascular deconditioning during spaceflight manifested among others as orthostatic intolerance, and some investigators have suggested that the nitric oxide system is involved in these changes4. At the physiological level, we demonstrated changes in the cardiovascular system with simulated microgravity characterized by alterations in sympathetic function, the renin-angiotensin system and electrolyte excretion25,26,27. Overall, understanding the effects of gravitational mechanical forces is important as mechanical unloading (MU) of cells has been shown to alter cell cytoskeleton28, affect caveolae29 and eNOS30,31. If shear stress can affect the cytoskeleton, cell function and expression, can gravitational mechanical forces do the same? Since caveolins are gravity-sensing elements and eNOS is tightly related to inflammation and cell-cell interaction including adhesion32, could microgravity have the potential to alter processes such as inflammation and cell-to-cell interaction? In this report, we investigate the effects of gravitational MU on primary ECs. The goals are to assess whether cell morphology is involved in functions such as eNOS regulation, inflammation and adhesion. To assess this, primary vascular endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells- HUVECs) were placed under MU and mechanical loading (ML) conditions after which gene expression profiles and the cytoskeleton were studied. We hypothesized that MU would lead to changes in the morphology of the cells and their gene expression, which could be reversed by ML. Results Effects of mechanical unloading on adhesion molecules and inflammation To assess if exposure of endothelial cells to simulated MU has a significant impact on expression of adhesion molecules or inflammatory and angiogenic factors, we used quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry to measure the levels of gene expression and presence at the cell surface respectively. We found that 24 hours of MU leads to a significant decrease in the expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin as well as inflammatory mediators IL-6 and TNF-α (Figure 1a). This response remained similar after 48 hours of exposure to MU (Figure 1a). Reflecting changes in gene expression, the presence on the cell surface of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin were also significantly decreased by MU at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 1b). Figure 1.

There was an increase in eNOS, Caveolin-1, Caveolin-2 gene expression after 24 h of MU (Figure 2a). This was also coupled with a significant increase in nitrite concentration in the media (Figure 2b). Figure 2.

Interestingly, the inhibition of NOS activity did not reverse the changes associated with MU (Figure 3), suggesting that NO production is not responsible for the decrease of adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory gene expression in this model. Compare to MU alone, the addition of L-NAME to MU led to a decrease in eNOS and Cav-1 (although not a complete return to the levels seen with control) and an increase in Cav-2. Figure 3.

Grimm et al41 showed that EA.hy926 cells in microgravity formed tubular structures that actually had an increased amount of actin that covered the entire surface of the tubular structure. It appears that expression and localization of key integrins that mediate EC attachment and spreading, such as the vitronectin and fibronectin receptors, could likely be involved in the changes seen in the cytoskeleton. For example, integrins have been shown to be decreased during parabolic flight in HUVECs42. The expression of fibronectin has been found to be increased with simulated microgravity in EA.hy.92643. Tube-shaped structures of EA.hy.926 forming after 2 weeks of simulated microgravity produced more fibronectin. Although not demonstrated in endothelial cells to our knowledge, Rho GAP expression has been found to be increased two fold with spaceflight in rat osteoblasts, suggesting that microgravity suppress Rho signals regulating actin filament rearrangement44. Since the cytoskeleton plays an important role in shear-stress-induced NO production and ICAM-1 gene expression by ECs with shear stress15,16, it could then be expected that MU also alters expression of eNOS, inflammatory and adhesion molecules. We demonstrated in this study a decrease in IL-6 and TNF-α expression with MU, which was reversed by hypergravity. This was coupled with a decrease in adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin, also reversed with hypergravity. Investigators have reported different effects of mechanical unloading or microgravity in the literature. For example, IL-6 was found to be increased45, decreased31, and unchanged46 in separate studies, which may be related to different conditions. IL-8 was also found to be increased45 and unchanged46 in separate studies. Buravkova et al found that 12-24 hours of simulated microgravity increased ICAM-1 in HUVECs but not VCAM-1 or E-Selectin- in fact microgravity had opposite effects on ICAM-1 compared to VCAM-1 and E-Selectin47. In this study, we found that mechanical unloading led to an increase in Caveolin-1 and -2 gene expression. This correlated with an increase in eNOS expression and nitrite concentration. Our results are overall consistent with the forming body of knowledge on the effects of simulated microgravity on endothelial cells. For example, Spisni et al.48 found that caveolin-1 protein expression was increased with 24 hours of microgravity. With regards to NO production, two studies showed an increase in eNOS protein levels and increased NO production at 48 hours and 72 hours respectively30,31. However, Spisni et al.49 found no change in eNOS or iNOS protein levels yet an increase in NO production at 24 hours. Ulbrich et al.45 actually found decreased eNOS gene expression at 24 hours. Finally, Wang et al.50 found increased iNOS protein levels at 24 hours. Recently, Shi et al reported that HUVECs exposed to 24 hours of simulated microgravity using a 2-D clinostat had an enhanced eNOS activity and promoted angiogenesis51. It is likely that the changes seen in inflammation, adhesion molecules expression, eNOS and caveolins are mediated through a change in the cytoskeleton since the cytoskeleton is altered by MU and returns toward baseline with ML, along with gene expression. This study has important implications for spaceflight. It is well known that astronauts suffer from orthostatic intolerance (OI) upon returning to a gravity environment after spaceflight. It has been suggested that the nitric oxide system may be involved4. Our findings support a role of increased NO production in the pathophysiology of post-spaceflight OI but more importantly, suggest that this variable may be improved by the addition of artificial gravity since 3 periods of 30 minutes of hypergravity in this study reversed the changes seen in microgravity. In addition to the implications of our findings to OI, it is interesting to note that the changes seen would be considered “anti-inflammatory” and possibly protective for early atherogenesis (Figure 7). This opens the way to explore new therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases by manipulation of cell phenotype using gravitational forces. Although the significance of the findings with regards to an overall “dysregulation” of the cells compared to a true change towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype need to be further assessed, our findings would suggest that microgravity may have a beneficial impact on the health of blood vessels. It has been of important interest to know that astronauts are more at risk of immune dysfunction52,53,54. The changes in the vascular ECs could therefore be involved in the overall changes in the immune system seen with spaceflight. Our findings support the fact that the cells respond to altered gravitational environments, which could have an important impact on organ physiology. Figure 7. Proposed Model for the Effects of Microgravity on Endothelial Cells. Open in a new tab Proposed model by which microgravity leads to changes in inflammation, adhesion molecules, caveolins and eNOS. Those changes are thought to be mediated through a change in the cytoskeleton.In summary, gravitational mechanical unloading affects inflammatory and adhesion molecules expression in ECs towards an “anti-inflammatory” phenotype. This is coupled with an increase in eNOS and caveolin gene expression. In view of the changes seen in the cytoskeleton and the reversal of both gene expression and morphology with exposure to ML, it is highly likely that this “anti-inflammatory” phenotype is mediated through changes in the cytoskeleton. Our findings further support a role for caveolae as gravity-sensing elements and demonstrate plasticity of changes with gravitational mechanical forces.Methods Cell culture Human Umbilical Vascular Endothelial Cells (HUVECs; HUVECs Clonetics, Lonza) were cultured at 37°C/5% CO2 in EBM®-2 Endothelial Cell Basal Medium-2 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2% (v/v) Gentamicin Sulfate and Amphotericin-B, 0.2% (v/v) Heparin, 0.2% (v/v) Hydrocortison, 0.2% (v/v) rhVEGF, 0.2% (v/v) rhEGF, 0.2% (v/v) rIGF1 and 0.4% (v/v) rhFGF-β (Lonza, Walkersville, MD USA). Medium was changed the day after seeding and every other day thereafter. The HUVECs were used up to passage 12. Confluent HUVECs were trypsinized and seeded at 2 million cells per 25 cm2 cell culture treated flasks with no underlying substrate. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were cultured in EBM®-2 Endothelial Cell Basal Medium-2 supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 0.05% (v/v) gentamicin sulfate and amphotericin-B, 0.05% (v/v) Heparin, 0.05% (v/v) Hydrocortison, 0.05% (v/v) rhVEGF, 0.05% (v/v) rhEGF, 0.05% (v/v) rIGF1and 0.1% (v/v) rhFGF-β. HEPES buffer was added to the medium at a concentration of 1.2% (v/v) to compensate for the lack of CO2 and avoid pH changes. Each group contained five biologically independent samples. The control group was maintained at 37°C in the CO2 incubator for 24 hours or 48 hours. The mechanical unloaded (MU) group was placed in a Random Positioning Machine (RPM, see below) for 24 hours or 48 hours. The mechanical loaded (ML) group was placed in the RPM for 24 hours and was exposed to a 30 minutes load period of mechanical stress (hypergravity) with centrifugal forces of 12 G at the 4, 8 and 23.5-hour time points. For the control and MU groups cultured for 48 hours, the serum concentration was increased at 2% at the 24 hours time point, while growth factor additives were at ¼ normal concentration. At 24 hours or 48 hours, all groups were harvested and stored at -80°C for RNA isolation or fixed for immunofluorescent labeling. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) Hydrochloride (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI USA) was added to the medium at a concentration of 10 mM at the beginning of the 24 hours. Nitrite concentration was measured in the cell media collected at the end of the experiment using the Ultrasensitive Colorimetric NOS Assay Kit (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Random Positioning Machine (Mechanical Unloading) and Cellular g-loading apparatus (Mechanical Loading) In order to mechanically unload cells, a random positioning machine (RPM) was used to minimize the gravitational gradient mechanically sensed by ECs. A desktop RPM described by Huijser55 and manufactured by Fokker Space was used to provide mechanical unloading. The RPM is 30 × 30 × 30 cm that was placed into an incubator at 37°C. The RPM has inner and outer frames that are independently controlled by two different motors and is operated in random modes of speed and direction (0.1–2 rad/s) via a computer user interface with dedicated control. The cell culture flasks were mounted on the center of the platform located on the inner frame. Under this experimental condition, the cells were exposed to mechanical unloading conditions ranging from 0.02 and 0.05 g. For static 1-g controls, cell culture flasks seeded at the same time as the mechanically unloaded flasks were placed into the same incubator as the RPM samples. A cellular g-loading apparatus was used for mechanical hyperloading as already described56. Damon/IEC model UV centrifuge (Needham Heights, MA, USA) was modified to become the cellular g-load apparatus. A micro-stepping drive system (SmartStep Microstepping Drive; Industrial Devices Corp.) coupled to a spindle and using timing belt and pulleys with a 3.14:1 gear ratio replaced the original centrifuge drive. Vibrations caused by S-23 stepper motor operation were minimized using pads made from sheet rubber mounted on the motor to the aluminum plate. The centrifuge was fitted with a SmartStep-23 keypad and control unit (Industrial Devices Corp., Petaluma, CA, USA). Using Ideal Commands (version 1.1; Industrial Devices Corp.), the drive system was programmed to generate the effective centrifugal force (ECF) desired (ECF = 1+ teGs, where teGs = 1.118 × 10−5 × cm × rpm2 and rotor length is 19.28 cm).Animal Model: Hind limb Suspension The mouse model of hind limb suspension was used to simulate mechanical unloading in vivo57,58. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center San Francisco. Three months old FVB/NJ mice were used. Hindlimbs of 8 mice were lifted approximately 0.5–1 cm off of the floor and beared no weight. The tail was cleaned with alcohol and sprayed with tincture of benzoin to make it sticky. Skin-trac pre-attached to a plastic bar with a small hook was then applied to the tail length-wise. Filament tape was used to wrap the tail to prevent the Skin-trac from loosening. The hook on the tail of the animal was finaly attached to a fish swivel and a rolling bar system that permited the animal free movement around its cage and free access to food and water. The animals were hung no more than 30 degrees (as calculated by the angle of spine of animal to the floor with forelimbs extended) to minimize discomfort. Eight control animals were kept in identical cages to the experimental animals but without hind limbs suspension. After 14 days of hindlimb suspension procedure, the animals were sacrificed, their thoracic aorta dissected, placed in RNA later and stored at –80°C.Quantitative Real-time-Polymerase Chain Reaction Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Scrapped cells or minced thoracic aortas were resuspended in buffer RLT and homogenized using QIA shredder homogenizer (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA). Oligo d(T) primed cDNA was synthesized from 300 ng of total RNA using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using 2× SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA) in a Bio-Rad MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA USA). Gene expression level were quantified using the primers listed in Table 1 and were normalized to cyclophilin (CPHI) internal standard. Five independent biological samples were used. Table 1.

Immediately after the experiments, the cells were fixed with 3.7% Formaldehyde for 30 minutes, then blocked and permeabilized in PBS with 1%BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human-E-selectin (20 ug/mL, Abcam, Cambridge, MA USA) or Rabbit polyclonal anti-human-VCAM-1 (dilution 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA USA) or Rabbit polyclonal anti-human-Caveolin-1 (dilution 1:250, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) were used in combination with Hoecht dye (2 μg/ml) and Rhodamine Phalloidin (2 U/ml) (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR USA). After 3 washes in PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fuor 488 Anti Rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:1000, Invitrogen Eugene, OR USA) during 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were mounted using Permount histological mounting medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and imaged using a Zeiss Axioscope Fluorescent Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) camera and a (Hamamatsu Corporation, Bridge-water, NJ USA) fluorescent microscope.Flow Cytometry Upon completion of the experiments, cells were washed 2 times with PBS. Cells were detached from the 25 cm2 flasks using 5 mM EDTA in PBS containing Ca2+/Mg2+, resuspended in ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS and filtered with a 40 uM cell strainer. Cells were blocked in PBS with 2% FBS containing 10% antibody host serum and 1% lgG/Fc Block (Sigma, St. Louis, MO USA). Cells were washed with PBS 2 times and then incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-human FITC-Conjugated ICAM-1/CD54 (dilution 1:100), Monoclonal mouse Anti-human Phycoerythrin-Conjugated VCAM-1/CD106 (dilution 1:100, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN USA) and monoclonal mouse anti-human PE-Cy5-Conjugated E-Selectin/CD62E (dilution 1:100, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA USA). Cells were washed, resuspended in 200 uL of PBS with 2% FBS and analyzed using a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star).Author Contributions S.M.G., M.J., M.S.C. and M.H.F. designed the experimental protocols and interpreted the results.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been associated with reduced mortality and inflammation in patients with cardiovascular disease. There are limited data on the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).Materials and methods: The OMEGA-PAD II trial was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of 3 mo of high-dose oral n-3 PUFA supplementation on inflammation, endothelial function, and walking ability in patients with PAD.Results: Twenty-four patients with claudication received 4.4 g/d of fish oil or placebo for 3 mo. Outcomes measured included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, the omega-3 index, endothelial function as measured via flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, and a 6-min walk test. Plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) were measured by liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In patients treated with fish oil, the absolute mean omega-3 index significantly increased from baseline (fish oil: 7.2 ± 1.2%, P < 0.001; placebo: −0.4 ± 0.9%, P = 0.31; between-group P < 0.001). Furthermore, there were significant increases in several pathway markers of SPM biosynthesis, including several mono-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids and mono-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids. We also observed significant increases in the SPM lipoxin A5 (fish oil: 0.57 ± 0.70 pg/mL, P = 0.05; placebo: 0.01 ± 0.38 pg/mL, P = 0.93; between-group P = 0.04) and resolvin E3 (fish oil: 154 ± 171 pg/mL, P = 0.04; placebo: 32 ± 54 pg/mL, P = 0.08; between-group P = 0.04). There were no significant changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, or 6-min walk test in the fish oil group.Conclusions: Fish oil increases SPMs in plasma of patients with PAD. Further studies are required to determine whether these early changes translate to clinical improvements in patients with PAD.Keywords: Peripheral artery disease, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, Fish oils, Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, Other pharmacotherapy",
    "introduction": "Introduction The effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on systemic inflammation1,2 and cardiovascular disease (CVD)3 have been described in many populations. In addition, studies have shown that n-3 PUFA supplementation is associated with improvements in endothelial function,4,5 reduction in platelet aggregation,6 and improved atherosclerotic plaque stability.7 Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the main PUFAs in fish oil and are substrates for enzymes that give rise to specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs), specifically D-series resolvins, E-series resolvins, maresins, and protectins.8 These SPMs have receptor-mediated actions on human leukocytes, platelets, and vascular cells and have been shown to actively promote resolution of vascular inflammation and decrease atherosclerosis and vascular injury in animal models.8–10 Analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data suggests that populations consuming a diet high in n-3 PUFAs may have a decreased prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD).11 As such, investigators have examined the relationship between n-3 PUFAs and PAD,12 but heterogeneity in dosage and intervention length has likely contributed to inconsistent results. To more rigorously investigate oral n-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with PAD, the OMEGA-PAD I trial was designed.13 This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that 1 mo of high-dose n-3 PUFA (4.4 g/d) supplementation can change the metabololipidomic profile in patients with PAD toward increased production of mediators of resolution.14 Based on these results, we designed the OMEGA-PAD II trial with the hypothesis that high-dose n-3 PUFA supplementation over 3 mo would lead to changes in systemic inflammation, endothelial function, SPM profile, and claudication symptoms.",
    "methods": "Methods Trial design and participants The OMEGA-PAD II trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The study protocol was based on the previously published OMEGA-PAD I trial13,14 and took place at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC) between 2014 and 2016. Patients aged ≥50 y presenting to the outpatient vascular surgery clinic at the SFVAMC with intermittent claudication (Rutherford I-III) and PAD were recruited to the study. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of <0.9, toe pressure <70 mm Hg, or ≥50% stenosis in segments of the aortoiliac, femoral, or tibial arteries on imaging. Patients were excluded from participating if they were taking immunosuppressive medications or steroids, had a severe acute illness (e.g., infection, surgery, critical limb ischemia) within the last 30 d, or had severe hepatic (Child-Pugh ≥ B), renal (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL), or nonvascular inflammatory disease. Participants enrolled in the trial were randomized to one of two groups: fish oil or placebo. Patients were randomized by a block randomization with four subjects per block with a ratio of 1:1 for each block. The randomization was done by research pharmacists who maintained the key until the end of the study. N-3 PUFA supplementation was achieved with four capsules of ProOmega (Ultimate Omega) taken twice daily (Nordic Naturals, Watsonville, CA), corresponding to a total of 4.4 g/d. Each ProOmega (Ultimate Omega) capsule contains 325 mg of EPA and 225 mg of DHA. The dose of 4 g/d corresponds to the American Heart Association’s recommendations for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.15 The placebo group took the same number of capsules containing soybean (Nordic Naturals) that was designed to appear the same as the treatment capsules. Study subjects attended a baseline visit and underwent a comprehensive vascular physiology assessment and then started on the study drug or placebo for 3 mo. After 3 mo of intervention, they returned for a second visit where the assessment was repeated (Supplemental Fig. 1). Compliance with daily supplementation was addressed using a pill count that was performed at the follow-up visit. Dietary information was not collected throughout the trial; however, participants in both groups were encouraged to engage in healthy dietary habits according to national society guidelines. The primary end point was a change in plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Several secondary end points were measured to evaluate a wide range of potential effects that n-3 PUFA supplementation may have. These included changes in other biomarkers of inflammation, SPM profile, omega-3 index, brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), and measures of walking ability. SPMs measured included bioactive products and their biosynthetic pathway markers generated from EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid (AA) (see below). Institutional review board approval was granted for this study by the Committee on Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco as well as the SFVAMC Research and Development Office, with all participants giving informed written consent. The study was registered with Clinical-Trials.gov (NCT01979874). Measurements Demographics, anthropometries, medical history, and hemodynamic measurements Basic demographic information was provided by the participant through an intake questionnaire. Information on past medical history and medication use was obtained through the SFVAMC electronic medical record, and common atherosclerotic risk factors such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking history were recorded. ABIs were measured bilaterally using current guidelines and standards.16Renal, lipid, metabolic, and inflammation measurements Blood samples were collected in a fasting state and assayed the same day per standard methodology (Beckman Coulter Analyzer, Miami, FL) for measurement of creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albumin, hemoglobin A1C, and lipids. Plasma was isolated from venous blood and assayed for hsCRP the same day as collection per standard methodology (Beckman Coulter Analyzer). Serum was stored at −80° C until assayed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits per standard protocol (R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN). The typical coefficients of variation for IL-6 and ICAM-1 are 7.4% and 4.6%, respectively. The lower limits of detection are 0.04 pg/mL and 0.10 ng/mL, respectively.Omega-3 index The omega-3 index represents the red blood cell (RBC) content of the two major long-chain n-3 fatty acids (FAs), EPA and DHA, and equates to EPA + DHA as a percent of total RBC FAs.17 The RBCs were isolated from whole venous blood and were assayed for n-3 FAs, n-6 FAs, AA, EPA, and DHA, according to the HS-Omega-3 Index methodology.18 The typical coefficient of variation for the HS-Omega-3 Index using this procedure is 3%. The average omega-3 index in the United States population is 4.5%, with values ranging from 2.7% in the lowest fifth percentile to 8.8% in the highest 95th percentile.19Mass spectrometry—based lipid mediator metabolomics Frozen plasma samples were subjected to solid-phase extraction and profiled for bioactive lipid mediators using liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS) using methodologies that have been previously described.20 Briefly, three volumes of methanol containing internal deuterium-labeled standards (i.e., d5-RvD2, d5-LXA4, d4-PGE2, d4-LTB4, d8–5-HETE) were added to plasma samples before solid-phase extraction to assess extraction recovery in each chromatographic region. Methyl formate fractions were collected and dried under a steady stream of N2 gas, resuspended in methanol:water (50:50), and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Identification of mediators was accomplished using specific multiple reaction monitoring transitions and matching of retention time and diagnostic fragmentation spectra as compared to authentic standards. Abundance of lipid mediators was quantified using standard curves constructed with synthetic or authentic standards for each compound.Brachial artery FMD Brachial artery FMD was measured according to current guidelines and standards21 and as already described.14,22 FMD in healthy subjects is expected to be above 7%21 and has been reported to range between 0.2 and 19.2%.23Functional tests The 6-min walk test was administered according to standard procedures,24 and the distance to claudication and the time to claudication were recorded. Patients completed the walking impairment questionnaire, which is a validated survey that assesses a patient’s perceived walking capacity and limitation due to claudication across three domains: distance, speed, and stair climbing.25 Statistical analysis Sample size was estimated based on the primary end point (reduction in hsCRP). It was estimated that a hsCRP value of 5.0 ± 5.0 mg/L can be expected in the PAD population13 and that 3 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation would result in a 30% decrease in hsCRP.26 A sample size of 30 patients per group (60 in total) would have 80% power to conclude that hsCRP reduction is significantly higher in the treatment group. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), and variables were summarized by appropriate descriptive statistics. Baseline demographics and clinical variables were compared between the placebo and fish oil group using Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Student’s t-test for continuous variables. Paired Student’s t-tests were used to compare baseline variables with postintervention variables. All analyses were based on intention to treat. To visualize changes driven by n-3 PUFA supplementation, interaction network pathway analyses of the EPA lipid mediator metabolome were performed between treatment groups using Cytoscape. To accomplish these analyses, a missing value imputation that replaced nondetected values with half the minimum value for each mediator was used. In addition, a log transformation of the data was performed. These pathways graphically illustrate both the magnitude of change from baseline to 3-month follow-up for each treatment and the mean abundance of each mediator in the 3-month follow-up samples.",
    "results": "Results Twenty-four patients were enrolled in the study (all male), with 11 randomized to the fish oil group and 13 randomized to the placebo group (Supplemental Fig. 2). Recruitment for the trial was slower than expected and was ended by the principal investigator before reaching target enrollment. Two subjects (one per group) did not complete a follow-up visit and dropped out of the trial because of personal reasons. One subject in the placebo group developed headaches of an unknown cause and was removed from the study, reported to the institutional review board, and referred to the neurology service, who did not suspect that the placebo pills were the cause of the headaches. One subject in the fish oil group was hospitalized for a stroke and stopped taking the intervention while in the hospital. No participant in this trial dropped out of the study because of gastrointestinal upset, which is a commonly reported adverse effect of fish oil supplementation. This resulted in an overall dropout rate of 17%. Both groups were balanced after randomization with the exception of lower aspirin use in the fish oil (7/11 versus. 13/13, P = 0.03) (Table 1).

There was no significant change in the primary outcome of hsCRP levels after intervention in the fish oil or placebo group (Table 2). This was also true for IL-6 and ICAM-1. However, the omega-3 index increased more than two-fold in the fish oil group only (7.2 ± 1.2% increase from baseline, P < 0.001; between group differential P < 0.001).

Consistent with increases in the omega-3 index observed in the fish oil group, several downstream omega-3 PUFA products increased in this group as well. Fish oil supplementation resulted in increases in total plasma DHA (2046 ± 2094 pg/mL, P = 0.03) and EPA (6785 ± 2039 pg/mL, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1). The increase in EPA observed in the fish oil group was significantly greater than the change in EPA observed in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Using interaction network pathway analyses to visualize quantitative differences in the EPA metabolome from baseline to follow-up, we observed enrichment in SPM biosynthesis pathways in the fish oil group (Fig. 2). Several downstream EPA products that are SPM biosynthesis pathway markers were identified (Table 3 and Fig. 2). These included 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE), a marker of lipoxin A5 (LXA5) biosynthesis, and 18-HEPE, which is a marker of E-series resolvin biosynthesis.8 The levels of 15-HEPE and 18-HEPE increased significantly after 3 mo of fish oil supplementation, whereas there was no change in the placebo group (Table 3 and Fig. 3). Similarly, levels of LXA5 increased in the fish oil group but remained the same in the placebo group. E-series resolvins (i.e., RvE1 and RvE3) increased in the fish oil group, but only changes in RvE3 were statistically significant (Table 3 and Fig. 3).

Similar to products of EPA metabolism, several downstream DHA products that serve as SPM biosynthesis pathway markers were identified in the plasma. In the fish oil group, levels of 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (14-HDHA) and 17-HDHA, which are markers of the maresin and D-series resolvin pathways, respectively, increased significantly after fish oil supplementation (Table 3). We also identified D-series resolvins (RvD1–5), maresins (MaR1, MaR2), and protectins (PD1,17R-PD1) in the plasma (Table 3). However, no significant relationship between their levels and fish oil supplementation was observed. Similarly, we identified several AA products, including lipoxins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, but no significant relationships between the fish oil and placebo groups were observed (Supplemental Table 1). With regard to functional measurements, after intervention, the fish oil group had a greater time to claudication (94 ± 88 s increase from baseline, P = 0.12) and a greater distance to claudication (106 ± 92 m increase from baseline, P = 0.06) after intervention as measured by the 6-min walk test (Table 2). Although these changes were not statistically significant, these trends were not observed in the placebo group. There were no significant changes in perceived walking performance as measured by the walking impairment questionnaire in either group. In addition, there was no significant change in FMD in the fish oil group, although FMD increased in the placebo group, which was significantly different between groups (Table 2).",
    "discussion": "Discussion The OMEGA-PAD II trial was designed to investigate the effects of 3 mo of high-dose n-3 PUFA supplementation on inflammation and vascular function in patients with PAD. No difference in hsCRP was observed between the fish oil and placebo group, and no significant differences in functional outcomes were observed. However, the omega-3 index, a predictor of cardiovascular risk,27 increased more than twofold in the fish oil group with no significant changes noted in the placebo group. In addition, there were significant increases in downstream EPA and DHA products, including several SPMs, which have been demonstrated to be potent mediators of inflammation-resolution and have biological roles that could potentially explain several previously reported cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs.8,9 Although the OMEGA-PAD I trial originally identified significant increases in intermediates of SPM biosynthesis (e.g., HDHA and HEPE) after 1 mo of fish oil supplementation, it did not identify significant changes in SPM end products (e.g., resolvins and lipoxins) as reported in the current trial. Primary end point PAD is associated with elevated levels of inflammation, and markers of inflammation have been identified as predictors of mortality28 and poor surgical outcomes.29 N-3 PUFA consumption has previously been reported to be associated with lower serum levels of several inflammatory markers.1 Siasos et al. reported reductions in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α after 3 mo of oral n-3 PUFA supplementation.26 However, participants in that study did not have preexisting CVD, PAD, or any known clinical atherosclerosis. Although there are limited data analyzing the effects of oral n-3 PUFA supplementation specifically in patients with PAD, Schiano et al. reported no changes in hsCRP levels after 3 mo of n-3 PUFA treatment.30 The current trial did not detect any significant changes in hsCRP, IL-6, or ICAM-1. These gross measures of systemic inflammation might not adequately measure local inflammation at the vascular level and might not be the best way to assess the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on atherogenesis and PAD. It is also possible that the small sample size of this trial did not allow for the detection of changes in inflammatory markers or that 3 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation is an inadequate time period to see changes in these biomarkers. Secondary end points Deficiencies in the levels of EPA and DHA in RBCs, as measured by the omega-3 index, have been implicated with adverse cardiac events.27 Efforts to address deficiencies in the omega-3 index could result in reduced morbidity and mortality, which is particularly applicable to PAD cohorts given their numerous atherosclerotic risk factors and high risk for adverse cardiac events.31 The OMEGA-PAD I trial reported an absolute mean increase of 4% in the omega-3 index after 1 mo of fish oil supplementation,14 whereas this trial reports an absolute mean increase of more than 7% after 3 mo of fish oil supplementation. The mechanism through which n-3 PUFA supplementation and the omega-3 index could have protective effects has been proposed to be via increasing the production of mediators of resolution of inflammation, specifically SPMs. Recent research demonstrates that the resolution of inflammation is an active process driven by SPMs, which are derived from n-3 and n-6 PUFAs.8 These SPMs are generated via specific biosynthetic pathways and represent distinct classes including lipoxins derived from AA or EPA; the E-series resolvins generated from EPA; and the DHA-derived D-series resolvins, protectins, and maresins.8 SPMs have been shown to have potent proresolution effects in several models of disease, including atherosclerosis.8,10,32 As SPMs orchestrate termination of inflammation and return to tissue homeostasis, they may be protective against atherosclerosis, vascular injury, and PAD.33–36 This trial, despite the small sample size, provides substantial evidence that patients with PAD are capable of utilizing EPA and DHA in endogenous enzymatic pathways that increase the production of SPMs. Lipoxins and resolvins regulate leukocyte-endothelial interactions,37,38 reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species,39 and regulate the production of prostacyclin40 and nitric oxide.41 Although clinical studies assessing the role of SPMs in PAD are sparse, Ho et al. reported a lower level of 15R-LXA4 in patients with PAD when compared with healthy subjects,33 suggesting that patients with PAD might have a deficit of mediators of resolution. A growing body of evidence suggests that mediators of resolution and n-3 PUFA isolates, such as icosapent ethyl, play a protective role in CVD.42,43 Results of this trial further support that n-3 PUFA supplementation increases plasma levels of vasculoprotective SPMs. There are several reports of n-3 PUFA supplementation improving endothelial function44; however, there are limited data analyzing the effects of supplementation specifically in patients with PAD. Schiano et al. reported an improvement in FMD in patients with PAD after 3 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation when compared with their control group.30 The OMEGA-PAD I trial reported an improvement in FMD after 1 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation, but this difference was not significant when compared with changes observed in the placebo group.14 Results from the OMEGA-PAD II trial report a paradoxical decrease in FMD in the fish oil group and increase in FMD in the placebo group. These results are surprising, and the mechanism underlying them is unclear. Although measurements of FMD were done by trained and experienced staff, there are several factors that can acutely alter the results of FMD measurements including caffeine use, medication use, exercise, anxiety, and stress. Patients were directed to refrain from activities that are known to affect FMD results before measurement, but not all of these factors are controllable and may have contributed to the paradoxical results reported in this study. These results contradict previous evidence and should be further explored using larger sample sizes. Although not statistically significant, results of this trial suggest that n-3 PUFA supplementation may play a role in increasing time to claudication and walking distance. Previous studies have assessed the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on functional outcomes, such as walking distance, and have reported mixed results. Carrero et al. and Madden et al. both examined the effects of n-3 PUFAs in intermittent claudicants and reported improvements in walking distance.45,46 In contrast, a recent meta-analysis representing a total of 425 participants from nine randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that measured the effects of n-3 PUFAs on claudication symptoms failed to identify significant improvements between treatment and control groups in pain-free walking distance and maximal walking distance.47 However, all of the trials included in this meta-analysis varied in supplementation length, dose, and n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio, which could have contributed to the suboptimal results.",
    "conclusion": "Conclusion Although the role of n-3 PUFA supplementation in PAD is poorly understood, there have been limited data that support their beneficial effects in patients with PAD, including the OMEGA-PAD I trial. In this follow-up trial, 3 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation resulted in significant increases in the omega-3 index and SPMs and their biosynthetic pathway markers in patients with PAD. This provides evidence of the potential role that n-3 PUFA, or SPM, supplementation may play in addressing an inflammation resolution deficit in patients with PAD. Further research utilizing high-dose n-3 PUFA supplementation in larger, more diverse, cohorts is required to confirm and expand the results of this trial.",

There are limited data on the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).Materials and methods: The OMEGA-PAD II trial was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of 3 mo of high-dose oral n-3 PUFA supplementation on inflammation, endothelial function, and walking ability in patients with PAD.Results: Twenty-four patients with claudication received 4.4 g/d of fish oil or placebo for 3 mo. Outcomes measured included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, the omega-3 index, endothelial function as measured via flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, and a 6-min walk test. Plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) were measured by liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In patients treated with fish oil, the absolute mean omega-3 index significantly increased from baseline (fish oil: 7.2 ± 1.2%, P < 0.001; placebo: −0.4 ± 0.9%, P = 0.31; between-group P < 0.001). Furthermore, there were significant increases in several pathway markers of SPM biosynthesis, including several mono-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids and mono-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids. We also observed significant increases in the SPM lipoxin A5 (fish oil: 0.57 ± 0.70 pg/mL, P = 0.05; placebo: 0.01 ± 0.38 pg/mL, P = 0.93; between-group P = 0.04) and resolvin E3 (fish oil: 154 ± 171 pg/mL, P = 0.04; placebo: 32 ± 54 pg/mL, P = 0.08; between-group P = 0.04). There were no significant changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, or 6-min walk test in the fish oil group.Conclusions: Fish oil increases SPMs in plasma of patients with PAD. Further studies are required to determine whether these early changes translate to clinical improvements in patients with PAD.Keywords: Peripheral artery disease, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, Fish oils, Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, Other pharmacotherapyIntroduction The effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on systemic inflammation1,2 and cardiovascular disease (CVD)3 have been described in many populations. In addition, studies have shown that n-3 PUFA supplementation is associated with improvements in endothelial function,4,5 reduction in platelet aggregation,6 and improved atherosclerotic plaque stability.7 Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the main PUFAs in fish oil and are substrates for enzymes that give rise to specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs), specifically D-series resolvins, E-series resolvins, maresins, and protectins.8 These SPMs have receptor-mediated actions on human leukocytes, platelets, and vascular cells and have been shown to actively promote resolution of vascular inflammation and decrease atherosclerosis and vascular injury in animal models.8–10 Analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data suggests that populations consuming a diet high in n-3 PUFAs may have a decreased prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD).11 As such, investigators have examined the relationship between n-3 PUFAs and PAD,12 but heterogeneity in dosage and intervention length has likely contributed to inconsistent results. To more rigorously investigate oral n-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with PAD, the OMEGA-PAD I trial was designed.13 This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that 1 mo of high-dose n-3 PUFA (4.4 g/d) supplementation can change the metabololipidomic profile in patients with PAD toward increased production of mediators of resolution.14 Based on these results, we designed the OMEGA-PAD II trial with the hypothesis that high-dose n-3 PUFA supplementation over 3 mo would lead to changes in systemic inflammation, endothelial function, SPM profile, and claudication symptoms.Methods Trial design and participants The OMEGA-PAD II trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The study protocol was based on the previously published OMEGA-PAD I trial13,14 and took place at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC) between 2014 and 2016. Patients aged ≥50 y presenting to the outpatient vascular surgery clinic at the SFVAMC with intermittent claudication (Rutherford I-III) and PAD were recruited to the study. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of <0.9, toe pressure <70 mm Hg, or ≥50% stenosis in segments of the aortoiliac, femoral, or tibial arteries on imaging. Patients were excluded from participating if they were taking immunosuppressive medications or steroids, had a severe acute illness (e.g., infection, surgery, critical limb ischemia) within the last 30 d, or had severe hepatic (Child-Pugh ≥ B), renal (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL), or nonvascular inflammatory disease. Participants enrolled in the trial were randomized to one of two groups: fish oil or placebo. Patients were randomized by a block randomization with four subjects per block with a ratio of 1:1 for each block. The randomization was done by research pharmacists who maintained the key until the end of the study. N-3 PUFA supplementation was achieved with four capsules of ProOmega (Ultimate Omega) taken twice daily (Nordic Naturals, Watsonville, CA), corresponding to a total of 4.4 g/d. Each ProOmega (Ultimate Omega) capsule contains 325 mg of EPA and 225 mg of DHA. The dose of 4 g/d corresponds to the American Heart Association’s recommendations for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.15 The placebo group took the same number of capsules containing soybean (Nordic Naturals) that was designed to appear the same as the treatment capsules. Study subjects attended a baseline visit and underwent a comprehensive vascular physiology assessment and then started on the study drug or placebo for 3 mo. After 3 mo of intervention, they returned for a second visit where the assessment was repeated (Supplemental Fig. 1). Compliance with daily supplementation was addressed using a pill count that was performed at the follow-up visit. Dietary information was not collected throughout the trial; however, participants in both groups were encouraged to engage in healthy dietary habits according to national society guidelines. The primary end point was a change in plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Several secondary end points were measured to evaluate a wide range of potential effects that n-3 PUFA supplementation may have. These included changes in other biomarkers of inflammation, SPM profile, omega-3 index, brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), and measures of walking ability. SPMs measured included bioactive products and their biosynthetic pathway markers generated from EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid (AA) (see below). Institutional review board approval was granted for this study by the Committee on Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco as well as the SFVAMC Research and Development Office, with all participants giving informed written consent. The study was registered with Clinical-Trials.gov (NCT01979874).Measurements Demographics, anthropometries, medical history, and hemodynamic measurements Basic demographic information was provided by the participant through an intake questionnaire. Information on past medical history and medication use was obtained through the SFVAMC electronic medical record, and common atherosclerotic risk factors such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking history were recorded. ABIs were measured bilaterally using current guidelines and standards.16Renal, lipid, metabolic, and inflammation measurements Blood samples were collected in a fasting state and assayed the same day per standard methodology (Beckman Coulter Analyzer, Miami, FL) for measurement of creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albumin, hemoglobin A1C, and lipids. Plasma was isolated from venous blood and assayed for hsCRP the same day as collection per standard methodology (Beckman Coulter Analyzer). Serum was stored at −80° C until assayed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits per standard protocol (R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN). The typical coefficients of variation for IL-6 and ICAM-1 are 7.4% and 4.6%, respectively. The lower limits of detection are 0.04 pg/mL and 0.10 ng/mL, respectively.Omega-3 index The omega-3 index represents the red blood cell (RBC) content of the two major long-chain n-3 fatty acids (FAs), EPA and DHA, and equates to EPA + DHA as a percent of total RBC FAs.17 The RBCs were isolated from whole venous blood and were assayed for n-3 FAs, n-6 FAs, AA, EPA, and DHA, according to the HS-Omega-3 Index methodology.18 The typical coefficient of variation for the HS-Omega-3 Index using this procedure is 3%. The average omega-3 index in the United States population is 4.5%, with values ranging from 2.7% in the lowest fifth percentile to 8.8% in the highest 95th percentile.19Mass spectrometry—based lipid mediator metabolomics Frozen plasma samples were subjected to solid-phase extraction and profiled for bioactive lipid mediators using liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS) using methodologies that have been previously described.20 Briefly, three volumes of methanol containing internal deuterium-labeled standards (i.e., d5-RvD2, d5-LXA4, d4-PGE2, d4-LTB4, d8–5-HETE) were added to plasma samples before solid-phase extraction to assess extraction recovery in each chromatographic region. Methyl formate fractions were collected and dried under a steady stream of N2 gas, resuspended in methanol:water (50:50), and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Identification of mediators was accomplished using specific multiple reaction monitoring transitions and matching of retention time and diagnostic fragmentation spectra as compared to authentic standards. Abundance of lipid mediators was quantified using standard curves constructed with synthetic or authentic standards for each compound.Brachial artery FMD Brachial artery FMD was measured according to current guidelines and standards21 and as already described.14,22 FMD in healthy subjects is expected to be above 7%21 and has been reported to range between 0.2 and 19.2%.23Functional tests The 6-min walk test was administered according to standard procedures,24 and the distance to claudication and the time to claudication were recorded. Patients completed the walking impairment questionnaire, which is a validated survey that assesses a patient’s perceived walking capacity and limitation due to claudication across three domains: distance, speed, and stair climbing.25Statistical analysis Sample size was estimated based on the primary end point (reduction in hsCRP). It was estimated that a hsCRP value of 5.0 ± 5.0 mg/L can be expected in the PAD population13 and that 3 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation would result in a 30% decrease in hsCRP.26 A sample size of 30 patients per group (60 in total) would have 80% power to conclude that hsCRP reduction is significantly higher in the treatment group. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), and variables were summarized by appropriate descriptive statistics. Baseline demographics and clinical variables were compared between the placebo and fish oil group using Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Student’s t-test for continuous variables. Paired Student’s t-tests were used to compare baseline variables with postintervention variables. All analyses were based on intention to treat. To visualize changes driven by n-3 PUFA supplementation, interaction network pathway analyses of the EPA lipid mediator metabolome were performed between treatment groups using Cytoscape. To accomplish these analyses, a missing value imputation that replaced nondetected values with half the minimum value for each mediator was used. In addition, a log transformation of the data was performed. These pathways graphically illustrate both the magnitude of change from baseline to 3-month follow-up for each treatment and the mean abundance of each mediator in the 3-month follow-up samples.Results Twenty-four patients were enrolled in the study (all male), with 11 randomized to the fish oil group and 13 randomized to the placebo group (Supplemental Fig. 2). Recruitment for the trial was slower than expected and was ended by the principal investigator before reaching target enrollment. Two subjects (one per group) did not complete a follow-up visit and dropped out of the trial because of personal reasons. One subject in the placebo group developed headaches of an unknown cause and was removed from the study, reported to the institutional review board, and referred to the neurology service, who did not suspect that the placebo pills were the cause of the headaches. One subject in the fish oil group was hospitalized for a stroke and stopped taking the intervention while in the hospital. No participant in this trial dropped out of the study because of gastrointestinal upset, which is a commonly reported adverse effect of fish oil supplementation. This resulted in an overall dropout rate of 17%. Both groups were balanced after randomization with the exception of lower aspirin use in the fish oil (7/11 versus. 13/13, P = 0.03) (Table 1).

Consistent with increases in the omega-3 index observed in the fish oil group, several downstream omega-3 PUFA products increased in this group as well. Fish oil supplementation resulted in increases in total plasma DHA (2046 ± 2094 pg/mL, P = 0.03) and EPA (6785 ± 2039 pg/mL, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1). The increase in EPA observed in the fish oil group was significantly greater than the change in EPA observed in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Using interaction network pathway analyses to visualize quantitative differences in the EPA metabolome from baseline to follow-up, we observed enrichment in SPM biosynthesis pathways in the fish oil group (Fig. 2). Several downstream EPA products that are SPM biosynthesis pathway markers were identified (Table 3 and Fig. 2). These included 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE), a marker of lipoxin A5 (LXA5) biosynthesis, and 18-HEPE, which is a marker of E-series resolvin biosynthesis.8 The levels of 15-HEPE and 18-HEPE increased significantly after 3 mo of fish oil supplementation, whereas there was no change in the placebo group (Table 3 and Fig. 3). Similarly, levels of LXA5 increased in the fish oil group but remained the same in the placebo group. E-series resolvins (i.e., RvE1 and RvE3) increased in the fish oil group, but only changes in RvE3 were statistically significant (Table 3 and Fig. 3).

In the fish oil group, levels of 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (14-HDHA) and 17-HDHA, which are markers of the maresin and D-series resolvin pathways, respectively, increased significantly after fish oil supplementation (Table 3). We also identified D-series resolvins (RvD1–5), maresins (MaR1, MaR2), and protectins (PD1,17R-PD1) in the plasma (Table 3). However, no significant relationship between their levels and fish oil supplementation was observed. Similarly, we identified several AA products, including lipoxins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, but no significant relationships between the fish oil and placebo groups were observed (Supplemental Table 1). With regard to functional measurements, after intervention, the fish oil group had a greater time to claudication (94 ± 88 s increase from baseline, P = 0.12) and a greater distance to claudication (106 ± 92 m increase from baseline, P = 0.06) after intervention as measured by the 6-min walk test (Table 2). Although these changes were not statistically significant, these trends were not observed in the placebo group. There were no significant changes in perceived walking performance as measured by the walking impairment questionnaire in either group. In addition, there was no significant change in FMD in the fish oil group, although FMD increased in the placebo group, which was significantly different between groups (Table 2).Discussion The OMEGA-PAD II trial was designed to investigate the effects of 3 mo of high-dose n-3 PUFA supplementation on inflammation and vascular function in patients with PAD. No difference in hsCRP was observed between the fish oil and placebo group, and no significant differences in functional outcomes were observed. However, the omega-3 index, a predictor of cardiovascular risk,27 increased more than twofold in the fish oil group with no significant changes noted in the placebo group. In addition, there were significant increases in downstream EPA and DHA products, including several SPMs, which have been demonstrated to be potent mediators of inflammation-resolution and have biological roles that could potentially explain several previously reported cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs.8,9 Although the OMEGA-PAD I trial originally identified significant increases in intermediates of SPM biosynthesis (e.g., HDHA and HEPE) after 1 mo of fish oil supplementation, it did not identify significant changes in SPM end products (e.g., resolvins and lipoxins) as reported in the current trial. Primary end point PAD is associated with elevated levels of inflammation, and markers of inflammation have been identified as predictors of mortality28 and poor surgical outcomes.29 N-3 PUFA consumption has previously been reported to be associated with lower serum levels of several inflammatory markers.1 Siasos et al. reported reductions in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α after 3 mo of oral n-3 PUFA supplementation.26 However, participants in that study did not have preexisting CVD, PAD, or any known clinical atherosclerosis. Although there are limited data analyzing the effects of oral n-3 PUFA supplementation specifically in patients with PAD, Schiano et al. reported no changes in hsCRP levels after 3 mo of n-3 PUFA treatment.30 The current trial did not detect any significant changes in hsCRP, IL-6, or ICAM-1. These gross measures of systemic inflammation might not adequately measure local inflammation at the vascular level and might not be the best way to assess the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on atherogenesis and PAD. It is also possible that the small sample size of this trial did not allow for the detection of changes in inflammatory markers or that 3 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation is an inadequate time period to see changes in these biomarkers. Secondary end points Deficiencies in the levels of EPA and DHA in RBCs, as measured by the omega-3 index, have been implicated with adverse cardiac events.27 Efforts to address deficiencies in the omega-3 index could result in reduced morbidity and mortality, which is particularly applicable to PAD cohorts given their numerous atherosclerotic risk factors and high risk for adverse cardiac events.31 The OMEGA-PAD I trial reported an absolute mean increase of 4% in the omega-3 index after 1 mo of fish oil supplementation,14 whereas this trial reports an absolute mean increase of more than 7% after 3 mo of fish oil supplementation. The mechanism through which n-3 PUFA supplementation and the omega-3 index could have protective effects has been proposed to be via increasing the production of mediators of resolution of inflammation, specifically SPMs. Recent research demonstrates that the resolution of inflammation is an active process driven by SPMs, which are derived from n-3 and n-6 PUFAs.8 These SPMs are generated via specific biosynthetic pathways and represent distinct classes including lipoxins derived from AA or EPA; the E-series resolvins generated from EPA; and the DHA-derived D-series resolvins, protectins, and maresins.8 SPMs have been shown to have potent proresolution effects in several models of disease, including atherosclerosis.8,10,32 As SPMs orchestrate termination of inflammation and return to tissue homeostasis, they may be protective against atherosclerosis, vascular injury, and PAD.33–36 This trial, despite the small sample size, provides substantial evidence that patients with PAD are capable of utilizing EPA and DHA in endogenous enzymatic pathways that increase the production of SPMs. Lipoxins and resolvins regulate leukocyte-endothelial interactions,37,38 reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species,39 and regulate the production of prostacyclin40 and nitric oxide.41 Although clinical studies assessing the role of SPMs in PAD are sparse, Ho et al. reported a lower level of 15R-LXA4 in patients with PAD when compared with healthy subjects,33 suggesting that patients with PAD might have a deficit of mediators of resolution. A growing body of evidence suggests that mediators of resolution and n-3 PUFA isolates, such as icosapent ethyl, play a protective role in CVD.42,43 Results of this trial further support that n-3 PUFA supplementation increases plasma levels of vasculoprotective SPMs. There are several reports of n-3 PUFA supplementation improving endothelial function44; however, there are limited data analyzing the effects of supplementation specifically in patients with PAD. Schiano et al. reported an improvement in FMD in patients with PAD after 3 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation when compared with their control group.30 The OMEGA-PAD I trial reported an improvement in FMD after 1 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation, but this difference was not significant when compared with changes observed in the placebo group.14 Results from the OMEGA-PAD II trial report a paradoxical decrease in FMD in the fish oil group and increase in FMD in the placebo group. These results are surprising, and the mechanism underlying them is unclear. Although measurements of FMD were done by trained and experienced staff, there are several factors that can acutely alter the results of FMD measurements including caffeine use, medication use, exercise, anxiety, and stress. Patients were directed to refrain from activities that are known to affect FMD results before measurement, but not all of these factors are controllable and may have contributed to the paradoxical results reported in this study. These results contradict previous evidence and should be further explored using larger sample sizes. Although not statistically significant, results of this trial suggest that n-3 PUFA supplementation may play a role in increasing time to claudication and walking distance. Previous studies have assessed the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation on functional outcomes, such as walking distance, and have reported mixed results. Carrero et al. and Madden et al. both examined the effects of n-3 PUFAs in intermittent claudicants and reported improvements in walking distance.45,46 In contrast, a recent meta-analysis representing a total of 425 participants from nine randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that measured the effects of n-3 PUFAs on claudication symptoms failed to identify significant improvements between treatment and control groups in pain-free walking distance and maximal walking distance.47 However, all of the trials included in this meta-analysis varied in supplementation length, dose, and n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio, which could have contributed to the suboptimal results.Limitations This study is limited by a small sample size. Trial recruitment was closed early, and only 40% of the target sample was achieved. The comprehensive vascular physiology assessment that was completed at each study visit amounted to more than 6 h and this time commitment likely impaired study enrollment. In addition, the sample calculation was based on a baseline mean hsCRP of 5.0 mg/L, yet the mean hsCRP of this sample was much lower, and therefore even a sample size of 60 would have been underpowered to detect a difference in the primary end point. The groups were largely balanced after randomization, but differences in aspirin use could have altered the results. In addition, the use of cilostazol was not recorded and may have affected our results. Although not significant, patients in the fish oil group had a higher baseline FMD than the placebo group and could represent falsely elevated baseline FMD, which may have affected the postintervention results. Although recruitment was open to men and women, this cohort reflects the Veterans Affairs population and was made up completely of men, which limits the generalizability of the results.Conclusion Although the role of n-3 PUFA supplementation in PAD is poorly understood, there have been limited data that support their beneficial effects in patients with PAD, including the OMEGA-PAD I trial. In this follow-up trial, 3 mo of n-3 PUFA supplementation resulted in significant increases in the omega-3 index and SPMs and their biosynthetic pathway markers in patients with PAD. This provides evidence of the potential role that n-3 PUFA, or SPM, supplementation may play in addressing an inflammation resolution deficit in patients with PAD. Further research utilizing high-dose n-3 PUFA supplementation in larger, more diverse, cohorts is required to confirm and expand the results of this trial.Supplementary Material 1 MS1008290-supplement-1.doc (56KB, doc) 2 MS1008290-supplement-2.jpg (437KB, jpg) 3 MS1008290-supplement-3.jpg (410.3KB, jpg) Acknowledgment The authors would like to acknowledge the generous contribution of Nordic Naturals in providing ProOmega (Ultimate Omega) capsules and placebo for this study.

    "abstract": "Abstract Three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocytes leads to improved and prolonged synthetic and metabolic functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo, primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4a) binding sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications. Keywords: three-dimensional cell culture, bioreactor, hepatocyte, microarray, gene expression, spheroid",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is critical for understanding the function of cells in a physiologically relevant context and for tissue engineering complex solid organs like the liver [1]. 3D culture of hepatocytes has been shown to maintain the differentiated functions of hepatic cell lines [2] and primary cells [3, 4] as well as promote differentiation of stem cells toward the hepatic lineage [5–8]. Sustained differentiated functions of hepatocytes in 3D culture could be harnessed for drug toxicity screening [9, 10] or to improve the efficacy of extracorporeal liver-assist devices [11]. In addition, 3D aggregation may facilitate transplantation of hepatocytes kept in culture, which would be particularly useful for hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells [12, 13]. While differentiated functions are improved in hepatocytes cultured either on 3D scaffolds [14–17] or as self-aggregated 3D spheroids [2–4], little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to those improved functions in 3D culture. Using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) system, we previously showed that one important factor for sustaining differentiated functions of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line is sustained 3D cell-cell interactions [2]. RWVs are rotational bioreactors with a gas permeable membrane that, when in operation, are completely filled with culture media so that it functionally rotates as a solid-body around a horizontal axis. This creates a suspension culture environment with minimal fluid shear stress and turbulence, allowing cells to co-localize and self-aggregate with 3D spatial freedom [18]. Studies have shown that hepatocyte spheroids cultured under these conditions could develop into larger sizes with less hypoxic limitations to the inner core compared to stationary culture [19]. Human hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells co-cultured within RWVs demonstrated formation of complex 3D micro-architectures, including microvilli, bile canaliculi, and sinusoidal fenestrations [20, 21]. Importantly, as tissue engineering strategies advance and the definitions of biomaterials evolve, self-aggregated hepatocyte spheroids developed within bioreactors may be considered biomaterials in their own right [22]. Self-aggregated cellular spheroids are the building blocks for organ printing, a bottom up synthesis approach to tissue engineering [23]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hepatocyte functions within 3D spheroids is critical for the optimization of organ function within a printed liver. Moreover, hepatocyte spheroids generated within RWVs allow investigation of the biological effects of 3D cell-cell interactions without the influence of contacting scaffolds, surfaces, or carriers. In this study, we performed global gene expression and promoter region analyses on primary mouse hepatocytes cultured on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes (TCDs) or RWVs to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms important for maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture.",
    "methods": "2. Material and Methods 2.1. Mice Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were handled in accordance with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 2.2. Hepatocyte Isolation and Culture Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated by the two-step perfusion technique using Liver Perfusion and Liver Digest Media (Life Technologies, Pleasanton, CA), followed by separation using a 50% Percoll (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) density gradient. Purity of live hepatocytes was routinely ≥90%. Hepatocytes were cultured in 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) in DMEM supplemented with L-glutamine, antibiotics, insulin-transferrin-selenium, and HEPES (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) and placed either in 6cm collagen-coated TCDs (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or 10ml RWVs that were high-aspect-ratio-vessels (HARVs) with a diameter of 6cm (Synthecon, Houston, TX). RWV cultures were rotated at 16 rpm to maintain aggregates in suspension. Cells were cultured in 10mls of media at a cell density of 1×105 cells/ml for both TCDs and RWVs. 2.3. Light Microscopy Phase contrast photos were taken with a Rebel T3i (Canon, San Jose, CA) adapted to the photoport of the Eclipse TS100 Inverted Microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Cell sizes were measured with a stage micrometer. 2.4. Albumin ELISA Assay Cell culture supernatants were collected and albumin concentration was determined by a mouse albumin ELISA kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Bethyl, Montgomery, TX). 2.5. Assay for Cytochrome P450 1a1 Activity EROD (7-ethoxyresorufin-o-dealkylase) assays were performed as previously described [24]. 8μM of 7-ethoxyresorufin (Life Technologies) and 10μM of dicumarol (Sigma) were added to TCD or RWV cultures and incubated for 1 hour in the dark. Culture supernatants were then reacted with 15 Fishman units of β-gluconidase and 120 Roy units of arylsulfatase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at 37°C for 2 hours. Conversion of 7-ethoxyresorfin to resorufin was used to quantify CYP1A1 activity by determining the fluorescence optical density at 544nm/590nm (absorption/emission) measured against a standard curve of known amounts of resorufin (Life Technologies). 2.6. Cyquant Assay Cells from TCD and RWV cultures were harvested, frozen, and lysed. DNA content was quantified using the Cyquant Assay following the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). Cell numbers were determined by using a standard curve generated by known numbers of isolated primary mouse hepatocytes. 2.7. Microarray Sample Preparation and Analysis RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Initial RNA integrity was verified by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA). For microarray hybridization, RNA was amplified and biotinylated using the MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX). 10μg of biotinylated amplified RNA was hybridized on to the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) through the UCSF Gladstone Institute Genomics Core (San Francisco, CA). Global gene expression analysis was carried out with GeneSpring GX v. 12.0 software (Agilent) using the GC-RMA summarization algorithm. The expression threshold for analysis was set to raw data greater than the 20th percentile in at least 2 of the 15 samples. Genes with significant differential expression between any 2 of the 5 conditions were identified by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction (p-value <0.01) post-hoc Tukey analysis. Complete MIAME (Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment) –compliant microarray data will be submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus. 2.8. Promoter Region Analysis The oPOSSOM Web-based program (http://www.cisreg.ca) was used to identify over-representation of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in genes upregulated in RWV culture. oPOSSOM is a validated algorithm that identifies statistically over-represented TFBSs, as defined by the JASPAR database, within a set of co-regulated genes that are compared with a database of background genes that have conserved non-coding regions derived from phylogenetic footprinting and enriched for functional TFBSs. The search for TFBS was limited to within 5000 nucleotides upstream or downstream of the transcription start site. The TFBS rate was calculated as the number of times the TFBS was predicted, multiplied by the width of the TFBS profile, and divided by the total number of nucleotides in the conserved non-coding regions of the gene set. The two calculated statistical scores when used in combination (Z-score >10 and Fisher score <0.01) correctly identified the regulating transcription factor in reference gene sets and resulted in a false-positive rate of 15% in random gene sets [25]. 2.9. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) Reverse transcription was carried out with 300ng of RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transciption Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. One μl of the resulting cDNA was added to a final 20μl mixture containing 10μl of 2x SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 12 pmol oligonucleotide primers. PCRs were carried out in a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The thermal profile was 50°C for 2min, 95°C for 10min, followed by 40 amplification cycles consisting of 95°C for 15s, 63°C for 30s, and 72°C for 30s.

Morphology and function of primary mouse hepatocytes cultured within RWVs and on TCDs Primary mouse hepatocytes cultured within RWVs self-organized into 3D aggregates that were 100–200 μm in their longest cross-sectional length by 24 hours of culture (Figure 1A). After 3 days in RWVs, hepatocyte cell shape remained round in densely-packed aggregates ranging from 200–300 μm in size. In contrast, hepatocytes on TCDs formed a monolayer of characteristic bi-nucleated cells within 24 hours of culture (Figure 1A). After 3 days in TCDs, cultured cells acquired irregular and pleomorphic shapes with elongated spindle-like projections. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Hepatocyte 3D aggregates generated in rotating wall vessels (RWVs) demonstrated improved hepatocyte-specific functions compared to monolayers in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). (A) Primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured in either TCDs or RWVs and phase-contrast photomicrographs were taken at 24h and day 3 of culture. Scale bar = 100μm. Total magnification 40x. (B) Albumin production was significantly increased in RWVs at 36h and day 3 of culture compared to TCDs. (C) Likewise, cytochrome P450 1a1 activity was significantly increased in RWVs at 4h, 24h, and day 3 of culture compared to TCDs. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. *p<0.001. Error bars indicate standard deviation.Along with these morphological differences, hepatocytes cultured as 3D aggregates demonstrated significantly improved synthetic and metabolic functions as compared to hepatocytes in monolayers, at both early and late time-points. Albumin secretion was 2.5-fold more per cell at 36 hours and 3.5-fold more per cell at day 3 in RWV cultures compared to TCDs (Figure 1B). Cytochrome P450 1a1 (CYP1A1) activity was 3-fold higher per cell in RWVs as compared to TCDs in as early as 4 hours of culture, and improved function was maintained at 24 hours (3-fold) and day 3 (2.2-fold) (Figure 1C). These findings indicate that primary hepatocytes cultured in RWVs self-aggregated to form 3D spheroids with enhanced synthetic and metabolic functions compared hepatocytes cultured as monolayers. Improved hepatocyte-specific functions in RWV culture were not associated with increased proliferation of these cells. After 3 days, cell numbers were slightly increased in TCDs compared to RWVs, but not to a statistically significant extent (Figure 2A). Moreover, expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) was higher in TCDs than in RWVs at 36 hours of culture (Figure 2B), suggesting that proliferative capacity of cultured primary hepatocytes may be higher in TCDs. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Primary hepatocytes cultured on TCDs have a slight growth advantage compared to those cultured in RWVs. (A) Cell numbers were enumerated by the Cyquant assay on day 3 of culture. The slight increases in cell numbers in TCD cultures compared to RWV were not statistically significant. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviation. (B) Expression of Pcna (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) in hepatocytes cultured on TCDs was significantly higher than in those cultured in RWV. Data are the average of 5 independent experiments. *p<0.005. Error bars represent standard error. 3.2. Global gene expression profiles of hepatocytes cultured as 3D aggregates or as monolayers To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying improved hepatocyte functions in 3D aggregates, we analyzed the global gene expression of hepatocytes cultured as monolayers on TCDs and 3D aggregates in RWVs at 4 hours and 24 hours using microarrays. These early time-points were chosen to determine the initial gene expression profile of hepatocytes in TCD and RWV cultures. For each of the 5 conditions (freshly isolated hepatocytes, 4h TCD, 4h RWV, 24h TCD, and 24h RWV) we analyzed 3 independent biological samples from separate experiments to ensure experimental reproducibility and increase confidence in the microarray analysis. One-way ANOVA (with p < 0.01) generated a list of 16,893 genes that were significantly differentially expressed among the 5 experimental conditions. Principal component analysis demonstrated that experimental triplicates clustered together within each condition and separately from the other groups, indicating good reproducibility of the global gene expression patterns within each condition (Figure 3A). The 4h TCD samples clustered separately from the 4h RWV samples, showing that these culture conditions led to differential gene expression in as early as 4h of culture. The variance between TCD and RWV samples increased at 24h reflecting increased differences in gene expression. Figure 3.

Each symbol represents an independent sample from 3 independent experiments. (B) Hierarchical clustering of genes with 2-fold or greater expression difference between TCD and RWV culture conditions at either 4h or 24h. Each column represents the average expression values of 3 independent experiments. (C) Venn diagram that compares genes significantly upregulated by 2-fold or more in hepatocyte 3D aggregates compared to monolayers with genes significantly upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Numbers represent the number of genes either distinct in or shared by the 3 processes.Analysis was then focused on genes with significant differential expression between TCD and RWV by at least 2-fold at either time-point. The complete lists of genes upregulated in RWV or TCD cultures at 4 or 24 hours are detailed in Supplemental Tables 1–4. The resulting combined list of 822 differentially expressed genes was analyzed by hierarchical clustering on both gene expression and experimental condition (Figure 3B). Each condition was compared to freshly isolated hepatocytes as the baseline. Hierarchical clustering on experimental conditions revealed that hepatocytes cultured in RWVs for 24 hours still had a gene expression profile similar enough to freshly isolated hepatocytes to be linked under one main branch of the hierarchical dendrogram. In contrast, the gene expression profile of hepatocytes cultured for 24h in TCDs was significantly different from freshly isolated and 24h RWV hepatocytes that it grouped separately under its own branch of the hierarchical dendrogram. This analysis suggests that RWV culture preserved molecular features in hepatocytes that more closely resembled freshly isolated hepatocytes, whereas TCD culture induced molecular programs that drove hepatocytes further from their initial phenotype. 3.3. Gene expression profile of 3D aggregate cultures compared to liver development and liver regeneration One hypothesis for the improved functional capacity of hepatocytes cultured in RWVs as compared to TCDs is that formation of 3D cellular interactions recapitulated in vivo-like molecular pathways. To test this hypothesis, we compared the genes significantly upregulated in RWV with genes differentially regulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Raw microarray datasets (accession number: GSE6998) of the developing mouse liver and the regenerating mouse liver after two-thirds hepatectomy were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and re-analyzed using the GC-RMA summarization algorithm [27]. Because the same microarray platform was used to generate the curated datasets, re-analyzed data could be directly compared to the microarray data generated in this study. Genes significantly upregulated at any time-point during liver development were identified by one-way ANOVA (p < 0.01) and filtered for genes expressed 2-fold or higher compared to unmanipulated adult mouse liver. Similarly, significantly upregulated genes in liver regeneration at any time-point after hepatectomy were identified using the same criteria. Finally, genes significantly upregulated by 2-fold or more in RWV as compared to TCD at either 4 or 24 hours of culture were identified. Differentially upregulated genes from these 3 processes were compared to determine whether they shared significant numbers of genes (Figure 3C). Most of the upregulated genes in these biological processes were uniquely upregulated in each process: 93% (4460 genes) of the upregulated genes in liver development, 73% (353 genes) in 3D aggregate/monolayer culture, and 52% (300 genes) in regeneration. Only 5 genes were shared by all 3 processes. These analyses reveal that 3D aggregate culture triggers different molecular pathways from liver development or regeneration to maintain hepatocyte-specific functions. 3.4. Characterization of differential gene expression between 3D aggregate and monolayer cultures Gene Ontogeny (GO) analysis was performed to classify the 293 genes significantly upregulated by ≥2-fold in hepatocytes cultured in RWV compared to TCD at 24 hours. The most significant GO Biological Process terms encompassed characteristic hepatocyte functions such as lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, oxidation-reduction, response to glucose stimulus, and response to xenobiotic stimulus (Table 2). Table 2. Gene ontology analysis of significantly upregulated biological process terms in 3D aggregates as compared to monolayers at 24h of culture. GO Term Number of Genes P-value Lipid metabolic process 44 < 0.0001 Organic acid metabolic process 41 < 0.0001 Amino acid metabolic process 19 <0.01 Organic acid biosynthetic process 23 < 0.0001 Amino acid biosynthetic process 12 < 0.001 Oxidation-reduction process 35 < 0.05 Response to glucose stimulus 9 < 0.05 Response to xenobiotic stimulus 6 < 0.05 Open in a new tabFor some genes whose expression is correlated with mature hepatocyte function, microarray results were validated by qRT-PCR (Figure 4). Bile acid co-enzyme A (Baat), which catalyzes the conjugation of bile acids to amino acids before excretion into bile canaliculi [28], was upregulated 23.3±2.5 fold in 3D aggregates compared to monolayers. Akr1c19, a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, which catalyzes conversion of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols [29], was upregulated 9.4±1.3 fold. The liver-specific isoform of glycogen synthase (Gys2), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of glycogen synthesis [30], was upregulated by 6.6±1.1 fold. Expression of factor VII (F7), a coagulation factor in the extrinsic pathway and important indicator of liver synthetic function [31], was 2.9±0.6 fold higher in RWV-cultured hepatocytes than in TCDs. Expression of Hfe2, which encodes the protein hemojuvelin involved in iron metabolism, was increased 11.4±1.7 fold in RWV compared to TCD cultures. Lastly, leptin receptor (Lepr), important in the regulation of lipid metabolism, was expressed 19.8±5.9 fold higher in RWV-cultured hepatocytes. Together, these data indicate that the most significant difference between TCD- and RWV-cultured hepatocytes is that diverse metabolic functions characteristic of hepatocytes were maintained at higher levels in 3D aggregates than in monolayers. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Metabolic and synthetic genes were upregulated in hepatocytes cultured as 3D aggregates in RWVs compared to monolayers in TCDs. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that expression levels of bile acid co-enzyme A (Baat), aldo-ketoreductase 1c19 (Akr1c19), glycogen synthase 2 (Gys2), factor VII (F7), hemochromatosis type 2 (Hfe2), and leptin receptor (Lepr) were significantly upregulated in RWV compared to TCD. Data are the average of 6 independent experiments. *p<0.005, **p<0.0001. Error bars indicate standard error. 3.5. Promoter region analysis of genes upregulated in RWVs compared to TCDs To identify a unifying mechanism that may explain the improved expression of a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific genes in 3D aggregate culture, promoter region analysis was performed on the 293 genes upregulated in RWV at 24 hours to find over-represented transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Of the 293 genes, 261 were in the oPOSSUM database (http://www.cisreg.ca) and included in the analysis. Table 3 lists the top 10 over-represented TFBSs in genes significantly upregulated in RWV-cultured hepatocytes compared with a background gene set. TFBSs with a Z-score > 10 and Fisher score < 0.01 were empirically validated to identify functionally relevant transcription factors within a set of co-expressed genes [25]. Using these criteria, only the top 2 transcription factors, HNF4α (Hnf4a) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 1 (TFCOUP1), were identified as functionally important regulators of the genes upregulated in RWV-cultured hepatocytes. Remarkably, 52% of the analyzed genes (138 genes) contained Hnf4a TFBSs in their promoter regions. Hnf4a is known as a master regulator of hepatocyte-specific functions [32]. Interestingly, TFCOUP1 and Hnf4a binding motifs are highly related and TFCOUP1 has been shown to act as a negative regulator of Hnf4a transactivation [33]. These analyses suggest that Hnf4a is particularly important for maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in RWV-cultured hepatocytes. Table 3.

Expression of Hnf4a was significantly increased by 3.4±0.5 fold in RWV-cultured hepatocytes compared to TCD (Figure 5), whereas expression of Cebpa and Foxa2 did not differ significantly between culture types. CCAAT/enchancer-binding protein α (Cebpa) is a liver-enriched transcription factor known to regulate expression of numerous genes that support liver-specific functions [34]. Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) is a transcription factor critical for liver development [35], but dispensable for maintenance of mature hepatocyte functions [36]. Our findings suggest that Hnf4a is the principle promoter of hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Expression of Hnf4a was significantly increased in 3D aggregates in RWVs compared to monolayers in TCDs, as determined by qRT-PCR. Expression levels of Cebpa and Foxa2, two other liver-enriched transcription factors, were not significantly different between the two culture conditions. Data are the average of 6 independent experiments. *p<0.001. Error bars indicate standard error. 3.6. Characterization of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal gene expression in monolayer cultures compared to 3D aggregate cultures In addition to being a direct transcriptional activator of many hepatocyte-specific functional genes, Hnf4a has also been shown to maintain hepatocyte differentiation by repressing expression of mesenchymal genes, including Snail (Snai1), a key inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [37]. In order to determine whether mesenchymal molecular pathways may be concomitantly suppressed in hepatocyte 3D aggregates, we measured expression of several important markers of EMT at 24h of culture in TCDs and RWVs, before potential overgrowth of contaminating non-parenchymal cells (<10% of the purified hepatocyte population, data not shown) may confound the results. Notably, Snail expression was significantly higher in TCD cultures by 2.7±0.6 fold at 24h as compared to RWV cultures. Vimentin (Vim), a cytoskeletal intermediate filament widely used as a marker of EMT [38], was expressed 6.6±1.3 fold higher in monolayer cultures compared to 3D aggregate cultures. Furthermore, expression of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (Loxl2), another inducer of EMT [39], was also significantly upregulated by 33.3±6.5 fold in TCDs compared to RWVs (Figure 6). Expression of E-cadherin (Cdh1) and N-cadherin (Cdh2), adhesion molecules characteristic of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, respectively, were not significantly different between TCD and RWV cultures (data not shown). Instead, several cytoskeletal genes not previously described in hepatocyte monolayer cultures were significantly upregulated in TCDs compared to RWVs. These included filamin A (Flna), an actin-binding protein that interacted with vimentin to regulate cell adhesion and spreading [40], whose expression was increased 3.7±0.4 fold in TCDs compared to RWVs. Expression of α1-actin (Acta1), an actin isoform expressed primarily in skeletal muscle [41], was greatly increased by 25.9±4.2 fold in monolayer cultures as compared to 3D aggregates. Finally, expression of β-tropomyosin (Tpm2), an isoform primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and fibroblasts [42], was also significantly increased by 6.9±1.5 fold in TCD-cultured hepatocytes (Figure 6). The significantly higher expression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in TCD as compared to RWV cultures at 24h suggests that these molecular pathways are induced in hepatocyte monolayers and suppressed in 3D aggregates. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes were upregulated in hepatocytes cultured as monolayers in TCDs compared to 3D aggregates in RWVs. qRT-PCR demonstrated that expression levels of Snail (Snai1), vimentin (Vim), lysyl oxidase-like 2 (Loxl2), filamin A (Flna), α1 actin (Acta1), and β-tropomyosin (Tpm2) were significantly upregulated in TCD compared to RWV at 24h of culture. Data are the average of 6 independent experiments. *p<0.05, **p<0.005, ***p<0.001. Error bars indicate standard error.",
    "discussion": "4. Discussion In this study, we used global gene expression profiling and promoter region analyses to identify molecular differences between primary mouse hepatocytes cultured as monolayers on TCDs and as 3D aggregates generated in RWVs. Our results indicated that improved synthetic and metabolic functions in hepatocyte 3D aggregates reflected the upregulated expression of a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes compared to monolayer cultures. The pattern of differential gene expression was distinct from molecular pathways induced during hepatocyte differentiation in organogenesis or hepatocyte proliferation after two-thirds hepatectomy. Remarkably, TFBS analysis revealed that more than 50% of the genes upregulated in RWV cultures had Hnf4a binding sites in their promoter regions. Hnf4a binding sites were the most significantly over-represented TFBS in genes differentially upregulated in RWV cultures and expression of Hnf4a itself was significantly upregulated in 3D aggregates compared to monolayers. While cell-matrix interactions dominate in hepatocyte monolayers cultured on collagen-coated TCDs, 3D cell-cell interactions dominate within self-aggregated spheroids generated in RWVs. These findings suggest that 3D cell-cell interactions are important for sustained expression of Hnf4a, which in turn plays a key role in maintaining differentiated hepatocyte functions in 3D aggregates. Hnf4a (also known as Nr2a1) is a liver-enriched transcription factor and a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. It can activate gene transcription in the absence of exogenous ligand [43], though it has a hydrophobic binding pocket and linoleic acid may be a potential endogenous ligand [44]. Hnf4a is known to have essential roles in normal liver development, maintaining mature liver functions, and in inducing hepatic differentiation in stem cells and fibroblasts. Targeted disruption of Hnf4a in mice led to embryonic lethality due to failure to complete gastrulation [45]. Tetraploid complementation of Hnf4a−/− embryos demonstrated that Hnf4a was essential for hepatocyte differentiation during liver development [46]. Conditional knock-out of Hnf4a in fetal hepatocytes showed that Hnf4a was required for normal morphological and functional differentiation of hepatocytes and development of hepatic epithelium [47]. In addition to its critical role during liver development, Hnf4a is also required to maintain normal metabolic functions of mature hepatocytes. Conditional knock-out of Hnf4a in mature hepatocytes, generated by mating Hnf4aloxp/loxp mice with mice expressing Cre under the albumin promoter, showed that Hnf4a was an essential regulator of lipid homeostasis [48], bile acid metabolism [49], glucose metabolism [50], and xenobiotic metabolism [51]. Moreover, ectopic expression of Hnf4a is required for conversion of fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells that have mature hepatocyte functions, including the ability to reconstitute liver tissue after transplantation [52]. Over-expression of Hnf4a in human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell derived hepatoblasts was able to significantly improve the mature hepatocyte functions of differentiated cells [53]. Finally, genome-wide studies demonstrated that Hnf4a bound the promoters of liver-specific genes significantly more often than other liver-enriched transcription factors [54, 55], indicating that Hnf4a was one of the most important transcriptional master regulators of hepatocyte function. Our global gene expression and promoter region analyses indicate that Hnf4a also plays a central role in maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture. Three-dimensional culture has been shown to improve hepatocyte differentiated functions but the underlying mechanisms of how 3D culture induced these effects were previously unknown. Our data suggest that 3D cell-cell interactions are important for maintaining expression of the master regulator Hnf4a at a higher level compared to monolayer culture. Increased expression of Hnf4a in 3D culture in turn leads to sustained expression of a wide range of downstream hepatocyte-specific functional genes as well as improved overall metabolic function of the hepatocyte. Several gene targets correlating with mature hepatocyte functions significantly upregulated in RWVs are known direct targets of Hnf4a (e.g. Baat, F7, and Gys2) [47, 49, 56] or have Hnf4a binding sites within their promoter regions (e.g. Akr1c19) [57]. There are also functional genes highly upregulated in RWVs that do not possess Hnf4a TFBS (e.g. Hfe2 and Lepr) [57], suggesting that Hnf4a may have an indirect role in controlling expression of these genes or that other transcriptional networks may be involved. Nevertheless, our analyses reveal that Hnf4a is likely the major transcriptional effector for maintaining differentiated functions of hepatocytes in 3D culture. Conversely, one can consider the signals induced in monolayer cultures that may be repressed in 3D aggregates. Monolayer culture on TCD is a highly artificial environment in which cell-matrix interactions dominate and cells are spread against a stiff two-dimensional (2D) surface. Under these conditions, we found that hepatocytes significantly increased expression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes compared to 3D aggregate culture. Hepatocytes cultured on collagen-coated TCDs have been shown to undergo fibroblastoid dedifferentiation [58, 59] and express mesenchymal cell characteristics [60–62]. Our results suggest that this transition towards a mesenchymal phenotype may be inhibited in hepatocytes cultured in 3D. We showed that while hepatocytes acquired spindle-like projections after several days of culture on TCDs, they maintained a round shape in 3D aggregates. Several EMT inducers and mesenchymal cell markers (Snail, Vim, and Loxl2) were highly upregulated in TCDs as compared RWVs. In addition, expression levels of several cytoskeletal genes not previously described in monolayer culture (Acta1, Tpm2, and Flna) were also significantly increased in TCDs compared to RWVs. There is evidence that Hnf4a actively represses the mesenchymal program in hepatocytes in conjunction with maintaining hepatocyte-specific differentiated functions. Hnf4a was shown to bind to the Vim and Snail promoters in hepatocytes and to directly repress transcription of Snail. Silencing of Hnf4a was sufficient to upregulate expression of both Vim and Snail [37]. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Hnf4a induced the reverse mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) process in fibroblasts [47]. Therefore, one interpretation of our data is that stiff 2D matrix interactions in monolayer culture inhibited expression of Hnf4a that in turn led to decreased expression of hepatocyte functional genes as well as upregulation of EMT inducers that promoted mesenchymal transition. Mechanotransduction, in which cells biochemically integrate mechanical matrix and substrate cues of the micro-environment, is an important determinant of cell function and behavior [63]. Future investigation in our lab will further characterize the differential molecular signals in monolayer versus 3D aggregate culture that lead to inhibited or maintained expression of Hnf4a in hepatocytes. Our results demonstrating that 3D cell-cell interactions maintained expression of Hnf4a as a master regulator of hepatocyte functions and phenotype provide a foundation for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte function for in vitro and in vivo applications. Our findings suggest that biomaterials aimed to augment hepatocyte differentiated functions should maximize 3D cell-cell interactions and minimize stiff 2D substrate contacts. As self-aggregated hepatocyte spheroids may be considered biomaterials in their own right [22] and used in applications such as organ printing [23], our data inform how tissue engineering strategies utilizing hepatocyte spheroids may be optimized. Moreover, we show that 3D hepatocyte cultures would be advantageous for in vitro applications in which the differentiated state of hepatocytes is critical, such as drug toxicity studies. Along these lines, 3D aggregate cultures may also be effective in improving differentiation of hepatocyte-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which would be beneficial for efforts aimed at liver disease modeling in vitro.",

Conclusions Using global gene expression and promoter region analyses, we demonstrated that the master transcriptional regulator Hnf4a has a major role in maintaining differentiated hepatocyte functions in 3D culture. Concomitantly, expression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes induced in monolayer cultures were suppressed in 3D aggregates. These findings provide a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte-specific functions for in vitro and in vivo applications.",

In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo, primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4a) binding sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications. Keywords: three-dimensional cell culture, bioreactor, hepatocyte, microarray, gene expression, spheroid1. Introduction Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is critical for understanding the function of cells in a physiologically relevant context and for tissue engineering complex solid organs like the liver [1]. 3D culture of hepatocytes has been shown to maintain the differentiated functions of hepatic cell lines [2] and primary cells [3, 4] as well as promote differentiation of stem cells toward the hepatic lineage [5–8]. Sustained differentiated functions of hepatocytes in 3D culture could be harnessed for drug toxicity screening [9, 10] or to improve the efficacy of extracorporeal liver-assist devices [11]. In addition, 3D aggregation may facilitate transplantation of hepatocytes kept in culture, which would be particularly useful for hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells [12, 13]. While differentiated functions are improved in hepatocytes cultured either on 3D scaffolds [14–17] or as self-aggregated 3D spheroids [2–4], little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to those improved functions in 3D culture. Using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) system, we previously showed that one important factor for sustaining differentiated functions of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line is sustained 3D cell-cell interactions [2]. RWVs are rotational bioreactors with a gas permeable membrane that, when in operation, are completely filled with culture media so that it functionally rotates as a solid-body around a horizontal axis. This creates a suspension culture environment with minimal fluid shear stress and turbulence, allowing cells to co-localize and self-aggregate with 3D spatial freedom [18]. Studies have shown that hepatocyte spheroids cultured under these conditions could develop into larger sizes with less hypoxic limitations to the inner core compared to stationary culture [19]. Human hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells co-cultured within RWVs demonstrated formation of complex 3D micro-architectures, including microvilli, bile canaliculi, and sinusoidal fenestrations [20, 21]. Importantly, as tissue engineering strategies advance and the definitions of biomaterials evolve, self-aggregated hepatocyte spheroids developed within bioreactors may be considered biomaterials in their own right [22]. Self-aggregated cellular spheroids are the building blocks for organ printing, a bottom up synthesis approach to tissue engineering [23]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hepatocyte functions within 3D spheroids is critical for the optimization of organ function within a printed liver. Moreover, hepatocyte spheroids generated within RWVs allow investigation of the biological effects of 3D cell-cell interactions without the influence of contacting scaffolds, surfaces, or carriers. In this study, we performed global gene expression and promoter region analyses on primary mouse hepatocytes cultured on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes (TCDs) or RWVs to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms important for maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture.2. Material and Methods 2.1. Mice Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were handled in accordance with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.2.2. Hepatocyte Isolation and Culture Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated by the two-step perfusion technique using Liver Perfusion and Liver Digest Media (Life Technologies, Pleasanton, CA), followed by separation using a 50% Percoll (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) density gradient. Purity of live hepatocytes was routinely ≥90%. Hepatocytes were cultured in 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) in DMEM supplemented with L-glutamine, antibiotics, insulin-transferrin-selenium, and HEPES (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) and placed either in 6cm collagen-coated TCDs (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or 10ml RWVs that were high-aspect-ratio-vessels (HARVs) with a diameter of 6cm (Synthecon, Houston, TX). RWV cultures were rotated at 16 rpm to maintain aggregates in suspension. Cells were cultured in 10mls of media at a cell density of 1×105 cells/ml for both TCDs and RWVs.2.3. Light Microscopy Phase contrast photos were taken with a Rebel T3i (Canon, San Jose, CA) adapted to the photoport of the Eclipse TS100 Inverted Microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Cell sizes were measured with a stage micrometer.2.4. Albumin ELISA Assay Cell culture supernatants were collected and albumin concentration was determined by a mouse albumin ELISA kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Bethyl, Montgomery, TX).2.5. Assay for Cytochrome P450 1a1 Activity EROD (7-ethoxyresorufin-o-dealkylase) assays were performed as previously described [24]. 8μM of 7-ethoxyresorufin (Life Technologies) and 10μM of dicumarol (Sigma) were added to TCD or RWV cultures and incubated for 1 hour in the dark. Culture supernatants were then reacted with 15 Fishman units of β-gluconidase and 120 Roy units of arylsulfatase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at 37°C for 2 hours. Conversion of 7-ethoxyresorfin to resorufin was used to quantify CYP1A1 activity by determining the fluorescence optical density at 544nm/590nm (absorption/emission) measured against a standard curve of known amounts of resorufin (Life Technologies).2.6. Cyquant Assay Cells from TCD and RWV cultures were harvested, frozen, and lysed. DNA content was quantified using the Cyquant Assay following the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). Cell numbers were determined by using a standard curve generated by known numbers of isolated primary mouse hepatocytes.2.7. Microarray Sample Preparation and Analysis RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Initial RNA integrity was verified by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA). For microarray hybridization, RNA was amplified and biotinylated using the MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX). 10μg of biotinylated amplified RNA was hybridized on to the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) through the UCSF Gladstone Institute Genomics Core (San Francisco, CA). Global gene expression analysis was carried out with GeneSpring GX v. 12.0 software (Agilent) using the GC-RMA summarization algorithm. The expression threshold for analysis was set to raw data greater than the 20th percentile in at least 2 of the 15 samples. Genes with significant differential expression between any 2 of the 5 conditions were identified by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction (p-value <0.01) post-hoc Tukey analysis. Complete MIAME (Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment) –compliant microarray data will be submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus.2.8. Promoter Region Analysis The oPOSSOM Web-based program (http://www.cisreg.ca) was used to identify over-representation of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in genes upregulated in RWV culture. oPOSSOM is a validated algorithm that identifies statistically over-represented TFBSs, as defined by the JASPAR database, within a set of co-regulated genes that are compared with a database of background genes that have conserved non-coding regions derived from phylogenetic footprinting and enriched for functional TFBSs. The search for TFBS was limited to within 5000 nucleotides upstream or downstream of the transcription start site. The TFBS rate was calculated as the number of times the TFBS was predicted, multiplied by the width of the TFBS profile, and divided by the total number of nucleotides in the conserved non-coding regions of the gene set. The two calculated statistical scores when used in combination (Z-score >10 and Fisher score <0.01) correctly identified the regulating transcription factor in reference gene sets and resulted in a false-positive rate of 15% in random gene sets [25].2.9. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) Reverse transcription was carried out with 300ng of RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transciption Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. One μl of the resulting cDNA was added to a final 20μl mixture containing 10μl of 2x SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 12 pmol oligonucleotide primers. PCRs were carried out in a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The thermal profile was 50°C for 2min, 95°C for 10min, followed by 40 amplification cycles consisting of 95°C for 15s, 63°C for 30s, and 72°C for 30s. Samples were normalized to rRNA 18S internal standard. Relative quantification of gene expression was calculated by using the 2ΔΔCt equation.2.10.

Results 3.1. Morphology and function of primary mouse hepatocytes cultured within RWVs and on TCDs Primary mouse hepatocytes cultured within RWVs self-organized into 3D aggregates that were 100–200 μm in their longest cross-sectional length by 24 hours of culture (Figure 1A). After 3 days in RWVs, hepatocyte cell shape remained round in densely-packed aggregates ranging from 200–300 μm in size. In contrast, hepatocytes on TCDs formed a monolayer of characteristic bi-nucleated cells within 24 hours of culture (Figure 1A). After 3 days in TCDs, cultured cells acquired irregular and pleomorphic shapes with elongated spindle-like projections. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Hepatocyte 3D aggregates generated in rotating wall vessels (RWVs) demonstrated improved hepatocyte-specific functions compared to monolayers in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). (A) Primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured in either TCDs or RWVs and phase-contrast photomicrographs were taken at 24h and day 3 of culture. Scale bar = 100μm. Total magnification 40x. (B) Albumin production was significantly increased in RWVs at 36h and day 3 of culture compared to TCDs. (C) Likewise, cytochrome P450 1a1 activity was significantly increased in RWVs at 4h, 24h, and day 3 of culture compared to TCDs. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. *p<0.001. Error bars indicate standard deviation.Along with these morphological differences, hepatocytes cultured as 3D aggregates demonstrated significantly improved synthetic and metabolic functions as compared to hepatocytes in monolayers, at both early and late time-points. Albumin secretion was 2.5-fold more per cell at 36 hours and 3.5-fold more per cell at day 3 in RWV cultures compared to TCDs (Figure 1B). Cytochrome P450 1a1 (CYP1A1) activity was 3-fold higher per cell in RWVs as compared to TCDs in as early as 4 hours of culture, and improved function was maintained at 24 hours (3-fold) and day 3 (2.2-fold) (Figure 1C). These findings indicate that primary hepatocytes cultured in RWVs self-aggregated to form 3D spheroids with enhanced synthetic and metabolic functions compared hepatocytes cultured as monolayers. Improved hepatocyte-specific functions in RWV culture were not associated with increased proliferation of these cells. After 3 days, cell numbers were slightly increased in TCDs compared to RWVs, but not to a statistically significant extent (Figure 2A). Moreover, expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) was higher in TCDs than in RWVs at 36 hours of culture (Figure 2B), suggesting that proliferative capacity of cultured primary hepatocytes may be higher in TCDs. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Primary hepatocytes cultured on TCDs have a slight growth advantage compared to those cultured in RWVs. (A) Cell numbers were enumerated by the Cyquant assay on day 3 of culture. The slight increases in cell numbers in TCD cultures compared to RWV were not statistically significant. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviation. (B) Expression of Pcna (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) in hepatocytes cultured on TCDs was significantly higher than in those cultured in RWV. Data are the average of 5 independent experiments. *p<0.005. Error bars represent standard error.3.2. Global gene expression profiles of hepatocytes cultured as 3D aggregates or as monolayers To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying improved hepatocyte functions in 3D aggregates, we analyzed the global gene expression of hepatocytes cultured as monolayers on TCDs and 3D aggregates in RWVs at 4 hours and 24 hours using microarrays. These early time-points were chosen to determine the initial gene expression profile of hepatocytes in TCD and RWV cultures. For each of the 5 conditions (freshly isolated hepatocytes, 4h TCD, 4h RWV, 24h TCD, and 24h RWV) we analyzed 3 independent biological samples from separate experiments to ensure experimental reproducibility and increase confidence in the microarray analysis. One-way ANOVA (with p < 0.01) generated a list of 16,893 genes that were significantly differentially expressed among the 5 experimental conditions. Principal component analysis demonstrated that experimental triplicates clustered together within each condition and separately from the other groups, indicating good reproducibility of the global gene expression patterns within each condition (Figure 3A). The 4h TCD samples clustered separately from the 4h RWV samples, showing that these culture conditions led to differential gene expression in as early as 4h of culture. The variance between TCD and RWV samples increased at 24h reflecting increased differences in gene expression. Figure 3.

Each symbol represents an independent sample from 3 independent experiments. (B) Hierarchical clustering of genes with 2-fold or greater expression difference between TCD and RWV culture conditions at either 4h or 24h. Each column represents the average expression values of 3 independent experiments. (C) Venn diagram that compares genes significantly upregulated by 2-fold or more in hepatocyte 3D aggregates compared to monolayers with genes significantly upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Numbers represent the number of genes either distinct in or shared by the 3 processes.Analysis was then focused on genes with significant differential expression between TCD and RWV by at least 2-fold at either time-point. The complete lists of genes upregulated in RWV or TCD cultures at 4 or 24 hours are detailed in Supplemental Tables 1–4. The resulting combined list of 822 differentially expressed genes was analyzed by hierarchical clustering on both gene expression and experimental condition (Figure 3B). Each condition was compared to freshly isolated hepatocytes as the baseline. Hierarchical clustering on experimental conditions revealed that hepatocytes cultured in RWVs for 24 hours still had a gene expression profile similar enough to freshly isolated hepatocytes to be linked under one main branch of the hierarchical dendrogram. In contrast, the gene expression profile of hepatocytes cultured for 24h in TCDs was significantly different from freshly isolated and 24h RWV hepatocytes that it grouped separately under its own branch of the hierarchical dendrogram. This analysis suggests that RWV culture preserved molecular features in hepatocytes that more closely resembled freshly isolated hepatocytes, whereas TCD culture induced molecular programs that drove hepatocytes further from their initial phenotype.3.3. Gene expression profile of 3D aggregate cultures compared to liver development and liver regeneration One hypothesis for the improved functional capacity of hepatocytes cultured in RWVs as compared to TCDs is that formation of 3D cellular interactions recapitulated in vivo-like molecular pathways. To test this hypothesis, we compared the genes significantly upregulated in RWV with genes differentially regulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Raw microarray datasets (accession number: GSE6998) of the developing mouse liver and the regenerating mouse liver after two-thirds hepatectomy were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and re-analyzed using the GC-RMA summarization algorithm [27]. Because the same microarray platform was used to generate the curated datasets, re-analyzed data could be directly compared to the microarray data generated in this study. Genes significantly upregulated at any time-point during liver development were identified by one-way ANOVA (p < 0.01) and filtered for genes expressed 2-fold or higher compared to unmanipulated adult mouse liver. Similarly, significantly upregulated genes in liver regeneration at any time-point after hepatectomy were identified using the same criteria. Finally, genes significantly upregulated by 2-fold or more in RWV as compared to TCD at either 4 or 24 hours of culture were identified. Differentially upregulated genes from these 3 processes were compared to determine whether they shared significant numbers of genes (Figure 3C). Most of the upregulated genes in these biological processes were uniquely upregulated in each process: 93% (4460 genes) of the upregulated genes in liver development, 73% (353 genes) in 3D aggregate/monolayer culture, and 52% (300 genes) in regeneration. Only 5 genes were shared by all 3 processes. These analyses reveal that 3D aggregate culture triggers different molecular pathways from liver development or regeneration to maintain hepatocyte-specific functions.3.4. Characterization of differential gene expression between 3D aggregate and monolayer cultures Gene Ontogeny (GO) analysis was performed to classify the 293 genes significantly upregulated by ≥2-fold in hepatocytes cultured in RWV compared to TCD at 24 hours. The most significant GO Biological Process terms encompassed characteristic hepatocyte functions such as lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, oxidation-reduction, response to glucose stimulus, and response to xenobiotic stimulus (Table 2). Table 2. Gene ontology analysis of significantly upregulated biological process terms in 3D aggregates as compared to monolayers at 24h of culture.

Bile acid co-enzyme A (Baat), which catalyzes the conjugation of bile acids to amino acids before excretion into bile canaliculi [28], was upregulated 23.3±2.5 fold in 3D aggregates compared to monolayers. Akr1c19, a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, which catalyzes conversion of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols [29], was upregulated 9.4±1.3 fold. The liver-specific isoform of glycogen synthase (Gys2), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of glycogen synthesis [30], was upregulated by 6.6±1.1 fold. Expression of factor VII (F7), a coagulation factor in the extrinsic pathway and important indicator of liver synthetic function [31], was 2.9±0.6 fold higher in RWV-cultured hepatocytes than in TCDs. Expression of Hfe2, which encodes the protein hemojuvelin involved in iron metabolism, was increased 11.4±1.7 fold in RWV compared to TCD cultures. Lastly, leptin receptor (Lepr), important in the regulation of lipid metabolism, was expressed 19.8±5.9 fold higher in RWV-cultured hepatocytes. Together, these data indicate that the most significant difference between TCD- and RWV-cultured hepatocytes is that diverse metabolic functions characteristic of hepatocytes were maintained at higher levels in 3D aggregates than in monolayers. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Metabolic and synthetic genes were upregulated in hepatocytes cultured as 3D aggregates in RWVs compared to monolayers in TCDs. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that expression levels of bile acid co-enzyme A (Baat), aldo-ketoreductase 1c19 (Akr1c19), glycogen synthase 2 (Gys2), factor VII (F7), hemochromatosis type 2 (Hfe2), and leptin receptor (Lepr) were significantly upregulated in RWV compared to TCD. Data are the average of 6 independent experiments. *p<0.005, **p<0.0001. Error bars indicate standard error.3.5. Promoter region analysis of genes upregulated in RWVs compared to TCDs To identify a unifying mechanism that may explain the improved expression of a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific genes in 3D aggregate culture, promoter region analysis was performed on the 293 genes upregulated in RWV at 24 hours to find over-represented transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Of the 293 genes, 261 were in the oPOSSUM database (http://www.cisreg.ca) and included in the analysis. Table 3 lists the top 10 over-represented TFBSs in genes significantly upregulated in RWV-cultured hepatocytes compared with a background gene set. TFBSs with a Z-score > 10 and Fisher score < 0.01 were empirically validated to identify functionally relevant transcription factors within a set of co-expressed genes [25]. Using these criteria, only the top 2 transcription factors, HNF4α (Hnf4a) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 1 (TFCOUP1), were identified as functionally important regulators of the genes upregulated in RWV-cultured hepatocytes. Remarkably, 52% of the analyzed genes (138 genes) contained Hnf4a TFBSs in their promoter regions. Hnf4a is known as a master regulator of hepatocyte-specific functions [32]. Interestingly, TFCOUP1 and Hnf4a binding motifs are highly related and TFCOUP1 has been shown to act as a negative regulator of Hnf4a transactivation [33]. These analyses suggest that Hnf4a is particularly important for maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in RWV-cultured hepatocytes. Table 3.

Expression of Hnf4a was significantly increased by 3.4±0.5 fold in RWV-cultured hepatocytes compared to TCD (Figure 5), whereas expression of Cebpa and Foxa2 did not differ significantly between culture types. CCAAT/enchancer-binding protein α (Cebpa) is a liver-enriched transcription factor known to regulate expression of numerous genes that support liver-specific functions [34]. Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) is a transcription factor critical for liver development [35], but dispensable for maintenance of mature hepatocyte functions [36]. Our findings suggest that Hnf4a is the principle promoter of hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Expression of Hnf4a was significantly increased in 3D aggregates in RWVs compared to monolayers in TCDs, as determined by qRT-PCR. Expression levels of Cebpa and Foxa2, two other liver-enriched transcription factors, were not significantly different between the two culture conditions. Data are the average of 6 independent experiments. *p<0.001. Error bars indicate standard error.3.6. Characterization of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal gene expression in monolayer cultures compared to 3D aggregate cultures In addition to being a direct transcriptional activator of many hepatocyte-specific functional genes, Hnf4a has also been shown to maintain hepatocyte differentiation by repressing expression of mesenchymal genes, including Snail (Snai1), a key inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [37]. In order to determine whether mesenchymal molecular pathways may be concomitantly suppressed in hepatocyte 3D aggregates, we measured expression of several important markers of EMT at 24h of culture in TCDs and RWVs, before potential overgrowth of contaminating non-parenchymal cells (<10% of the purified hepatocyte population, data not shown) may confound the results. Notably, Snail expression was significantly higher in TCD cultures by 2.7±0.6 fold at 24h as compared to RWV cultures. Vimentin (Vim), a cytoskeletal intermediate filament widely used as a marker of EMT [38], was expressed 6.6±1.3 fold higher in monolayer cultures compared to 3D aggregate cultures. Furthermore, expression of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (Loxl2), another inducer of EMT [39], was also significantly upregulated by 33.3±6.5 fold in TCDs compared to RWVs (Figure 6). Expression of E-cadherin (Cdh1) and N-cadherin (Cdh2), adhesion molecules characteristic of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, respectively, were not significantly different between TCD and RWV cultures (data not shown). Instead, several cytoskeletal genes not previously described in hepatocyte monolayer cultures were significantly upregulated in TCDs compared to RWVs. These included filamin A (Flna), an actin-binding protein that interacted with vimentin to regulate cell adhesion and spreading [40], whose expression was increased 3.7±0.4 fold in TCDs compared to RWVs. Expression of α1-actin (Acta1), an actin isoform expressed primarily in skeletal muscle [41], was greatly increased by 25.9±4.2 fold in monolayer cultures as compared to 3D aggregates. Finally, expression of β-tropomyosin (Tpm2), an isoform primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and fibroblasts [42], was also significantly increased by 6.9±1.5 fold in TCD-cultured hepatocytes (Figure 6). The significantly higher expression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in TCD as compared to RWV cultures at 24h suggests that these molecular pathways are induced in hepatocyte monolayers and suppressed in 3D aggregates. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes were upregulated in hepatocytes cultured as monolayers in TCDs compared to 3D aggregates in RWVs. qRT-PCR demonstrated that expression levels of Snail (Snai1), vimentin (Vim), lysyl oxidase-like 2 (Loxl2), filamin A (Flna), α1 actin (Acta1), and β-tropomyosin (Tpm2) were significantly upregulated in TCD compared to RWV at 24h of culture. Data are the average of 6 independent experiments. *p<0.05, **p<0.005, ***p<0.001. Error bars indicate standard error.4. Discussion In this study, we used global gene expression profiling and promoter region analyses to identify molecular differences between primary mouse hepatocytes cultured as monolayers on TCDs and as 3D aggregates generated in RWVs. Our results indicated that improved synthetic and metabolic functions in hepatocyte 3D aggregates reflected the upregulated expression of a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes compared to monolayer cultures. The pattern of differential gene expression was distinct from molecular pathways induced during hepatocyte differentiation in organogenesis or hepatocyte proliferation after two-thirds hepatectomy. Remarkably, TFBS analysis revealed that more than 50% of the genes upregulated in RWV cultures had Hnf4a binding sites in their promoter regions. Hnf4a binding sites were the most significantly over-represented TFBS in genes differentially upregulated in RWV cultures and expression of Hnf4a itself was significantly upregulated in 3D aggregates compared to monolayers. While cell-matrix interactions dominate in hepatocyte monolayers cultured on collagen-coated TCDs, 3D cell-cell interactions dominate within self-aggregated spheroids generated in RWVs. These findings suggest that 3D cell-cell interactions are important for sustained expression of Hnf4a, which in turn plays a key role in maintaining differentiated hepatocyte functions in 3D aggregates. Hnf4a (also known as Nr2a1) is a liver-enriched transcription factor and a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. It can activate gene transcription in the absence of exogenous ligand [43], though it has a hydrophobic binding pocket and linoleic acid may be a potential endogenous ligand [44]. Hnf4a is known to have essential roles in normal liver development, maintaining mature liver functions, and in inducing hepatic differentiation in stem cells and fibroblasts. Targeted disruption of Hnf4a in mice led to embryonic lethality due to failure to complete gastrulation [45]. Tetraploid complementation of Hnf4a−/− embryos demonstrated that Hnf4a was essential for hepatocyte differentiation during liver development [46]. Conditional knock-out of Hnf4a in fetal hepatocytes showed that Hnf4a was required for normal morphological and functional differentiation of hepatocytes and development of hepatic epithelium [47]. In addition to its critical role during liver development, Hnf4a is also required to maintain normal metabolic functions of mature hepatocytes. Conditional knock-out of Hnf4a in mature hepatocytes, generated by mating Hnf4aloxp/loxp mice with mice expressing Cre under the albumin promoter, showed that Hnf4a was an essential regulator of lipid homeostasis [48], bile acid metabolism [49], glucose metabolism [50], and xenobiotic metabolism [51]. Moreover, ectopic expression of Hnf4a is required for conversion of fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells that have mature hepatocyte functions, including the ability to reconstitute liver tissue after transplantation [52]. Over-expression of Hnf4a in human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell derived hepatoblasts was able to significantly improve the mature hepatocyte functions of differentiated cells [53]. Finally, genome-wide studies demonstrated that Hnf4a bound the promoters of liver-specific genes significantly more often than other liver-enriched transcription factors [54, 55], indicating that Hnf4a was one of the most important transcriptional master regulators of hepatocyte function. Our global gene expression and promoter region analyses indicate that Hnf4a also plays a central role in maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture. Three-dimensional culture has been shown to improve hepatocyte differentiated functions but the underlying mechanisms of how 3D culture induced these effects were previously unknown. Our data suggest that 3D cell-cell interactions are important for maintaining expression of the master regulator Hnf4a at a higher level compared to monolayer culture. Increased expression of Hnf4a in 3D culture in turn leads to sustained expression of a wide range of downstream hepatocyte-specific functional genes as well as improved overall metabolic function of the hepatocyte. Several gene targets correlating with mature hepatocyte functions significantly upregulated in RWVs are known direct targets of Hnf4a (e.g. Baat, F7, and Gys2) [47, 49, 56] or have Hnf4a binding sites within their promoter regions (e.g. Akr1c19) [57]. There are also functional genes highly upregulated in RWVs that do not possess Hnf4a TFBS (e.g. Hfe2 and Lepr) [57], suggesting that Hnf4a may have an indirect role in controlling expression of these genes or that other transcriptional networks may be involved. Nevertheless, our analyses reveal that Hnf4a is likely the major transcriptional effector for maintaining differentiated functions of hepatocytes in 3D culture. Conversely, one can consider the signals induced in monolayer cultures that may be repressed in 3D aggregates. Monolayer culture on TCD is a highly artificial environment in which cell-matrix interactions dominate and cells are spread against a stiff two-dimensional (2D) surface. Under these conditions, we found that hepatocytes significantly increased expression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes compared to 3D aggregate culture. Hepatocytes cultured on collagen-coated TCDs have been shown to undergo fibroblastoid dedifferentiation [58, 59] and express mesenchymal cell characteristics [60–62]. Our results suggest that this transition towards a mesenchymal phenotype may be inhibited in hepatocytes cultured in 3D. We showed that while hepatocytes acquired spindle-like projections after several days of culture on TCDs, they maintained a round shape in 3D aggregates. Several EMT inducers and mesenchymal cell markers (Snail, Vim, and Loxl2) were highly upregulated in TCDs as compared RWVs. In addition, expression levels of several cytoskeletal genes not previously described in monolayer culture (Acta1, Tpm2, and Flna) were also significantly increased in TCDs compared to RWVs. There is evidence that Hnf4a actively represses the mesenchymal program in hepatocytes in conjunction with maintaining hepatocyte-specific differentiated functions. Hnf4a was shown to bind to the Vim and Snail promoters in hepatocytes and to directly repress transcription of Snail. Silencing of Hnf4a was sufficient to upregulate expression of both Vim and Snail [37]. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Hnf4a induced the reverse mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) process in fibroblasts [47]. Therefore, one interpretation of our data is that stiff 2D matrix interactions in monolayer culture inhibited expression of Hnf4a that in turn led to decreased expression of hepatocyte functional genes as well as upregulation of EMT inducers that promoted mesenchymal transition. Mechanotransduction, in which cells biochemically integrate mechanical matrix and substrate cues of the micro-environment, is an important determinant of cell function and behavior [63]. Future investigation in our lab will further characterize the differential molecular signals in monolayer versus 3D aggregate culture that lead to inhibited or maintained expression of Hnf4a in hepatocytes. Our results demonstrating that 3D cell-cell interactions maintained expression of Hnf4a as a master regulator of hepatocyte functions and phenotype provide a foundation for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte function for in vitro and in vivo applications. Our findings suggest that biomaterials aimed to augment hepatocyte differentiated functions should maximize 3D cell-cell interactions and minimize stiff 2D substrate contacts. As self-aggregated hepatocyte spheroids may be considered biomaterials in their own right [22] and used in applications such as organ printing [23], our data inform how tissue engineering strategies utilizing hepatocyte spheroids may be optimized. Moreover, we show that 3D hepatocyte cultures would be advantageous for in vitro applications in which the differentiated state of hepatocytes is critical, such as drug toxicity studies. Along these lines, 3D aggregate cultures may also be effective in improving differentiation of hepatocyte-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which would be beneficial for efforts aimed at liver disease modeling in vitro.5. Conclusions Using global gene expression and promoter region analyses, we demonstrated that the master transcriptional regulator Hnf4a has a major role in maintaining differentiated hepatocyte functions in 3D culture. Concomitantly, expression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes induced in monolayer cultures were suppressed in 3D aggregates. These findings provide a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte-specific functions for in vitro and in vivo applications.Supplementary Material 01 MS544839-supplement-01.xlsx (182.9KB, xlsx) Acknowledgments This work was supported by the American College of Surgeons Resident Research Scholarship, the UCSF Liver Center Pilot/Feasibility Grant P30-DK026743, National Institutes of Health grant K08-DK093708 (to TTC), and in part by 5UH3-AG037628 (to MHF).

Spaceflight alters expression of microRNA during T-cell activation. Keywords: gene expression, microgravity, epigenetics, immune response Over 50% of the Apollo astronauts had bacterial or viral infections during flight or within 1 wk of landing (1). Apollo 7 marked humanity’s first experience with spaceflight infection when all 3 crew members contracted head colds during their mission. On Apollo 13, one astronaut contracted Pseudomonas aeruginosa and experienced intense chills and fever (1). P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that rarely causes disease unless the person is immunosuppressed. As a result, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) implemented a preflight quarantine program that subsequently reduced the number of reported infections to a single Apollo astronaut (1). To this day, the preflight quarantine program is still actively used in both the U.S. and Russian programs. Even with the precautions, astronauts working on Skylab (2), Shuttle (3, 4), International Space Station (ISS) (3), and Soyuz (5) showed changes in immune function and depressed lymphocyte activation compared to levels before spaceflight. Experiments from Skylab and Shuttle have confirmed that T cells have a suppressed immune response (in vivo and in vitro) with lower T-cell proliferation/activation, lower IL-2 synthesis and severely reduced IL-2-Rα expression (RNA and protein) (6–9). More recently, our ISS experiments proved that microgravity of spaceflight was a major cause of decrease of T-cell activation and altered gene expression in microgravity compared to onboard normal gravity controls (10). Immunosuppression during spaceflight may increase the risk of opportunistic infections. Shuttle astronauts on short duration (11 d) spaceflights had significant increases in early viral gene transcription of the Epstein-Barr virus compared to healthy controls, while astronauts on board the ISS for long-duration spaceflight (180 d) had latent and lytic viral gene expression that resembled activation patterns observed during infectious mononucleosis (3, 11). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were first discovered in 1993 in Caenorhabditis elegans when miRNA lin-4 was seen to down-regulate expression of the gene lin-14; however, there were no homologs to lin-4 in other species. The later discovery of miRNAs in other species, including humans, showed that miRNAs are common in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that key miRNAs are up-regulated after activation of human T cells (12). Here we present our discovery of dysregulation of miRNA gene expression by gravity during early T-cell activation in spaceflight. We recently proved that the lack of immune response in microgravity occurs at the cellular level (10) and identified promoter regions, transcription factors, and signal transduction pathways regulating human T-cell gene activation under normal and altered gravity conditions (10, 13, 14). To our knowledge, this is the first time that miRNAs have been analyzed using an onboard normal gravity control centrifuge eliminating possible confounders such as launch effects, cosmic radiation, and vibration, leaving only gravity conditions as a variable. Our data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell gene expression by 2 separate mechanisms during immune activation. Additionally, our finding that several miR-21 targets are co-up-regulated with miR-21 during early activation suggests that miR-21 may be involved in a previously unrecognized autoregulatory loop that limits the duration of normal T-cell activation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Flight mission profile Whole peripheral blood was obtained from 4 human donors between the ages of 21 and 55 years. All were in good health, and none was taking medication at the time of donation; no personal health identifiers were recorded. This study was reviewed and approved by the University of California, San Francisco, Committee on Human Research. Red blood cells were lysed and peripheral blood leukocytes isolated using Ficoll gradients. Human T cells were further purified using enrichment columns per manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), which isolate CD3+ T cells to 90% or greater purity. Human T cells were resuspended into RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and loaded at 6 × 106 cells per chamber into the spaceflight hardware, Lycis. The spaceflight hardware consisted of 8 cassettes, each with 4 chambers. Some units had smart-button temperature data storage capability, and temperatures of the containers were tracked for the duration of the mission. Purified T cells from each donor were kept separate and loaded into 4 individual chambers in separate cassettes for the following treatments: microgravity nonactivated, microgravity activated, 0.5 g activated, and normal gravity activated. Units were loaded and handed over to the Russian team 14 h before launch and were stored in insulated pouches. The experimental units were launched into space on board the Soyuz 13S rocket from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on September 18, 2006. Before the in-flight experimental procedures, cassettes were kept in ambient temperatures, which ranged from 16 to 22°C. Cassettes were transferred to the ISS immediately after docking of the Soyuz vehicle on September 20 (flight day 3) and placed into the Kubik incubator centrifuge at 36.5°C. All samples were preincubated at 36.5°C for 30 min. The normal gravity and 0.5 g units were placed in the central centrifuge positions and centrifuged with an applied normal gravity or 0.5 g force, respectively. The microgravity units were placed in static positions for continued microgravity exposure. After 30 min of preincubation, microgravity-nonactivated units were fixed by addition of RNALater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), removed from the incubator, and stored at 4°C. The microgravity-, 0.5 g-, and normal gravity-activated units were activated with a final concentration of 10 μg/ml Con A and 4 μg/ml anti-CD28. These cassettes were replaced into Kubik on either the centrifuge or static positions and activated for 1.5 h. Activation was stopped with the addition of RNALater, and the units were then moved to 4°C storage. All units were returned to earth on board the Soyuz 12S vehicle on September 28. After landing on September 29, samples were kept at 4°C and handed over to the PI team at the Moscow airport on September 30. Frozen samples were transported to the investigators’ laboratory in San Francisco for analysisRNA isolation RNA was isolated by the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The samples were then stored at −80°C until further analysis. Isolated RNA from spaceflight samples were all of high quality. Although only a limited amount of small RNA was recovered with this method, there was an abundant amount of miR-21 that could be detected by gene array and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).Microarray sample preparation and analysis Three of the 4 human volunteer samples of high RNA quality, as determined by the 260 nm/280 nm values (range, 1.8–2.0, with the majority of samples at 2.0), were chosen for microarray hybridization. RNA was amplified and biotinylated using the MessageAmp II-Biotin enhanced kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). A total of 10 μg of biotinylated aRNA was hybridized on to the Human U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) through the University of California, San Francisco, Gladstone Institute Genomics Core. MIAME (minimum information about a microarray experiment)-compliant microarray data can be found under the accession number GSE38836 and are posted online (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE38836).Microarray analysis Microarray data were analyzed by GeneSpring GX 13.0 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Data were normalized using the GC-RMA algorithm, and baseline normalization was set to the average level of expression in microgravity-nonactivated T cells. Low signal probes (below 20%) were filtered to remove background noise, and statistical analysis was performed using 1-way ANOVA and the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction with a P value of ≤0.05. Post hoc Tukey analysis was performed to identify 85 genes with significant differences in regulation between the normal gravity- and microgravity-activated samples. Genes were filtered for fold change that was 2-fold or greater between the normal gravity- and microgravity-activated samples. MiRNA target gene clustering analysis was performed in GeneSpring GX 13.0 software using Pearson’s centered metric with centroid linkage.Gene targets of miR-21 Predicted gene targets for miR-21 were found using TargetScan 6.2 (15). Targets with a context+ score of −0.10 or less were considered. Experimentally confirmed miRNA targets for miR-21 were identified using DIANA-TarBase v.7.0, a manually curated database (16). miRNA targets from these databases were compared with the list of 85 genes differentially regulated in gravity conditions to identify 16 genes that had predicted and/or confirmed miR-21 target sites in the 3′-UTR region. FASLG, a predicted gene target of miR-21, passed a significance cutoff at P ≤ 0.06 but not P ≤ 0.05 and was included in further analysis because of its well-established role in T-cell signaling and function.qRT-PCR Details of qRT-PCR methods have been previously published (10). At the end of the amplification period, melting curve analysis was performed to confirm the specificity of the amplicon. RNA samples were normalized to cyclophilin A (CPHI), also known as kinase C peptidyl prolyl isomerase A (PPIA), as a internal standard. PPIA expression is stable between normal gravity and microgravity conditions. Relative quantification of gene expression was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt equation. All data derived using qRT-PCR were from independent donor biologic samples (n = 4).miRNA reverse transcription miR-21 miRNA was detected and quantified using the mirVana qRT-PCR miRNA detection kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA (100 ng) was added to 10 μl reverse transcription (RT) reaction buffer containing mirVana RT buffer, mirVana RT primer (mir21 or 5S internal standard), and ArrayScript enzyme mix. The RT reaction was incubated at 37°C for 10 min, then 95°C for 10 min to inactivate. A no-template control was also performed for each primer set. For miRNA qRT-PCR, cDNA from the RT reaction (10 μl) was added to a total of 25 μl qRT-PCR mixture containing 5 μl of 5× SYBR Green mirVana PCR buffer, 0.5 μl of 50× ROX, 0.5 μl mirVana PCR primers (miR21 or 5S internal standard), and 1 U of SuperTaq polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCRs were carried out in a Bio-Rad MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The thermal profile was 50°C for 2 min, denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95°C for 15 s and at 60°C for 30 s. Fluorescence was measured and used for quantitative purposes. At the end of the amplification period, melting curve analysis was performed to confirm the specificity of the amplicon. RNA samples were normalized to 5S rRNA internal standard, which was stable under all gravity conditions. Relative quantification of gene expression is calculated by using the 2−(Ct gene T – Ct 5S T) − (Ct gene MA – Ct 5S MA) equation, where threshold cycle (Ct) gene T represents the calculated Ct of a time point of each sample other than microgravity activated (MA). All data derived by qRT-PCR were from independent biologic samples (n = 4–8).RESULTS miR-21 is dysregulated in true ISS microgravity during T-cell activation Using bioinformatics, we analyzed the gene expression T-cell activation of 3 individual human donors under normal gravity on board, and microgravity conditions that were incubated, activated, and fixed on the ISS. In our initial bioinformatics analysis, we found that there was 1 miRNA that had reduced gene expression in true microgravity; in normal gravity, miR-21 was increased 2-fold, while in microgravity miR-21 was not significantly changed compared to onboard normal gravity controls (n = 4). This gene array analysis was confirmed by mirVana qRT-PCR. Expression was corrected to internal standard 5S rRNA. A small amount of mRNA from 0.5 g onboard samples (n = 4) was available for analysis. With a 0.5 g fractional gravity, the expression of miR-21 was increased over the microgravity sample.Analysis of mRNA gene arrays for significantly dysregulated microgravity genes Global microarray analysis revealed significant suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions compared to gene up-regulation in onboard normal gravity-activated samples. We analyzed the altered gene expression of activated T cells in microgravity using software showing either proven miR-21 interaction (TarBase), predicted seed sequences (TargetScan), or both. Table 1 provides an abbreviated list of 13 key target genes that significantly changed gene expression within 1.5 h after activation in spaceflight. TABLE 1.

Potential hsa-miR-21-5p target genes shown have differentially regulated between normal gravity and microgravity conditions. T cells from 3 independent donors were flown in space and activated with concanavalin A/anti-CD28 in microgravity or in normal gravity. Genes that had altered expression between microgravity and normal gravity were identified by 1-way ANOVA (≤0.05) with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction and post hoc Tukey test. FASLG was not quite significant at P ≤ 0.05 but was significant at P ≤ 0.06 and thus is included in the list. Potential hsa-miRNA-21-5p targets were identified using TargetScan (predicted miRNA targets) and TarBase (confirmed miRNA–gene interactions).Of the 85 gravity-sensitive genes, 17 were defined as miR-21 targets. Of these, 13 were immune-related miR-21 target genes, including EGR3, CD69, FASLG, SPRY1, BTG2, SPRY2, and TAGAP. All the immune-related targets were biologically confirmed. We further confirmed via gene array analysis using qRT-PCR that FASLG, SPRY2, BTG2, and TAGAP gene expression was gravity sensitive.Heat map of gene expression Seventeen significant gene targets of miR-21 from flown individual donors (n = 3) were differentially regulated after 1.5 h of activation under normal gravity and microgravity conditions on board the ISS (P ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 1). Samples were incubated and activated in the same incubator and fixed on board the ISS. In some cases, the gene array contained multiple gene probe sets targeted to different regions of the gene. Here we saw multiple probe sets for FASLG, TAGAP, and EGR1 showing the same trends of significant inhibition of gene expression under different gravities. The activation profile in the normal gravity-activated samples is fairly uniform across donors, indicating that common genes and pathways were stimulated in all 3 donors after activation with concanavalin A/anti-CD28. Gene expression in the microgravity flown samples was lower and less uniform than the activated normal gravity samples. In some cases, the microgravity profile was essentially the same as the nonactivated samples, indicating suppression of gene expression in all 3 donors. The 3 conditions had distinct profiles across the 17 predicted miR-21 gene targets, demonstrating clear differences in early activation gene expression between the onboard normal gravity-activated, microgravity-activated, and nontreated controls. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Heat map of predicted miR-21 target genes showing differentially regulated 1.5 h after T-cell activation in microgravity (μg) and normal gravity (1g). Genes were grouped based on expression profile using Pearson's centered metric with centroid linkage. Rows represent gene probes; columns represent expression profiles of donors. Heat map scale ranges from green (down-regulation) to red (up-regulation) for log2 normalized expression values. Blue-labeled columns are normal gravity-activated samples, red-labeled columns are microgravity-activated samples, and yellow-labeled columns are microgravity-nonactivated T cells. A total of 17 unique miR-21 gene targets are shown with differential expression between normal gravity and microgravity condition (P ≤ 0.05; FASLG P ≤ 0.06). There is considerable variability between donors in nonactivated samples and some variability in microgravity-activated donors. Gene expression in normal gravity-activated samples becomes considerably more uniform 1.5 h after activation.qRT-PCR of immediate early genes in nonactivated, normal gravity onboard activated, and onboard microgravity-activated T cells with 3′-UTR miR-21 seed sequences We used qRT-PCR to analyze miR-21 targets BTG2, TAGAP, SPRY2, and FASLG in these ISS samples that were activated and fixed in orbit. These genes were selected because they contained the seed sequence in the 3′-UTR region. In addition, 4 genes (BTG2, TAGAP, SPRY2, and FASLG) had previously been confirmed to have interaction with miR-21. We also analyzed nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell inhibitor α (NFKBIA) and CD40 ligand (CD40LG), 2 genes that are key in early T-cell activation. All 6 genes exhibit gravity-sensitive gene expression. It is notable that many of the miR-21 targets are co-up-regulated with miR-21 during the early hours of T-cell activation.Predictions of transcription factor locations in promoter regions of gravity-sensitive genes We used bioinformatics software, the Match program of TRANSFAC Pro, oPOSSUM, target genes to predict transcription factor locations in the promoter regions of gravity-sensitive mRNA. Key immune genes share common transcription factors with miR-21, showing that at the initiation of activation, both the positive immune genes share increased gene expression with the miR-21 precursor pre-miR-21 (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Promoter regions of IL-1, IL-2-Rα, Premir-21, TAGAP, SPRY2, and FASLG are induced by AP1 and/or NF-κB-1α; 2 of transcription factors in early gene expression (these 2 transcription factors are found in promoter region of nearly 40% of T-cell early induced genes).DISCUSSION miRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression and play fundamental roles in regulating immune response and autoimmunity (17). In the data presented here, we show for the first time an altered profile of miRNA expression under true microgravity compared to its onboard normal gravity controls; all samples were isolated from donors on earth, incubated, activated, and fixed in ISS on-orbit operations. The miR-21 differential expression seen in the global gene analysis was confirmed by mirVana qRT-PCR (Fig. 3). Of interest, samples from onboard 0.5 g samples demonstrated that fractional gravity is capable of restoring gene expression of miR-21. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Real-time confirmation of miR-21 down-regulation of gene expression in CD4+ T cells flown on ISS. Cells were placed in microgravity (μg), 0.5g, or normal gravity (1g) for 3 h before activation. At 1.5 h after activation with concanavalin A/anti-CD28, RNA was stabilized in RNALater. Total RNA was isolated, and miR-21 expression was quantified using mirVana miRNA detection kit. Expression was corrected to internal standard 5S rRNA. Bars represent mean ± sd of independent biologic replicates (n = 6). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.001 with 2-tailed Student t test against activated microgravity samples (μg Act).Previous in vitro studies by our laboratory using an onboard normal gravity control (10) demonstrated that T-cell activation was suppressed in microgravity, independent of other systemic factors. Several studies have also demonstrated that immunosuppression occurs in vivo during spaceflight in humans (1–4) and mice (18). The direct effects of microgravity on early T-cell activation described here eliminates confounding systemic effects and shows that the immune system needs gravity to function normally. Global gene analysis of the ISS samples revealed altered gene expression in spaceflight vs. normal gravity onboard controls 1.5 h after activation, showing changes in 85 genes associated with T-cell activation. Of the 85 differentially expressed genes, 17 were computationally predicted or experimentally verified as miR-21 target genes. Table 1 provides an abbreviated list of 13 T-cell-relevant targets that are predicted miR-21 targets from the miR-21 seed sequence (UAGCUUAU) in the gene by TargetScan. Of the 17 predicted genes, EGR1, FASLG, SPRY2, BTG2, REL, and MYC have been biologically confirmed by others as true targets as described in the TarBase database. We confirmed the global gene array analysis of several of the target genes using qRT-PCR analysis. We have previously confirmed microgravity-mediated suppression of IL-2, IL-2-RA, EGR1, and INF-γ gene expression in the immune response (10, 13, 14, 18). Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed that microgravity-induced down-regulation of 4 of the miR-21 target genes, BTG2, TAGAP, SPRY2, and FASLG, as well as immune regulators NFKBIA and CD40LG genes (Fig. 4). We chose BTG2, TAGAP, and SPRY2 for qRT-PCR analysis because they had been previously shown to biologically interact with miR-21. BTG2 is a known factor in T-cell activation and supports proliferation in immune cells (19). Other genes important in immune function, such as NFKBIA and CD40LG, were selected because of their importance in early T-cell activation. CD40LG is a marker of T-cell activation, and here we found that as early as 1.5 h of activation, it is induced in T cells that were normal gravity activated and was inhibited in microgravity-activated cells. NF-κB-1A binds to REL, RELA, or RELB to form the NF-κB complex. NF-κB-1A is associated with cells that express chemokines or cytokines. TAGAP is a member of the rho GTPase activator protein superfamily, and TAGAP loci have been associated with immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (20–22) and multiple sclerosis (23, 24). SPRY2 protein down-regulation by miR-21 inhibits proliferation, and when SPRY2 is overexpressed, it can increase proliferation of HEK293T cells (25, 26). Binding of FASLG (TNFSF6) to FAS results in cell apoptosis and cell death. FAS ligand is known to be expressed in activated splenocytes and may be part of an innate mechanism to limit the duration of cell activation. Figure 4. Open in a new tab qRT-PCR of genes selected from gene array analysis in nonactivated and concanavalin A/anti-CD28 activated human lymphocytes in flown normal gravity-activated and flown microgravity conditions indicating altered gene expression in ISS spaceflight vs. normal gravity onboard controls (1.5 h). We used qRT-PCR to analyze mir-21 targets BTG2, TAGAP, SPRY2, and FASLG in ISS samples that were activated and fixed in orbit. NFKBIA and CD40LG were also analyzed because they are important in T-cell activation.These data show that as early as 1.5 h after T-cell activation, key immune genes are induced in an ISS normal gravity environment and are suppressed in microgravity. It is notable that several of the miR-21 targets are initially up-regulated in T-cell activation, and it is possible that as miR-21 levels rise in the cell, this miRNA will cause a reduction in the protein synthesis of these targets and may be another mechanism to limit the time of T-cell activation. In this laboratory’s previous work on activation of T cells, gel shift analysis revealed that the activator protein 1 (AP1) transcriptional factor was activated by protein kinase A and was blocked by a MAPK inhibitor, U016, with AP1 being a key player in T-cell activation (13) (Fig. 5). AP1 is a transcription factor site composed of Fos and Jun family proteins. AP1 is also the key regulator of miR-21 gene induction; Fujita et al. (27) demonstrated that miR-21 is regulated by AP1 after phorbol treatment. Moreover, studies by Talotta et al. (28) demonstrated that RAS activation of miR-21 is regulated by the AP1 proteins. The promoter region analysis of key immune regulatory genes, including the precursor to miR-21, pre-miR-21, is shown in Fig. 2. The early activation of T cells and the gene induction of miR-21 and 4 of its functional/computational targets share common pathway or pathways of up-regulation by AP1 and NF-κB. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Postulated actions of miR-21 and gene expression of early T-cell activation. Hypothesized pathways of expression and down-regulation. miR-21 is known to down-regulate AP1 (28), and from presence of its seed sequence in 3′-UTR of target genes miR-21 is predicted to down-regulate 4 targets approximately 24 h after activation; BTG2, TAGAP, SPRY2, and FASLG as miR-21 expression increases. It is possible that miR-21 provides a mechanism of self-limited induction regulating T-cell activation.Taken together, the early activation of T cells and the gene induction of miR-21 precursor and 4 of its computational targets share common pathways of up-regulation. Therefore, we hypothesize that in early regulation, T-cell activation–induced gene expression is regulated by AP1 and later by protein kinase C. As miR-21 accumulates in the cell in the days after initial activation, it most likely will inhibit translation of miR-21 targets such as BTG2, TAGAP, SPRY2, and FASLG. Our previous experiments have demonstrated that AP1 and NF-κB account for 37% of all significant induction of gene expression 4 h after T-cell activation (13). Figure 5 shows our hypothetical pathway of miR-21 regulation of T-cell activation, illustrating our theory that the pathways that are responsible for early T-cell activation are NF-κB and AP1. This illustration was deduced from prior work (13, 14) and from Figs. 1, 3, 4. We have previously shown that REL, IL-2, IL-2-RA, and INF-γ are increased during normal gravity activation, and expression is repressed in microgravity (10, 13, 14, 18). Here we present evidence that early activation genes and miR-21 gene expression have increased gene expression during the early hours of T-cell activation. Extensive analysis of the promoter regions seen in Fig. 2 shows that the genes in question share common transcription elements in promoter regions of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-2-RA, BTG2, TAGAP, SPRY2, FASLG, and miR-21 precursor. We were left with the question of why the miR-21 target genes and miR-21 itself are co-up-regulated the start of T-cell activation. These opposing actions are analogous to pressing the gas pedal while stepping on the brake; however, it takes days for the repressive miR-21 to build up in a cell before blocking translation (29–31). This provides a plausible mechanism for suppression of T-cell activation to limit the immune response. Our results and hypothesis are in line with the findings of Fujita et al. (27) showing increased expression of miR-21 by AP1. Moreover, Carissimi et al. (32) showed that miR-21 is up-regulated by T-cell receptor activation and that miR-21 reaches peak production at 3 d. In addition, they showed that overexpression of miR-21 in Jurkat cells causes a suppression of T-cell receptor signaling, and they surmised that miR-21 caused suppression of activation downstream of T-cell receptor signal (32), although they were unable to find the mechanism. In mice, miR-21 is a known limiting factor of immune response (33). Here we present evidence that the downstream miR-21 targets BTG2, SPRY2, TAGAP, and FASLG may be among the targets regulating suppression. Together, these microgravity experiments support our hypothesized mechanism for miR-21 translational repression of key immune genes. This previously unknown mechanism controlling the immune response has been termed self-limiting induction. This mechanism may apply to other growth induction that is normally self-limiting, such as wound healing. It is possible that in some tissues, dysfunction of this type of mechanism could lead to uncontrolled growth and result in cancer.Acknowledgments This work was supported by a U.S. Veterans Affairs Biomedical Laboratory Research and Development Merit Review award to M.H.F., U.S. NASA Award NCC2-1361, NASA Award NNX09AH21G, CASIS, and primarily by U.S. National Institutes of Health National Institute on Aging Grant 5UH3AG037628.Glossary AP1 activator protein 1 CD40LG CD40 ligand CPHI cyclophilin A aka peptidyl prolyl isomerase A (PPIA) Ct threshold cycle ISS International Space Station miRNA microRNA NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration NFKBIA nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell inhibitor α PPIA peptidyl prolyl isomerase A qRT-PCR quantitative real-time PCR RT reverse transcription REFERENCES 1.Hawkins W., Zieglschmid J.

M., Hughes-Fulford, M. Spaceflight impairs antigen-specific tolerance induction in vivo and increases inflammatory cytokines. Keywords: inflammation, microgravity, T-cell memory, T-cell tolerance, transgenic model Immune dysregulation in microgravity, defined as 10−3 to 10−6 of normal gravity near Earth’s surface (1g), is predicted to be a significant challenge to human health during long-term space travel and habitation (1, 2). Evidence indicates that dysregulated CD4 T-cell–mediated immunity is a major mechanism of spaceflight-associated immune dysfunction. The response of T cells isolated from humans postflight to phytohemagglutinin mitogen stimulation was significantly reduced compared with preflight (3). Importantly, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions mediated by CD4 T cells were significantly reduced in astronauts when antigenic challenge was administered during flight compared with preflight (4). Spaceflight in vitro studies showed that microgravity directly disrupted T-cell activation independently of systemic factors such as the stress response. Cultures of leukocytes isolated from human peripheral blood that were stimulated during spaceflight with the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (ConA) demonstrated profoundly suppressed T-cell proliferation compared with ground control animals (5). T cells activated with either anti-CD3 alone or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 demonstrated significantly decreased surface expression of CD25 (high-affinity IL-2 receptor or IL-2Rα) in microgravity comparison to 1g-centrifuge controls in flight (6). Expression of IL-2, CD25, and numerous cytokines and chemokines were significantly decreased in T cells activated with ConA in ground-based simulated microgravity compared with 1g (7–9). In addition, differential expression analysis of immediate early genes revealed that Rel/NF-κB signal transduction was likely a major pathway affected by microgravity in T-cell activation compared with 1g-centrifuge controls in flight (10). These findings indicated that spaceflight altered CD4 T-cell responses independently of the systemic stress response and that microgravity inhibited T-cell activation by mitogens at the cellular level. What remained unknown after these studies was what would happen to humans exposed to infectious agents during long-term spaceflight, such as on a voyage to Mars, or if stationed for a prolonged period on an outpost in space. Critical to answering this question was to determine the effect of spaceflight on the response of CD4 T cells to cognate peptide–major histocompatibility complex stimulation in vivo. Although it is possible that human space travelers may encounter novel extraterrestrial microbes, a more likely scenario is that they would continue to contend with hitchhiking Earth-derived microorganisms to which there was immunologic experience and established immune memory. Earth-derived bacteria, fungi, and viruses are brought into space through normal human skin, oral, and gastrointestinal flora. Studies have shown that numerous species of common Earth bacteria and fungi could be cultured from the environment of the Mir and International Space Stations and that the degree of microbial contamination increased with time (11, 12). In addition, latent viral infections have been shown to reactivate in astronauts during spaceflight (13). Memory CD4 T-cell responses to these bacteria, fungi, and viruses may be altered during spaceflight because normal T-cell activation is inhibited by microgravity. An easily treatable infection on Earth may have serious consequences if acquired in space because of the associated immune dysregulation. In order to test and track a physiologic antigen-specific response in vivo during the course of spaceflight, we used the well-vetted adoptive transfer model of T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells in mice (14). In our chosen experimental system, small numbers of T cells from CD45.2-expressing OT-II transgenic mice, in which almost all T cells expressed a single TCR specific to ovalbumin (OVA) peptide 323-339 (15), were transferred into congenic CD45.1 C57BL/6 mice with a normal immune repertoire. Memory CD4 T cells have been shown to rapidly generate from effector CD4 T cells after in vitro activation (16, 17). Therefore, we first activated OT-II transgenic T cells with OVA peptide in vitro and then adoptively transferred them into recipients just before launch in order to test the development and maintenance of CD4 T-cell memory during spaceflight. Experimental mice were rechallenged in vivo during spaceflight with OVA peptide in an inflammatory adjuvant to determine the likely outcome of a memory CD4 T-cell response to infection. The OVA-specific memory CD4 T-cell response was specifically tracked using the congenic surface marker CD45.2 expressed on transferred OT-II T cells. As a result of limitations of the spaceflight hardware and crew time availability, our experiment was designed to be self-contained and internally delivered the dose protocol during the 15 d flight mission on Space Transport System (STS)-131 without requirement of astronaut time. Antigen delivery to recipient mice during spaceflight was achieved through minipumps preloaded with treatment and surgically implanted subcutaneously into mice before flight. The minipumps delivered 2 burst-releases of antigen several days into the flight mission in order to test the immune system after mice have acclimatized to spaceflight and a few days of in vivo quiescence in the absence of antigen. OVA peptide was delivered mixed with the inflammatory adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), in order to simulate the context of an infection in vivo. MPLA is a low-toxicity derivative of LPS, a component of the cell membranes of gram-negative bacteria. MPLA has been used successfully as an adjuvant in vaccines instead of LPS because, like LPS, it is a TLR4 agonist (18). The reduced toxicity of MPLA is related to reduced potency at producing inflammation compared with LPS. Because infectious pathogens and toxic materials like LPS were not allowed on flight missions, use of MPLA as an adjuvant was the best choice to test the CD4 T-cell memory response to infection in vivo during spaceflight. Our experimental design examined 4 groups of mice in order to comprehensively characterize the effect of spaceflight on the antigen-specific CD4 T-cell response in vivo using the internal in situ delivery of adjuvant/antigen: ground mice stimulated with MPLA alone (ground control), ground mice stimulated with MPLA plus OVA peptide (ground OVA), flight mice stimulated with MPLA alone (flight control), and flight mice stimulated with MPLA plus OVA peptide (flight OVA). Unexpectedly, we found that our experimental protocol led to impaired tolerance induction in mice that received OVA challenge during spaceflight. Although not the original intention of the experimental design, these results allowed us to discover a unique effect of spaceflight on in vivo tolerance induction. This study is the first detailed analysis of an antigen-specific immune response upon antigenic challenge in the mouse during the course of spaceflight. The findings are an important advance in our understanding of the potential impact of spaceflight immune dysregulation on human space travelers and provide additional insight on the mechanisms of immune tolerance here on Earth. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice Female wild-type, CD45.1 congenic (B6.SJL-PtprcaPepcb/BoyJ), and OT-II C57BL/6 mice [B6.Cg-Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J] were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and transferred directly to the Kennedy Space Center Space Life Sciences Laboratory specific-pathogen-free animal care facility at least 30 d before the flight experiment. Six- to 8-wk-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used as sources of antigen-presenting cells and OT-II mice as sources of transgenic OT-II T cells. CD45.1 congenic mice >18 wk old at the time of launch and between 22 and 24 g in weight were used as recipient animals. Three weeks before launch, CD45.1 mice were acclimated to the modified water delivery Lixit that mimicked those they would use during spaceflight and placed on a diet of U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Rodent Foodbars in preparation for flight conditions. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the NASA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Flight hardware Through the duration of the spaceflight experiment, flight and ground mice were housed in animal enclosure modules (AEMs) (19). The AEM is a self-contained enclosed rodent habitat that provided ventilation at a rate of 14 ft3/min, 12 h light/dark lighting cycle, and waste collection through an exhaust filter. Each AEM housed 7–8 mice and conformed to the housing space guidelines in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. During the experiment, rodents were periodically observed through the clear plastic cover, but there was no access availability to the crew.Preparation and adoptive transfer of OT-II memory cells CD4 T cells were purified from the spleens of naive OT-II mice using magnetic Dynabead negative isolation per the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Purified OT-II CD4 T cells were combined with mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)-treated splenocytes from wild-type C57BL/6 mice as antigen-presenting cells at a ratio of 1:2.5 to a final cell density of 8 × 106 cell/ml. Cells were cultured in complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% l-glutamine (Mediatech, Manassas, VA, USA), 1% antibiotics/antimycotic (Mediatech), 1% sodium pyruvate (Hyclone), and 1.2% 1 M HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich). To generate activated OT-II effector T cells, cultures were stimulated with 20 μg/ml OVA peptide and 30 U/ml of recombinant mouse IL-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). After 2 or 3 d of culture, medium was exchanged with fresh complete medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml OVA peptide and 15 U/ml IL-2. Cells were collected on d 4 of culture, washed, and resuspended in PBS for adoptive transfer. Five million cells per mouse were adoptively transferred into CD45.1 congenic mice by intravenous tail-vein injection.Antigen and adjuvant delivery by subcutaneous minipump Alzet osmotic minipumps (model 2002, 3 cm length, 0.7 cm diameter; Durect, Cupertino, CA, USA) with a reservoir volume of 200 μl and release rate of 0.5 μl/h over 2 wk were modified with a coiled external polyethylene catheter (PE-60; Durect) to deliver 200 μg OVA 323-339 peptide (Anaspec, San Jose, CA, USA) with 30 μg MPLA (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) or 30 μg MPLA alone in 2 separate timed burst-releases. MPLA was initially dissolved in cyclodextran and then combined 1:1 with OVA peptide dissolved in ddH2O to final concentration. In mice that received MPLA alone, MPLA in cyclodextran was combined 1:1 with ddH2O. Timed burst-release of antigen/adjuvant was achieved by filling the catheter with saline spacers that were separated from the antigen/adjuvant solution by mineral oil to prevent mixing and dilution. The antigen/adjuvant mixture was delivered in 10 μl over 20 h of release time on flight d 6 and 10 so that mice had time to acclimatize to spaceflight and transferred OT-II cells had time to develop into memory CD4 T cells before being restimulated with antigen in vivo (Fig. 1A). The combined volume of the loaded solutions (including saline, mineral oil, and antigen/adjuvant mixture) was 167 μl, which required 36.6 cm of catheter and was released over 334 h (14 d). The minipumps were sterilely prepared by first weighing and filling the pumps with saline per the manufacturer’s instructions. The coiled catheter was separately filled with saline, mineral oil, and the antigen/adjuvant mixture sequentially using gel loading tips. The distal delivery end of the catheter was attached to the flow modulator of the minipump. The pumps were then primed by submersion in a beaker of sterile saline overnight at 37°C with the catheter extended outside of the saline. Immediately before implantation, the filled coiled catheter was pushed over the body of the pump to reduce to overall size of the implant. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Experimental design. A) Schematic of minipump modified with catheter extension used to deliver antigen in vivo. B) Timeline of experimental procedures. Procedural events for flight cohort are shown above timeline and events for ground cohort below timeline. C) Experimental groups. Four experimental groups and corresponding sample sizes are represented.For implantation, CD45.1 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Using aseptic technique, a small 1 cm transverse incision was made on the upper back of mice, and a subcutaneous pocket just large enough for the pump was developed by dissection. Prepared minipumps were placed into the subcutaneous pocket with the catheter opening toward the neck of the mice. The incision was closed with several interrupted permanent sutures. The mice were then treated with buprenorphine for pain relief and allowed to recover.Experiment procedural timeline Mice intended for the flight cohort were implanted with minipumps 3 d before the launch of STS-131 Space Shuttle Discovery on April 5, 2010 (Fig. 1B). Activated OT-II cells were adoptively transferred into these mice 1 d later. Mice were placed into the AEM and integrated into the space shuttle 24 h before launch. Flight AEMs remained in the middeck of the space shuttle for the duration of spaceflight. After a 15 d mission, STS-131 landed back in Kennedy Space Center on April 20, 2010. Mice were received by the science team 2 h after landing, and tissue dissection began immediately. Cell suspensions from cervical lymph nodes and spleens were made and stained immediately for flow cytometry analysis. Splenocytes were also restimulated in vitro for 3 d for additional analysis. To minimize environmental factors other than spaceflight that may affect the immune response, ground mice were housed in identical AEM flight hardware within an orbital environment simulator that mimicked the temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration of the space shuttle middeck. To accomplish this simulation and to accommodate for potential changes in the flight plan, synchronous ground cohort mice were generated 48 h after flight mice were launched into space per standard NASA protocol. A separate fresh preparation of memory OT-II T cells was used in the adoptive transfer of ground mice. All postflight analyses, including staining for flow cytometry, were also performed synchronously 48 h later for the ground cohort compared with flight mice. All reagents and protocols were kept identical between flight and ground mice to minimize variability. For flow cytometry, although cells from flight and ground mice were stained on different days, flow cytometer analysis was performed on the same day using the same acquisition settings to minimize variability.Experimental groups and power analysis Ground and flight mice were either implanted with minipumps containing MPLA alone or with minipumps containing OVA peptide and MPLA. Therefore, a total of 4 experimental groups were generated: ground mice stimulated with MPLA alone (ground control), ground mice stimulated with MPLA plus OVA peptide (ground OVA), flight mice stimulated with MPLA alone (flight control), and flight mice stimulated with MPLA plus OVA peptide (flight OVA) (Fig. 1C). The sample size of each group was 4 in order to detect a 30% difference between groups with a 20% sd, α of 0.05, and power of 0.85. Just before integration with the space shuttle, one mouse in the flight control group was disqualified for flight because of an incompletely healed wound at the minipump implantation site. The sample size for the flight control group was reduced to 3, and therefore any comparisons to this group had decreased experimental power.Flow cytometry Red blood cells were lysed with Pharm Lyse buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell suspensions were washed and incubated in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich), 1% mouse serum (Life Technologies), and 10 μg/ml purified anti-CD16/CD32 (2.4G2; BD Biosciences) to block nonspecific binding. Cells were then stained with antibodies in 1% BSA/1% mouse serum/PBS for 45 min on ice. Antibodies and dilutions used were: anti-CD3-PE (145-2C11; 1:20), anti-CD4-FITC (GK1.5; 1:100), anti-B220-PerCP-Cy5.5 (RA3-62B; 1:100), anti-CD45.2 PerCP-Cy5.5 (104; 1:20), anti-CD62L-PE (MEL-14; 1:20) anti-CD25-PE (7D4; 1:20), anti-CD44-PE (IM7; 1:20). Isotype controls were used at the same dilution as the corresponding antibody—mouse IgG2a-PerCP-Cy5.5 for anti-CD45.2, rat IgG2a-PE for anti-CD62L, rat IgM for anti-CD25-PE, and rat IgG2b-PE for anti-CD44 (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min in room temperature. Fixative was washed off and cells were stored in 1% BSA/1% mouse serum/PBS in 4°C protected from light until analysis. Flow cytometry data acquisition was performed using a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) located at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute (Orlando, FL, USA). A minimum of 10,000 CD4+CD45.2+ cells were counted for analysis of transferred OT-II T cells. Analysis was performed by FlowJo, v10 software (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA). In vitro restimulation cultures Spleens were mechanically dissociated into single cell suspensions and red blood cells lysed with Pharm Lyse buffer. Cells were washed, resuspended in complete medium, and plated in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 107 cells/well. Cells were cultured with either medium alone, 20 μg/ml OVA peptide, 20 μg/ml OVA peptide plus 5 U/ml IL-2, or 5 μg/ml ConA (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 4 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody (BD Biosciences) for 3 d. Cells were then collected for flow cytometry or preserved for RNA isolation.Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeling and proliferation analysis Splenocytes were resuspended in 0.1% BSA/PBS at 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with 1.5 μM CFSE (Life Technologies) for 10 min in room temperature. Cell labeling was quenched by adding an equal volume of ice-cold fetal bovine serum and incubation on ice for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in complete medium, washed, and plated in 96-well U-bottom plates at 1 × 106 cells/well. Cells were cultured with medium alone, OVA peptide, OVA peptide plus IL-2, or ConA and anti-CD28 for 3 d. On d 3, cells were stained with anti-CD3-PE and anti-CD45.2-PerCP-Cy5.5 for flow cytometry analysis. Expansion index of CD45.2+ cells for each sample (number of CD45.2+ cells at end of culture/number of CD45.2+ cells at start of culture) was calculated by the Proliferation Platform of FlowJo v9.8.1 (FlowJo).Multiplex cytokine analysis Cell culture supernatant from cultures restimulated in vitro with ConA and anti-CD28 for 2 d or restimulated with medium alone or OVA peptide for 3 d were collected, frozen, and stored at −80°C until analysis. Supernatant samples were assayed using a mouse cytokine 20-plex assay (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s procedures to detect basic fibroblast growth factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 (p40/p70), IL-13, IL-17, IP-10, KC, MCP-1, MIG, MIP-1α, TNF-α, and VEGF-A. Multiplex results were acquired on a Labscan 200 analyzer (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) using Bio-Plex manager software v6.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A 5-point logistic regression curve was used to calculate the concentration from the fluorescence intensity of the bead measurements. Samples that were below the level of detection were assigned half the lowest detectable value for that analyte.RNA isolation and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR Cells were preserved in RNAprotect Cell Reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and stored at −80°C until processing. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quantity and purity were measured by a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and 260/280 ratios for all samples were 1.8 to 2.0. Reverse transcription was carried out with 300 ng of RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. One microliter of the resulting cDNA was added to a final 20 μl mixture containing 10 μl of VeriQuest SYBR Green Master Mix (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and 12 pmol oligonucleotide primers. PCRs were carried out in a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences used were: Faslg (12597287a1), forward 5′-GCCCATGAATTACCCATGTCC-3′, reverse 5′-ACAGATTTGTGTTGTGGTCCTT-3′; Fas (226443052c1), forward 5′- GCGGGTTCGTGAAACTGATAA-3′, reverse 5′- GCAAAATGGGCCTCCTTGATA-3′; Foxp3 (16905075a1), forward 5′- CCCATCCCCAGGAGTCTTG-3′, reverse 5′- ACCATGACTAGGGGCACTGTA-3′; 18S, forward 5′-GTGGAGCGATTTGTCTGGTT-3′, reverse 5′-CGCTGAGCCAGTCAGTGTAG-3′. For primer sequences obtained from the Harvard Primer Bank (http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/citation.html), the PrimerBank IDs were provided in parentheses (20). Additional primers were designed by using the Web-based Primer3 primer design program. The thermal profile was 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles consisting of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Samples were normalized to rRNA 18S internal standard. Relative quantification of gene expression was calculated by the 2ΔΔCt equation.DNA fragmentation assay A portion of cells preserved in RNAprotect were used for DNA isolation and fragmentation assay according to a previously described protocol (21). Briefly, cells were lysed with 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 solution. An equal volume of 5% polyethylene glycol in 2 M NaCl solution was added to precipitate nonfragmented DNA. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected as the fragmented DNA fraction. The pellets were redissolved in an equal volume of Tris EDTA buffer and represented the nonfragmented DNA fraction. A 100 μl of supernatant and pellet samples were combined 1:1 with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 dye (Life Technologies). Fluorescence was read at 355 nm excitation/460 nm emission to measure DNA content. Percentage DNA fragmentation for each sample = [fluorescence intensity of supernatant/(fluorescence intensity of supernatant + fluorescence intensity of pellet)].Statistical analysis Two-tailed Student’s t tests and 2-way ANOVA analyses were performed by Prism v5.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).RESULTS Antigen-specific challenge in vivo during spaceflight resulted in greater numbers of antigen-specific T cells compared with ground-based responses Draining lymph nodes and spleens from flight mice were collected within 4 h of landing for immediate analysis, and the same procedure was followed for ground mice. Consistent with previously published findings, flight mice demonstrated a significant overall decrease in the proportion of T cells in the spleen compared with ground mice. Lower T-cell numbers in flight mice were due to decreased numbers of CD4 T cells, whereas the CD8 T-cell compartment was relatively unaffected (Supplemental Fig. 1A) (22). Two-color flow cytometry for CD4 and CD45.2 expression was used to identify the adoptively transferred OT-II memory CD4 T cells. Unexpectedly, the number of CD45.2+CD4+ T cells decreased significantly in flight OVA mice compared with flight control mice in both lymph node and spleen, suggesting that in vivo exposure to OVA led to some sort of T-cell tolerance or deletion (Fig. 2). CD45.2+CD4+ T cells tended to decrease in ground OVA compared with ground control mice, suggesting that induction of T-cell tolerance or deletion was due to our experimental system and not specific to the spaceflight condition. Importantly, for both the lymph nodes and spleen, the numbers of CD45.2+CD4+ T cells were significantly greater in flight OVA mice than in ground OVA mice, indicating that OVA-specific T-cell tolerance or deletion was less effective in spaceflight. Furthermore, numbers of CD45.2+CD4+ T cells tended to increase in flight control compared with ground control mice, suggesting that even in the absence of in vivo OVA restimulation, CD45.2+CD4+ T cells had a slight proliferative or survival advantage in the flight condition. These findings were maintained even after we normalized for baseline alterations in the overall CD4 T-cell numbers between flight and ground mice (Supplemental Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results indicated that: 1) spaceflight conditions likely offered a growth or survival advantage to OVA-specific memory T cells compared with ground conditions, 2) in vivo restimulation with OVA using minipump delivery in our system led to a dominant T-cell tolerance or deletion response, and 3) induced T-cell tolerance or deletion was less effective in flight mice than in ground mice. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Flight mice demonstrated more transferred OVA-specific T cells in vivo than ground mice. A) Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) plots show CD45.2+CD4+ T cells from draining lymph nodes of 1 representative mouse from each experimental group. Bar graph shows average frequency of CD45.2+CD4+ T cells as percentage of total CD4 cells for entire experimental group (n = 4, except flight control n = 3). Error bars represent se. B) Similar analysis of CD4+CD45.2+ cell frequency in spleen. G, ground; F, flight. *P < 0.05 (2-tailed Student’s t test). In vivo OVA peptide plus MPLA stimulation by minipump delivery led to induction of antigen-specific tolerance One potential explanation for the higher numbers of CD45.2+CD4+ T cells detected directly ex vivo from flight mice was that deletional tolerance mechanisms, such as activation-induced cell death, were impaired in spaceflight. However, Fas expression did not differ among the 4 experimental groups, and expression of Fas ligand was higher in flight mice than in ground mice (Supplemental Fig. 2A). Corresponding to Fas ligand expression, there were more apoptotic cells in flight compared with ground cultures restimulated with OVA peptide in vitro (Supplemental Fig. 2B), suggesting that spaceflight did not induce any global defects in Fas/Fas ligand expression or resistance to activation-induced cell death after antigen-specific stimulation. Expression of other molecules that modulate T-cell apoptosis, including Bcl2 and Bcl-xL, were not significantly changed between the 4 experimental conditions (data not shown). To further examine whether antigen-specific tolerance was induced in transferred OT-II cells by implanted minipumps that delivered antigen in vivo, we determined the proliferative response of CD45.2+CD4+ T cells restimulated in vitro in medium alone, OVA peptide, OVA peptide plus IL-2, or ConA and anti-CD28. We found that CD45.2+CD4+ T-cell proliferation to OVA peptide restimulation significantly decreased in cultures from mice that received OVA compared with control in vivo, indicating that our experimental protocol resulted in tolerance induction in mice that received OVA peptide by minipump (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, CD45.2+CD4+ T cells from flight mice tended to proliferate slightly more than those from ground mice, again suggesting that tolerance induction was less robust in flight mice. Corresponding to proliferation, OVA-specific IL-2 production from in vivo OVA-stimulated mice was decreased compared with that in control mice for both flight and ground cohorts, a finding that supports the idea that antigen-specific tolerance was induced (Fig. 3B). When IL-2 was added to OVA in the in vitro restimulation cultures, the proliferation of CD45.2+CD4+ T cells did not increase significantly (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the mechanism of tolerance was not classic T-cell anergy. Figure 3. Open in a new tab In vivo OVA plus MPLA stimulation by minipump inhibited antigen-specific proliferation and IL-2 production. A) Splenocytes were labeled with CFSE and restimulated in vitro with medium alone, OVA peptide, OVA peptide plus IL-2, or ConA and anti-CD28. After 3 d, cultured cells were collected, stained with CD45.2, and analyzed by FACS for proliferation. *P < 0.05 by 2-way ANOVA. B) Antigen-specific IL-2 production was measured by restimulating splenocytes with OVA peptide for 3 d and subtracting IL-2 level from parallel cultures stimulated with medium alone. IL-2 production resulting from mitogen activation was measured from culture supernatants after 2 d of ConA and anti-CD28 stimulation. *P < 0.05 (2-tailed Student’s t test). G, ground; F, flight. All groups n = 4, except for flight control n = 3. Error bars represent se.In contrast to the OVA-specific response, flight cultures produced significantly less IL-2 than ground cultures upon stimulation with ConA and anti-CD28, regardless of whether mice received control or OVA in vivo (Fig. 3B). This finding indicated that IL-2 production in response to mitogen stimulus was highly dependent on the gravity condition and confirmed previously published results that showed significantly reduced IL-2 expression from mitogen-activated T cells exposed to simulated microgravity (8, 9). Proliferation of CD45.2+CD4+ T cells in response to ConA and anti-CD28 stimulation was similar in all 4 experimental groups, suggesting there are compensatory mechanisms that maintain T-cell proliferation despite significantly reduced IL-2 production in flight cultures.Spaceflight had differential effects on CD62L, CD25, and CD44 expression on endogenous and transferred CD4 T cells To determine the expression of CD62L, CD25, and CD44 on endogenous (CD45.2−CD4+) and transferred OT-II (CD45.2+CD4+) T cells in draining lymph nodes, we performed 3-color flow cytometry. Endogenous CD4 T cells represented the normal CD4 T-cell repertoire of the mouse as altered by the ground vs. flight conditions, including a small fraction that might have been activated by the in vivo administration of OVA peptide. Transferred OT-II cells were the OVA-specific memory CD4 T cells. As expected, the majority of endogenous CD4 T cells in ground and flight mice were nonactivated CD62Lhi cells, regardless of in vivo treatment (Fig. 4). Upon closer inspection, endogenous CD4 T cells in flight mice consistently showed a higher proportion of CD62Llo cells, reflecting an overall lower median fluorescence intensity (MFI), compared with ground mice. This finding suggested that a small percentage of endogenous CD4 T cells in flight conditions had a more activated phenotype compared with ground control mice. Although most of the transferred OT-II cells from ground control and flight control mice also showed a CD62Lhi phenotype, MFI did not differ between the 2 groups. Importantly, transferred OT-II cells from ground control and flight OVA mice significantly down-regulated CD62L expression by comparable magnitudes, suggesting that initial activation of these cells by in vivo OVA challenge was equally effective in flight and ground conditions. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Expression of CD62L, CD25, and CD44 on endogenous and transferred CD4 T cells from flight and ground mice differed. Draining lymph nodes were collected and single cell suspensions stained with CD4, CD45.2, and 1 of indicated T-cell markers or its corresponding isotype control. Endogenous CD4 T cells were identified as CD45.2−CD4+ cells, and transferred OT-II T cells were identified as CD45.2+CD4+ cells. FACS histograms show expression profile of CD62L, CD25, or CD44 on endogenous or OT-II cells of 1 representative mouse per group. Gray lines within histograms show gating between cells expressing high vs. low levels of indicated surface marker. Bar graphs show MFI for each T-cell marker averaged across all mice for entire experimental group (n = 4, except flight control n = 3). MFI of surface markers was calculated for entire indicated T-cell population (endogenous or OT-II), except for CD25 on endogenous cells, which represent MFI of gated CD25hi population. G, ground; F, flight. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.005 (2-tailed Student’s t test). Error bars represent se.Interpretation of CD25 expression was more complex than that of other T cell activation markers because it could also serve as a marker for regulatory T (Treg)cells. Approximately 20 to 25% of the endogenous CD4 T cells in ground and flight mice expressed CD25. Among CD25-expressing endogenous CD4 T cells, the level of CD25 expression was significantly lower in flight mice compared with ground mice as manifested by a significantly lower MFI (Fig. 4). Not surprisingly, the entire population of transferred OT-II memory T cells demonstrated up-regulated expression of CD25 in ground control and flight control mice, which was further up-regulated upon in vivo OVA challenge in ground control and flight OVA mice. Similarly to endogenous CD4 T cells, transferred OT-II cells in flight control mice expressed significantly lower levels of CD25 than did ground control animals. Although CD25 on OT-II cells was significantly up-regulated in ground OVA mice compared with ground control animals, up-regulation of CD25 on OT-II cells in flight OVA mice compared with flight control animals was less robust. In addition, expression of CD25 on OT-II cells tended to be reduced in flight OVA mice compared with ground OVA mice. Because appropriate down-regulation of CD62L indicated that T-cell activation was at least partially intact during spaceflight, these CD25 findings suggested that spaceflight caused targeted impairment of CD25 expression and/or up-regulation on both endogenous and transferred T cells. Finally, high CD44 expression was used as a marker for memory T cell phenotype. Endogenous CD4 T cells in flight mice demonstrated a significantly lower proportion of CD44hi cells and overall lower CD44 MFI compared with ground mice (Fig. 4). Although transferred OT-II cells showed generally higher CD44 expression levels than endogenous cells, the proportion of CD44hi cells and CD44 MFI remained significantly lower in flight mice compared with ground mice regardless of whether there was in vivo OVA stimulation. Indeed, in vivo OVA stimulation did not significantly alter the level of CD44 expression within the ground or flight cohorts. These results indicated that spaceflight had a dominant effect in significantly reducing CD44 expression on both endogenous and OT-II memory CD4 T cells, regardless of in vivo antigen exposure, and that maintenance of the memory phenotype might be impaired.Spaceflight differentially impaired subsequent expression of CD25, Foxp3, and CD44 upon antigen-specific restimulation in vitro To characterize the effect of spaceflight on the antigen recall response after return to Earth, splenocytes from ground and flight mice were restimulated in vitro with medium alone, OVA peptide, OVA peptide plus IL-2, or ConA and anti-CD28. Upon OVA in vitro restimulation, expression of CD25 on OT-II (CD45.2+CD4+) T cells from flight control mice remained significantly reduced compared with ground control mice (Fig. 5A). CD25 expression tended to increase on OT-II cells from flight OVA compared with flight control mice, suggesting that in vivo exposure to OVA during spaceflight partially mitigated the defect in CD25 up-regulation. Adding IL-2 to OVA cultures significantly up-regulated CD25 expression on OT-II cells from flight OVA mice compared with flight control mice so that levels became comparable to those on OT-II cells from ground OVA mice. In contrast, upon ConA and anti-CD28 in vitro stimulation, expression of CD25 on OT-II cells was significantly reduced in flight compared with ground cultures regardless of prior in vivo treatment, confirming previously published results that showed impaired CD25 expression upon mitogen T-cell activation in spaceflight and simulated microgravity (6, 8). Together, these findings suggested that spaceflight induced a generalized defect in CD25 up-regulation. Antigen-specific exposure in vivo during spaceflight likely partially mitigated the deficiency in CD25 expression and additional exposure to exogenous IL-2 appeared to abrogate the defect. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Transferred OT-II cells from flight mice demonstrated impaired expression of CD25, Foxp3, and CD44 upon OVA peptide restimulation in vitro compared with ground mice. A) Splenocytes were restimulated in vitro with medium alone, OVA peptide, OVA peptide plus IL-2, or ConA and anti-CD28. After 3 d, cultured cells were stained with CD4, CD45.2, and CD25 and analyzed by FACS. Data represent MFI of CD25 for gated CD45.2+CD4+ cells for each experimental group. *P < 0.005 and **P < 0.001. B) Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of Foxp3 expression in splenocytes restimulated with OVA peptide for 3 d compared with freshly collected splenocytes as control. *P < 0.005. C) Analysis of CD44 expression by FACS on CD4+CD45.2+ cells after in vitro restimulation. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.005. All groups n = 4, except for flight control n = 3. Error bars represent se. P values were calculated by 2-tailed Student’s t test.To determine whether differences in CD25 expression might be correlated with Treg cell development, we investigated the expression of Foxp3, a more specific marker for Treg cells. When restimulated with OVA in vitro, splenocytes from ground OVA mice significantly up-regulated Foxp3 expression compared with unstimulated controls (Fig. 5B). A similar trend was observed in flight OVA splenocytes cultures. In contrast, flight control splenocytes showed no appreciable up-regulation of Foxp3 when stimulated with OVA in vitro compared with unstimulated controls. These results, together with those for CD25 expression, suggested that reduced generation or maintenance of induced OVA-specific CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells in flight mice might be a potential mechanism for impaired tolerance induction during spaceflight. Moreover, the deficiency in generating Treg cells appeared to persist upon antigen restimulation after return from spaceflight and might be partially mitigated if there was exposure to the specific antigen during spaceflight. To further examine the generation and maintenance of memory T cells in ground and flight mice, we determined the expression of CD44 on OT-II cells upon in vitro restimulation. Similar to what was observed on freshly isolated cells, CD44 expression remained significantly reduced on OT-II cells from flight compared with ground cultures regardless of prior in vivo treatment (Fig. 5C). Addition of exogenous IL-2 did not increase CD44 expression on OT-II cells from flight mice. ConA and anti-CD28 stimulation induced comparably weak up-regulation of CD44 from all 4 experimental groups. These results suggested that exposure to spaceflight significantly impaired generation and maintenance of antigen-specific CD44hi memory T cells. Disrupted memory T-cell homeostasis was not mitigated by in vivo antigen-specific exposure during spaceflight, and impaired development of memory T cells persisted after return from spaceflight, at least in the short term.Splenocyte cultures from mice exposed to spaceflight produced increased antigen-specific proinflammatory cytokines Culture supernatants were collected from in vitro restimulation cultures to determine the cytokine production profile of splenocytes upon OVA-specific activation. Levels of each cytokine from OVA restimulated cultures were subtracted by the baseline level of that cytokine from parallel cultures with medium alone in order to determine its production due to antigen-specific stimulation. Overall, cultures from flight mice produced more antigen-specific proinflammatory cytokines than counterpart cultures from ground mice regardless of prior in vivo treatment (Fig. 6). Some of the increases in proinflammatory cytokine production were statistically significant (e.g., IL-1β and IL-17 for flight OVA vs. ground OVA; GM-CSF and IFN-γ for flight control vs. ground control animals). From the restimulation cultures in general, there was relatively less overall production of IL-10, a major anti-inflammatory cytokine product of T regulatory type 1 cells, and IL-4, the signature cytokine product of T helper 2 (Th2) cells. In contrast, production of IFN-γ and IL-17, the signature cytokines for Th1 and Th17 cells, respectively, were significantly increased in cultures from flight mice compared with ground mice. These results indicated that OVA-specific T cells from flight mice differentiated toward the Th1 and Th17 subsets more robustly and induced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines than was true for ground mice. Importantly, these findings suggested that flight mice developed an excessive inflammatory response to the in vivo OVA challenge compared with ground mice. Production of TNF-α, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, and IL-17 tended to be lower in cultures from flight OVA compared with flight control mice, again suggesting that in vivo OVA treatment induced dominant T-cell tolerance that was somewhat less effective in flight compared with ground mice. There were no significant differences among the 4 experimental groups in the levels of these cytokines upon restimulation with ConA and anti-CD28 (Supplemental Fig. 3), indicating that in vivo treatment or gravity conditions did not induce any generalized defects in the ability to produce these cytokines. In addition, similar cytokine production profiles from ConA/anti-CD28 stimulated cultures indicated that differences in OVA-specific cytokine production were unlikely due to overall changes in T-cell numbers between flight and ground cultures. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Cultures from flight mice produced increased proinflammatory cytokines to OVA peptide restimulation compared with ground mice. OVA-specific cytokine response was measured by restimulating splenocytes with OVA peptide for 3 d and subtracting level from parallel cultures stimulated with medium alone. Production of proinflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and GM-CSF) and T-cell subset cytokines (Th1 represented by IFN-γ, Th2 represented by IL-4, Th17 represented by IL-17, and T regulatory type 1 cells represented by IL-10) was measured by multiplex assay. G, ground; F, flight. *P < 0.05 (2-tailed Student’s t test). All groups n = 4, except for flight control n = 3. Error bars represent se.DISCUSSION This report represents the first detailed analysis of an in vivo antigen-specific CD4 T-cell response induced during spaceflight. We found that spaceflight disrupted induction of T-cell tolerance, impaired maintenance of memory T-cell homeostasis, and led to the development of a heightened inflammatory response. Our experimental system, in which soluble OVA peptide was administered subcutaneously with MPLA by minipump, led to the development of tolerance in vivo. This was evidenced by decreased numbers of OT-II T cells in mice exposed to OVA plus MPLA compared with MPLA alone, as well as their decreased proliferation and IL-2 production upon restimulation. Continuous administration of subcutaneous soluble peptide by minipump has been shown to lead to Treg cell development (23). Although we attempted to avoid tolerance induction by giving 2 isolated bursts of antigen, the minipump infusion method of antigen delivery may still have favored Treg cell generation. In addition, MPLA, chosen for its lower toxicity and safety profile, might have skewed the immune response more toward Treg cells compared with highly inflammatory adjuvants such as LPS or complete Freund's adjuvant. The reduced toxicity of MPLA might be related to altered intracellular signaling that actively suppressed proinflammatory activity (18), thus favoring Treg cell generation. Although not our original intention, this experimental system allowed us to examine the effectiveness of tolerance induction during spaceflight. Importantly, our results suggested that the mechanism of impaired tolerance in spaceflight was not due to defects in clonal deletion or anergy, and instead might be related to impaired generation or maintenance of Treg cells. Treg cells are critical for maintaining tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, limiting inflammatory responses, and preserving immune homeostasis. Natural Treg cells are differentiated within the thymus, whereas induced Treg cells may be derived from mature naive or memory CD4 T cells in the periphery (24). Rapidly dividing memory CD4 T cells are likely an important continued source of induced Treg cells later in life (25). Treg cells are CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ and mediate suppression of a wide range of immune cell types through a cell-contact-dependent mechanism (26). IL-2 is essential for the generation and expansion of Treg cells (27). Mice lacking expression of IL-2 or CD25 developed severe autoimmune lymphoproliferative diseases spontaneously (28, 29), indicating that the dominant nonredundant role of IL-2 in vivo was to maintain immune tolerance and homeostasis. Adoptive transfer of CD4+CD25+ T cells into mice with deficiencies in IL-2 receptor signaling rescued them from lethal autoimmunity (30, 31). Moreover, low-dose IL-2 increased Treg cell numbers and alleviated severity of autoimmune diseases (27), suggesting that IL-2 mediated its immunoregulatory effect through Treg cells. Our in vivo results confirmed previous findings that spaceflight and microgravity caused severe impairment of IL-2 and CD25 up-regulation when T cells were activated with mitogens in vitro (6–9). The dominant in vivo manifestation of decreased IL-2 and CD25 expression during spaceflight may be altered Treg cell homeostasis that leads to dysregulated inflammatory responses. On the basis of our in vivo results and findings from previous in vitro T-cell spaceflight experiments, we hypothesize that microgravity during spaceflight predominantly inhibited IL-2 and CD25 up-regulation during T-cell activation, leading to a disproportionate decrease in Treg cells and subsequent impairment in tolerance that is manifested as heightened inflammatory responses. Whether reduced antigen-specific expression of CD25 and Foxp3 caused by spaceflight represented transiently impaired up-regulation after T-cell activation or a lasting deficiency of the Treg cell lineage could not be definitively answered by our data. Nevertheless, our findings provided the first evidence that antigen-specific activation of T cells in vivo during spaceflight might lead to impaired generation of Treg cells and dysregulated inflammatory responses. The relationship between Treg cells and memory CD4 T cells is interesting because memory CD4 T cells have been proposed to be an important source of induced Treg cells (25). Our results suggested that both Treg and memory CD4 T-cell numbers may be significantly reduced by spaceflight. However, Treg cells could be increased by antigen-specific stimulation in vivo during spaceflight, whereas memory CD4 T cells could not. If homeostasis of Treg and memory CD4 T cells were linked, our findings would suggest that spaceflight induced a profound and absolute inhibition of memory CD4 T-cell development and maintenance, and that a subset may be stimulated to become Treg cells if exposed to antigen during spaceflight. Because the prevailing functional outcome was increased inflammatory response in mice exposed to spaceflight, the deficiency of Treg cells had the dominant effect in our experimental system. Additional studies are required to determine whether spaceflight impairs unique memory T-cell functions, such as efficient homing to lymphoid organs, increased life span, and faster response kinetics (32), resulting in less effective immune responses in other contexts. In our current study, a cohort of flight mice was compared with ground control mice that were housed in identical flight hardware enclosures and subjected to simulated ambient conditions experienced by the flight mice. Under these conditions, the spaceflight-related variables that remained different between the 2 groups were the presence of microgravity cosmic radiation, and systemic stress response related to launch and landing for the flight mice. In vitro spaceflight experiments using isolated human peripheral blood leukocytes demonstrated that spaceflight inhibited T-cell activation independent of systemic stress hormone responses (5, 6, 10). In addition, experiments that compared activation of T cells in spaceflight microgravity with an in-flight 1g centrifuge control demonstrated that suppressed T-cell activation can be attributed to effects of microgravity independent of other spaceflight-related environmental factors (6, 10). Cosmic radiation has been shown to have adverse effects on the immune system at high doses (2 to 3 Gy) which may occur during sporadic solar particle events and exposure risk is greatest for astronauts performing extravehicular activities (33, 34). It is very unlikely that flight mice in our study were exposed to these levels of radiation during a 15 d low-Earth-orbit mission while enclosed and protected by the space shuttle. Increased systemic stress hormones, as determine by spikes in urinary cortisol levels, have been documented immediately around the time of space shuttle launch and landing (35). However, how these changes in stress hormones may affect an immune response induced during the course of spaceflight remains unclear. Our current experiment was designed so that the in vivo antigen challenge was delivered on flight d 6 and 10 during a 15 d mission, remote from the acute neuroendocrine changes induced by launch and landing. As a result of this experimental design, the acute stress responses to launch and landing likely had minimal effect on the OVA-specific immune responses we measured. Although the possible effects of cosmic radiation and systemic stress hormones cannot be completely eliminated in our experiment, the most likely spaceflight-related factor that caused the immune dysregulation we observed remains to be microgravity. Our study had some limitations. First, the sample size of 4 mice per experimental group was powered to detect a 30% difference between groups with up to a 20% sd. The flight control group had 3 animals because 1 mouse was disqualified for flight as a result of an incompletely healed wound at the minipump implant site. As a result of limited statistical power, there might have been significant differences between groups that could not be definitively determined. This was reflected by the fact that several consistent trends in our data did not reach statistical significance. Regardless of the limitations, we still detected several statistically significant effects of spaceflight on the immune response, indicating that the impact of spaceflight on the immune system was substantial and would likely pose considerable challenges for human health. Second, per standard NASA protocol, synchronous ground control mice were generated 48 h after flight mice in order to conform to the requirements of the Orbital Environment Simulator that mimicked space shuttle ambient conditions for the ground cohort. This minimized experimental variability that may be caused by differences in ambient conditions with the tradeoff that variability may be introduced by the adoptive transfer of separate preparations of activated OT-II T cells. Due diligence was followed to keep all experimental procedures and reagents the same between the flight and ground cohorts so that experimental differences may be attributable to exposure to spaceflight. In conclusion, we showed that spaceflight caused significant impairment in tolerance induction and disrupted homeostasis of memory CD4 T cells, leading to increased inflammatory responses. There are examples in humans in which the host’s hyperstimulated inflammatory responses induce more overall damage than the inciting infectious agent or agents (e.g., sepsis.) Our results raise the possibility that humans who acquire an infection during long-term spaceflight, such as on an exploratory mission to Mars, may develop excessive inflammatory responses and associated adverse consequences. As a result of disrupted Treg cell homeostasis, autoimmune diseases may also develop during long-term spaceflight. Additional studies are required to assess the true risks of humans developing deleterious inflammatory responses and/or autoimmune manifestations during long-term space travel. With increased laboratory facilities and safety barriers on the International Space Station, performing such experiments using in vivo infectious and autoimmune disease models will be possible. Determining the nature of immune dysregulation during spaceflight and potential countermeasures will be critical for protecting of the health of humans who venture on long-term space voyages. Finally, understanding spaceflight immune dysregulation may reveal fundamental and previously unappreciated aspects of how the immune system functions under Earth’s gravity and provide critical insights into the mechanisms of immune dysfunction in various human diseases.Supplementary Material This article includes supplemental data.

My scientific education was limited to the fields of molecular biochemistry, cell biology and medicine, and I have never taken an academic course in engineering. Thus, virtually all of the contributions I have made in the field of bioengineering for which I am being honored today are based on what I have learned from my trainees, and from my many outstanding collaborators. To me, this is one of the greatest messages I can convey to young faculty: remember that you can learn as much (or more) from your students, as they can learn from you. Thus, I dedicate this lecture to all of the biomedical engineering students and fellows whom I have trained over the course of my career. For the past thirty years, my laboratory has pursued the fundamental question of how living cells and tissues are constructed. This is an exciting and important question for engineers and material scientists because living cells are the ultimate “intelligent” materials. They are mechanically strong and resilient; exhibit integrated multifunctional chemical/mechanical/electrical/optical and information-processing capabilities; grow, move and self-heal; learn, adapt, and self-organize; and emerge through hierarchical self-assembly of nanoscale components. So for many years my group has strived to identify the design principles that Nature uses to build living cells, with the long-term goal of leveraging this knowledge to develop new biologically inspired materials and devices for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.THE LIVING CELL AS A MECHANICAL STRUCTURE Most people believe that living cells are built from an elastic membrane that encloses a viscous or viscoelastic cytoplasm with a nucleus at its center, much like a balloon filled with molasses or jello. However, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to explain how cells do all the myriad tasks they do to build tissues and organs in the embryo, and to maintain our bodies throughout adult life, if they were built this way. This is because development is an incredibly physical process in which cells pull and push and twist on each other until the interacting cells and tissues deform, bend, and fold into the characteristic three-dimensional (3D) forms that make up the typical body plan of every organism. Moreover, all adherent cells generate tensional forces within their internal cytoskeleton through an actomyosin-based contraction mechanism. Cells exert these forces on their adhesions to other cells and to extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds composed of various types of collagens, proteoglycans, and large glycoproteins (e.g., laminin, fibronectin) that hold cells together within specialized tissues. Cells lose their characteristic shapes (e.g., cuboidal, columnar, pyramidal) and round when they are dissociated from living tissues using ECM-degrading enzymes (e.g., collagenase, proteases), and they spread by applying traction forces to their new adhesions when cultured on tissue culture substrates that are coated with ECM molecules or serum-components. These internal forces that govern cell adhesion and control cell shape are hidden in cultured cells and in cells within living tissues because they are isometric, that is, they are balanced by opposing forces due to the rigidity of the adhesion substrate (e.g., culture dish or ECM), and to the pulling forces of neighboring cells. This internal resting tension or “prestress” can be visualized by culturing cells on flexible substrates, such as silicon rubber, which fold up into compression wrinkles when the cells exert traction forces on their basal ECM adhesions. The existence of these micro-scale forces is important because it is well known that physical forces acting at the organ level can significantly influence the function of cells within living tissues. A few examples include the effects of compression on bone, tension on muscle, pressure on lung, and fluid shear on blood vessels.A STRANGE IDEA: TENSEGRITY IN CELLS So how are cells constructed so that they can generate, sense, and respond to physical forces? When I was a graduate student, I proposed an alternate hypothesis to the water balloon model of cell structure; instead, I suggested that cells might be built more like tents. In order to stabilize a tent, we need to prestress the flexible nylon fabric by placing it under tension. We do this by anchoring it to the ground at multiple sites using tent pegs, and then pushing the membrane up against these adhesions using tent poles. My vision at that time (in the late 1970s) was based on the then recent discovery that all adherent cells contain a contractile cytoskeleton, which is made up on a network of molecular cables, ropes, and struts that span from the nucleus to the surface membrane. Many biologists have studied the role of the cytoskeleton with the belief that it is critical for control of cell growth and movement; however, they tend to focus on its gel properties, as if it were truly organized like jello. In contrast, I suggested that living cells use a particular form of architecture that depends on tensional integrity to convey shape stability, and is known as “tensegrity”.16,24,25 Most man-made constructions, such as Stonehenge, gain their stability from continuous compression, as in brick-upon-brick type constructions in which gravitational forces compress one building element down upon another. These are generally stable structures; however, if there is an impact from the side, the individual building components can fall like dominoes. By contrast, tensegrity structures are composed of a network of tensed elements linked to a subset of elements that resist being compressed, and thereby bring the entire system into a state of isometric tension. The architect Buckminster Fuller first coined this term. His student, the sculptor Kenneth Snelson, was the first to reduce this concept to its simplest embodiment by physically constructing sculptures composed of stainless steel beams interconnected by tension cables that hold themselves stable against the force of gravity even though the beams never come in direct contact. Even though geodesic domes can be constructed using all solid struts, Fuller realized that the reason his domes were such efficient structures in terms of their capacity to bear loads with a minimum of building materials was because they utilized tensegrity principles to ensure their stability. Interestingly, the first article published using anti-actin antibodies to visualize the cytoskeleton in cultured non-muscle cells described the presence of actin geodomes—miniscule geodesic domes with nanometer-sized struts, each composed of many parallel actomyosin filaments.27 Thus, the suggestion that cells might use tensegrity architecture did not seem that outrageous. As part of my Ph.D. dissertation, I built tensegrity models of the cell composed of sticks and elastic strings.16,24 I found that when the tensed structure was unanchored, it took on a round form much like a living cell because tensional forces pulled inward on all sides, with only internal struts providing resistance. However, when I pegged the structure to anchoring points distributed across a rigid substrate, the same cell model extended and took on a flattened and spread form, much like a cell when it adheres to culture substrate. And when I clipped these anchors, the model spontaneously retracted and leapt up off the substrate, again closely mimicking the behavior cells exhibit when trypsinized from a culture dish. This was enough for me conceptually: cells must be tensegrity structures, but it would take me, the members of my laboratory team, and multiple collaborators the next thirty years to provide experimental evidence to convince others that there was indeed substance to this theory.ENGINEERING APPROACHES PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO CELL STRUCTURE My group and many others have been able to demonstrate that many types of cells behave mechanically like tensegrity structures. For example, we confirmed experimentally that large bundles of actomyosin filaments, called stress fibers generate tension and experience tensile prestress in living cells.26 We accomplished this using a laser nanosurgery technique that we developed in collaboration with Eric Mazur (Department of Physics, Harvard University). By focusing light generated by a femtosecond laser through a microscope objective, we could effectively generate the heat of the sun within a tiny volume for an incredibly short time (10−15 s), thereby vaporizing all molecules located within this location. When we focused the laser on a single stress fiber labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a living cultured cell, we produced a circular punch hole with a 300-nm diameter, which spontaneously deformed into an elliptical form (with long axis in parallel with the fiber), thereby directly visualizing tensile prestress within this structure.26 In addition, when we severed a stress fiber in a spread cell attached to a rigid glass substrate, both cut ends retracted spontaneously, confirming that these are tensed structures; however, none of the other stress fibers in the same cells changed their shape or orientation. But when the same experiment was carried out with cells cultured on a flexible ECM-coated polyacrylamide substrate that had a compliance closer to that of living tissues, global structural rearrangements were observed throughout the interconnected actin cytoskeleton, much like when a single tensile fiber is cut in a tensegrity sculpture. We also have been able to show that microtubules can bear compression in living cells, and that they resist inward-directed forces generated by the surrounding contractile actin cytoskeleton.3,55 For example, working with Kit Parker (School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Wyss Institute, Harvard University), we demonstrated that when cultured cardiomyocytes are transfected with GFP-tubulin, their microtubules buckle in unison when these beating heart cells contract, and they straighten when the cells relax.3 Interestingly, if heart cells have too many microtubules, they mechanically interfere with contractility, and this can lead to heart failure in whole animals.52 Most importantly, different types of cells exhibit the same microtubule buckling morphology with a wavelength of approximately 2–3 μm, and working with David Weitz (Department of Physics, Harvard University) and Fred Macintosh (Vrije Universiteit, The Netherlands), we showed that a constrained buckling theory which assumes that microtubules bear compression in living cells can quantitatively predict this curvature.3 This is because it is energetically more efficient for microtubules to buckle into many small curves (i.e., rather than to undergo Euler buckling with a single large bend) when the microtubule is pushing out against a surrounding viscoelastic cytoskeleton. Interestingly, these studies revealed that microtubules can bear more than 100 times higher levels of compressive loading when present within the living cytoskeleton, than previously assumed based on studies with microtubules in isolation. These findings confirm that cell shape stability depends a mechanical force balance in which microtubule struts balance inward-directed compressive forces generated by tensile actomyosin filaments, as predicted by the tensegrity model. However, cells also anchor to the ECM substrate through multiple small discrete tethering sites, known as “focal adhesions,” which function much like tent pegs. This is where cells cluster together their integrin receptors, which mediate cell surface binding to various ECM proteins. The cytoplasmic tails of integrins bind to actin-associated molecules, such as talin, vinculin, paxillin, and α-actinin, and thereby recruit them to form the structural backbone of the focal adhesion that forms a molecular bridge linking ECM and integrins to the internal contractile cytoskeleton. These discrete focal adhesions form at the distal ends of each stress fiber, which attempts to shorten when their internal actomyosin filaments slide and generate tension; this results in an increase in cytoskeletal prestress and flattening in a cell adherent to a rigid substrate (that can resist filament contraction), whereas cells round and form compression wrinkles as these adhesions are pulled closer to each other (like a purse-string) when the cell is cultured on a flexible substrate. Thus, the cell’s ECM adhesions also can work in a complementary way with microtubules to resist inward-directed cell tensional forces, and forces can be shuttled back and forth between ECM, microtubules, and the actin cytoskeleton in living cells.21INTEGRINS AS MECHANORECEPTORS One of the most important facets of the cellular tensegrity model is that it led me to predict that transmembrane cell surface receptors, which physically link external support scaffolds (e.g., ECM, other cells) to the load-bearing cytoskeleton of the cell, may function as mechanoreceptors.15,24,25 In other words, they would be among the first molecules on the cell surface to sense a physical force, and they transfer this mechanical signal across the cell surface via a specific molecular pathway. Because integrins are a ubiquitous class of transmembrane receptors that physically couple ECM to the actin cytoskeleton, we set out to explore whether they could mediate mechanosensing in living cells. In order to test this hypothesis, we developed various magnetic cytometry techniques in which small (1–10 μm diameter) magnetic beads are coated with ligands for integrins (e.g., ECM proteins, RGD peptide, specific antibodies) or other transmembrane receptors, and then applied magnetic fields are used to either twist (shear) or pull (tense) on these specific receptors through the bound beads.36,37,54 We found that when we applied force to transmembrane receptors, such as metabolic receptors or histocompatibility antigens, which do not support focal adhesion formation or mechanically couple to the deep cytoskeleton, and that these bead adhesions were very flexible as expected from the submembranous actin–spectrin–ankryn lattice to which they interconnect. However, when the same forces were applied to integrins that form focal adhesions on the same cells, the beads exhibited great resistance to pulling or twisting that increased in direct proportion as the level of applied stress was raised. Moreover, working with Dimitrije Stamenovic (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University), we developed a mathematical tensegrity model starting from first mechanistic principles that predicted these results, and led to quantitative and qualitative predictions of many other mechanical behaviors of various types of living cells, and similar results were obtained by other investigators around the world.21,50,51 Most other models of cell mechanics are ad hoc models, and while they can predict some of these behaviors, only the tensegrity model can predict this huge range of different cellular responses a priori. Thus, it appears to be the most universal model of cell structure at the present time.STRUCTURAL HIERARCHIES FOR FORCE TRANSMISSION IN LIVING SYSTEMS One of the most interesting properties of tensegrity structures first recognized by Buckminster Fuller is that hierarchical tensegrities may be built, which exhibit force transmission and fine structural coordination across multiple size scales.12 This is important because one of the major differences between living systems and man-made structures is that while man usually builds using bulk materials (e.g., a hunk of metal or rubber), Nature builds hierarchically. For example, scientists can separate a nucleus from the cytoplasm of a living cell, and then transfer that nucleus to a second enucleated cell to create a fully functional organism, as in the cloning of “Dolly the Sheep.” This means that the nucleus has its own structural and functional integrity that is maintained when it is isolated, as does the cytoplasm, and yet when you recombine them and these structures reconnect, normal structures and functions are restored. I explored this idea many years ago by constructing a tensegrity cell model containing a nucleus at its center, which was connected to the surface of the model by additional elastic strings (i.e., to provide tensional integrity across size scales).16,24 Now, when the model was unanchored, both the cell and nucleus exhibited round forms, but when the surface of the model was tethered to a rigid substrate, both the cell and nucleus spread and flattened in a coordinated manner due to the presence of these tensional connections. Moreover, when the adhesive anchors were clipped, both the cell and nucleus rounded as well. Importantly, we demonstrated precisely this type of coupling between cell and nuclear spreading within living mammalian cells years later.14 In order to experimentally confirm that tensile connections between the nucleus and cell surface exist in living cells, we coated a glass micropipette tip with the ECM protein fibronectin and bound it to integrins on the surface of a cultured cell; then a micromanipulator was used to rapidly pull on these receptors. Amazingly, we not only found that this resulted in coordinated distortion of the surface membrane and nucleus, but also detected molecular realignment within nucleoli (using birefringence microscopy) within the center of the nucleus when we pulled on integrin receptors tens of microns away on the surface membrane.34 Importantly, when we pulled on other transmembrane receptors in the same cells, only a local response at the membrane was observed. By carrying out similar studies in cells treated with pharmacological inhibitors of intermediate filaments, or in which the intermediate filament protein vimentin was knocked out genetically, we confirmed that intermediate filaments that have been previously shown to span from the nuclear surface to the surface membrane are largely responsible for this form of transcellular mechanical coupling.9 However, the actin cytoskeleton also contributes to this coupling because pulling on integrins in mitotic cells that lack an intermediate filament cytoskeleton can actually cause reorientation of the mitotic spindle axis.9 But these cells tear when pulled on and the cytoskeleton experiences more than about 15% mechanically strain. This finding emphasizes how studying the gel-like behavior of the actin cytoskeleton alone is not sufficient to explain the mechanical properties of living cells. The observation that forces applied to surface integrins result in reorientation of nucleoli suggested that the nucleus itself must contain some type of load-bearing structural network. In fact, we were able to confirm the existence of mechanical connectivity within the entire living human genome by using an ultrafine micropipette (500-nm tip) to harpoon a single chromosome in a living mitotic cell, or a single nucleolus in an interphase cell.33 Pulling a single chromosome out of a cell resulted in progressive removal of all of the remaining chromosomes, and when one nucleolus was extracted, it similarly resulted in removal of the entire interphase chromatin along with all of the remaining nucleoli. Importantly, cells remained viable during this nanosurgery procedure, and, in fact, we have used this extracted mitotic genome to study the physiology of chromosome decondensation and recondensation.2 The key point here is that all of the chromosomes are linked by a continuous elastic network in living mammalian cells. It has been long known that mitotic spindles can be isolated from living cells, and that they maintain their mechanical stability when isolated free of cells and studied in vitro even though they are made of molecules that we commonly think are dominated by thermal noise. Apparently, the stiffened microtubules stabilize the spindle by pushing out against this surrounding elastic chromatin network, and hence creating a tensegrity force balance on a smaller scale. Pickett-Heaps and his group in Australia has confirmed that the spindle microtubules bear compression: when he severed one microtubule with a laser, the others buckled, thus demonstrating the shift in compressive force to the remaining semiflexible microtubular struts.44 But it doesn’t stop here. We recently showed that individual actin stress fibers can be modeled as tensegrity structures because they are composed of actomyosin filaments that generate tension by shortening, but the stress fiber does not narrow when tensed.30 Hence, some of the other molecular components of the fiber must resist being compressed laterally to stabilize the entire tensionally prestressed fiber structure. Moreover, this tensegrity model again was able to predict a wider range of mechanical behaviors of stress fibers than any other existing stress fiber model.30 Amy Sung and Bob Skelton (Department of Biomedical Engineering, UCSD) independently showed that mechanical behavior of the red blood cell membrane can be predicted using a tensegrity model.53 In their model, the geodesic array of spectrin molecules within the submembranous cortical cytoskeleton form the tensile network of the tensegrity structure, whereas the relative stiff actin protofilament and intervening region of the non-compressible lipid bilayer at the surface membrane act as compression elements. This model helps to explain why prestress is critical for shape stability of the erythrocyte membrane, and it emphasizes how tensegrity structures can be built with materials other than sticks and strings or struts and cables, and still provide this form of shape stability. Pursuing this concept even further, I suggested some years ago that individual molecules might stabilize their shape through use of tensegrity principles.19 For example, proteins have multiple rigidified domains (e.g., α-helices, β-strands) interconnected by flexible regions, and multiple portions of the molecule pull in on themselves through attractive hydrogen bonding to assume a stable form. Moreover, we know that proteins are prestressed because enzymatic cleavage of the protein backbone often results in the molecule splaying open (i.e., loss of shape stability). Tensegrity structures are notorious for their ability to produce global rearrangements throughout the structure in response to local force application. Thus, this might explain why binding or pulling a small region of a large transmembrane surface receptor molecule (e.g., growth factor receptors, integrins, cadherins) can result in coordinated structural rearrangements throughout the molecule, thereby inducing shape transitions at its cytoplasmic face, which mediate transmembrane signaling. Artists also have described the human body as a tensegrity structure. Each of us has hundreds of individual bones that are connected by a continuous tensile network, composed of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia, which pulls us up against the force of gravity and stabilizes our forms. The stiffness of our bodies is not controlled by osmotic forces; rather it is the tensile prestress or tone in our muscles, which governs whether we stand strong or move in response to stress, much like in a tensegrity model. These observations bring home the point that Nature uses tensegrity principles to stabilize the structural hierarchies of molecules, cells, tissues, and organs that comprise our bodies.19,21 The use of tensegrity also provides a mechanism to transfer mechanical signals from the macroscale to the nanoscale by transmission across tensional connections, and it facilitates mechanical integration between part and whole.21,22 Thus, the structural organization of our bodies determines how physical forces will be sensed and received at all size scales.SOLID-STATE BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELLULAR MECHANOTRANSDUCTION The body’s structural hierarchies enable it to channel mechanical forces applied at the organ level through load-bearing prestressed networks of bones, muscles, tendons, fascia, and ECM scaffolds so that they impact cell and molecular structure at the nanometer scale.22 This is important because the cytoskeleton that gives cells their shape is more than a mechanical scaffold; it also orients most of the cell’s metabolic machinery. Many of the enzymes and substrates that mediate DNA synthesis, RNA processing, transcription, translation, glycolysis and signal transduction do not function in solution, or when floating free in the lipid bilayer. Instead, cells use a form of “solid-state” biochemistry in which these components function when immobilized on the insoluble scaffolds that comprise the cytoskeleton and interlinked nuclear matrix.17 Moreover, these chemical reactions are often “channeled” through these structures so that substrates are not freely diffusible and pass from one modifying enzyme or enzyme complex to neighboring functional assemblies. Because these reactions are not diffusion limited, cells can exhibit much higher efficiencies of biochemical reactions than we can mimic in solution in a test tube. Thus, use of solid-state biochemistry, in which the cytoskeleton is both a mechanical structure and a catalytic assembly simultaneously, is one of the most fundamental design principles used by living cells, and this insight into cellular engineering might throw some light into how life first originated on this planet.20 This coupling between structure and biochemistry within the cytoskeleton also provides a mechanism for cells to convert external mechanical signals into changes in intracellular biochemistry and gene expression—a process known as cellular mechanotransduction.15,18,22 This is because physical distortion of biomolecules changes their thermodynamic and kinetic properties, and hence, alters their biochemical activities. For example, stress-sensitive ion channels alter their opening and closing rates (kinetics) when tensed or strained, either directly or through their interconnections with underlying cytoskeletal scaffolds. Other molecules, such as myosin motors and RNA polymerases, have been shown to alter their biochemical functions when physically distorted by piconewton scale forces applied using optical tweezers. Certain proteins, such as fibronectin, physically unfold when cells apply tension to their matrix adhesions and expose new binding site within the molecule the promote ECM fibrillogenesis. And cytoskeletal microtubules alter their polymerization dynamics when mechanically stressed such that they depolymerize when compressed and assemble when decompressed. This coupling between mechanics and biochemistry at the nanoscale led me to suggest many years ago that stress application to transmembrane receptors that physically couple the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton—as integrins do in focal adhesions—might mediate mechanochemical conversion in living cells.15,24 Importantly, the cytoskeletal backbone of the focal adhesion also orients many of the cell’s signal transduction molecules, including protein tyrosine kinases (e.g., src, FAK), small and large G proteins, ion channels, mediators of inositol lipid signaling, and a subset of growth factor receptors (e.g., FGF receptors), among others.18,24 Thus, given that we had previously shown that mechanical forces are preferentially transmitted across integrins that directly connect with these focal adhesions, it seemed likely to be a potential site where mechanochemical conversion might occur. My group explored this possibility by adapting the magnetic twisting and pulling cytometry techniques we had developed previously to apply controlled mechanical stresses to cells while quantitating changes in cellular biochemistry and gene expression. Using this approach, we confirmed directly that cell surface β1-integrin receptors mediate mechanically induced changes in cellular mechanotransduction. For example, we showed that applying shear or tension to integrin-bound magnetic beads stimulates the entire cAMP-signaling cascade, as measured by activation of large heterotrimeric G proteins within the focal adhesions, increased production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase, enhanced nuclear translocation of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, activation of the transcription factor CREB, and induction of reporter gene transcription driven by multiple cAMP response elements.1,39 Again, application of the same stresses to other transmembrane receptors, such as metabolic receptors that do not form focal adhesions, failed to produce any of these responses. We also have used this approach to demonstrate that integrins mediate stress-induced changes in mRNA and ribosome distritribution5 as well as calcium signaling37 in living cells. In our most recent unpublished studies, we have been able to detect mechanical stress-dependent increases in calcium influx into cells at the focal adhesion site where magnetic beads bind to integrins on the cell surface within 5 ms after tension is applied to these beads using applied magnetic forces (Matthews et al., in review). To our knowledge, this is the most rapid integrin-specific mechanochemical conversion event that has been demonstrated in living cells. Thus, integrins are indeed mechanoreceptors that transmit mechanical forces across the cell surface over a specific molecular pathway, and that facilitate mechanochemical signal conversion inside the cell. These studies combined results from other leading researchers in this area (e.g., Burridge, Geiger, Horwitz, Schwartz, Sheetz, Yamada, among others) have led to the recognition that the focal adhesion functions as a nanoscale mechanochemical machine that mediates cellular mechanotransduction. Forces applied at the macroscale that are channeled over stiffened ECM elements to surface integrin receptors result in distortion of focal adhesion molecules. Changes in molecular shape can alter the biochemical activities of these molecules in many ways, including altering binding/unbinding rates (e.g., zyxin),28 unfolding proteins and exposing phosphorylation sites (e.g., p130Cas),46 altering cytoskeletal filament assembly,45 modulating ion flux,37 or through some other mechanism that remains to be identified. Conversely, application of cell traction forces on integrins and surrounding ECM can feed back to alter biochemistry outside the cell, for example, by unfolding fibronectin proteins and promoting ECM fibril formation.62 In this manner, changes in cytoskeletal tension and cellular prestress can alter both biochemistry and structure in a highly coordinated manner, which is critical for cell and tissue development. But there is more to cellular mechanotransduction than local mechanical signaling across at the focal adhesion. One of the novel predictions of the nucleated cellular tensegrity model is that forces applied to integrins at one point on the cell surface can be rapidly channeled across interconnected cytoskeletal elements to multiple locations distributed throughout the entire cell and nucleus.16,24 As described above, we demonstrated this type of “action-at-a-distance” many years ago by pulling on integrins with ECM-coated micro-pipettes and inducing changes in nuclear and nucleolar structure inside the cell.34 We also demonstrated that intermediate filaments and actin filaments are required for this response.9,34 However, recent studies by others has identified the LINC protein complex on the surface of the nucleus composed of Nesprin, Sun, and Emerin proteins, which appears to physically couple cytoskeletal filaments in the cytoplasm to the nuclear surface and lamins within internal nuclear scaffolds that, in turn, link to genes and their regulatory proteins.56 Most importantly, long-distance force transfer across the prestressed cytoskeletal framework enables transcellular mechanical signaling to occur much more rapidly than chemical signaling. For instance, Ning Wang (Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) has shown that force application to magnetic beads bound to surface integrins activates the protein tyrosine kinase, c-Src, at distant sites within the cytoplasm within 0.3 s after force application, and this response can be suppressed either by disrupting the actin cytoskeleton or merely by altering the level of prestress in the cytoskeleton.41 Thus, this fundamental principle of tensegrity—the dependence of mechanical stability on tensile pre-stress—is also a key feature of cellular mechanochemical conversion.51MECHANICAL CONTROL OF CELL FUNCTION AND TISSUE DEVELOPMENT My belief that cells are tensegrity structures led me as a graduate student to think about embryological development and tissue formation from a mechanical perspective. Early biologists at the beginning of the last century had described tissue development in largely mechanical terms; however, interest in this area waned with the advent of biochemistry, and it virtually died once the power of molecular biology and genetic engineering was recognized. Yet, there was no way to ignore the reality that embryological development is a highly mechanical process, and that it is impossible to explain movement or changes in form at the micro and macro scale without employing physical forces. If cells are prestressed tensegrity structures, then tissues also must be prestressed. In fact, we know this to be true; this is why surgeons must suture a wound to ensure tissue closure. If a developing tissue, such as a budding epithelium, exhibits a stable form, then the tensional forces exerted by the epithelial cells must be balanced by opposing mesenchymal cells in the stroma below, and by the planar ECM or basement membrane that separates these tissues. If this ECM is tensed due to the traction forces surrounding adherent cells exert on it, then local breakdown or thinning of its structural backbone will cause it to stretch out, much like a “run” in a woman’s stocking. Interestingly, local thinning of the basement membrane due to localized elaboration of matrix-degrading enzymes occurs at virtually all sites where new epithelial bud and capillary branches will form in developing tisssues before cell growth ensues. A seminal article in 1978 by the late Judah Folkman had suggested that cell shape is tightly coupled to growth, with spread cells growing more rapidly than round given the same soluble cues.11 Thus, this led me to propose a micromechanical mechanism for morphogenetic control in which changes in ECM remodeling alters ECM mechanics (e.g., flexibility), which promotes cell stretching and thereby alters local cell growth.13,24 Although I had no idea of a molecular mechanism at that time, I suggested that increased tension on the ECM receptors of the cells adherent to these thinned regions of the tensed basement membrane would induce cytoskeletal distortion and thereby alter cellular biochemistry, somehow leading to the localized changes in cell proliferation and motility, which drive changes in tissue form. We, therefore, set out to explore whether cell shape distortion influences cell growth and function. In an earlier study, we showed that cell spreading and growth increase in parallel when anchorage-dependent cells are cultured on increasing molecular coating densities of ECM molecules, such as fibronectin, laminin, or different collagen types.14,23 However, increasing ECM molecular densities also promotes integrin clustering, which we found can induce chemical signaling independently of cell shape distortion.48 Thus, in order to unequivocally address the question of cell shape in growth control, we set out to develop an experimental system in which cell shape can be varied independently of other critical control parameters. In order to accomplish this, we desired to develop an experimental system in which individual cells are cultured on single cell sized adhesive islands coated with a high ECM coating density (i.e., which promotes optimal integrin clustering) surrounded by non-adhesive barrier regions. The concept was that cells adhere and spread by applying traction forces to their ECM contacts and thus, cells would spread to take the shape of the adhesive island until they reached the non-adhesive edge that could not resist cell traction forces. In this manner, plating a cell on large circular ECM island should result in a pancake-shaped cell, whereas on a smaller island, the cell would be shaped more like a cupcake, and on a tiny island, it would take on the form of a golf ball-on-a-tee. If we cultured the cells in chemically defined medium containing a saturating amount of growth factors and they all adhered to the same high density of immobilized ECM protein, then the only experimental variable would be the degree to which cells physically distort and change shape. We reduced this concept to practice by collaborating with George Whitesides (Department of Chemical Biology and Wyss Institute, Harvard University) who had recently developed the soft lithography-based microcontact printing technique as an inexpensive alternative to create microchips for the computer industry.57 This method uses photolithography to create a master surface containing micrometer-sized indentations etched to take on the form, size and distribution of the final desired adhesive islands. Then an elastomer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), is polymerized on its surface. When peeled off, the PDMS functions as a flexible rubber stamp that retains the surface topography down below the 100-nm scale. We inked the elevated regions of the stamp corresponding to the desired adhesive islands with alkanethiols, and transferred them in this precise pattern to gold-coated silicon chips or glass slides by pressing the stamp to the surface. The intervening regions between the islands were then made non-adhesive by adding soluble alkanethiols linked to polyethylene glycol molecules, which similarly bound to the gold-coated substrates and filled in all the spaces of the surface creating a completely planar, near-crystalline, self-assembled monolayer that supported ECM protein adsorption only in the regions corresponding to the desired cell adhesive islands. Using this method, we showed that when capillary endothelial cells are cultured on large 50-μm diameter circular islands they indeed take on the shape of flat round cells, and when plated on small 10-μm circles, they appear almost spherical in form. In order to control for the total amount of ECM the cells contact, we created substrates in which the 10-μm circular islands were broken up in many tiny 3–5-μm diameter circular islands distributed so that cells spread from dot to dot over multiple islands. Thus, cells on these latter substrates spread like the cells on large ECM islands, yet they only adhered to small total area of ECM similar to that contacted by cells anchored to single 10-μm circular islands. In separate studies, we cultured liver epithelial cells on rectangular islands, and these cells took on the precise shape of the islands. These studies revealed that as island size and cell spreading were increased, DNA synthesis (as measured by entry into S phase) was promoted in a coordinated manner, regardless of the ECM contact area.4,49 Moreover, when cell spreading was inhibited on smaller islands and growth as shut down, cells were induced to undergo apoptosis even though they were still anchored to the ECM substrate.4 In addition, when capillary endothelial cells were cultured on linear substrates that supported only a moderate degree of cell spreading as well as cell–cell interactions, differentiation was induced as indicated by formation of hollow capillary tubes within a period of hours.7 Similar switching from growth to differentiation was seen in single liver cells when their spreading was partially inhibited using a similar approach.49 In later studies, we showed that when cells cultured on square ECM islands are stimulated with motility factors, they preferentially extend new motile process (e.g., lamellipodia, filopodia) at their corners, whereas cells cultured on similar ECM-coated circular islands exhibit no directional bias.43 This is important because biologists interested in control of cell motility focus on identification of signaling molecules that are critical for movement, such as the small GTPase Rac. But while molecules such as Rac may be necessary for lamellipodia formation, they are activated to similar levels in different shaped cells, yet the physical microenvironment and direction of cell distortion apparently govern the way in which these signaling molecules manifest their motility-promoting activities. More recently, my group has shown that this spatial control of motility signaling is controlled mechanically. Cells cultured on square ECM islands spread more along the diagonals (to reach the corners) than they do to the sides. This geometry results in stress concentrations at the cells’ corners, which promotes focal adhesion formation in these regions and further increases cell prestress through activation of the small GTPase Rho.43 This increase in tension promotes actin cytoskeletal remodeling, resulting in formation of contractile stress fibers oriented primarily along the diagonal axes of the cell, which in turn further enhances tension generate at their insertion sites on focal adhesions in the corner regions. Importantly, using a Rac-FRET construct, we experimentally confirmed that Rac is activated locally at sites of new focal adhesion formation within 1 min after cell surface binding to ECM substrates.60 Thus, because cells carry out solid-state biochemistry on their cytoskeleton, physical forces that distort cell shape through their ECM adhesions that link to the cytoskeleton can impact the spatial distribution of signaling events inside the cell, and this appears to be how physical cues influence the direction in which cells will move. Later study by Chris Chen and by Dennis Discher (both of Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania) extended these findings to show that cell shape distortion, cytoskeletal prestress, and ECM mechanics regulate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) lineage switching. When human MSCs are cultured on microfabricated ECM-coated islands in the presence of a mixture of soluble inducing factors, virtually all of the spread cells on large islands differentiate into bone cells, whereas all of the round cells on small islands turn into fat cells.38 Moreover, this process is mediated by RhoA-dependent cytoskeletal tension generation. In addition, when the same human MSCs are cultured on ECM-coated polyacrylamide substrates with different mechanical compliances that match those of living tissues, cells on rigid ECMs that mimic bone osteoid differentiate into bone cells, cells on less rigid substrates that mimic muscle form skeletal muscle cells, and MSCs on ECMs with the highly flexible properties of brain tissue become nerve cells.10 Thus, cell-generated tensional forces, ECM mechanics, and cell shape distortion appear to play a fundamental role in developmental control. In later studies on cell shape-dependent growth control, we discovered that the small GTPase Rho is also central to the mechanism by which mechanical distortion of cells and the cytoskeleton regulate the G1/S control point during cell cycle progression.32 Rho’s effects were mediated in large part by its downstream target, Rho associated kinase (ROCK), that increases cytoskeletal tension (prestress). With this molecular handle, we then set out to further explore the concept I had proposed years earlier13,24 that changes in the balance of mechanical forces between the cytoskeleton and ECM could contribute to morphogenetic control in vivo. In order to do this, we carried out experiments in whole embryonic mouse lung rudiments, which contain epithelium and vascular endothelium that continue to undergo progressive budding and branching morphogenesis, respectively, when cultured in vitro.40 When these developing lung rudiment were treated with the Rho activator, CNF-1, epithelial budding and capillary branching were both stimulated in parallel; however, when Rho levels were further activated with increased doses of CNF-1 and higher levels of myosin-based tension were induced, large scale contraction of the whole lung and growth inhibition were observed. In addition, when tension was dissipated using a ROCK inhibitor, budding morphogenesis and angiogenesis were both inhibited. Importantly, cytoskeletal tension suppression resulted in loss of pattern formation because regional thinning of the basement membrane and associated spatial differentials of cell growth were lost, and not because there was a generalized suppression of cell proliferation. Thus, these studies further support the concept that cytoskeletal prestress contributes significantly to morphogenetic control, as initially predicted by the tensegrity-based micromechanical model of developmental control.13,24 More recently, we also confirmed that ECM mechanics is critical for angiogenic control in vivo, and identified two antagonistic transcription factors—TFII-I and GATA2—that sense changes in ECM compliance and regulate transcription of the gene that encodes the VEGFR2 receptor for the VEGF angiogenic factor.31 These findings also have great clinical relevance. For example, working with Dennis Orgill (Department of Plastic Surgery, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School), we have analyzed therapies used to address the problem of large nonhealing skin wounds in humans.47 One of the first growth factor therapeutics (PDGF) was developed and clinically approved for this application. It likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars to bring to the clinic, and although it works moderately well in patients, it is extremely expensive. Interestingly, one of the first tissue engineering scaffold therapeutics also was developed and approved for this medical application, and it too was costly to develop and is very expensive, yet it produces sub-optimal results. Incredibly, the preferred therapy now used to treat this problem in the clinic is a simple mechanical therapy, called a VAC Sponge. It involves placement of a microporous biocompatible sponge in the wound, which is covered with an air-tight silicone seal and then suction is repetitively applied to the wound. This was initially developed with the goal of removing edema fluid; however, recent study suggests that the suction results in cyclical mechanical strain of the cells located within the interstices of the sponge, which is at the appropriate level to enhance the cells’ ability to respond to growth factors and ECM proteins that already exist within these wounds.47 Thus, this is a simple example of how a mechanical perspective can lead to a simple and a more cost-effective solution to a long-standing medical problem of great clinical importance. Taken together, these studies clearly demonstrate that integrins, ECM, and the cytoskeleton control tissue development by mediating cellular mechanotransduction. Although genes, chemicals, and hormones regulate developmental responses, mechanical forces guide these processes and help to establish pattern formation in 3D. This novel insight into developmental control would not have been possible without the application of engineering approaches to confront fundamental questions in biology, and specifically melding these techniques with methods from molecular and cellular biology. I hope that it has been clear from my presentation so far that the problem is too large to be solved by any single existing discipline on its own.BIOINSPIRED TECHNOLOGY FALLOUT Although my group has long been interested in fundamental mechanisms of biological control, we also always seek to discover new ways we might apply the new insights we make or the tools we develop. This is an important lesson for all graduate students and fellows in Bioengineering, and thus, before ending I would like to present a few examples of how deeper appreciation of the way Nature builds, controls, and manufactures has led us to create new technologies that could potentially transform medicine in the future. Our study on mechanotransduction revealed that application of mechanical stresses to cell surface molecules can influence biochemistry independently of classic receptor signaling mechanisms. But even chemical signaling mechanisms potentially involve mechanical forces. For example, many growth factors, such as EGF and PDGF, must cluster their receptors on the cell surface to elicit chemical signals inside the cell. This is normally accomplished chemically through multivalency; however, this is essentially a mechanical process as the receptors are physically dragged together on the surface membrane (in this case, driven by attractive forces due to binding to a multivalent ligand). We, therefore, explored whether physical forces alone are sufficient to activate this type of transmembrane signaling mechanism. Because we had great experience with applying mechanical stresses to cell surface receptors through bound magnetic microbeads, we adapted this approach by coating much smaller magnetic nanobeads that were on the same size scale as individual receptor molecules (30 nm diameter) with a single ligand per bead for IgE receptors on the surface of cultured mast cells.35 When these receptors normally bind to multivalent antigens, clustering of the IgE receptors induces calcium influx that stimulates histamine release. When we bound single magnetic nanobeads to one receptor each, they remained evenly distributed across the surface of these cells and did not stimulate signal transduction. However, when we applied an external magnetic field, the bound superparamagnetic beads magnetized and acting like small bar magnets pulled their neighbors into tight clusters. This physical clustering of the ligated receptors was sufficient to induce calcium influx inside the cell, and this process could be repeated in a cyclical manner by removing and applying the magnetic field from a distance.35 This study revealed yet another way in which physical forces can influence cell behavior. However, it also represents a potentially exciting medical technology of the future in which cell contraction, nerve impulses, or gene expression could be controlled non-invasively inside our organs by applying a magnetic “wand” over the surface of our bodies. Another example of a medical technology that fell out from our basic study involves the application of microfluidics in biology. Around the same time, George Whitesides was developing soft lithography to microcontact print patterns on substrates, his group also pioneered the use of PDMS to engineer microfluidic systems that essentially mimic the microvasculature of living systems. Microfluidic systems are interesting because they only exhibit laminar flow due to their small size (fluid channels are usually <500 μm in largest dimension), and thus two different fluids introduced into a single flow channel through separate inlets do not mix and simply flow in parallel until they exit through two separate outlets. We took advantage of this novel feature of these microfluidic systems and combined it with our expertise in magnetic particles to develop a nanomagnetic-microfluidic cell separation device for sepsis therapy that effectively functions like an artificial spleen.59,61 Patients with sepsis have pathogens in their blood that spread throughout the body and often result in multiple organ systems failure and death. Although most pathogens remain within tissues, some patients respond fully to antibiotic therapy alone, which only decreases the pathogen load. If we could rapidly remove circulating pathogens while simultaneously treating with antibiotics, then we might be able to save increasing numbers of patients’ lives. In addition, if we could quickly remove these microbes from the blood, then we might be able to diagnose the specific type of pathogen immediately, and not have to wait many days to obtain results of blood cultures before tailoring their therapy appropriately. This is a particular problem in patients with fungal infection because anti-fungal therapy will not be initiated until a definite diagnosis has been made because the drugs have significant toxicity. Thus, we set out to develop an extracorporeal microdevice that could rapidly cleanse blood of pathogens without compromising or removing normal blood components that are critical to fight infections (e.g., immune cells, antibodies, complement, etc.). In order to accomplish this, we coat magnetic beads (130-nm or 1-μm diameter) with ligands for pathogens (e.g., antibodies to E. coli bacteria or C. albicans fungi), mix them with saline or whole human blood containing living pathogens, and then flowed the mixture through one inlet of a single channel microfluidic device while passing isotonic saline through the second inlet into the parallel flow stream. Without applied magnetic fields, the contaminated fluid and saline do not mix, and each pass out through their corresponding outlet. However, when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the direction of flow, the magnetic beads and bound pathogens are pulled across the flow border between the laminar streams, and they are removed through the isotonic saline outlet while the cleansed blood exits through its outlet and potentially can return back to the patient. We demonstrated greater than 85% filtration efficiency in our initial studies using E. coli in saline,59 and more recently, and we have been able to cleanse whole human blood of C. albicans with greater than 90% efficiency at much higher flow rates.59,61 These microdevices can be aligned in tandem and multiplexed to produce even greater efficiencies, and to cleanse larger volumes of blood in a clinical setting. Thus, we are pursuing this approach in animal studies for sepsis therapy; however, this represents a platform technology in that it also could be used to isolate many other types of circulating cells (e.g., cancer cells, stem cells, immune cells, fetal cells in the maternal circulation), molecules (e.g., antibodies, inflammatory cytokines), or any other component in blood or other biological fluid that would normally be restricted by a filtration membrane. It was about the time we initiated these studies on the artificial spleen that we began to conceive of the concept of a research institute dedicated to development of technologies inspired by how Nature builds. This vision recently became a reality with the establishment of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University that I now head. At the Wyss Institute, we have a major platform effort in Biomimetic Microsystems, which applies microengineering approaches to create “organ-on-a-chip” technologies that we hope will someday replace animals for applications in drug testing, toxicity, and device screening. One example of ongoing study in this area is the recent development of a “breathing human lung-on-a-chip” that recapitulates the functional alveolar–capillary interface of the lung, and exposes it to both fluid flows and cyclical mechanical strain similar to that observed in vivo (Huh et al., in review). This device contains two parallel microfluidic channels separated by a porous membrane that is coated with ECM. It has human airway epithelium adherent on one surface, and human vascular endothelium adherent to the other; rhythmic suction is applied to the cells on the flexible membrane to mimic the distortion normally produced by the breathing motions of the lung. Interestingly, when living bacteria are placed in the alveolar channel of this device and blood containing fluorescently labeled neutrophils is passed through the vascular channel, these neutrophils can be observed to adhere to the inflamed endothelium and to undergo diapedesis as they migrate to the alveolar space where they engulf the pathogen. Hence, multiple stages of the inflammatory response that normally occurs in vivo can be studied at high resolution in this in vitro model. We also discovered that toxic effects of nanoparticles delivered to the alveolar channel can only be detected when the tissues experience physiological breathing motions. Thus, although these results are only preliminary, they strongly support the potential clinical value of engineering biomimetic systems that recreate functional tissue–tissue interfaces and experience physiological mechanical stresses. Finally, one of the most fundamental biological design principles that we have uncovered is clearly the use of tensegrity architecture, which we observe at virtually all size scales in the hierarchy of life.19,21,22 Over 10 years ago, I formed a company called Molecular Geodesics Inc. (later known as Tensegra Inc.) to leverage this knowledge to design and fabricate biomimetic materials that utilize tensegrity principles using computer-assisted design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques in combination with solid-free form fabrication strategies.42 Unfortunately, methods did not exist to manufacture structures with the precise architecture we desired on the nanometer scale the way Nature builds. However, recent advances in nanotechnology now make it possible to build on this miniscule size scale and, in fact, self-assembled tensegrity arrays have been created using programmable DNAs that form defined structures based on complementary binding interactions. For example, William Shih (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School and Wyss Institute) has applied the DNA origami approach to build 3D tensegrities.6,8 In DNA origami, a single circular strand of DNA is induced to fold up on itself and to create specific 3D forms (e.g., octahedral, icosahedra) much like twisting and folding a balloon animal, by allowing many small complementary DNA oligonucleotides to bind to sites located at different positions along the strand. Shih and his colleague Shawn Douglas have developed a CAD program (caDNAno) that allows one to define the oligonucleotide sequences to build virtually any 3D structure one desires on the nanometer scale.58 Using this approach, we have worked together at the Wyss Institute to create a prestressed 3-strut tensegrity structure approximately 100 nm in length composed of a singular circular strand of DNA that folds up into nanotubular forms to create the struts, which are interlinked by remaining linear regions of the same DNA strand.29 Moreover, we can alter the prestress, and hence the mechanical stability in these structures, by designing different length nanotubular struts. Because DNA has the potential to be both biocompatible and biodegradable, we hope to extend this approach to create prestressed tensegrities that someday might be used as mechanical actuators to control ECM mechanics or regulate stem cell behavior for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

I hope that I fully communicated the challenges I have faced as a biologist who believed that mechanics and structure are as important regulators of cell and tissue function as chemicals and genes. I had to seek out collaborators who shared in my vision and had the patience to teach me engineering principles, concepts, approaches, and vocabulary. But to me the key has always been to remain at the boundary between these disciplines because this is where the most exciting and dynamic advances always take place. In order to do interdisciplinary research and pursue unconventional ideas successfully, it is necessary to demonstrate to one’s critics that you can use the same approaches they do, and obtain the same results. It is only when you have their respect as a peer, that you can go further and show that by looking at the problem from a slightly different perspective or using a new technology, you can explain things that they cannot, using existing approaches. It is only then that your critics become your competitors. Thank you once again for this wonderful honor.Acknowledgments The research described in this lecture was supported by grants from , NASA, NSF, DARPA, DoD, CIMIT, ARO, and Wyss Institute, and the author is a recipient of a DoD Breast Cancer Innovator Award.References 1.Alenghat FJ, Tytell J, Thodeti CK, Derrien A, Ingber DE.
