    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear. To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response countermeasures.

    "introduction": "Introduction During both short- and long-duration spaceflight, the human body is exposed to various factors that are unique to the space environment, including weightlessness (e.g., microgravity), increased radiation, isolation, and confinement1,2. Due to the unique remote and spaceflight environment, lifestyle and hygienic practices are different from an Earth setting and often simplified due to the minimal resources and space available in a spacecraft (e.g., lack of showers, restrooms, limited clothing available)3. Moreover, significant physiological adaptations and overall shifts in biological homeostasis occur from spaceflight exposure, including musculoskeletal deconditioning, cardiovascular fluid shifts, vision loss (e.g., spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome), metabolic shifts, and mitochondrial and immune dysfunction4,5. Several studies have identified the effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, including fluid redistribution, orthostatic intolerance, changes in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, arterial stiffening, bone loss, atrophy of the striated and cardiac muscle groups, and increased risk of bone fracture1,6–12. The body’s largest organ, the skin, is another key physiological system sensitive to environmental changes. Human skin serves multiple functions, including physical and immunological protection, supporting microbiota (containing bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses) homeostasis, thermoregulation, fluid retention, and metabolism13–15. Also, since the skin is the outermost layer of the body and exposed to the direct, external environment, it is usually the first substrate affected by environmental changes an individual experiences, including environmental adaptations resulting from spaceflight. The skin serves as a unique organ for investigating the impacts of spaceflight on the human body as it encompasses a range of physiological elements, from surface microbiota and connective tissue to vasculatures, follicles, and the nervous and immune systems, alongside various skin cell types. It offers a comprehensive platform to understand the multifaceted effects of spaceflight. Unfortunately, few studies exist on the spaceflight environment’s impact on the skin, and observations to-date show that spaceflight may cause epidermal hypersensitivity and irritation, rarefaction of the cutaneous fiber network, and impaired epidermal proliferation and repair16–20. Nonetheless, the skin remains an understudied organ in the field of space biology; to date, fewer than ten astronaut case evaluations have been conducted3. Furthermore, only a few existing studies have examined transcript-level changes, and none of these studies has contextualized spatial or whole transcriptome gene expression or investigated the multiple omics components of skin adapting from spaceflight exposure3,21,22. Our study investigates skin samples collected from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission and, for the first time, explores the spatial-transcriptomic characterization of short-duration spaceflight’s impact on skin tissue. We comprehensively profiled skin microenvironment changes in response to spaceflight by performing a multi omics analysis using 4 mm skin punch biopsies from the crew members (n = 4) 44 days before launch (L-44) and 1 day after return (R + 1) of the 3-day mission. Tissue location specific gene expression levels were quantified using Nanostring GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) system across four regions of interest (ROI) targets, Outer Epidermis (OE) and Inner Epidermis (IE), Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA) compartments. From immunofluorescence images, we identified epidermis, dermis, and vascular area and subdivided epidermis ROIs into outer and inner layers, which corresponded to granular and spinous layer (OE) and basal layer (IE). In total, we analyzed 95 astronaut skin ROIs using the human whole-transcriptome atlas (WTA, 18,676 genes). We also correlate these transcript level findings with matched metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from skin swabs obtained prior to biopsy, as well as single-cell sequencing data (10X multiome single-cell ATAC and gene expression (GEX) characterizations) from isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).",
    "methods": "Methods IRB statement The research in this manuscript complies with all relevant ethical regulations. Tissue samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members (n = 4, two males and two females) after consent for research use of the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). Sample collection Skin biopsy and swabs The biopsies were collected from all four crew members’ right (preflight) and left (postflight) deltoid (or upper arm) that were anatomically the same, matched locations, except for one crew member. For this crew member, both timepoints were collected from the right arm, approximately 1.5 inches away from one another. The average age of the crew members was 41.5 and consisted of two males and two females. Prior to biopsy, the selected areas were swabbed for 30 s with pressure using an Isohelix Swab dampened with DNase and RNase free water. The swabs were stored in the pre-labeled Thermo Fisher 2D barcoded tubes with DNA/RNA Shield Stabilization Solution (Zymo Research, cat# R1100-250) added. After the swab, the area was disinfected using CloraPrep (BD Biosciences) followed by injection of 1% lidocaine and 1/100,000 epinephrine. The biopsies were performed using a trephine punch (Miltex). If desired, the surgical sites were either closed with two 5-0 Vicryl sutures or applied pressure to stop bleeding. To prevent infection and allow healing, bacitracin ointment or sterile petrolatum was applied to the biopsied site followed by Band-Aids and after-care instructions. The resected piece was cut into approximately 1/3 and 2/3 sections. The smaller piece was fixed with formalin and stored at room temperature for histology and pathology. The larger piece was flash frozen for GeoMx analysis.PBMC isolations For each crew member, 8 ml of venous blood was collected in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant tubes. Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from whole blood using the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µl/ml of blood) for 20 min at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identified using side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single-cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or Multiome (GEX and ATAC) libraries. Spatial transcriptomics analysis GeoMx digital spatial profiling Skin biopsy samples from four crew members were collected and frozen in cryovials pre and post flight. Collected skin was flash embedded in OCT blocks. Three or four replicate of OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide per subject including pre and post flight replicates. Tissues were then cryosectioned at 5 µm thickness and attached to glass microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, cat# 22-037-246). Immunofluorescent visualization marker for Pan-Cytokeratin (PanCK, Novus cat# NBP2-33200AF532, Alexa Fluor® 532, clone ID AE1 + AE3, 1:40 dilution), fibroblast activation protein (FAP, Abcam cat# ab222924, clone ID EPR20021, conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 594 using Thermo Fisher antibody labeling kit cat# A20185, 1:20 dilution) and smooth muscle actin (SMA, R&D Systems cat# IC1420R, Alexa Fluor® 647, clone 1A4, 1:200 dilution) were used for region or interest (ROI) selection. The DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to assess genes collected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides were thawed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) at 4 °C followed by PBS washes for thorough fixation. After washes, slides were prepared following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Preparation Protocol for fixed frozen samples, digesting samples with 1.0 µg/ml proteinase K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at 100 °C (NanoString, no. MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM final concentration were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology markers were prepared for four slides concurrently using Syto13 (DNA), PanCK, FAP and SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per slide. Slides incubated with 225 μl of morphology marker solution at RT for 1 h, then washed in SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP instrument. The 20x scan was used to select freeform ROIs to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. OE ROIs covered spinous and granular layers, while IE ROIs covered the basal layer, identified from the staining of the tissue. To ensure proper selection and to avoid overlaps across different ROI types, small gaps between each ROI type were made, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI. FASTQ files were then converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the normalized count matrix, DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis (Supplementary Data 1), and FGSEA was used for pathway enrichment analysis, which uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like enrichment score test to obtain statistics (Supplementary Data 2). GSVA was used to run ssGSEA analysis with custom gene signatures obtained from published single-cell and bulk skin datasets25,26. The methods used to perform data exploration and visualization have been published previously78. PBMC single-cell sequencing analysis Library preparation and sequencing To capture T cell and B cell variability, diversity, and joining (VDJ) repertoire, single-cell gel beads-in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics). Prior to single-cell Multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µl of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% digitonin, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 4 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 ml cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), nuclei were resuspended in diluted nuclei buffer (10x Genomics Single-Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6000 nuclei per µl. Single-cell libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single-Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system. GEX and ATAC libraries were processed using Cell Ranger arc v2.0.0. VDJ libraries were processed using Cell Ranger v6.1.1. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analysis DNA/RNA library preparation and sequencing Samples were collected prior to processing as isohelix swabs stored in 400 ul of Zymo Research DNA/RNA shield (cat# R1100) in Thermo Fisher Matrix 1.0 ml ScrewTop Tubes (cat# 3741-WP1D-BR). Prior to beginning the extraction protocol, samples were vortexed for 5 s using the MO BIO Vortex Adapter tube holder (cat# 13000-V1-24) to ensure maximum biomolecular yield from the collected swabs. Due to loss in DNA/RNA shield during sample collection, sample volume was transferred into AllPrep Bacterial Bead Tubes provided by the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (cat# 47054) and the volume of samples were adjusted to 350 ul prior to further processing to ensure sufficient input volume for the extraction protocol. DNA/RNA/Protein extraction was performed using the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (cat# 47054). Steps one and two were omitted from the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit manufacturer’s protocol as these samples were not generated through bacterial culture. Aside from this omission, samples were extracted following the manufacturer’s protocol. Following the completion of the extraction protocol, the extracted DNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (cat# Q33231), extracted RNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (cat# Q32855), and extracted protein was measured using the Thermo Fisher Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay (cat # A53225). All quantification protocols were conducted per manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted DNA and cDNA (from RNA) samples for Illumina Whole genome sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96 Samples). In total, 408 DNA samples (4 × 96-well plates and 24 samples on a 5th 96-well plate) were library prepared and pooled into a total of 4 pools—96 samples were pooled into 1 (for plates 1, 2 and 3), except for plates 4 and 5, where 120 libraries were pooled into 1. Each library pool was sequenced using 2 × 150 Paired end sequencing on S4 flow cell using NovaSeq 6000 sequencer, one pool per lane of the S4 flow cell.Genomic data preprocessing and quality control All metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples underwent the same quality control pipeline prior to downstream analysis. Software used was run with the default settings unless otherwise specified. The majority of our quality control pipeline makes use of bbtools (V38.92), starting with clumpify [parameters: optical = f, dupesubs = 2, dedupe = t] to group reads, bbduk [parameters: qout = 33 trd = t hdist = 1 k = 27 ktrim = “r” mink = 8 overwrite = true trimq = 10 qtrim = “rl” threads = 10 minlength = 51 maxns = −1 minbasefrequency = 0.05 ecco = f] to remove adapter contamination, and tadpole [parameters: mode = correct, ecc = t, ecco = t] to remove sequencing error79. Unmatching reads were removed using bbtool’s repair function. Alignment to the human genome with Bowtie2 (parameters: --very-sensitive-local) was done to remove potentially human-contaminating reads80.Taxonomic abundance quantification We used the XTree (https://github.com/GabeAl/UTree) [parameters: –redistribute] to quantify the bacterial and viral taxonomic compositions of the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. XTree is the recent version of Utree81; it implements an optimized alignment approach and increased ease of use. In brief, XTree is a k-mer based aligner (akin to Kraken282, but faster and designed for larger databases) that uses capitalist read redistribution in order to pick the highest-likelihood mapping between a read and a given reference based on the overall support of all reads in a sample for said reference83. Notably, it reports the total coverage of a given query genome, as well as total unique coverage, which refers to coverage of regions found in only one genome of an entire genome database. We generated an XTree k-mer database [parameters: XTree BUILD k 29 comp 0] from the Genome Taxonomy Database representative species dataset (Release 207) and aligned both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. For the metagenomic sequencing, we filtered for genomes that had at least 0.5% coverage (i.e., approximately 15 genes in 3000 genes, each 1000 bp) and/or 0.25% unique coverage. Relative abundances were calculated by dividing the total reads assigned to a given genome by the total number of reads assigned to all genomes in each sample. Cytokine assay Biochemical assays from the serum samples obtained from the same i4 crew members was performed using the bead-based multiplexed assay protocols provided by Eve Technologies (https://www.evetechnologies.com/cytokine/). Two biomarker profiling panels were used: (1) Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HD71) and (2) Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9). Concentration values from the assay were extrapolated using a 4 of 5 parameter logic standard curve. Chromogenic in situ hybridization Using additional sections from the same FFPE blocks, AP3B1 transcripts were quantified using custom RNA probe. Five-micron thick sections were cut from the paraffin blocks and mounted on glass slides. For each block two duplicate serial sections were mounted on a single slide, stained, and analyzed. Chromogenic in situ hybridization was performed on an automated stainer (Leica Bond RX, Leica Biosystems, Deer Park, IL) with RNAscope 2.5 LS Assay Reagent Kit-Red (Cat. # 322150, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) and Bond Polymer Refine Red Detection (Cat. # DS9390, Leica Biosystems) following manufacturer’s standard protocol. A probe was designed to detect region 301-1333 of human AP3B1 gene,  Reference Sequence 126221 (Cat. # 1262218-C1; Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Positive control probe detecting a housekeeping gene (human PPIB, cat # 313908, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) and a negative control probe detecting bacterial (Bacillus subtilis) dapB gene (cat #312038, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) were used to confirm adequate RNA preservation and detection, and absence of non-specific signal, respectively. The chromogen was fast red and the counterstain hematoxylin. Positive RNA hybridization was identified as discrete, punctate chromogenic red dots under brightfield microscopy. Images were acquired with an Olympus VS200 slides scanner and VS200 ASW 3.4.1 software (Evident Scientific, Hamburg, Germany) using a 40X/0.95NA objective and extended focal imaging mode to generate whole slide images with a pixel size of 0.1369 µm. Images were analyzed using Halo 3.5.3577 software and ISH module 4.2.3 (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM). The entire epidermis region was annotated manually and analyzed. As melanin pigment was observed in the epidermis it was set as an exclusion stain in order to avoid its false detection as red stain. Probe size was set at 1.0000 µm2. Average probe copy number per cell was reported. Image acquisition and analysis were performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.

    "results": "Results Transcriptome-wide changes in response to spaceflight To understand the impact of spaceflight to skin and tissue microenvironment, paired 4 mm skin punch biopsies from Inspiration4 crew members’ upper arms were used for pathology evaluation and spatial transcriptomics profiling (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). In total, 95 ROIs were collected across 16 slides for processing, with the GeoMx whole transcriptome profiling probe set (18,422 probes). Based on imaging we selected four region types of interest, including the outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and the vasculature (OE, IE, OD, and VA). We also performed a skin histopathology analysis from the biopsied samples, which showed no significant abnormalities or changes in tissue morphologies or gross architecture (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.From GeoMx spatial transcriptomics analysis, unsupervised clustering of all ROIs showed large clustering around compartmental identities. Slight shifts in response to spaceflight, and batch effects from both technical and biological replicates were not apparent after normalization (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Differential gene expression analysis comparing post-spaceflight to pre-spaceflight samples found significant upregulation in 95 genes (log2FC > 0 and q value < 0.05 by DESeq2) including ARHGAP31, GALNT9, CPNE2, NMB, GPR50, CLDN2, OOSP2, and downregulation in 121 genes (log2FC < 0 and q value < 0.05 by DESeq2) such as AP3B1, LMNA, COL6A2, VIM, HLA-B, PPP1CB, PABPC1 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore, proteins associated with cell junctions and extracellular matrices—particularly those from vimentin (VIM) and keratin (KRT) family—were the primary transcripts lost based on the DEG analyses. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed statistically significant enrichment in kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) signaling pathways, while transcripts associated with cell junctions and protein (i.e., apical junction, unfolded protein response) decreased (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Data 2). From expression levels, cell type composition for each ROI was estimated and compared across timepoints. We also observed statistically significant decreases in the cell type associated gene signatures of the major skin cell types and immune cells (e.g., melanocyte, pericyte, fibroblast, and T cells) (Fig. 1e). Region-specific expressions and spaceflight-induced changes We then investigated region-specific expression changes across pre- and post-spaceflight samples for each ROI type label (OE, IE, OD, and VA). OE and IE regions were selected based on and corresponds to stratum granulosum and spinosum/basal, respectively. OD ROIs were selected by capturing a minimum of 200 cells inside of the basal cell layer (therefore mostly papillary layer), while VA ROIs were collected based on epithelial (FAP) and fibroblast (αSMA) staining (Fig. 1a). We observed transcripts specific to each ROI label and timepoint (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). For each ROI type, differential gene expression analyses were performed comparing postflight samples relative to preflight samples (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 1). For example, we found that the decrease in transcripts related to fibroblast and junction genes (e.g., DES, ACTA2, TLN1, TAGLN) specifically near the vasculature sites (VA). Loss of KRT14 as well as other keratin family transcripts (KRT1, 5, and 10) were found predominantly in the dermal layer (OD). Taking the intersections of these DEGs to identify unique and overlapping genes across ROI types, we confirmed that most of the gene overlaps occur within ROI types that are relatively close to each other (i.e., VA and OD) (Fig. 2b). In particular, changes in AP3B1, a transcript related to granule formation, cytokine production, and inflammatory responses, were found in multiple comparisons (overall, OE, and OD) and was orthogonally validated with another technology, RNA scope (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c)23. In the inner layers of the tissue (OD and VA), we found overlapping DEGs related to stress and growth factor associated pathways, such as COL6A2, CRKL, HLA-B. Fig. 2. Region-specific gene expression profile and cellular composition changes. Open in a new tab a Volcano plot showing DEGs by ROI types—OE, IE, OD, and VA respectively; the number of DEGs were determined by cutoffs of adjusted p value < 0.1 and |log2FC| > 0.5 (using DESeq2 method), b UpSet plots comparing the intersections of region-specific DEGs, c Hallmark, non-germline gene set enrichment analysis across four ROI types; NES Normalized Enrichment Scores; Arrow indicates tissue locations, where OE is the outermost layer and VA is the innermost layer. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed the consistent increase of KRAS signaling and inflammatory responses across all regions while specific immune pathways such as Interferon alpha and gamma response showed positive enrichment only in epidermal regions (OE and IE) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 2). Pathways such as DNA repair, apoptosis, and UV response, reactive oxygen species were enriched only in the OE. We observed downregulation in genes involved with mitochondrial metabolism (e.g., myc target genes and oxidative phosphorylation) across all regions, particularly stronger in IE and OD ROIs. Also, the myogenesis pathway and EMT-related genes showed stronger decrease in enrichment scores in the VA ROIs, underscoring the region- and layer-specific responses to spaceflight. Comparing the pathway-level changes to blood sequencing datasets from the same mission and previous mission (NASA Twin Study, although with different duration of exposure), we found consistent changes in pathways such as KRAS signaling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 4d)5. In addition to differential analyses, we also found that the marker genes reported to be specific to each skin layer and cell type corresponded to the expression levels in each ROI type and were consistent with the previous findings (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c)24–26. Based on the reference datasets, deconvolved cell type abundances were compared across ROI types and timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 5a). We found a loss of melanocyte related gene signatures specifically in the middle layers (IE and OD), not in the outermost region (OE) or vascular region deeper in the dermal layer (VA). On the contrary, fibroblast related gene expressions were decreased across all regions except for the outermost epidermal layer (OE). Although fibroblast is an unanticipated cell type in the epidermis ROIs, decreased fibroblast signature could indicate loss or damage of cellular and matrix interactions, consistent with previous reports highlighting the role of fibroblasts with epidermal regeneration (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c)27,28. Epithelial barrier disruption and regeneration observed in post-spaceflight samples To investigate the phenotypic impact of spaceflight, we then focused on genes and pathways related to skin barrier formation, disruption, and regeneration. From the pathway analysis, we found enrichment changes in apical junction, UV stress response, hypoxia, and TGFβ signaling (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 2). Specifically, we observed a decrease in filaggrin (FLG) expression, a gene related to skin barrier function and plays a crucial role during epidermal differentiation by controlling interactions across cytoskeleton components, in postflight relative to preflight samples29. The decrease of FLG was the most evident in the OE region (Supplementary Data 1). Related to this observation, we also observed decreases in transcripts such as HAS1, HAS2, HAS3, OCLN, CLDN, TGM2 in the OE region (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3. Cellular microenvironment changes from spaceflight by tissue region. Open in a new tab a Gene expression changes of interest, b fold change of proportions in post-flight samples relative to pre-flight samples, by compartments, c cell type correlation matrix changes. Black boxes represent undetermined spots (due to minimal cell counts); boxes with X marks represent correlations that did not pass statistical testing (p value < 0.05, Pearson correlation, two-sided). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.The decrease in protein production and response potentially are connected to decrease in keratinocyte and increase in immune signatures (potentially related to interactions with T cells and fibroblasts) in OE region ROIs (Fig. 3b)30. Although weaker, the IE region shows a similar trend of cell proportion fold changes. Specifically, among fibroblast populations we also found that gene signatures of reticular fibroblast increased in postflight samples while there were no statistically significant changes in papillary fibroblast, suggesting disruptions in regeneration processes (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c)31,32. Taking co-occurrence of the proportion changes, cellular interactions within the ROIs were estimated. While cluster disruption was relatively minimal, an increase in melanocyte-macrophage interactions were found in the epidermis (OE and IE) ROIs (Fig. 3c). In addition, expression changes related to vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells and pericytes varied across the skin regions. The most pronounced cell signature changes were seen in the OE and VA compartments. In the OE compartment, we observed an increase in signatures related to lymphatic endothelial cells, potentially indicating the changes in the skin’s vascular and immune system (Fig. 3b). While blood and lymphatic capillaries are not typically found in the epidermis, these adaptations may be suggestive of a wound-healing phenotype with the skin, which is supported by our results showing increased damage, inflammation, apoptosis, ROS, hypoxia, angiogenesis, TGF-beta expression, etc., in the epidermis (Fig. 2c)33,34. On the other hand, in the VA compartment, there was an increase of gene signatures related to blood endothelium and decrease in lymphatic endothelium, also associated with vascular remodeling events. Skin-microbiota interaction changes during spaceflight To test whether immune activation and epithelial barrier disruption can be explained with external environmental change, we performed metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analysis on the skin swabs collected right before biopsies (Supplementary Fig. 6a). After assignment of taxonomic labels to DNA sequences, we identified 826 bacterial and 9819 viral species with non-zero counts from metagenomics analysis, and 88 bacterial and 1456 viral species from metatranscriptomics analysis (Supplementary Data 3). From PCA analysis, no major clustering was observed, although post flight samples were located closer to one another in the PCA space (Fig. 4a). The shifts of the samples were mostly from species from Staphylococcus and Streptococcus family, along the PC2 axis. Slight decrease in overall numbers of bacterial and viral species was observed in postflight samples relative to preflight, with one exception of C003 in metagenomics data and of C004 in metatranscriptomics data (Fig. 4b). Gross comparison of bacterial species by family showed decreased abundance in Actinobacteria (e.g., Actinomyces sp000220835) while increased abundance in Firmicutes/Bacillota (e.g., Peptoniphilus C/B) and Proteobacteria/Pseudomonadota (e.g., Caulobacter vibrioides, Sphingomonas carotinifaciens, Roseomonas mucosa/nepalensis) (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 6b). When grouped into genus, several species, including Cutibacterium (e.g., Cutibacterium acnes/avidum/modestum/porci), Mycobacterium (e.g., Mycobacterium paragordonae, Mycobacterium phocaicum), and Pseudomonas (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa/nitroreducens) showed statistically significant decrease (p values < 0.05). Several species including Streptococcus (e.g., Staphylococcus capitis, Streptococcus mitis BB) and Veillonella (e.g., Veillonella atypica/parvula/rogosae) showed significant increase (Fig. 4d). Also, species under the Staphylococcus genus, such as staphylococcus capitis/epidermidis/saprophyticus showed slight decrease while the relative abundances were highly variable across biological replicates.

Open in a new tab a PCA across all metagenomic and metatranscriptomic (bacterial and viral reads) relative abundance features and all crew members pre- and post-flight, b Total number of bacterial and viral species with nonzero counts, c Relative abundances by sample and timepoint, grouped by family, d Changes in relative abundance before and after spaceflight, grouped by genus; statistically significant or previously reported microbes are visualized (two-sided Wilcoxon test across four crew members was performed to compare means between pre- and post-flight samples and to obtain p values, and error bars represent the standard error of the mean), and e Correlation across relative abundance of bacterial phyla identified by metagenomics data and known barrier/immune genes associated with skin diseases and disruptions. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Changes of bacterial species were then linked to skin gene expression profiles, especially dermatitis-related genes (i.e., STAT3, STAT5B, FLG, CDSN, and ADAM17) previously associated with Staphylococcus species, as Staphylococcus aureus-dependent atopic dermatitis have been reported to activate immune system and reduce microbe diversity35–37 (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 6c). When subsetting previously reported bacterial species and associated genes, we found Staphylococcus species show an inverse relationship with JAK1 (Fig. 4e). In particular, Staphylococcus correlates closely to FLG, SPINK5, and DSG1, all of which are related with epithelial barriers (stratum corneum and junctional barriers)38. Also, microbes belong to Carnobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Nanosynbacteraceae, and Weeksellaceae families showed high correlation with both barrier and immune genes (CDSN, DSP, DSG1, SPINK5, FLG, and JAK1), whereas common skin microbes from Dermatophilaceae and Dermabacteraceae families showed no correlation. Although larger sample size is needed, it is possible that skin microbiome disruptions, such as those observed in these bacterial families, also contribute to barrier disruption and immune activation during short-term spaceflight. In addition, from alignment to known viral assemblies we found statistically significant decrease in abundance of reads associated with those from Uroviricota (i.e., Fromanvirus, Acadianvirus, Armstrongvirus, Amginevirus, Bixzunavirus) and Naldaviricetes (i.e., Alphabaculovirus), and increased abundance of reads associated with those from Negarnaviricota (i.e., Almendravirus, Orthotospovirus) and Cossaviricota (i.e., Betapapillomavirus, Betapolyomavirus) (p values < 0.05). Virome changes are limited by the depth of the sequencing and skin virome knowledge, however we also report relative abundances of both bacterial and viral species (Supplementary Data 3). To explore microbiota-skin interactions, we also identified potential associations between microbiome shifts from metagenomics/metatranscriptomics data and human gene expression from skin spatial transcriptomics data; these included associations were with viral phyla (i.e., Uroviricota, Cressdnaviricota, Phixviricota), which is a potentially interesting area to explore as more crew samples are collected. (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e and Supplementary Data 3). Immune changes in response to spaceflight To investigate immune changes that occur beneath the epidermis we also examined changes in immune cells in the profiled vascular regions vs. PBMCs. We saw overall decrease of T cells and increase of macrophage DCs in VA ROIs (Fig. 3b), indicating an immune-epidermis interaction. Related to this, we also observed increased cytokines and inflammatory signals including IL4, IL5, and IFNG in the inner regions (VA and OD ROIs) of the tissue (Fig. 5a)39,40. As a confirmation, we observed that these specific cytokines are also shown to be increased in cytokine assays from the crew members’ serum samples (Fig. 5b). To compare immune change observations from VA ROIs to system-wide immune system changes, we performed leveraged 10X multiome sequencing (dual snRNA and ATAC sequencing from each cell) on timepoint-matched PBMCs from the crew members (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We analyzed 151,411 cells across 9 gross cell types and performed differential expression analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). Overall, we observed fluctuations of T-cells across timepoints, consistent to the observations from skin spatial transcriptomics data (Fig. 5c, d and Supplementary Fig. 7d). Among 555 DEGs from multiome samples and 446 DEGs from GeoMx VA ROIs, 12 overlapping DEGs were found (both log2FC > 0.1 and p values < 0.01, DESeq2), including ATP11A, CEP85L, CEPT1, DMXL1, DOP1A, EVI5, GSAP, MDFIC, SENP7, TBCK, VAV3, and VPS13C (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Several of these genes are related to cellular metabolism and cytosolic transports. In particular, VAV3, one of signaling adapters in NK/T cell activation, has been previously reported to be associated with atopic dermatitis onset41–43. While all these overlapping DEGs were temporary in PBMCs, i.e., upregulated in the immediate postflight samples (R + 1 timepoint) and returned to pre-flight expression levels, the chromatin accessibility of these genes stayed slightly longer, up to R + 45 timepoint (Fig. 5d).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Finally, we derived cell type- and spaceflight-specific gene signatures from the multiome data, to examine any enrichment in the GeoMx samples (using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, or ssGSEA approach) (Fig. 5e). Most of the immune cell specific postflight DEGs enrichments were near the innermost ROIs (OD and VA), except for T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+), which showed enrichment in the postflight OE ROIs. While it was previously reported that spaceflight stressors change the immune system, increased enrichment of the T cells in the epidermal region correlates with activated T cell activity and connects to inflammatory responses and barrier disruptions44–48. Lastly, we found that these increased T cell signatures in the OE region may not have direct connection to Th17 T cells or psoriasis, rather have closer connection to the antigen-associated and lymphatic T cells infiltrated from inner layers of the skin (Fig. 5f)49,50. Also, the ssGSEA analysis using skin disease-associated gene signatures showed a slight increase in melanoma signatures. The slight increase can be explained with previous observations throughout this manuscript, including increase in cell death, immune activation, and stress response (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f), but more research is needed to prove the direct connection or causality of gene expression shifts.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, we applied a battery of omics methods of the Inspiration4 crew to discern the impact of spaceflight on the skin, collecting and integrating skin spatial transcriptomics data with clinical, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and single-cell sequencing data. By performing spatially resolved sequencing of astronaut skin biopsies before and after short-term spaceflight, we see varying transcriptomic and cellular changes and responses specific with their four skin layers (outer and inner epidermis, dermis, and vasculature) across 95 ROIs from all four crew members. To provide a more comprehensive view of these changes in response to the spaceflight environment and stressors, we correlated the spatial expression profiles with the metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data with the skin swab and PBMC single-cell sequencing data collected from the same crew member and from the same biopsy locations. The Inspiration4 mission was a short-term (3-day flight) spaceflight, with minimal exposure to radiation (about 2.7 mGy-Eq based on NASA Q quality factors and 50% FAX ModelEffective dose). Most of these changes are expected to be temporary, based on prior missions’ data, and due to fluid redistribution and stress from the spaceflight itself. At the molecular level, we observed consistent changes in immune signals and extracellular matrix and junction proteins in the postflight samples relative to preflight. Most evidently, we see a strong increase in gene expression of the KRAS pathway, which has previously been discussed in the context of space radiation51. In the context of skin, KRAS is known to alter epidermis homeostasis and induces redundant skin, papillomas, defective skin cell proliferation and differentiation and associated with many skin diseases such as melorheostosis, lymphangiomatosis, and vascular stenosis52–54. Activated KRAS, as a part of RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, is responsible for many angiogenic pathways, cytokine/chemokine productions, biochemical pathways (e.g., PI3K, RAF, etc.), and cellular proliferation/renewals55. When activated, the KRAS oncogene has the greatest mutation rate of all cancers, and is linked to several difficult to treat, highly lethal cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer56. In the context of keratinocyte biology, KRAS plays various roles including proliferation, survival, cell-cell adhesion, and polarity and redox balance, and the Ras pathway is also activated by integrins and negatively regulated by cell-cell adhesion57. KRAS has many roles across three key cell types, including: (1) endothelial cells (i.e., mechanotransduction pathways and integrin-associated events58), (2) fibroblast reprogramming (i.e., inflammatory gene expression and tissue extracellular signaling effectors, which polarizes immune populations while preventing tissue repair59), and (3) pericytes (i.e., wound healing and scar formation, and endothelial tubulogenesis, plus apical membrane and cytoskeletal polarization, which mediates the interaction between endothelial cells and pericytes60,61). From our results, we also see changes in various cell populations, including melanocyte, pericyte, fibroblast, and lymphatic endothelial cells, with KRAS being a likely mechanistic pathway being altered from spaceflight exposure within these cell populations leading to their phenotype changes. The impairment of skin cell proliferation is consistent with relative decrease in melanocytes and fibroblasts in postflight samples. Related to this observation, other non-inflammatory pathways such as WNT-βcatenin, TGFβ, Notch, ROS, glycolysis, apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, G2M checkpoints, also show significant changes. These pathways may provide more context as to why KRAS is changing, as well as the phenotypic adaptations and distribution changes seen with the cell populations. For example, from a metabolic perspective, an increase in glycolysis and a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation is tied with apoptotic events, decreased oxygen supply/hypoxia (e.g., change in cardiovascular function, increased inflammation, increased wound healing, etc.), as a compensatory response to the environmental insult. TGFβ is involved with ECM remodeling, inflammatory pathways, and these various cell types affect these biological events. Notch and WNT-βcatenin are involved with cytoskeletal/cell-cell adhesion processes. Furthermore, looking at the host of inflammatory pathways changing (interferon, TNFα, complement, interleukin), primarily pro-inflammatory given the timeframe of this mission as well as environmental insults (e.g., radiation exposure, weightlessness) that also exacerbate the biochemical pathways that are being shifted after spaceflight (e.g., metabolic, cell phenotypic, increased apoptosis, etc.). The spatial analysis enabled a unique study of gene expression changes, at higher resolution across the layers of skin, plus also within distinct tissue compartments. While all regions show varying but consistent enrichment in inflammation-related pathways, we are able to locate damage and repair related pathways (i.e., DNA repair, apoptosis, and UV response, reactive oxygen species) in epidermal (mostly outer layers) regions, suggesting that the skin’s stressors from spaceflight occur primarily in the outermost region. Space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly through interaction of charged particles with DNA itself or indirectly through the production of free radicals (which we also see from the increased oxidative stress transcripts)62. The type of DNA damage can also differ, from single-strand to double-strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, copy number variation, and other genomic changes. The level of DNA repair depends on the cell type and its capacity for repair as well, with more rapidly replicating cell types (e.g., epithelial cells vs. endothelial cells) having more active DNA repair mechanisms63. Of note, spaceflight can also cause increased reactive oxygen species production, likely also from radiation exposure64–68. We also identify specific keratin (KRT) transcripts in dermal layer and loss of fibroblast and cell junction transcripts including DES, ACTA2, TLN1, and TAGLN in vascular regions, which may be related to epithelial barrier disruptions and hindered regeneration. Various spaceflight and ground-analog studies have shown spaceflight induces oxidative damage to cell junctional proteins and adhesion. Further supporting epithelial barrier disruptions, we show decrease in barrier-related transcripts (i.e., FLG, HAS, OCLN, CLDN) and relate the loss of these proteins to microbiome changes using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data from the swabs. Some of these changes may be related to the changes in skin microbiota. Consistent to previous reports from the International Space Station (ISS), we find changes in microbes such as Corynebacterium, Actinomyces, and Staphylococcus in the Inspiration4 crew skin samples, despite the small sample size69. We then correlated microbiome changes with gene expression fluctuations and identified gene-microbe clusters. While many of these changes are known to be associated with the microbial composition within the capsule, systematic studies spanning spaceflight environment, skin surface, and gene expression will provide additional insights to which countermeasures are needed70,71. Connecting the findings in the immune system, we cross-validated these results with 10X multiome profiling of PBMCs and reported consistent immunological changes. We identify overall loss of immune cells in vascular ROIs, while T-cell signature increases in the outermost epidermal layers. T-cell migration and infiltration in epidermal layers have been previously associated with skin inflammation and several disease conditions72, and several other studies have connected immune system dysregulation and adaptations to spaceflight exposure. For example, consistent adaptive immune system changes (for example, T cells generally shift toward a Th2 phenotype) are consistent with our observation that T cells shifts can lead to fluctuations in cytokine concentration44,73. We also found increases in macrophages and various chemotactic markers (e.g., CCL2, CCL4, CXCL5), which are previously associated with spaceflight. These changes, which were predicted in peripheral, circulating blood cells, are shown within the vasculatures of the skin tissue microenvironment. Furthermore, by taking intersections of DEGs from both skin spatial profiling and PBMC single-cell, we saw an enrichment of genes related to neutrophils. Such observation is consistent with previous observations from space shuttle flights studies74. It has been shown that neutrophils increase in postflight samples, likely due to inflight stress rather than microgravity. Related to this observation, the changes in the microvascular network seen (both blood and lymphatic), may also be suggestive of local tissue adaptations resulting from fluid redistribution and interstitial pressure changes. It has been previously shown that microgravity-induced capillary transmural pressure (blood to tissue) change may reduce lymphatic flow and is discussed in the context of ocular health8,75. These changes in lymphatic flow and cellular microenvironment are also crucial for immune and stem cell interactions and turnovers, therefore deeper investigations to characterize the changes and develop countermeasures are crucial76,77. Overall, we present a thorough model of skin tissue (1) interacting with microbes and viruses on the surface, (2) changing expression profiles layer-by-layer, and (3) signaling from circulating PBMCs that likely interact with the peripheral skin vasculature. Our study is limited by four crew members, two timepoints, and a short-term mission, but to mediate this limitation, the data has been compared with other research and analog models (Henry Cope and Jonas Elsborg et al., Nature Communications, in review). In addition, some limitations are due to the unique challenges associated with the astronaut samples, including: their difficult procurement (biopsy), their rarity (there are few missions being conducted), and limited infrastructure for on-site sample collection and processing78–83. Nonetheless, these first structural and molecular views into the epidermal response to spaceflight highlight key KRAS, immune, and related pathways that can be integrated in the future missions and on-site monitoring of crews84 to help researchers understand the long-term effects of the spaceflight stressors and cellular changes we identified in this study.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166909 PMID: 38862494 Abstract Spaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear. To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response countermeasures. Subject terms: Computational models, Image processing, Outcomes research, Risk factors, Systems analysis Here the authors profile skin microenvironment changes in response to spaceflight by performing a multi omics analysis using skin punch biopsies from the crew members of SpaceX Inspiration4 mission comparing before, post launch and one day after return 91 of the 3-day mission.Introduction During both short- and long-duration spaceflight, the human body is exposed to various factors that are unique to the space environment, including weightlessness (e.g., microgravity), increased radiation, isolation, and confinement1,2. Due to the unique remote and spaceflight environment, lifestyle and hygienic practices are different from an Earth setting and often simplified due to the minimal resources and space available in a spacecraft (e.g., lack of showers, restrooms, limited clothing available)3. Moreover, significant physiological adaptations and overall shifts in biological homeostasis occur from spaceflight exposure, including musculoskeletal deconditioning, cardiovascular fluid shifts, vision loss (e.g., spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome), metabolic shifts, and mitochondrial and immune dysfunction4,5. Several studies have identified the effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, including fluid redistribution, orthostatic intolerance, changes in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, arterial stiffening, bone loss, atrophy of the striated and cardiac muscle groups, and increased risk of bone fracture1,6–12. The body’s largest organ, the skin, is another key physiological system sensitive to environmental changes. Human skin serves multiple functions, including physical and immunological protection, supporting microbiota (containing bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses) homeostasis, thermoregulation, fluid retention, and metabolism13–15. Also, since the skin is the outermost layer of the body and exposed to the direct, external environment, it is usually the first substrate affected by environmental changes an individual experiences, including environmental adaptations resulting from spaceflight. The skin serves as a unique organ for investigating the impacts of spaceflight on the human body as it encompasses a range of physiological elements, from surface microbiota and connective tissue to vasculatures, follicles, and the nervous and immune systems, alongside various skin cell types. It offers a comprehensive platform to understand the multifaceted effects of spaceflight. Unfortunately, few studies exist on the spaceflight environment’s impact on the skin, and observations to-date show that spaceflight may cause epidermal hypersensitivity and irritation, rarefaction of the cutaneous fiber network, and impaired epidermal proliferation and repair16–20. Nonetheless, the skin remains an understudied organ in the field of space biology; to date, fewer than ten astronaut case evaluations have been conducted3. Furthermore, only a few existing studies have examined transcript-level changes, and none of these studies has contextualized spatial or whole transcriptome gene expression or investigated the multiple omics components of skin adapting from spaceflight exposure3,21,22. Our study investigates skin samples collected from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission and, for the first time, explores the spatial-transcriptomic characterization of short-duration spaceflight’s impact on skin tissue. We comprehensively profiled skin microenvironment changes in response to spaceflight by performing a multi omics analysis using 4 mm skin punch biopsies from the crew members (n = 4) 44 days before launch (L-44) and 1 day after return (R + 1) of the 3-day mission. Tissue location specific gene expression levels were quantified using Nanostring GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) system across four regions of interest (ROI) targets, Outer Epidermis (OE) and Inner Epidermis (IE), Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA) compartments. From immunofluorescence images, we identified epidermis, dermis, and vascular area and subdivided epidermis ROIs into outer and inner layers, which corresponded to granular and spinous layer (OE) and basal layer (IE). In total, we analyzed 95 astronaut skin ROIs using the human whole-transcriptome atlas (WTA, 18,676 genes). We also correlate these transcript level findings with matched metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from skin swabs obtained prior to biopsy, as well as single-cell sequencing data (10X multiome single-cell ATAC and gene expression (GEX) characterizations) from isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).Results Transcriptome-wide changes in response to spaceflight To understand the impact of spaceflight to skin and tissue microenvironment, paired 4 mm skin punch biopsies from Inspiration4 crew members’ upper arms were used for pathology evaluation and spatial transcriptomics profiling (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). In total, 95 ROIs were collected across 16 slides for processing, with the GeoMx whole transcriptome profiling probe set (18,422 probes). Based on imaging we selected four region types of interest, including the outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and the vasculature (OE, IE, OD, and VA). We also performed a skin histopathology analysis from the biopsied samples, which showed no significant abnormalities or changes in tissue morphologies or gross architecture (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.From GeoMx spatial transcriptomics analysis, unsupervised clustering of all ROIs showed large clustering around compartmental identities. Slight shifts in response to spaceflight, and batch effects from both technical and biological replicates were not apparent after normalization (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Differential gene expression analysis comparing post-spaceflight to pre-spaceflight samples found significant upregulation in 95 genes (log2FC > 0 and q value < 0.05 by DESeq2) including ARHGAP31, GALNT9, CPNE2, NMB, GPR50, CLDN2, OOSP2, and downregulation in 121 genes (log2FC < 0 and q value < 0.05 by DESeq2) such as AP3B1, LMNA, COL6A2, VIM, HLA-B, PPP1CB, PABPC1 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore, proteins associated with cell junctions and extracellular matrices—particularly those from vimentin (VIM) and keratin (KRT) family—were the primary transcripts lost based on the DEG analyses. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed statistically significant enrichment in kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) signaling pathways, while transcripts associated with cell junctions and protein (i.e., apical junction, unfolded protein response) decreased (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Data 2). From expression levels, cell type composition for each ROI was estimated and compared across timepoints. We also observed statistically significant decreases in the cell type associated gene signatures of the major skin cell types and immune cells (e.g., melanocyte, pericyte, fibroblast, and T cells) (Fig. 1e).Region-specific expressions and spaceflight-induced changes We then investigated region-specific expression changes across pre- and post-spaceflight samples for each ROI type label (OE, IE, OD, and VA). OE and IE regions were selected based on and corresponds to stratum granulosum and spinosum/basal, respectively. OD ROIs were selected by capturing a minimum of 200 cells inside of the basal cell layer (therefore mostly papillary layer), while VA ROIs were collected based on epithelial (FAP) and fibroblast (αSMA) staining (Fig. 1a). We observed transcripts specific to each ROI label and timepoint (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). For each ROI type, differential gene expression analyses were performed comparing postflight samples relative to preflight samples (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 1). For example, we found that the decrease in transcripts related to fibroblast and junction genes (e.g., DES, ACTA2, TLN1, TAGLN) specifically near the vasculature sites (VA). Loss of KRT14 as well as other keratin family transcripts (KRT1, 5, and 10) were found predominantly in the dermal layer (OD). Taking the intersections of these DEGs to identify unique and overlapping genes across ROI types, we confirmed that most of the gene overlaps occur within ROI types that are relatively close to each other (i.e., VA and OD) (Fig. 2b). In particular, changes in AP3B1, a transcript related to granule formation, cytokine production, and inflammatory responses, were found in multiple comparisons (overall, OE, and OD) and was orthogonally validated with another technology, RNA scope (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c)23. In the inner layers of the tissue (OD and VA), we found overlapping DEGs related to stress and growth factor associated pathways, such as COL6A2, CRKL, HLA-B. Fig. 2. Region-specific gene expression profile and cellular composition changes. Open in a new tab a Volcano plot showing DEGs by ROI types—OE, IE, OD, and VA respectively; the number of DEGs were determined by cutoffs of adjusted p value < 0.1 and |log2FC| > 0.5 (using DESeq2 method), b UpSet plots comparing the intersections of region-specific DEGs, c Hallmark, non-germline gene set enrichment analysis across four ROI types; NES Normalized Enrichment Scores; Arrow indicates tissue locations, where OE is the outermost layer and VA is the innermost layer. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed the consistent increase of KRAS signaling and inflammatory responses across all regions while specific immune pathways such as Interferon alpha and gamma response showed positive enrichment only in epidermal regions (OE and IE) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 2). Pathways such as DNA repair, apoptosis, and UV response, reactive oxygen species were enriched only in the OE. We observed downregulation in genes involved with mitochondrial metabolism (e.g., myc target genes and oxidative phosphorylation) across all regions, particularly stronger in IE and OD ROIs. Also, the myogenesis pathway and EMT-related genes showed stronger decrease in enrichment scores in the VA ROIs, underscoring the region- and layer-specific responses to spaceflight. Comparing the pathway-level changes to blood sequencing datasets from the same mission and previous mission (NASA Twin Study, although with different duration of exposure), we found consistent changes in pathways such as KRAS signaling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 4d)5. In addition to differential analyses, we also found that the marker genes reported to be specific to each skin layer and cell type corresponded to the expression levels in each ROI type and were consistent with the previous findings (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c)24–26. Based on the reference datasets, deconvolved cell type abundances were compared across ROI types and timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 5a). We found a loss of melanocyte related gene signatures specifically in the middle layers (IE and OD), not in the outermost region (OE) or vascular region deeper in the dermal layer (VA). On the contrary, fibroblast related gene expressions were decreased across all regions except for the outermost epidermal layer (OE). Although fibroblast is an unanticipated cell type in the epidermis ROIs, decreased fibroblast signature could indicate loss or damage of cellular and matrix interactions, consistent with previous reports highlighting the role of fibroblasts with epidermal regeneration (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c)27,28.Epithelial barrier disruption and regeneration observed in post-spaceflight samples To investigate the phenotypic impact of spaceflight, we then focused on genes and pathways related to skin barrier formation, disruption, and regeneration. From the pathway analysis, we found enrichment changes in apical junction, UV stress response, hypoxia, and TGFβ signaling (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 2). Specifically, we observed a decrease in filaggrin (FLG) expression, a gene related to skin barrier function and plays a crucial role during epidermal differentiation by controlling interactions across cytoskeleton components, in postflight relative to preflight samples29. The decrease of FLG was the most evident in the OE region (Supplementary Data 1). Related to this observation, we also observed decreases in transcripts such as HAS1, HAS2, HAS3, OCLN, CLDN, TGM2 in the OE region (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3. Cellular microenvironment changes from spaceflight by tissue region. Open in a new tab a Gene expression changes of interest, b fold change of proportions in post-flight samples relative to pre-flight samples, by compartments, c cell type correlation matrix changes. Black boxes represent undetermined spots (due to minimal cell counts); boxes with X marks represent correlations that did not pass statistical testing (p value < 0.05, Pearson correlation, two-sided). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.The decrease in protein production and response potentially are connected to decrease in keratinocyte and increase in immune signatures (potentially related to interactions with T cells and fibroblasts) in OE region ROIs (Fig. 3b)30. Although weaker, the IE region shows a similar trend of cell proportion fold changes. Specifically, among fibroblast populations we also found that gene signatures of reticular fibroblast increased in postflight samples while there were no statistically significant changes in papillary fibroblast, suggesting disruptions in regeneration processes (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c)31,32. Taking co-occurrence of the proportion changes, cellular interactions within the ROIs were estimated. While cluster disruption was relatively minimal, an increase in melanocyte-macrophage interactions were found in the epidermis (OE and IE) ROIs (Fig. 3c). In addition, expression changes related to vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells and pericytes varied across the skin regions. The most pronounced cell signature changes were seen in the OE and VA compartments. In the OE compartment, we observed an increase in signatures related to lymphatic endothelial cells, potentially indicating the changes in the skin’s vascular and immune system (Fig. 3b). While blood and lymphatic capillaries are not typically found in the epidermis, these adaptations may be suggestive of a wound-healing phenotype with the skin, which is supported by our results showing increased damage, inflammation, apoptosis, ROS, hypoxia, angiogenesis, TGF-beta expression, etc., in the epidermis (Fig. 2c)33,34. On the other hand, in the VA compartment, there was an increase of gene signatures related to blood endothelium and decrease in lymphatic endothelium, also associated with vascular remodeling events.Skin-microbiota interaction changes during spaceflight To test whether immune activation and epithelial barrier disruption can be explained with external environmental change, we performed metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analysis on the skin swabs collected right before biopsies (Supplementary Fig. 6a). After assignment of taxonomic labels to DNA sequences, we identified 826 bacterial and 9819 viral species with non-zero counts from metagenomics analysis, and 88 bacterial and 1456 viral species from metatranscriptomics analysis (Supplementary Data 3). From PCA analysis, no major clustering was observed, although post flight samples were located closer to one another in the PCA space (Fig. 4a). The shifts of the samples were mostly from species from Staphylococcus and Streptococcus family, along the PC2 axis. Slight decrease in overall numbers of bacterial and viral species was observed in postflight samples relative to preflight, with one exception of C003 in metagenomics data and of C004 in metatranscriptomics data (Fig. 4b). Gross comparison of bacterial species by family showed decreased abundance in Actinobacteria (e.g., Actinomyces sp000220835) while increased abundance in Firmicutes/Bacillota (e.g., Peptoniphilus C/B) and Proteobacteria/Pseudomonadota (e.g., Caulobacter vibrioides, Sphingomonas carotinifaciens, Roseomonas mucosa/nepalensis) (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 6b). When grouped into genus, several species, including Cutibacterium (e.g., Cutibacterium acnes/avidum/modestum/porci), Mycobacterium (e.g., Mycobacterium paragordonae, Mycobacterium phocaicum), and Pseudomonas (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa/nitroreducens) showed statistically significant decrease (p values < 0.05). Several species including Streptococcus (e.g., Staphylococcus capitis, Streptococcus mitis BB) and Veillonella (e.g., Veillonella atypica/parvula/rogosae) showed significant increase (Fig. 4d). Also, species under the Staphylococcus genus, such as staphylococcus capitis/epidermidis/saprophyticus showed slight decrease while the relative abundances were highly variable across biological replicates. Fig. 4. Skin metagenomics and transcriptomics analysis for skin-microbiota interaction map. Open in a new tab a PCA across all metagenomic and metatranscriptomic (bacterial and viral reads) relative abundance features and all crew members pre- and post-flight, b Total number of bacterial and viral species with nonzero counts, c Relative abundances by sample and timepoint, grouped by family, d Changes in relative abundance before and after spaceflight, grouped by genus; statistically significant or previously reported microbes are visualized (two-sided Wilcoxon test across four crew members was performed to compare means between pre- and post-flight samples and to obtain p values, and error bars represent the standard error of the mean), and e Correlation across relative abundance of bacterial phyla identified by metagenomics data and known barrier/immune genes associated with skin diseases and disruptions. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Changes of bacterial species were then linked to skin gene expression profiles, especially dermatitis-related genes (i.e., STAT3, STAT5B, FLG, CDSN, and ADAM17) previously associated with Staphylococcus species, as Staphylococcus aureus-dependent atopic dermatitis have been reported to activate immune system and reduce microbe diversity35–37 (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 6c). When subsetting previously reported bacterial species and associated genes, we found Staphylococcus species show an inverse relationship with JAK1 (Fig. 4e). In particular, Staphylococcus correlates closely to FLG, SPINK5, and DSG1, all of which are related with epithelial barriers (stratum corneum and junctional barriers)38. Also, microbes belong to Carnobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Nanosynbacteraceae, and Weeksellaceae families showed high correlation with both barrier and immune genes (CDSN, DSP, DSG1, SPINK5, FLG, and JAK1), whereas common skin microbes from Dermatophilaceae and Dermabacteraceae families showed no correlation. Although larger sample size is needed, it is possible that skin microbiome disruptions, such as those observed in these bacterial families, also contribute to barrier disruption and immune activation during short-term spaceflight. In addition, from alignment to known viral assemblies we found statistically significant decrease in abundance of reads associated with those from Uroviricota (i.e., Fromanvirus, Acadianvirus, Armstrongvirus, Amginevirus, Bixzunavirus) and Naldaviricetes (i.e., Alphabaculovirus), and increased abundance of reads associated with those from Negarnaviricota (i.e., Almendravirus, Orthotospovirus) and Cossaviricota (i.e., Betapapillomavirus, Betapolyomavirus) (p values < 0.05). Virome changes are limited by the depth of the sequencing and skin virome knowledge, however we also report relative abundances of both bacterial and viral species (Supplementary Data 3). To explore microbiota-skin interactions, we also identified potential associations between microbiome shifts from metagenomics/metatranscriptomics data and human gene expression from skin spatial transcriptomics data; these included associations were with viral phyla (i.e., Uroviricota, Cressdnaviricota, Phixviricota), which is a potentially interesting area to explore as more crew samples are collected. (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e and Supplementary Data 3).Immune changes in response to spaceflight To investigate immune changes that occur beneath the epidermis we also examined changes in immune cells in the profiled vascular regions vs. PBMCs. We saw overall decrease of T cells and increase of macrophage DCs in VA ROIs (Fig. 3b), indicating an immune-epidermis interaction. Related to this, we also observed increased cytokines and inflammatory signals including IL4, IL5, and IFNG in the inner regions (VA and OD ROIs) of the tissue (Fig. 5a)39,40. As a confirmation, we observed that these specific cytokines are also shown to be increased in cytokine assays from the crew members’ serum samples (Fig. 5b). To compare immune change observations from VA ROIs to system-wide immune system changes, we performed leveraged 10X multiome sequencing (dual snRNA and ATAC sequencing from each cell) on timepoint-matched PBMCs from the crew members (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We analyzed 151,411 cells across 9 gross cell types and performed differential expression analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). Overall, we observed fluctuations of T-cells across timepoints, consistent to the observations from skin spatial transcriptomics data (Fig. 5c, d and Supplementary Fig. 7d). Among 555 DEGs from multiome samples and 446 DEGs from GeoMx VA ROIs, 12 overlapping DEGs were found (both log2FC > 0.1 and p values < 0.01, DESeq2), including ATP11A, CEP85L, CEPT1, DMXL1, DOP1A, EVI5, GSAP, MDFIC, SENP7, TBCK, VAV3, and VPS13C (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Several of these genes are related to cellular metabolism and cytosolic transports. In particular, VAV3, one of signaling adapters in NK/T cell activation, has been previously reported to be associated with atopic dermatitis onset41–43. While all these overlapping DEGs were temporary in PBMCs, i.e., upregulated in the immediate postflight samples (R + 1 timepoint) and returned to pre-flight expression levels, the chromatin accessibility of these genes stayed slightly longer, up to R + 45 timepoint (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5. Changes in the skin immune system relates to peripheral blood immune cell changes. Open in a new tab a Notable cytokine changes and locations from (a) skin transcriptomics data by region and, b cytokine assay from serum samples (sig.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Finally, we derived cell type- and spaceflight-specific gene signatures from the multiome data, to examine any enrichment in the GeoMx samples (using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, or ssGSEA approach) (Fig. 5e). Most of the immune cell specific postflight DEGs enrichments were near the innermost ROIs (OD and VA), except for T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+), which showed enrichment in the postflight OE ROIs. While it was previously reported that spaceflight stressors change the immune system, increased enrichment of the T cells in the epidermal region correlates with activated T cell activity and connects to inflammatory responses and barrier disruptions44–48. Lastly, we found that these increased T cell signatures in the OE region may not have direct connection to Th17 T cells or psoriasis, rather have closer connection to the antigen-associated and lymphatic T cells infiltrated from inner layers of the skin (Fig. 5f)49,50. Also, the ssGSEA analysis using skin disease-associated gene signatures showed a slight increase in melanoma signatures. The slight increase can be explained with previous observations throughout this manuscript, including increase in cell death, immune activation, and stress response (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f), but more research is needed to prove the direct connection or causality of gene expression shifts.Discussion In this study, we applied a battery of omics methods of the Inspiration4 crew to discern the impact of spaceflight on the skin, collecting and integrating skin spatial transcriptomics data with clinical, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and single-cell sequencing data. By performing spatially resolved sequencing of astronaut skin biopsies before and after short-term spaceflight, we see varying transcriptomic and cellular changes and responses specific with their four skin layers (outer and inner epidermis, dermis, and vasculature) across 95 ROIs from all four crew members. To provide a more comprehensive view of these changes in response to the spaceflight environment and stressors, we correlated the spatial expression profiles with the metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data with the skin swab and PBMC single-cell sequencing data collected from the same crew member and from the same biopsy locations. The Inspiration4 mission was a short-term (3-day flight) spaceflight, with minimal exposure to radiation (about 2.7 mGy-Eq based on NASA Q quality factors and 50% FAX ModelEffective dose). Most of these changes are expected to be temporary, based on prior missions’ data, and due to fluid redistribution and stress from the spaceflight itself. At the molecular level, we observed consistent changes in immune signals and extracellular matrix and junction proteins in the postflight samples relative to preflight. Most evidently, we see a strong increase in gene expression of the KRAS pathway, which has previously been discussed in the context of space radiation51. In the context of skin, KRAS is known to alter epidermis homeostasis and induces redundant skin, papillomas, defective skin cell proliferation and differentiation and associated with many skin diseases such as melorheostosis, lymphangiomatosis, and vascular stenosis52–54. Activated KRAS, as a part of RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, is responsible for many angiogenic pathways, cytokine/chemokine productions, biochemical pathways (e.g., PI3K, RAF, etc.), and cellular proliferation/renewals55. When activated, the KRAS oncogene has the greatest mutation rate of all cancers, and is linked to several difficult to treat, highly lethal cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer56. In the context of keratinocyte biology, KRAS plays various roles including proliferation, survival, cell-cell adhesion, and polarity and redox balance, and the Ras pathway is also activated by integrins and negatively regulated by cell-cell adhesion57. KRAS has many roles across three key cell types, including: (1) endothelial cells (i.e., mechanotransduction pathways and integrin-associated events58), (2) fibroblast reprogramming (i.e., inflammatory gene expression and tissue extracellular signaling effectors, which polarizes immune populations while preventing tissue repair59), and (3) pericytes (i.e., wound healing and scar formation, and endothelial tubulogenesis, plus apical membrane and cytoskeletal polarization, which mediates the interaction between endothelial cells and pericytes60,61). From our results, we also see changes in various cell populations, including melanocyte, pericyte, fibroblast, and lymphatic endothelial cells, with KRAS being a likely mechanistic pathway being altered from spaceflight exposure within these cell populations leading to their phenotype changes. The impairment of skin cell proliferation is consistent with relative decrease in melanocytes and fibroblasts in postflight samples. Related to this observation, other non-inflammatory pathways such as WNT-βcatenin, TGFβ, Notch, ROS, glycolysis, apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, G2M checkpoints, also show significant changes. These pathways may provide more context as to why KRAS is changing, as well as the phenotypic adaptations and distribution changes seen with the cell populations. For example, from a metabolic perspective, an increase in glycolysis and a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation is tied with apoptotic events, decreased oxygen supply/hypoxia (e.g., change in cardiovascular function, increased inflammation, increased wound healing, etc.), as a compensatory response to the environmental insult. TGFβ is involved with ECM remodeling, inflammatory pathways, and these various cell types affect these biological events. Notch and WNT-βcatenin are involved with cytoskeletal/cell-cell adhesion processes. Furthermore, looking at the host of inflammatory pathways changing (interferon, TNFα, complement, interleukin), primarily pro-inflammatory given the timeframe of this mission as well as environmental insults (e.g., radiation exposure, weightlessness) that also exacerbate the biochemical pathways that are being shifted after spaceflight (e.g., metabolic, cell phenotypic, increased apoptosis, etc.). The spatial analysis enabled a unique study of gene expression changes, at higher resolution across the layers of skin, plus also within distinct tissue compartments. While all regions show varying but consistent enrichment in inflammation-related pathways, we are able to locate damage and repair related pathways (i.e., DNA repair, apoptosis, and UV response, reactive oxygen species) in epidermal (mostly outer layers) regions, suggesting that the skin’s stressors from spaceflight occur primarily in the outermost region. Space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly through interaction of charged particles with DNA itself or indirectly through the production of free radicals (which we also see from the increased oxidative stress transcripts)62. The type of DNA damage can also differ, from single-strand to double-strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, copy number variation, and other genomic changes. The level of DNA repair depends on the cell type and its capacity for repair as well, with more rapidly replicating cell types (e.g., epithelial cells vs. endothelial cells) having more active DNA repair mechanisms63. Of note, spaceflight can also cause increased reactive oxygen species production, likely also from radiation exposure64–68. We also identify specific keratin (KRT) transcripts in dermal layer and loss of fibroblast and cell junction transcripts including DES, ACTA2, TLN1, and TAGLN in vascular regions, which may be related to epithelial barrier disruptions and hindered regeneration. Various spaceflight and ground-analog studies have shown spaceflight induces oxidative damage to cell junctional proteins and adhesion. Further supporting epithelial barrier disruptions, we show decrease in barrier-related transcripts (i.e., FLG, HAS, OCLN, CLDN) and relate the loss of these proteins to microbiome changes using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data from the swabs. Some of these changes may be related to the changes in skin microbiota. Consistent to previous reports from the International Space Station (ISS), we find changes in microbes such as Corynebacterium, Actinomyces, and Staphylococcus in the Inspiration4 crew skin samples, despite the small sample size69. We then correlated microbiome changes with gene expression fluctuations and identified gene-microbe clusters. While many of these changes are known to be associated with the microbial composition within the capsule, systematic studies spanning spaceflight environment, skin surface, and gene expression will provide additional insights to which countermeasures are needed70,71. Connecting the findings in the immune system, we cross-validated these results with 10X multiome profiling of PBMCs and reported consistent immunological changes. We identify overall loss of immune cells in vascular ROIs, while T-cell signature increases in the outermost epidermal layers. T-cell migration and infiltration in epidermal layers have been previously associated with skin inflammation and several disease conditions72, and several other studies have connected immune system dysregulation and adaptations to spaceflight exposure. For example, consistent adaptive immune system changes (for example, T cells generally shift toward a Th2 phenotype) are consistent with our observation that T cells shifts can lead to fluctuations in cytokine concentration44,73. We also found increases in macrophages and various chemotactic markers (e.g., CCL2, CCL4, CXCL5), which are previously associated with spaceflight. These changes, which were predicted in peripheral, circulating blood cells, are shown within the vasculatures of the skin tissue microenvironment. Furthermore, by taking intersections of DEGs from both skin spatial profiling and PBMC single-cell, we saw an enrichment of genes related to neutrophils. Such observation is consistent with previous observations from space shuttle flights studies74. It has been shown that neutrophils increase in postflight samples, likely due to inflight stress rather than microgravity. Related to this observation, the changes in the microvascular network seen (both blood and lymphatic), may also be suggestive of local tissue adaptations resulting from fluid redistribution and interstitial pressure changes. It has been previously shown that microgravity-induced capillary transmural pressure (blood to tissue) change may reduce lymphatic flow and is discussed in the context of ocular health8,75. These changes in lymphatic flow and cellular microenvironment are also crucial for immune and stem cell interactions and turnovers, therefore deeper investigations to characterize the changes and develop countermeasures are crucial76,77. Overall, we present a thorough model of skin tissue (1) interacting with microbes and viruses on the surface, (2) changing expression profiles layer-by-layer, and (3) signaling from circulating PBMCs that likely interact with the peripheral skin vasculature. Our study is limited by four crew members, two timepoints, and a short-term mission, but to mediate this limitation, the data has been compared with other research and analog models (Henry Cope and Jonas Elsborg et al., Nature Communications, in review). In addition, some limitations are due to the unique challenges associated with the astronaut samples, including: their difficult procurement (biopsy), their rarity (there are few missions being conducted), and limited infrastructure for on-site sample collection and processing78–83. Nonetheless, these first structural and molecular views into the epidermal response to spaceflight highlight key KRAS, immune, and related pathways that can be integrated in the future missions and on-site monitoring of crews84 to help researchers understand the long-term effects of the spaceflight stressors and cellular changes we identified in this study.Methods IRB statement The research in this manuscript complies with all relevant ethical regulations. Tissue samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members (n = 4, two males and two females) after consent for research use of the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569).Sample collection Skin biopsy and swabs The biopsies were collected from all four crew members’ right (preflight) and left (postflight) deltoid (or upper arm) that were anatomically the same, matched locations, except for one crew member. For this crew member, both timepoints were collected from the right arm, approximately 1.5 inches away from one another. The average age of the crew members was 41.5 and consisted of two males and two females. Prior to biopsy, the selected areas were swabbed for 30 s with pressure using an Isohelix Swab dampened with DNase and RNase free water. The swabs were stored in the pre-labeled Thermo Fisher 2D barcoded tubes with DNA/RNA Shield Stabilization Solution (Zymo Research, cat# R1100-250) added. After the swab, the area was disinfected using CloraPrep (BD Biosciences) followed by injection of 1% lidocaine and 1/100,000 epinephrine. The biopsies were performed using a trephine punch (Miltex). If desired, the surgical sites were either closed with two 5-0 Vicryl sutures or applied pressure to stop bleeding. To prevent infection and allow healing, bacitracin ointment or sterile petrolatum was applied to the biopsied site followed by Band-Aids and after-care instructions. The resected piece was cut into approximately 1/3 and 2/3 sections. The smaller piece was fixed with formalin and stored at room temperature for histology and pathology. The larger piece was flash frozen for GeoMx analysis.PBMC isolations For each crew member, 8 ml of venous blood was collected in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant tubes. Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from whole blood using the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µl/ml of blood) for 20 min at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identified using side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single-cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or Multiome (GEX and ATAC) libraries.Spatial transcriptomics analysis GeoMx digital spatial profiling Skin biopsy samples from four crew members were collected and frozen in cryovials pre and post flight. Collected skin was flash embedded in OCT blocks. Three or four replicate of OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide per subject including pre and post flight replicates. Tissues were then cryosectioned at 5 µm thickness and attached to glass microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, cat# 22-037-246). Immunofluorescent visualization marker for Pan-Cytokeratin (PanCK, Novus cat# NBP2-33200AF532, Alexa Fluor® 532, clone ID AE1 + AE3, 1:40 dilution), fibroblast activation protein (FAP, Abcam cat# ab222924, clone ID EPR20021, conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 594 using Thermo Fisher antibody labeling kit cat# A20185, 1:20 dilution) and smooth muscle actin (SMA, R&D Systems cat# IC1420R, Alexa Fluor® 647, clone 1A4, 1:200 dilution) were used for region or interest (ROI) selection. The DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to assess genes collected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides were thawed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) at 4 °C followed by PBS washes for thorough fixation. After washes, slides were prepared following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Preparation Protocol for fixed frozen samples, digesting samples with 1.0 µg/ml proteinase K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at 100 °C (NanoString, no. MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM final concentration were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology markers were prepared for four slides concurrently using Syto13 (DNA), PanCK, FAP and SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per slide. Slides incubated with 225 μl of morphology marker solution at RT for 1 h, then washed in SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP instrument. The 20x scan was used to select freeform ROIs to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. OE ROIs covered spinous and granular layers, while IE ROIs covered the basal layer, identified from the staining of the tissue. To ensure proper selection and to avoid overlaps across different ROI types, small gaps between each ROI type were made, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI. FASTQ files were then converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the normalized count matrix, DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis (Supplementary Data 1), and FGSEA was used for pathway enrichment analysis, which uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like enrichment score test to obtain statistics (Supplementary Data 2). GSVA was used to run ssGSEA analysis with custom gene signatures obtained from published single-cell and bulk skin datasets25,26. The methods used to perform data exploration and visualization have been published previously78.PBMC single-cell sequencing analysis Library preparation and sequencing To capture T cell and B cell variability, diversity, and joining (VDJ) repertoire, single-cell gel beads-in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics). Prior to single-cell Multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µl of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% digitonin, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 4 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 ml cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), nuclei were resuspended in diluted nuclei buffer (10x Genomics Single-Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6000 nuclei per µl. Single-cell libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single-Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system. GEX and ATAC libraries were processed using Cell Ranger arc v2.0.0. VDJ libraries were processed using Cell Ranger v6.1.1. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome.Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analysis DNA/RNA library preparation and sequencing Samples were collected prior to processing as isohelix swabs stored in 400 ul of Zymo Research DNA/RNA shield (cat# R1100) in Thermo Fisher Matrix 1.0 ml ScrewTop Tubes (cat# 3741-WP1D-BR). Prior to beginning the extraction protocol, samples were vortexed for 5 s using the MO BIO Vortex Adapter tube holder (cat# 13000-V1-24) to ensure maximum biomolecular yield from the collected swabs. Due to loss in DNA/RNA shield during sample collection, sample volume was transferred into AllPrep Bacterial Bead Tubes provided by the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (cat# 47054) and the volume of samples were adjusted to 350 ul prior to further processing to ensure sufficient input volume for the extraction protocol. DNA/RNA/Protein extraction was performed using the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (cat# 47054). Steps one and two were omitted from the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit manufacturer’s protocol as these samples were not generated through bacterial culture. Aside from this omission, samples were extracted following the manufacturer’s protocol. Following the completion of the extraction protocol, the extracted DNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (cat# Q33231), extracted RNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (cat# Q32855), and extracted protein was measured using the Thermo Fisher Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay (cat # A53225). All quantification protocols were conducted per manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted DNA and cDNA (from RNA) samples for Illumina Whole genome sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96 Samples). In total, 408 DNA samples (4 × 96-well plates and 24 samples on a 5th 96-well plate) were library prepared and pooled into a total of 4 pools—96 samples were pooled into 1 (for plates 1, 2 and 3), except for plates 4 and 5, where 120 libraries were pooled into 1. Each library pool was sequenced using 2 × 150 Paired end sequencing on S4 flow cell using NovaSeq 6000 sequencer, one pool per lane of the S4 flow cell.Genomic data preprocessing and quality control All metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples underwent the same quality control pipeline prior to downstream analysis. Software used was run with the default settings unless otherwise specified. The majority of our quality control pipeline makes use of bbtools (V38.92), starting with clumpify [parameters: optical = f, dupesubs = 2, dedupe = t] to group reads, bbduk [parameters: qout = 33 trd = t hdist = 1 k = 27 ktrim = “r” mink = 8 overwrite = true trimq = 10 qtrim = “rl” threads = 10 minlength = 51 maxns = −1 minbasefrequency = 0.05 ecco = f] to remove adapter contamination, and tadpole [parameters: mode = correct, ecc = t, ecco = t] to remove sequencing error79. Unmatching reads were removed using bbtool’s repair function. Alignment to the human genome with Bowtie2 (parameters: --very-sensitive-local) was done to remove potentially human-contaminating reads80.Taxonomic abundance quantification We used the XTree (https://github.com/GabeAl/UTree) [parameters: –redistribute] to quantify the bacterial and viral taxonomic compositions of the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. XTree is the recent version of Utree81; it implements an optimized alignment approach and increased ease of use. In brief, XTree is a k-mer based aligner (akin to Kraken282, but faster and designed for larger databases) that uses capitalist read redistribution in order to pick the highest-likelihood mapping between a read and a given reference based on the overall support of all reads in a sample for said reference83. Notably, it reports the total coverage of a given query genome, as well as total unique coverage, which refers to coverage of regions found in only one genome of an entire genome database. We generated an XTree k-mer database [parameters: XTree BUILD k 29 comp 0] from the Genome Taxonomy Database representative species dataset (Release 207) and aligned both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. For the metagenomic sequencing, we filtered for genomes that had at least 0.5% coverage (i.e., approximately 15 genes in 3000 genes, each 1000 bp) and/or 0.25% unique coverage. Relative abundances were calculated by dividing the total reads assigned to a given genome by the total number of reads assigned to all genomes in each sample.Cytokine assay Biochemical assays from the serum samples obtained from the same i4 crew members was performed using the bead-based multiplexed assay protocols provided by Eve Technologies (https://www.evetechnologies.com/cytokine/). Two biomarker profiling panels were used: (1) Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HD71) and (2) Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9). Concentration values from the assay were extrapolated using a 4 of 5 parameter logic standard curve.Chromogenic in situ hybridization Using additional sections from the same FFPE blocks, AP3B1 transcripts were quantified using custom RNA probe. Five-micron thick sections were cut from the paraffin blocks and mounted on glass slides. For each block two duplicate serial sections were mounted on a single slide, stained, and analyzed. Chromogenic in situ hybridization was performed on an automated stainer (Leica Bond RX, Leica Biosystems, Deer Park, IL) with RNAscope 2.5 LS Assay Reagent Kit-Red (Cat. # 322150, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) and Bond Polymer Refine Red Detection (Cat. # DS9390, Leica Biosystems) following manufacturer’s standard protocol. A probe was designed to detect region 301-1333 of human AP3B1 gene,  Reference Sequence 126221 (Cat. # 1262218-C1; Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Positive control probe detecting a housekeeping gene (human PPIB, cat # 313908, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) and a negative control probe detecting bacterial (Bacillus subtilis) dapB gene (cat #312038, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) were used to confirm adequate RNA preservation and detection, and absence of non-specific signal, respectively. The chromogen was fast red and the counterstain hematoxylin. Positive RNA hybridization was identified as discrete, punctate chromogenic red dots under brightfield microscopy. Images were acquired with an Olympus VS200 slides scanner and VS200 ASW 3.4.1 software (Evident Scientific, Hamburg, Germany) using a 40X/0.95NA objective and extended focal imaging mode to generate whole slide images with a pixel size of 0.1369 µm. Images were analyzed using Halo 3.5.3577 software and ISH module 4.2.3 (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM). The entire epidermis region was annotated manually and analyzed. As melanin pigment was observed in the epidermis it was set as an exclusion stain in order to avoid its false detection as red stain. Probe size was set at 1.0000 µm2. Average probe copy number per cell was reported. Image acquisition and analysis were performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (18.3MB, pdf) Peer Review File (3.3MB, pdf) 41467_2024_48625_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (53.9KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (9.5MB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 2 (7.3MB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 3 (1.7MB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (3MB, pdf) Source data Source Data (26.6MB, xlsx) Acknowledgements We thank Igor Tulchinsky and WorldQuant, The GI Research Foundation, NASA (NNX14AH50G, NNX17AB26G, 80NSSC22K0254, NNH18ZTT001N-FG2, 80NSSC22K0254), the National Institutes of Health (R01MH117406, P01CA214274 R01CA249054), and the LLS (MCL7001-18, LLS 9238-16, 7029-23).

    "abstract": "Abstract Maintenance of astronaut health during spaceflight will require monitoring and potentially modulating their microbiomes. However, documenting microbial shifts during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints. We found that most alterations were transient across body sites; for example, viruses increased in skin sites mostly during flight. However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example, Fusobacteriota), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Further, microbial genes associated with phage activity, toxin–antitoxin systems and stress response were enriched across multiple body sites. In total, this study reveals in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts experienced by astronauts during short-term spaceflight and the associated changes to the living environment, which can help guide future missions, spacecraft design and space habitat planning.

    "methods": "Methods Informed consent and ethics approval This study was completely in accordance with appropriate ethics guidelines. All participants consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX (Hawthorne, California), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the institutional review board at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members provided written informed consent for data and sample sharing. Sample collection, extraction and sequencing We sequenced analysed samples from human skin, oral and nasal environmental swabs before, during and after a 3-day mission to space. This dataset comprised paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing for each swab. A total of 750 samples were collected in this study by the four crew members of the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. The samples were taken from 10 body sites (Fig. 1a) across 8 collection points (3 pre-launch, 2 mid-flight and 3 post-flight) between June 2021 and December 2021. The crew additionally collected 20 samples from multiple Dragon capsules from 10 different locations. We note that some crew members (two adult male, two adult female) were using wet wipes (UPC, 036000317985) to bathe themselves in-flight in between swabbing; however, not every crew member did so, and SpaceX did not require this to be a consistent protocol among the crew. Wet wipes used by the crew were neither reused nor shared, which should limit any influence of this confounding variable. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are greater than any previous publication in this field. The crew were each provided sterile Isohelix Buccal Mini Swabs (Isohelix, MS-03) and 1.0 ml dual-barcoded screw-top tubes (Thermo Scientific, 3741-WP1D-BR/1.0 ml) prefilled with 400 μl of DNA/RNA Shield storage preservative (Zymo Research, R1100). Following sample collection, swabs were immediately transferred to the barcoded screw-top tubes and kept at room temperature for less than 4 days before being stored at 4 °C until processing. Additional descriptions of the sample collection and sequencing methods are available in companion publications37 DNA, RNA and proteins were isolated from each sample using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein kit (QIAGEN, 47054) according to manufacturer protocol, yet omitting steps one and two. To lyse biological material from each sample, 350 μl of each sample was transferred to a QIAGEN PowerBead tube with 0.1 mm glass beads and secured to a Vortex-Genie 2 using an adapter (1300-V1-24) before being homogenized for 10 min. Of the subsequent lysate, 350 μl was transferred to a spin-column before proceeding with the protocol. Concentrations of the isolated DNA, RNA and protein for each sample were measured by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit 4 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, Q33238) and a corresponding assay kit. The Qubit 1Xds DNA HS Assay kit was used for DNA concentration (Q33231) and the RNA HS Assay kit (Q32855) was used for RNA concentration. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, library preparation for Illumina NGS platforms was performed using the Illumina DNA FLEX Library Prep kit (20018705) with IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA US indexes (20060059). Following library preparation, quality control was assessed using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent, G2939BA) and the High Sensitivity DNA assay. All libraries were pooled and sequenced on an S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150-bp paired-end reads. For metatranscriptomic sequencing, library preparation and sequencing were performed at Discovery Life Sciences (Huntsville, Alabama). The extracted RNA went through an initial purification and cleanup with DNase digestion using the Zymo Research RNA Clean & Concentrator Magbead kit (R1082) following the manufacturer-recommended protocol on the Beckman Coulter Biomek i5 liquid handler (B87583). Following cleanup, ribosomal RNA reduction for RNA-seq library reactions was performed using the New England Bioscience NEBnext rRNA Depletion kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (E6310X), and libraries were prepared using the NEBnext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit (E7760X) with GSL 8.8 IDT Plate Set B indexes. Following library preparation, quality control was assessed using the Roche KAPA Library Quantification kit (KK4824). All libraries were pooled and sequenced on an S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150-bp paired-end reads. For faecal collection, all participants were provided with DNA Genotek OMNIgene-GUT (OM-200) kits for gut microbiome DNA collection. Each participant was instructed to empty their bladder and collect a faecal sample free of urine and toilet water. From the faecal specimen, each participant used a sterile single-use spatula, provided by the OMNIgene-GUT kit, to collect the faeces and deposit it into the OMIgene-GUT tube. Once deposited and sealed, the user was instructed to shake the sealed tube for 30 s to homogenize the sample and release the storage buffer. All samples from each timepoint were stored at room temperature for less than 3 days before storing at −80 °C long term. Faecal samples collected using the OMNIgene-GUT kit are stable at room temperature (15–25 °C) for up to 60 days. DNA was isolated from each sample using the QIAGEN PowerFecal Pro DNA kit (51804). OMNIgene-GUT tubes were thawed on ice (4 °C) and vortexed for 10 s. Then, 400 μl of homogenized faeces was transferred into the QIAGEN PowerBead Pro tube with 0.1 mm glass beads and secured to a Vortex-Genie 2 using an adapter (1300-V1-24) before being homogenized at maximum speed for 10 min. The remainder of the protocol was completed as instructed by the manufacturer. The concentration of the isolated DNA was measured by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit 4 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, Q33238), and the Qubit 1Xds DNA Broad Range Assay kit was used for DNA concentration (Q33265). For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, library preparation for Illumina NGS platforms was performed using the Illumina DNA FLEX Library Prep kit (20018705) with IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA US indexes (20060059). Following library preparation, quality control was assessed using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent, G2939BA) and the High Sensitivity DNA assay. All libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150-bp paired-end reads. Sample quality control All metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples underwent the same quality control pipeline before downstream analysis. Software used was run with the default settings unless otherwise specified. The majority of our quality control pipeline makes use of bbtools (v.38.92), starting with clumpify (parameters: optical = f, dupesubs = 2,dedupe = t) to group reads, bbduk (parameters: qout = 33 trd = t hdist = 1 k = 27 ktrim = ‘r’ mink = 8 overwrite = true trimq = 10 qtrim = ‘rl’ threads = 10 minlength = 51 maxns = −1 minbasefrequency = 0.05 ecco = f) to remove adapter contamination, and tadpole (parameters: mode = correct, ecc = t, ecco = t) to remove sequencing error38. Unmatched reads were removed using bbtool’s repair function. Alignment to the human genome with Bowtie2 v.2.2.3 (parameters: –very-sensitive-local) was done to remove potentially human-contaminating reads39. Metagenomic assembly, bacterial and viral binning, and bin abundance quantification We assembled all samples with MetaSPAdes v.3.14.3 (–assembler-only)40. Assembly quality was gauged using MetaQUAST (v.5.0.2)41. We binned contigs into bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes on a sample-by-sample basis using MetaBAT2 v.2.12.1 (parameters: –minContig 1500)42. Depth files were generated with MetaBAT2’s built-in ‘jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths’ function. Alignments used in the binning process were created with Bowtie2 v.2.2.3 (parameters: —very-sensitive-local) and formatted into index bamfiles with samtools v.1.0. Genome bin quality was checked using the ‘lineage’ workflow of CheckM (v.1.2)43. Medium and high-quality bins were dereplicated using deRep v.3.2.2 (parameters: -p 15 -comp 50 -pa 0.9 -sa 0.95 -nc 0.30 -cm larger). The resulting database of non-redundant bins was formatted as an xtree database (parameters: xtree BUILD k 29 comp 2), and sample-by-sample alignments and relative abundances were completed with the same approach as before. Bins were assigned taxonomic annotations with GTDB-tK (v.2.1.1)44. Identification and taxonomic annotation of assembled viral contigs To identify putative viral contigs, we used CheckV (v.0.8.1)45. For downstream viral abundance quantification, we filtered for contigs annotated as medium quality, high quality or complete. This contig database was dereplicated using BLAST and clustered at the 99% identity threshold as described above using established and published approaches (https://github.com/snayfach/MGV/tree/master/ani_cluster)46. The non-redundant viral contigs were formatted as an xtree database (parameters: xtree BUILD k 29 comp 0), and sample-by-sample alignments and relative abundances were computed with the same approach as before, the only difference being the coverage cut-off used to filter out viral genomes, which was lowered to 1% total and 0.05% unique due to the fact that those in question came directly from the samples analysed. Gene catalogue construction and functional annotation We generated gene catalogues using an approach piloted in previous studies47–49. Bakta v.1.5.1 was used to call putative open reading frames (ORFs)50. The annotations reported in this study (for example, Fig. 5) derive directly from Bakta. We clustered predicted and translated ORFs (at 90% requisite overlap and 90% identity) into homology-based sequence clusters using MMseqs2 v.13.4511 (parameters: –easy-cluster –min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.9)51. The resulting ‘non-redundant’ gene catalogue and its annotations were used in the functional analysis. We computed the abundance of the representative consensus sequences selected by MMseqs2 by alignment of quality-controlled reads with Diamond (v.2.0.14)52. We computed the total number of hits and computed gene relative abundance by dividing the number of aligned reads to a given gene by its length and then by the total number of aligned reads across all genes in a sample. Benchmarking short-read viral taxonomic classification against the GenBank database To identify viral taxonomic abundance via short-read alignment, we mapped reads to a database of all complete, dereplicated (by BLAST at 99% sequence identity) GenBank viral genomes. We used the Xtree aligner for this method (see below); however, given the difficulty of assigning taxonomic ranks to viral species on the basis of alignment alone, we first benchmarked this process. We used Art53 to generate synthetic viral communities at random abundances from 100 random viruses from the GenBank database. We then aligned (with Xtree) back to these genomes, filtered for 1% total coverage and/or 0.5% unique coverage, and compared expected read mapping vs observed read mapping. We additionally computed true/false positive rates on the basis of the proportion of taxa identified that were present in the mock community (true positive) versus those that were not (false positive) versus those that were present but not identified (false negative). Overall, we identified optimal classification at the genus level, with >98% true positive rate (that is, 98/100 taxa identified) and low false positive/negative rates (for example, <10 taxa not present in the sample identified) (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Species-level classification had higher false negative rates (generally arising from multimapping reads to highly similar species) and a 60–70% true positive rate. Genus-level classification also yielded a nearly perfect correlation (>0.99 on average) between expected and observed read mappings (Extended Data Fig. 10c). As a result, while we report analyses for every taxonomic rank in the supplement, in the main text we describe only genus-level viral analysis. Overview of short-read taxonomic classification via alignment In total, we used and compared seven different short-read mapping methods (MetaPhlAn4/StrainPhlAn, Xtree, Kraken2/Bracken run with four different settings, and Phanta), which together utilize five different databases that span bacterial, viral and fungal life. In addition, we identified and computed the relative abundance of non-redundant genes as well as bacterial and viral metagenome-assembled genomes. Subsequent downstream regression analyses were run on each resultant abundance table at each taxonomic rank. Unless otherwise stated, for the figures involving taxonomic data used in the main text of this paper, we used XTree (https://github.com/GabeAl/UTree) (parameters: –redistribute). XTree is a recent update to Utree54 containing an optimized alignment approach and increased ease of use. In brief, it is a k-mer-based aligner (akin to Kraken2 (ref. 55) but faster and designed for larger databases) that uses capitalist read redistribution56 to pick the highest-likelihood mapping between a read and a given reference based on the overall support of all reads in a sample for said reference. It reports the total coverage of a given query genome, as well as total unique coverage, which refers to coverage of regions found in only one genome of an entire genome database. We computed beta diversity (Bray–Curtis) metrics for taxonomic abundances using the vegan package in R57. Bacteria-specific short-read classification For bacterial alignments, we generated an Xtree k-mer database (parameters: BUILD k 29 comp 0) from the Genome Taxonomy Database representative species dataset (Release 207) and aligned both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. We filtered bacterial genomes for those that had at least 0.5% coverage and/or 0.25% unique coverage. Relative abundance was calculated by dividing the total reads assigned to a given genome by the total number of reads assigned to all genomes in a given sample. We additionally ran MetaPhlAn4 (ref. 58) (default settings) as an alternative approach to bacterial taxonomic classification. Virus-specific short-read classification For viral GenBank alignments, we generated an Xtree database (parameters: BUILD k 17 comp 0) from all complete GenBank viral genomes. We first dereplicated these sequences with BLAST 99% identity threshold via published approaches (https://github.com/snayfach/MGV/tree/master/ani_cluster)46,59. We filtered for genomes with 1%/0.5% total/unique coverage. Relative abundance was calculated identically as with the bacterial samples. We additionally ran Phanta (default settings) as an alternative to this approach for viral classification60. Kraken2 (multikingdom) short-read classification As another set of methods for measuring taxonomic sample composition, we used Kraken2 and bracken, both with the default settings, to call taxa and quantify their abundances, respectively55,61. We used the default kraken2 reference databases, which include all  listed taxa (bacteria, fungal and viral genomes) in RefSeq as of September 2022. We ran Kraken2 with four different settings: default (confidence = 0) and unmasked reads, confidence = 0 and masked reads, confidence = 0.2 and unmasked reads, and confidence = 0.2 and masked reads. In the cases where we masked reads before alignment (to filter repeats and determine whether fungal and other eukaryotic alignments were probably false positives), we used bbmask running default settings. Evaluation of bacterial and viral short-read classification To evaluate our taxonomic profiling approach, we first compared the top ten genus-level classifications by body site before and after decontamination for each classifier in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. We observed general concordance among the various classification methods; for instance, the predominant skin genera consistently identified included Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium and Corynebacterium. The oral microbiome included Streptococcus, Rothia and Fusobacterium. Kraken2, which uses a database comprising both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, identified fungi in the skin microbiome, as expected. The swabs from the Dragon capsule predominantly contained a diverse array of environmental microbes. We compared these results at additional taxonomic ranks and with other taxonomic classifiers. For example, to discern higher specificity of the viral changes, we additionally fit species-level virus associations. While species-level viral taxonomic classification can be difficult due to high read misalignments (Extended Data Fig. 10), we wanted to determine whether we could observe a higher-resolution picture of viral activity due to spaceflight, as this effect is known to be space-associated (as opposed to bacterial skin to skin transmission, which could be a result of sharing tight quarters and not a space-specific effect). Sample decontamination with negative controls We observed that many of the swabs collected, especially those from the skin sites, comprised low-biomass microbial communities; there are many documented challenges in analysing these data62,63. To filter environmental contamination and the kitome64 influencing our findings, we collected and sequenced negative controls of both (1) the water that sterile swabs were dipped in before use, as well as (2) the ambient air around the sites of sample collection and processing for sequencing. Following taxonomic classification and identification of de novo assembled microbial genes, we removed potential contaminants from samples by comparison to our negative controls. We ran the same classification approaches for each negative control sample as described in the above paragraphs. This yielded, for every taxonomy classification approach and accompanying database, a dataframe of negative controls alongside a companion dataframe of experimental data. On each of these dataframe pairs, we then used the isContaminant function (parameters: method = ‘prevalence’, threshold = 0.5) of the decontam package65 to mutually high-prevalence taxa between the negative controls and experimental samples. The guidance for implementation of the decontam package, including the parameter used, was derived from the following R vignette: https://benjjneb.github.io/decontam/vignettes/decontam_intro.html. Note that we used both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic negative control samples to decontaminate all data, regardless of whether those data were themselves metagenomic or metatranscriptomic. This decision was made to increase the overall conservatism of our approach. MAS on bacteria, viruses and genes Four mixed-model specifications were used for identifying microbial feature relationships with flight. Time is a variable encoded with three levels corresponding to the time of sampling relative to flight: pre-flight, mid-flight and post-flight. The reference group was the mid-flight timepoint, indicating that any regression coefficients had to be interpreted relative to flight (that is, a negative coefficient on the pre-launch timepoint implies that a feature was increased in-flight). We fit these models for all genes, viruses, and bacteria identified in our dataset by assembly, XTree (GTDB/GenBank), MetaPhlAn4, Kraken2 (all four algorithmic specifications), Phanta and gene catalogue construction. Each variable encoding a body site is binary, encoding whether a sample did or did not come from a particular region. To search for features that were changed across the entire body, we fit overall associations, oral associations, skin associations and nasal associations: lnmicrobial_feature_abundance+minval~β0+β1Time+1∣Crew.ID+ϵi 1 For associations with oral changes, we used: lnmicrobial_feature_abundance+minval~β0+β1Time×Oral+1∣Crew.ID+ϵi 2 For associations with nasal changes, we used: lnmicrobial_feature_abundance+minval~β0+β1Time×Nasal+1∣Crew.ID+ϵi 3 For identifying associations with skin swabs, we fit the following model: lnmicrobial_feature_abundance+minval~β0+β1Time×Armpit+β2Time×ToeWeb+β3Time×NapeOfNeck+β4Time×Postauricular+β5Time×Forehead+β6Time×BellyButton+β7Time×GlutealCrease+β8Time×TZone+1∣Crew.ID+ϵi 4 The β characters in each of the above equations refer to the beta coefficients on a given variable in that given regression. The ε characters refer to the regression residuals. Note that in the final equation (4), the reference groups are samples deriving from the nasal and oral microbiomes; this means that highlighted taxa will be those associated with time and skin sites as compared to the oral and nasal sites. We additionally fit these same model specifications without the random effect and compared the results in Extended Data Fig. 2. Data distributions were assumed to be normal but not tested for every single microbial feature. Individual data points for each feature are present in the online data stored at figshare66 and with NASA GeneLab (see Data availability). We used the lme4 (ref. 67) package to compute associations between microbial features (that is, taxa or genes) abundance and time as a function of spaceflight and body site. For all data types, we aimed to remove potential contamination before running any associations. We estimated P values on all models with the ImerTest package using its default settings67,68. We adjusted for false positives using Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment and used a q-value cut-off point of 0.05 to gauge significance. Identifying and plotting time-dependent trends in microbial features We grouped microbial features associated with flight into six different categories. These were determined since our model contained a categorical variable encoding a sample’s timing relative to flight: whether it was taken before, during or afterwards. Since the modelling reference group was ‘mid-flight’, the interpretation of any coefficients would be directionally oriented relative to mid-flight microbial feature abundances. As a result, we were able to categorize features on the basis of the jointly considered direction of association and significance for the ‘pre-flight’ and ‘post-flight’ levels of this variable. The below listed categories are all included in the association summaries provided on figshare66 (see ‘Data availability’). Transient increase in-flight—negative coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, negative coefficient on the post-flight variable, statistically significant for both Transient increase in-flight (low priority)—negative coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, negative coefficient on the post-flight variable, statistically significant for at least one of the two Transient decrease in-flight—positive coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, positive coefficient on the post-flight variable level, statistically significant for both Transient decrease in-flight (low priority)—positive coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, positive coefficient on the post-flight variable level, statistically significant for at least one of the two Potential persistent increase—negative coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, positive coefficient on the post-flight variable level, statistically significant for at least one of the two Potential persistent decrease—positive coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, negative coefficient on the post-flight variable level, statistically significant for at least one of the two We used these groups to surmise the time trends reported in the figures. It would be intractable to visualize every association of interest, so we prioritized within each category on the basis of the absolute value of beta-coefficients and adjusted P values. In Fig. 1c, we removed the ‘low priority’ categories (two and four above) and only looked at the top 100 most increased and decreased significant genes, by group, relative to flight. We did so to make fitting splines feasible (especially in the case of genes, which had so many associations) and filter out additional noise due to low association-size findings. We took a similar approach for the barplots in Figs. 2–4 and Extended Data Figs. 7–9. We again filtered out the low priority associations and selected, for each body site represented in the figure (for example, oral, skin, nasal), the top N with the greatest difference in absolute value of average L2FC relative to the mid-flight timepoints. In other words, we selected for microbial features with dramatic overall L2FCs. We maximized N on the basis of the available space in the figure in question. We note that the complete, categorized association results are available in the online data resource (see Data availability). Detecting microbial sharing between the crew and environment before, during and after flight We modelled our species/strain-sharing analysis on the basis of ref. 30. Briefly, we used the –s flag in MetaPhlAn4 to generate sam files that could be fed into StrainPhlAn. We used the sample2markers.py script to generate consensus markers and extracted markers for each identified strain using extract_markers.py. We ran StrainPhlAn with the settings recommended in ref. 30 (–markers_in_n_samples 1, –samples_with_n_markers 10 – mutation_rates –phylophlan_mode accurate). We then used the tree distance files generated by StrainPhlAn to identify strain-sharing cut-offs on the basis of the prevalence of different strains (detailed tutorial: https://github.com/biobakery/MetaPhlAn/wiki/Strain-Sharing-Inference). Association with host immune gene subtypes The single-cell sequencing approach and averaging of host genes to identify expression levels are documented in refs. 33,69. The resultant averaged expression levels across cell types were associated with microbial feature abundance/expression using lasso regression. We used the same log transformation approach as in the mixed effects modelling for the microbial features, and we centred and rescaled the immune expression data. In total, we computed one regression per immune cell type (N = 8) per relevant microbial feature, with the independent variables being all human genes (N = 30,601). We selected features on the basis of their grouping described above, picking only those that were increased transiently or persistently increased after flight. Due to the volume of gene-catalogue associations, we only analysed persistently increased genes. We report outcomes with non-zero coefficients in the text. Figure generation and additional data processing notes The GNU parallel package was used for multiprocessing on the Linux command line70. We additionally used a series of separate R packages for analysis and visualization67,68,71–76. Figures were compiled in Adobe Illustrator. Statistics and reproducibility No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size; all possible samples from all crew members (N = 4) were taken. No sequenced data were excluded from the analyses; however, samples were quality controlled before bioinformatic and statistical analysis to remove duplicated reads, trim adapters and low-quality bases, remove human contamination and remove potential microbial contamination (using negative controls). The experiments were not randomized. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.

    "results": "Results The human microbiome is altered in short-term spaceflight The i4 crew collected a microbiome dataset spanning eight timepoints: three before flight, three after flight and two during flight. In total, we sequenced 385 metagenomic and 365 metatranscriptomic swabs comprising ten body sites representing the oral, nasal and skin microbiomes (n = 750 samples, Fig. 1a), plus eight stool samples (from two participants before and after flight). Locations inside the Dragon capsule were swabbed twice in flight and also before spaceflight (a separate capsule was utilized for crew training). Fig. 1. Overview of dataset and summary of changes. Open in a new tab a, Collection and analytic approach. Body swabs were collected from ten different sites, comprising three microbial ecosystems (oral, nasal, skin) around the body at eight different timepoints surrounding launch. These are referred to as L-92, L-44, L-3, FD2, FD3, R+1, R+45, R+82, where ‘L’ refers to pre-launch, ‘FD’ corresponds to flight day (that is, in-flight) and ‘R’ refers to return (that is, post-flight). Following collection and paired metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequencing, samples were processed with a MAS to extract taxonomic (bacterial or viral) and functional features to determine their changes relative to flight. b, The time trajectories of persistently/transiently increased/decreased significant findings, filtering for strong associations (see Methods).

The orange shaded area refers to the samples collected while subjects were in orbit. c, Significant features by specific swabbing sites. Source dataWe used a diverse set of short-read alignment and de novo assembly approaches to estimate the microbial community taxonomic and functional composition of our dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1, Methods and Supplementary Figs. 1–7). We queried whether the conditions of short-term spaceflight (potentially including, for example, microgravity, radiation or altered dietary and cleaning habits) altered overall bacterial and viral community composition and expression consistently across the crews. Via a linear mixed effect (LME) modelling approach, we executed a microbiome-association study (MAS), computing associations for each taxonomic rank and classifier between flight and the abundance of (1) bacterial species, (2) viral genera and non-redundant proteins. We grouped false discovery rate (FDR) significant (q-value < 0.05) features into four categories: transiently increased in-flight, transiently decreased in-flight, persistently increased in/after flight and persistently decreased in/after flight. We additionally fit generalized linear models (GLMs) alongside LMEs and identified the two approaches to be generally concordant (Extended Data Fig. 2). Extended Data Fig. 1. Data processing workflow and summary statistics. Open in a new tab a) After quality-controlling reads, we executed two different, parallel, workflows to identify the microbial taxa and genes that comprised each sample. We used seven different algorithmic approaches (Xtree, MetaPhlAn4/StrainPhlAn4, Phanta, Kraken2 with multiple parameter settings) and four different databases to classify short reads into different taxonomic categories (bottom left). We also did a de novo assembly analysis to identify the abundance of non-redundant genes/functions as well as Metagenome-Assembled bacterial and viral genomes. We executed all regression analyses for every resultant abundance matrix across the taxonomic ranks ranging from species to phylum. b) Counts and percentages of reads aligning to the human reference genome. c) Aligned reads by taxonomic classification method.

Source dataExtended Data Fig. 2. Null model results. Open in a new tab Similarity between FDR-significant associations fit with mixed versus generalized linear models (sans a random effect). Source dataIn total, we observed a predominantly transient restructuring of the oral, nasal and skin microbiomes as a function of flight (Fig. 1b–c and Extended Data Fig. 3). Across all ten sites swabbed and regressed, over 821,337 associations were statistically significant (adjusted P < 0.05) and grouped into one of the four categories of interest. These comprised 314,701 distinct microbial features: 792 were viral, 767 were bacterial and the remaining were microbial genes. The majority (73.5%) of significant and categorized features were transiently increased in abundance, yet 24.6% were transiently depleted during flight, and 0.6% and 1.1% of features appeared to continually increase or decrease (respectively) following the crew’s return to Earth across multiple timepoints. Transient shifts were more dramatic than persistent ones. The limited persistence of changes indicates that, while microbial communities may restructure in space, the relative abundance of altered organisms, as well as their gene expression, generally reset upon returning to Earth. Despite these changes, we note that this analysis alone does not indicate the degree to which spaceflight itself, versus other confounding factors such as altered diet, affects the host microbiota.

Open in a new tab a) The total number of features (bacterial species, viral genera, or genes) found to be statistically associated with either pre- or post-flight timepoints across sequencing methods.

Plots with one or no lines had either no significant findings or none that met the filtering criteria. Gray shaded area indicates 95% confidence intervals. Source dataDifferent body sites displayed distinct time trends that varied depending on molecular type (gene expression vs relative abundance) and domain of life. Time-dependent shifts were apparent in all body sites. The oral microbiome displayed a restructuring in both relative abundance and bacterial gene expression; 161 bacterial and viral taxonomies were transiently increased, 173 were transiently decreased, 62 were persistently increased and 12 were persistently decreased (Fig. 1c). Alternatively, the skin microbiome demonstrated fewer persistent changes, with 933 transiently increased (metagenomic) taxa across all eight skin sites. The number and direction of altered microbiome features were generally consistent across classification methods (Extended Data Fig. 4), and most taxonomic associations were unique to individual body sites (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Similarity of regression output by body site. Open in a new tab Degree of overlap in the identity of significant bacterial and viral features as a function of body site and sequencing type. Source data Bacterial and viral shifts during and after spaceflight We next interrogated the taxonomies of bacterial shifts during spaceflight. The organisms with the strongest effects were distinct across biological modalities; in other words, an increase in gene expression did not necessarily imply the existence of a similar increase in the abundance of DNA ascribed to a given species. This discordance was apparent in the oral microbiome (Fig. 2), for example, where there was almost no overlap between the organisms that altered in terms of relative abundance and those that altered in terms of gene expression.

Source dataSpecifically, the oral microbiome demonstrated flight-dependent variation in the metatranscriptomic expression of bacteria associated with dental decay and biofilm formation (Fig. 2). Various members of Fusobacteriota, a progenitor to gum and tooth disease previously reported as spaceflight-associated, demonstrated an increase either in or after spaceflight27. These included Fusobacterium hwasookii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Leptotrichia hofstadii. Other oral biofilm species known to aggregate synergistically with Fusobacterium species in the mouth were also enriched in and after flight; these included Streptococcus gordonii A, multiple Campylobacter species and Actinomyces oris species28. Also, there was a persistent loss in the expression of Streptococcus oralis spp. and Lachnoanaerobaculum gingivalis, and a transient decrease in Veillonella spp. Alloscardovia omnicolens was the only organism with a strong, persistent increase in metagenomic levels. We compared the MetaPhlAn4 associations to those identified in the GTDB database and found similar results, especially regarding the overall enrichment of Fusobacterium sp. in flight. Many of the strongest bacterial skin microbiome alterations (Fig. 3) were predominantly metagenomic, as opposed to metatranscriptomic. We hypothesized that this may indicate the acquisition of new but non-transcriptionally active species from the surrounding environment and crew. For example, persistent increases were mostly in the metagenomic content of various gut microbes (for example, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Blautia, Enterocloster); this may result from altered hygiene habits during spaceflight.

Plotted taxa were selected by ranking significant features in each category and sequencing type (RNA/DNA) by L2FC and showing up to 10 at once. b, Host and molecular type of viral genera associated with flight. Source dataAs with the oral microbiome, there was little concordance between metagenomic and metatranscriptomic changes. On the other hand, Corynebacterium species (common skin commensals) experienced metatranscriptomic, temporary depletion in-flight, and Acinetobacter spp. demonstrated a persistent depletion. These ‘typical’ skin microbes (for example, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Variovorax, Acinetobacter) underwent changes in metatranscriptomic activity, whereas organisms not universally found on the human skin (for example, Mesorhizobium spp., Prevotella spp.) tended to experience metagenomic shifts, again indicating the potential acquisition of non-transcriptionally active organisms from different niches. However, the landscape of viral activity and depletion covered region-specific, prokaryotic- and eukaryotic-targeting viral genera (Fig. 3b). The majority of detectable viral activity comprised phages in the skin microbiome (that is, DNA viruses targeting prokaryotic hosts), and it was concentrated in the gluteal crease. Most viral activity was transiently increased in-flight across diverse lineages. For example, Uroviricota, Cressdnaviricota and Phixviricota shifted across the oral, skin and nasal microbiomes. However, phyla containing biomedically relevant, potential human pathogens also increased, including Kitrinoviricota, Artverviricota, Nucleocytoviricota and Duplornaviricota. A core functional microbial landscape of spaceflight We next aimed to characterize the consistency with which microbial gene abundances changed across time and body site across 3.6 million non-redundant genes. First, we explored the broad functions of the genes that fell into either the transiently increased or transiently decreased categories. The increases in DNA content on the skin, as well as decreases in nasal microbiome content, were immediately apparent (Extended Data Fig. 6a, third and first columns, respectively), and the oral microbiome and gluteal crease also underwent large metatranscriptomic increases. Of note, the category that exhibited the greatest fluctuation in genes was ‘amino acid transport and metabolism’. In the exposed areas of the skin, such as the forearm, the genes that were changed in this category mostly came from metagenomic data. In less exposed body sites (that is, oral, gluteal crease), the activity in this category was primarily metatranscriptomic. This may indicate the dramatic degree to which microbial nutrient needs change in-flight, probably from a combination of features ranging from environmental strain transfer, competition and host dietary changes.

The legend in the black box is relevant for all figures where those colors appear. Source dataThe oral, nasal and skin microbiomes demonstrated consistency in the functions that were altered during spaceflight, especially in the metagenomic data. We observed five different categories of proteins of interest enriched among increased features: antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, haem binding/export, lantibiotic-associated genes, phage-associated genes and toxin–antitoxin systems (Extended Data Figs. 6b and 7–9). Lantibiotic biosynthesis again displayed a discordant response between sequencing types; it was decreased in the metagenomic data but increased in metatranscriptomics. Phage proteins, toxin–antitoxin systems, and antibiotic-related/heavy metal pathways increased noticeably across all host niches. As in other spaceflight studies22,29, we specifically observed an increase in the RelB toxin–antitoxin genes, most notably through metatranscriptomics. Extended Data Fig. 7.

Source data Microbial similarity between the capsule and crew members We observed that, on average, bacterial beta diversity appeared to decrease after flight (Fig. 4a), indicating a broad convergence of the crew microbiome. When ranking sites by similarity to the capsule mid-flight (Fig. 4a, from left to right), the beta diversity correlated with the degree of environmental exposure for a given sampling site. For example, the oral microbiome remained highly dissimilar from the microbiome of the capsule and other sites, whereas the forearm microbiome became much more similar to that of the walls of the Dragon capsule and other crew members, which matches the degree of exposure of that body site.

Heat map colour corresponds to average beta diversity, with black being the midpoint (0.5), blue being totally dissimilar (1.0) and grey being highly similar (0.0). Columns are hierarchically clustered. The interpretation for a single cell is for the crew member annotated on the right-hand side: the value encoded refers to the dissimilarity of that individual’s body site (as indicated on the column) to all other cells in that column (so the capsule and all other crew samples from the same site). For example, the bottom right cell indicates C004’s average forearm dissimilarity to all other crew member’s forearm swabs. b, Strain-sharing events between the crew and the capsule during the mid-flight timepoints. c, The number of strain-sharing events across time, where an event is defined as the detection of the same strain between two different swabbing locations. d, Organisms with at least two strain-sharing events detected within a given timepoint. Source dataFurther, our MAS also indicated that during spaceflight, the composition of the crews’ microbiota changed, most notably in the skin niche, although the sources of these alterations were unclear. We hypothesized that these shifts in community composition and the overall increase in microbiome similarity could simply be a result of individuals cohabitating in a tight space; however, a change in gene expression in the oral microbiome, where microbial exchange is probably less likely, could derive from other ecological or other exposure changes such as diet or immune alterations. Therefore, we next identified shared microbial signatures between individuals and the environment. Specifically, we queried whether host microbiomes converged during and after flight and whether putative microbial exchange occurred within individuals, between individuals, or both within individuals and the capsule, utilizing recently published methods30 to determine whether strain-level markers could discern the directionality of microbial exchange across environments. Overall (Fig. 4b), we found that while in flight, marker genes for individual microbial strains were mostly shared between skin microbiome samples from the same individual (and not across individuals). The capsule had variation in overlap with individuals, with most occurring in exposed skin. Moreover, there were more potential shared microbial strains between the capsule and different individuals by the second sampling in-flight (Fig. 4c), indicating an influence of cohabitation time on migration. Strains identified by StrainPhlAn, such as Mesorhizobium_hungaricum|t__SGB11031, identified as present in multiple locations mid-flight (Fig. 4d), were similar in part to those GTDB species identified as increased metagenomically (but not transcriptionally) across exposed skin sites (Fig. 3). Notably, most of these putative sharing between individuals were present after flight, as opposed to before the mission, indicating in-flight transfer. Finally, we note that in this dataset, which contains numerous low-biomass samples, any indications of strain-sharing are difficult to validate (for example, contamination could potentially drive some of the findings), so the following results should be validated in future skin microbiome and aerospace studies. Spaceflight microbiome shifts associate with host gene expression Having mapped the architecture of microbiome changes surrounding spaceflight and identified the source of some of those changes, we next searched for indications of a link between microbiome ecology and the host immune system. To do so, we integrated the observations from our MAS with host immune single-nuclei transcriptome data from PBMCs. Via averaging across single-nuclei sequencing information, we estimated the gene expression of nine host immune cell subpopulations and we computed differentially expressed genes within cell types post-flight using lasso regression to identify candidate relationships between flight-associated, increased microbial features and immune cell subpopulation gene expression. Specifically, we aimed to identify whether metatranscriptomic or metagenomic (that is, cohabitation-derived) changes were more likely to be correlated with immune transcriptome changes. We observed many putative relationships between host immune cell expression, body site and microbial features (Fig. 5a). Bacterial species, specifically in the oral microbiome, had many metatranscriptomic associations across all cell types. In terms of relative abundance (that is, metagenomics), oral microbes were associated with CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and CD16 monocytes, which are known for innate immune response against pathogens31,32. Skin bacteria had very few associations with immune cells (compared to oral) in both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. The overall lack of associations between skin bacteria and immune response was interesting, as it indicated that while microbes are potentially acquired during flight (as observed in Fig. 4), these acquired microbes may have limited immediate impact on the host. In other words, there was limited evidence that strain-sharing due to cohabitation drove a strong altered immune state in humans. Conversely, we did observe a limited link in our data between viruses and immune cell expression, with natural killer (NK) cells, CD14 monocytes, dendritic cells and CD16 monocytes showing the most viral associations; these associations were predominantly in the skin microbiome, which may relate to previous observations of increase viral shedding in astronauts.

We sorted for genes within each body site and selected the top 15 with the greatest number of human gene associations. The legend at the bottom of a is relevant for all figures where those colours appear. Source dataNext, we examined a subset of microorganisms with expression and abundance changes that correlated with host genes across multiple immune cell types (Fig. 5b). A small group of metagenomically detected viruses were associated with many different immune genes; one genus (Family Genomoviridae) targets fungi and was correlated with 13 genes in natural killer cells. The presence of this virus on the skin makes additional sense given that fungi are known skin symbionts. The other associated viruses had unclassified hosts or targeted bacteria. In the oral microbiome, pathobiont gene expression was associated with immune cell gene expression. Streptococcus pneomoniae A had the largest number of genes associated with it; 30/32 genes were found in natural killer cells. Streptoccocus gordonii A, which was persistently increased after flight was associated with many different immune cell subtypes (N = 32 genes), including CD4 T cells, CD14 monocytes, CD16 monocytes and dendritic cells. The only oral bacterial relative abundance increase during or after flight that was associated with many immune cell subtypes was in Gemella morbillorum. The other oral microbes with the strongest oral associations included other medically relevant organisms, as well as some typical commensals: Pauljensenia hongkongensis, Campylobacter_A concisus_R, Actinomyces massiliensis, Haemophilus_A parahaemolyticus, Leptotrichia_A sp905371725, Porphyromonas catoniae and many Streptococcus spp. The microbial genes (Fig. 5c) associated with the most human genes were detected via both shifts in relative abundance (DNA) as well as expression (RNA). They spanned many different protein annotations, yet there were some commonalities among those that were correlated with many immune cell subpopulations. Most notably, these annotations, across both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, included transcription factors, cell surface proteins and transporters. Pertinent to our previous results (Extended Data Fig. 6b), the top microbial gene (for example, hemX) in the nasal microbiome was the haem uptake protein IsdC.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In this study, which comprises the largest dataset of spaceflight-associated microbiome data so far, we systematically queried the microbiome architecture of short-term spaceflight. Previous efforts, such as the NASA twins study, have had difficulty mapping microbiome shifts due to small sample sizes, restricted body site sampling (n = 3) and limited sequencing modalities25. Here we show significant bacterial, viral and gene-level microbiome shifts and their potential relationship to host immune response, which can help inform sampling and monitoring for future missions. Chief among our findings was that native microbiome shifts were highly correlated with host immune changes. Naturally, a microbial shift can affect the host immune system, or vice versa, without the initial cause being ‘space-specific’ (that is, due to microgravity or radiation). Dietary factors or other confounders could drive a portion of these effects. Putative convergence in microbiome signatures (Fig. 4a), for example, could be (and probably is) a function of humans residing in close quarters. Moreover, crews have been documented as experiencing immune and viral reactivation15; typically, this effect is not attributed solely to cohabitation, and we showed here that species potentially acquired from the environment in flight were not associated with immune cell changes—a topic that has been debated in previous studies25. We claim, therefore, that it is unlikely that strain sharing due to close quarters, or even variable sanitation in-flight, could explain the entirety of the link between host immune response and the microbiome. Future manuscripts, of course, could leverage this dataset as well as data from analogue astronaut studies on Earth to test this hypothesis more rigorously. An additional paper focuses more on the host-side of immune activation33, reporting specific human genes that seem to be associated with microbial features and integrating additional datasets. However, for completeness, we briefly document here some human genes of interest that were microbiome-associated. By cell type, we documented the most strongly associated genes with microbial features. For bacteria, gene functions were annotated with, for example, long non-coding RNAs (across all cell types), immunoglobulin genes (CD14 monocytes) and interferon regulatory factors. We additionally uncovered associations with specific immune modulatory genes such as CXCL10, XCL1, CXCL8 (immune cell migration), NLRC5, HLA genes, CD1C (antigen presentation/co-stimulation), SLC2A9 (immune cell metabolism), IRF1, NR4A3 and STAT1 (transcription factors that specify immune cell states) that increased across multiple immune cell types (B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, CD14 monocytes, DCs, NK cells). A limitation of our work is its observational nature, which arises from the overall study design and an opportunistic mission. Despite having more samples than all other astronaut microbiome studies combined, this effort still hosts a relatively small crew size (n = 4), and we cannot determine from these data alone if an outside effect on the immune system is altering their abundance or expression or if microbiome ecology may be driving these and similar changes. Given the nascence of the multi-omic space biomedicine (and the difficulty of sample collection), we were limited in this study to simply observing shifts in microbes and, from multi-omic data integration, inferring hypotheses regarding the overall nature of the mid-flight microbe–immune axis. As a result, there are several opportunities to expand on this work in future studies and missions. Analytically, our lasso-based approach for immune–microbe interaction modelling of immune cell gene expression changes does not inherently allow for statistical inference or account for inter-individual variation. Further, some of our samples had very low biomass, requiring PCR-amplification (18 cycles) for RNA-sequencing data, which can increase duplicate rates of sequences. For this reason, we attempted to take a conservative and systematic modelling approach to our effort. Specifically, (1) we implemented multiple algorithms and compared their concordance, (2) set coverage thresholds for bacterial and viral taxa to filter probable false positives, (3) used multiple, state-of-the-art taxonomic classifiers and compared our findings among all of them, (4) mapped reads across five databases and (5) implemented and compared both generalized linear models and mixed effect models, bearing in mind that the latter can face interpretability challenges with smaller sample sizes. Additional modelling strategies, including network analyses34, could be implemented in addition to those we have tested here. For example, recently developed network models or methods for controlling false positive rates in compositional data could be potentially useful34,35. We additionally used 76 negative controls to attempt to avert false positive signals, which can stem from contamination and the kitome. Depending on their aim, future studies should alter collection methods to increase the amount of biomass collected during sampling (for example, using one swab for multiple skin sites) or examine relatively unbiased methods of amplification36. In addition, they should encourage more detailed reporting on diet and cleaning methods (for example, wet wipes) to adjust for potential confounders introducing foreign microbial DNA into the host. Further, in this study, we attempted to measure viral shifts as a function of flight. Measuring viral abundances in metagenomic and (particularly) metatranscriptomic data is extremely challenging. First, the decontamination process we used to remove environmental contaminants was not designed for organisms as ubiquitous and with such short, diverse genomes as viruses. Second, high-resolution taxonomic classification of viruses is non-trivial. We observed, for example, many spaceflight-associated viruses with unusual names, often mapping to viral species not typically found in or on humans. Simply put, the viral universe is so vast that these alignments may represent both read alignments and as well as spurious read mapping (and databases lacking the strains that are truly present). While our benchmarking efforts (Extended Data Fig. 10) increased our confidence in our results, the viral taxonomic and functional mapping field is an area that will benefit the most from improved methods in the future.

Source data Additional experiments and missions can further test a microbiome-derived theory of spaceflight-associated immune changes. In addition to stress-testing our findings and increasing sample sizes, future spaceflight studies should consider several enhancements. For instance, they should compare sequestered ground controls to discern differences between space-driven and proximity-driven immune shifts. In addition, future efforts should design experiments that enable a deeper view into the causality of microbe–immune associations. Exploring some of these hypotheses through animal or organoid models could be valuable, as well as comparison to large control cohorts. In total, spaceflight microbiome studies are hyperbolic extensions of human exposome research. They capture a group of effectively immunocompromised individuals who share a self-contained environment that does not undergo microbial exchange with the outside world. Since these studies are rare, the range of immune system dynamics is just beginning to be explored. Overall, we describe here data and methods to map the axes of host–microbe–environment interaction, such that these observations and hypotheses can be tested and even modulated in future studies. Indeed, the increased access to space guarantees more opportunities to study astronauts, their microbiomes and their spacecraft while also motivating a strong health and medical impetus to plan for future missions.",

Abstract Maintenance of astronaut health during spaceflight will require monitoring and potentially modulating their microbiomes. However, documenting microbial shifts during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints. We found that most alterations were transient across body sites; for example, viruses increased in skin sites mostly during flight. However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example, Fusobacteriota), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Further, microbial genes associated with phage activity, toxin–antitoxin systems and stress response were enriched across multiple body sites. In total, this study reveals in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts experienced by astronauts during short-term spaceflight and the associated changes to the living environment, which can help guide future missions, spacecraft design and space habitat planning. Subject terms: Microbiome, Computational biology and bioinformatics, Medical research Longitudinal multi-omics reveals shifts to the human microbiome across multiple body sites and the associated immune responses during short-term spaceflight.Main The sources and health impacts of spaceflight-associated microbiome shifts are an open, yet important area of study. Microbes play manifold roles in human physiology; understanding the complex interplay between the space environment and host-microbiome composition is critical. This is especially true with the recent proliferation of commercial spaceflight missions and increased space tourism: individuals with increasingly diverse medical histories will travel into space and to the Moon (for example, dearMoon)1, and these crews will also carry a more complex history and range of microbiome states (for example, recent antibiotic usage). In this new age, astronauts can be immunocompromised, cancer survivors, elderly or have other health profiles that put them severe other severe outcomes, especially relative to previous NASA, ESA, JAXA and ROSCOSMOS missions2. Microbes are already associated with many spaceflight-specific health indications. In microgravity, many individuals experience gastrointestinal discomfort (that is, constipation), which is heavily linked to gut microbiome composition3–7. The skin barrier is disrupted and often inflamed, allowing potential invasion of pathobionts or otherwise inflammatory microorganisms8–12. Although the mechanisms are not entirely understood, the immune system experiences suppression during spaceflight, leading to inflammation or a ‘reactivation’ of latent infections, such as herpes viruses13–17. As a result, identifying the sources and impacts of microbiome changes as a function of spaceflight will be essential for the development of microbiome-targeted, spaceflight-relevant diagnostics and therapeutics. Microbial physiology, genetics and community composition are also dramatically affected by the space environment, probably due to the stressors of microgravity and radiation18–20. These changes, taken together, alter the nature of microbial communities and, therefore, their cumulative impact on the host21. We recently documented the ‘International Space Station (ISS) effect’, in which organisms on the ISS exhibit increasing resistance to antibiotics over time, despite not having been exposed to them in the first place22. Many Biosafety Level 2 organisms, including Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei and Staphylococcus aureus, have been observed to exhibit ecological succession in the environment of the ISS, demonstrating the propensity of the space environment to select for specific community compositions and gene content23,24. Early studies in aerospace medicine have indicated that the microbiomes of humans and the built environment shift as a function of spaceflight25; however, there are many open questions regarding spaceflight’s microbiome architecture: the totality of detectable flight-associated compositional and expression shifts in the set of all bacteria, viruses and microbial genes in the host and their surrounding environment (Glossary/Supplementary Table 1). Also, the proportion of organisms acquired from other crew members, versus from the environment, remains unclear, and the transience of microbiome changes post-flight remains opaque. Notably, the metatranscriptomic activity of human-associated microbes in response to flight is completely absent. These questions predominantly remain because previous studies have been hampered by (1) limited sample sizes, (2) a lack of longitudinal data and (3) a focus on single sequencing modalities (that is, amplicon sequencing or only DNA profiles). To interrogate microbiome community activity in spaceflight, we recently executed a longitudinal, multi-omic (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, single-cell immunome) sampling study of the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission (i4)—the first all-civilian commercial spaceflight. Over a 6-month window, the crew collected environmental (that is, from the Dragon capsule), skin (n = 8 sites), nasal and oral swabs at eight timepoints before, during and after a 3-day, high-elevation (590 km) mission in orbit, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and after spaceflight (n = 3 per flight window). We focused on expression and abundance shifts and their relationship to host immune status as a function of spaceflight. Our results yield a standardized approach for temporally monitoring microbial exposomic changes as a function of spaceflight and, in total, characterize the microbiome architecture26 of biomedically relevant taxa that are activated or repressed during short-term spaceflight.Results The human microbiome is altered in short-term spaceflight The i4 crew collected a microbiome dataset spanning eight timepoints: three before flight, three after flight and two during flight. In total, we sequenced 385 metagenomic and 365 metatranscriptomic swabs comprising ten body sites representing the oral, nasal and skin microbiomes (n = 750 samples, Fig. 1a), plus eight stool samples (from two participants before and after flight). Locations inside the Dragon capsule were swabbed twice in flight and also before spaceflight (a separate capsule was utilized for crew training). Fig. 1. Overview of dataset and summary of changes. Open in a new tab a, Collection and analytic approach. Body swabs were collected from ten different sites, comprising three microbial ecosystems (oral, nasal, skin) around the body at eight different timepoints surrounding launch. These are referred to as L-92, L-44, L-3, FD2, FD3, R+1, R+45, R+82, where ‘L’ refers to pre-launch, ‘FD’ corresponds to flight day (that is, in-flight) and ‘R’ refers to return (that is, post-flight). Following collection and paired metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequencing, samples were processed with a MAS to extract taxonomic (bacterial or viral) and functional features to determine their changes relative to flight. b, The time trajectories of persistently/transiently increased/decreased significant findings, filtering for strong associations (see Methods). Plots with one line had either no significant findings or none that met the filtering criteria. Grey shaded area indicates 95% confidence intervals. The orange shaded area refers to the samples collected while subjects were in orbit. c, Significant features by specific swabbing sites. Source dataWe used a diverse set of short-read alignment and de novo assembly approaches to estimate the microbial community taxonomic and functional composition of our dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1, Methods and Supplementary Figs. 1–7). We queried whether the conditions of short-term spaceflight (potentially including, for example, microgravity, radiation or altered dietary and cleaning habits) altered overall bacterial and viral community composition and expression consistently across the crews. Via a linear mixed effect (LME) modelling approach, we executed a microbiome-association study (MAS), computing associations for each taxonomic rank and classifier between flight and the abundance of (1) bacterial species, (2) viral genera and non-redundant proteins. We grouped false discovery rate (FDR) significant (q-value < 0.05) features into four categories: transiently increased in-flight, transiently decreased in-flight, persistently increased in/after flight and persistently decreased in/after flight. We additionally fit generalized linear models (GLMs) alongside LMEs and identified the two approaches to be generally concordant (Extended Data Fig. 2). Extended Data Fig. 1. Data processing workflow and summary statistics. Open in a new tab a) After quality-controlling reads, we executed two different, parallel, workflows to identify the microbial taxa and genes that comprised each sample. We used seven different algorithmic approaches (Xtree, MetaPhlAn4/StrainPhlAn4, Phanta, Kraken2 with multiple parameter settings) and four different databases to classify short reads into different taxonomic categories (bottom left). We also did a de novo assembly analysis to identify the abundance of non-redundant genes/functions as well as Metagenome-Assembled bacterial and viral genomes. We executed all regression analyses for every resultant abundance matrix across the taxonomic ranks ranging from species to phylum. b) Counts and percentages of reads aligning to the human reference genome. c) Aligned reads by taxonomic classification method.

Source dataExtended Data Fig. 2. Null model results. Open in a new tab Similarity between FDR-significant associations fit with mixed versus generalized linear models (sans a random effect). Source dataIn total, we observed a predominantly transient restructuring of the oral, nasal and skin microbiomes as a function of flight (Fig. 1b–c and Extended Data Fig. 3). Across all ten sites swabbed and regressed, over 821,337 associations were statistically significant (adjusted P < 0.05) and grouped into one of the four categories of interest. These comprised 314,701 distinct microbial features: 792 were viral, 767 were bacterial and the remaining were microbial genes. The majority (73.5%) of significant and categorized features were transiently increased in abundance, yet 24.6% were transiently depleted during flight, and 0.6% and 1.1% of features appeared to continually increase or decrease (respectively) following the crew’s return to Earth across multiple timepoints. Transient shifts were more dramatic than persistent ones. The limited persistence of changes indicates that, while microbial communities may restructure in space, the relative abundance of altered organisms, as well as their gene expression, generally reset upon returning to Earth. Despite these changes, we note that this analysis alone does not indicate the degree to which spaceflight itself, versus other confounding factors such as altered diet, affects the host microbiota. Extended Data Fig. 3. Supplemental Microbiome Association Study output. Open in a new tab a) The total number of features (bacterial species, viral genera, or genes) found to be statistically associated with either pre- or post-flight timepoints across sequencing methods.

Plots with one or no lines had either no significant findings or none that met the filtering criteria. Gray shaded area indicates 95% confidence intervals. Source dataDifferent body sites displayed distinct time trends that varied depending on molecular type (gene expression vs relative abundance) and domain of life. Time-dependent shifts were apparent in all body sites. The oral microbiome displayed a restructuring in both relative abundance and bacterial gene expression; 161 bacterial and viral taxonomies were transiently increased, 173 were transiently decreased, 62 were persistently increased and 12 were persistently decreased (Fig. 1c). Alternatively, the skin microbiome demonstrated fewer persistent changes, with 933 transiently increased (metagenomic) taxa across all eight skin sites. The number and direction of altered microbiome features were generally consistent across classification methods (Extended Data Fig. 4), and most taxonomic associations were unique to individual body sites (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Source dataBacterial and viral shifts during and after spaceflight We next interrogated the taxonomies of bacterial shifts during spaceflight. The organisms with the strongest effects were distinct across biological modalities; in other words, an increase in gene expression did not necessarily imply the existence of a similar increase in the abundance of DNA ascribed to a given species. This discordance was apparent in the oral microbiome (Fig. 2), for example, where there was almost no overlap between the organisms that altered in terms of relative abundance and those that altered in terms of gene expression.

Plotted taxa were selected by ranking significant features in each category and sequencing type (RNA/DNA) by L2FC and showing up to 15 at once. Source dataSpecifically, the oral microbiome demonstrated flight-dependent variation in the metatranscriptomic expression of bacteria associated with dental decay and biofilm formation (Fig. 2). Various members of Fusobacteriota, a progenitor to gum and tooth disease previously reported as spaceflight-associated, demonstrated an increase either in or after spaceflight27. These included Fusobacterium hwasookii, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Leptotrichia hofstadii. Other oral biofilm species known to aggregate synergistically with Fusobacterium species in the mouth were also enriched in and after flight; these included Streptococcus gordonii A, multiple Campylobacter species and Actinomyces oris species28. Also, there was a persistent loss in the expression of Streptococcus oralis spp. and Lachnoanaerobaculum gingivalis, and a transient decrease in Veillonella spp. Alloscardovia omnicolens was the only organism with a strong, persistent increase in metagenomic levels. We compared the MetaPhlAn4 associations to those identified in the GTDB database and found similar results, especially regarding the overall enrichment of Fusobacterium sp. in flight. Many of the strongest bacterial skin microbiome alterations (Fig. 3) were predominantly metagenomic, as opposed to metatranscriptomic. We hypothesized that this may indicate the acquisition of new but non-transcriptionally active species from the surrounding environment and crew. For example, persistent increases were mostly in the metagenomic content of various gut microbes (for example, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Blautia, Enterocloster); this may result from altered hygiene habits during spaceflight.

Plotted taxa were selected by ranking significant features in each category and sequencing type (RNA/DNA) by L2FC and showing up to 10 at once. b, Host and molecular type of viral genera associated with flight. Source dataAs with the oral microbiome, there was little concordance between metagenomic and metatranscriptomic changes. On the other hand, Corynebacterium species (common skin commensals) experienced metatranscriptomic, temporary depletion in-flight, and Acinetobacter spp. demonstrated a persistent depletion. These ‘typical’ skin microbes (for example, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Variovorax, Acinetobacter) underwent changes in metatranscriptomic activity, whereas organisms not universally found on the human skin (for example, Mesorhizobium spp., Prevotella spp.) tended to experience metagenomic shifts, again indicating the potential acquisition of non-transcriptionally active organisms from different niches. However, the landscape of viral activity and depletion covered region-specific, prokaryotic- and eukaryotic-targeting viral genera (Fig. 3b). The majority of detectable viral activity comprised phages in the skin microbiome (that is, DNA viruses targeting prokaryotic hosts), and it was concentrated in the gluteal crease. Most viral activity was transiently increased in-flight across diverse lineages. For example, Uroviricota, Cressdnaviricota and Phixviricota shifted across the oral, skin and nasal microbiomes. However, phyla containing biomedically relevant, potential human pathogens also increased, including Kitrinoviricota, Artverviricota, Nucleocytoviricota and Duplornaviricota.A core functional microbial landscape of spaceflight We next aimed to characterize the consistency with which microbial gene abundances changed across time and body site across 3.6 million non-redundant genes. First, we explored the broad functions of the genes that fell into either the transiently increased or transiently decreased categories. The increases in DNA content on the skin, as well as decreases in nasal microbiome content, were immediately apparent (Extended Data Fig. 6a, third and first columns, respectively), and the oral microbiome and gluteal crease also underwent large metatranscriptomic increases. Of note, the category that exhibited the greatest fluctuation in genes was ‘amino acid transport and metabolism’. In the exposed areas of the skin, such as the forearm, the genes that were changed in this category mostly came from metagenomic data. In less exposed body sites (that is, oral, gluteal crease), the activity in this category was primarily metatranscriptomic. This may indicate the dramatic degree to which microbial nutrient needs change in-flight, probably from a combination of features ranging from environmental strain transfer, competition and host dietary changes.

The legend in the black box is relevant for all figures where those colors appear. Source dataThe oral, nasal and skin microbiomes demonstrated consistency in the functions that were altered during spaceflight, especially in the metagenomic data. We observed five different categories of proteins of interest enriched among increased features: antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, haem binding/export, lantibiotic-associated genes, phage-associated genes and toxin–antitoxin systems (Extended Data Figs. 6b and 7–9). Lantibiotic biosynthesis again displayed a discordant response between sequencing types; it was decreased in the metagenomic data but increased in metatranscriptomics. Phage proteins, toxin–antitoxin systems, and antibiotic-related/heavy metal pathways increased noticeably across all host niches. As in other spaceflight studies22,29, we specifically observed an increase in the RelB toxin–antitoxin genes, most notably through metatranscriptomics. Extended Data Fig. 7.

Source dataMicrobial similarity between the capsule and crew members We observed that, on average, bacterial beta diversity appeared to decrease after flight (Fig. 4a), indicating a broad convergence of the crew microbiome. When ranking sites by similarity to the capsule mid-flight (Fig. 4a, from left to right), the beta diversity correlated with the degree of environmental exposure for a given sampling site. For example, the oral microbiome remained highly dissimilar from the microbiome of the capsule and other sites, whereas the forearm microbiome became much more similar to that of the walls of the Dragon capsule and other crew members, which matches the degree of exposure of that body site.

Heat map colour corresponds to average beta diversity, with black being the midpoint (0.5), blue being totally dissimilar (1.0) and grey being highly similar (0.0). Columns are hierarchically clustered. The interpretation for a single cell is for the crew member annotated on the right-hand side: the value encoded refers to the dissimilarity of that individual’s body site (as indicated on the column) to all other cells in that column (so the capsule and all other crew samples from the same site). For example, the bottom right cell indicates C004’s average forearm dissimilarity to all other crew member’s forearm swabs. b, Strain-sharing events between the crew and the capsule during the mid-flight timepoints. c, The number of strain-sharing events across time, where an event is defined as the detection of the same strain between two different swabbing locations. d, Organisms with at least two strain-sharing events detected within a given timepoint. Source dataFurther, our MAS also indicated that during spaceflight, the composition of the crews’ microbiota changed, most notably in the skin niche, although the sources of these alterations were unclear. We hypothesized that these shifts in community composition and the overall increase in microbiome similarity could simply be a result of individuals cohabitating in a tight space; however, a change in gene expression in the oral microbiome, where microbial exchange is probably less likely, could derive from other ecological or other exposure changes such as diet or immune alterations. Therefore, we next identified shared microbial signatures between individuals and the environment. Specifically, we queried whether host microbiomes converged during and after flight and whether putative microbial exchange occurred within individuals, between individuals, or both within individuals and the capsule, utilizing recently published methods30 to determine whether strain-level markers could discern the directionality of microbial exchange across environments. Overall (Fig. 4b), we found that while in flight, marker genes for individual microbial strains were mostly shared between skin microbiome samples from the same individual (and not across individuals). The capsule had variation in overlap with individuals, with most occurring in exposed skin. Moreover, there were more potential shared microbial strains between the capsule and different individuals by the second sampling in-flight (Fig. 4c), indicating an influence of cohabitation time on migration. Strains identified by StrainPhlAn, such as Mesorhizobium_hungaricum|t__SGB11031, identified as present in multiple locations mid-flight (Fig. 4d), were similar in part to those GTDB species identified as increased metagenomically (but not transcriptionally) across exposed skin sites (Fig. 3). Notably, most of these putative sharing between individuals were present after flight, as opposed to before the mission, indicating in-flight transfer. Finally, we note that in this dataset, which contains numerous low-biomass samples, any indications of strain-sharing are difficult to validate (for example, contamination could potentially drive some of the findings), so the following results should be validated in future skin microbiome and aerospace studies.Spaceflight microbiome shifts associate with host gene expression Having mapped the architecture of microbiome changes surrounding spaceflight and identified the source of some of those changes, we next searched for indications of a link between microbiome ecology and the host immune system. To do so, we integrated the observations from our MAS with host immune single-nuclei transcriptome data from PBMCs. Via averaging across single-nuclei sequencing information, we estimated the gene expression of nine host immune cell subpopulations and we computed differentially expressed genes within cell types post-flight using lasso regression to identify candidate relationships between flight-associated, increased microbial features and immune cell subpopulation gene expression. Specifically, we aimed to identify whether metatranscriptomic or metagenomic (that is, cohabitation-derived) changes were more likely to be correlated with immune transcriptome changes. We observed many putative relationships between host immune cell expression, body site and microbial features (Fig. 5a). Bacterial species, specifically in the oral microbiome, had many metatranscriptomic associations across all cell types. In terms of relative abundance (that is, metagenomics), oral microbes were associated with CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and CD16 monocytes, which are known for innate immune response against pathogens31,32. Skin bacteria had very few associations with immune cells (compared to oral) in both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. The overall lack of associations between skin bacteria and immune response was interesting, as it indicated that while microbes are potentially acquired during flight (as observed in Fig. 4), these acquired microbes may have limited immediate impact on the host. In other words, there was limited evidence that strain-sharing due to cohabitation drove a strong altered immune state in humans. Conversely, we did observe a limited link in our data between viruses and immune cell expression, with natural killer (NK) cells, CD14 monocytes, dendritic cells and CD16 monocytes showing the most viral associations; these associations were predominantly in the skin microbiome, which may relate to previous observations of increase viral shedding in astronauts. Fig. 5. The landscape of potential immune–microbiome associations related to spaceflight. Open in a new tab a, The total number of microbial features, by type, associated with different immune cell subtypes gene expression for those that were long-term increased (left) or decreased (right) after flight. b, The spaceflight-associated (increased in abundance or expression) bacteria and viruses that were associated with the greatest number of host genes. Viral genera are labelled ‘E’ for targeting a eukaryotic host and ‘P’ for targeting a prokaryote. If no definite host is known, no label was assigned. c, The spaceflight-associated microbial genes that were associated with the greatest number of host genes. We sorted for genes within each body site and selected the top 15 with the greatest number of human gene associations. The legend at the bottom of a is relevant for all figures where those colours appear. Source dataNext, we examined a subset of microorganisms with expression and abundance changes that correlated with host genes across multiple immune cell types (Fig. 5b). A small group of metagenomically detected viruses were associated with many different immune genes; one genus (Family Genomoviridae) targets fungi and was correlated with 13 genes in natural killer cells. The presence of this virus on the skin makes additional sense given that fungi are known skin symbionts. The other associated viruses had unclassified hosts or targeted bacteria. In the oral microbiome, pathobiont gene expression was associated with immune cell gene expression. Streptococcus pneomoniae A had the largest number of genes associated with it; 30/32 genes were found in natural killer cells. Streptoccocus gordonii A, which was persistently increased after flight was associated with many different immune cell subtypes (N = 32 genes), including CD4 T cells, CD14 monocytes, CD16 monocytes and dendritic cells. The only oral bacterial relative abundance increase during or after flight that was associated with many immune cell subtypes was in Gemella morbillorum. The other oral microbes with the strongest oral associations included other medically relevant organisms, as well as some typical commensals: Pauljensenia hongkongensis, Campylobacter_A concisus_R, Actinomyces massiliensis, Haemophilus_A parahaemolyticus, Leptotrichia_A sp905371725, Porphyromonas catoniae and many Streptococcus spp. The microbial genes (Fig. 5c) associated with the most human genes were detected via both shifts in relative abundance (DNA) as well as expression (RNA). They spanned many different protein annotations, yet there were some commonalities among those that were correlated with many immune cell subpopulations. Most notably, these annotations, across both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, included transcription factors, cell surface proteins and transporters. Pertinent to our previous results (Extended Data Fig. 6b), the top microbial gene (for example, hemX) in the nasal microbiome was the haem uptake protein IsdC.Discussion In this study, which comprises the largest dataset of spaceflight-associated microbiome data so far, we systematically queried the microbiome architecture of short-term spaceflight. Previous efforts, such as the NASA twins study, have had difficulty mapping microbiome shifts due to small sample sizes, restricted body site sampling (n = 3) and limited sequencing modalities25. Here we show significant bacterial, viral and gene-level microbiome shifts and their potential relationship to host immune response, which can help inform sampling and monitoring for future missions. Chief among our findings was that native microbiome shifts were highly correlated with host immune changes. Naturally, a microbial shift can affect the host immune system, or vice versa, without the initial cause being ‘space-specific’ (that is, due to microgravity or radiation). Dietary factors or other confounders could drive a portion of these effects. Putative convergence in microbiome signatures (Fig. 4a), for example, could be (and probably is) a function of humans residing in close quarters. Moreover, crews have been documented as experiencing immune and viral reactivation15; typically, this effect is not attributed solely to cohabitation, and we showed here that species potentially acquired from the environment in flight were not associated with immune cell changes—a topic that has been debated in previous studies25. We claim, therefore, that it is unlikely that strain sharing due to close quarters, or even variable sanitation in-flight, could explain the entirety of the link between host immune response and the microbiome. Future manuscripts, of course, could leverage this dataset as well as data from analogue astronaut studies on Earth to test this hypothesis more rigorously. An additional paper focuses more on the host-side of immune activation33, reporting specific human genes that seem to be associated with microbial features and integrating additional datasets. However, for completeness, we briefly document here some human genes of interest that were microbiome-associated. By cell type, we documented the most strongly associated genes with microbial features. For bacteria, gene functions were annotated with, for example, long non-coding RNAs (across all cell types), immunoglobulin genes (CD14 monocytes) and interferon regulatory factors. We additionally uncovered associations with specific immune modulatory genes such as CXCL10, XCL1, CXCL8 (immune cell migration), NLRC5, HLA genes, CD1C (antigen presentation/co-stimulation), SLC2A9 (immune cell metabolism), IRF1, NR4A3 and STAT1 (transcription factors that specify immune cell states) that increased across multiple immune cell types (B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, CD14 monocytes, DCs, NK cells). A limitation of our work is its observational nature, which arises from the overall study design and an opportunistic mission. Despite having more samples than all other astronaut microbiome studies combined, this effort still hosts a relatively small crew size (n = 4), and we cannot determine from these data alone if an outside effect on the immune system is altering their abundance or expression or if microbiome ecology may be driving these and similar changes. Given the nascence of the multi-omic space biomedicine (and the difficulty of sample collection), we were limited in this study to simply observing shifts in microbes and, from multi-omic data integration, inferring hypotheses regarding the overall nature of the mid-flight microbe–immune axis. As a result, there are several opportunities to expand on this work in future studies and missions. Analytically, our lasso-based approach for immune–microbe interaction modelling of immune cell gene expression changes does not inherently allow for statistical inference or account for inter-individual variation. Further, some of our samples had very low biomass, requiring PCR-amplification (18 cycles) for RNA-sequencing data, which can increase duplicate rates of sequences. For this reason, we attempted to take a conservative and systematic modelling approach to our effort. Specifically, (1) we implemented multiple algorithms and compared their concordance, (2) set coverage thresholds for bacterial and viral taxa to filter probable false positives, (3) used multiple, state-of-the-art taxonomic classifiers and compared our findings among all of them, (4) mapped reads across five databases and (5) implemented and compared both generalized linear models and mixed effect models, bearing in mind that the latter can face interpretability challenges with smaller sample sizes. Additional modelling strategies, including network analyses34, could be implemented in addition to those we have tested here. For example, recently developed network models or methods for controlling false positive rates in compositional data could be potentially useful34,35. We additionally used 76 negative controls to attempt to avert false positive signals, which can stem from contamination and the kitome. Depending on their aim, future studies should alter collection methods to increase the amount of biomass collected during sampling (for example, using one swab for multiple skin sites) or examine relatively unbiased methods of amplification36. In addition, they should encourage more detailed reporting on diet and cleaning methods (for example, wet wipes) to adjust for potential confounders introducing foreign microbial DNA into the host. Further, in this study, we attempted to measure viral shifts as a function of flight. Measuring viral abundances in metagenomic and (particularly) metatranscriptomic data is extremely challenging. First, the decontamination process we used to remove environmental contaminants was not designed for organisms as ubiquitous and with such short, diverse genomes as viruses. Second, high-resolution taxonomic classification of viruses is non-trivial. We observed, for example, many spaceflight-associated viruses with unusual names, often mapping to viral species not typically found in or on humans. Simply put, the viral universe is so vast that these alignments may represent both read alignments and as well as spurious read mapping (and databases lacking the strains that are truly present). While our benchmarking efforts (Extended Data Fig. 10) increased our confidence in our results, the viral taxonomic and functional mapping field is an area that will benefit the most from improved methods in the future. Extended Data Fig. 10. Viral classifier benchmarking. Open in a new tab Benchmarking a viral classifier across taxonomic ranks. Synthetic viral communities were generated from 100 genomes at random levels of abundance (from the GenBank database used in the rest of this study). a) The number of recovered genomes out of 100, for 10 mock communities for the genus and species levels. N = 10 independently generated mock communities. b) The number of true positive (identified and present in the sample), false positive (identified but not present in the sample), and false negative (that is, not recovered) genomes for the genus and species levels. N = 10 independently generated mock communities. c) The correlation between observed and expected read counts for each taxon as a function of being a true positive, false positive, or false negative. Lines on box plots in A and B indicate minimum and maximum values. The median is the centerline, and the bounds of the box are the interquartile range. The whiskers extend to 1.5 times the interquartile range of the upper and lower quartiles. Source dataAdditional experiments and missions can further test a microbiome-derived theory of spaceflight-associated immune changes. In addition to stress-testing our findings and increasing sample sizes, future spaceflight studies should consider several enhancements. For instance, they should compare sequestered ground controls to discern differences between space-driven and proximity-driven immune shifts. In addition, future efforts should design experiments that enable a deeper view into the causality of microbe–immune associations. Exploring some of these hypotheses through animal or organoid models could be valuable, as well as comparison to large control cohorts. In total, spaceflight microbiome studies are hyperbolic extensions of human exposome research. They capture a group of effectively immunocompromised individuals who share a self-contained environment that does not undergo microbial exchange with the outside world. Since these studies are rare, the range of immune system dynamics is just beginning to be explored. Overall, we describe here data and methods to map the axes of host–microbe–environment interaction, such that these observations and hypotheses can be tested and even modulated in future studies. Indeed, the increased access to space guarantees more opportunities to study astronauts, their microbiomes and their spacecraft while also motivating a strong health and medical impetus to plan for future missions.Methods Informed consent and ethics approval This study was completely in accordance with appropriate ethics guidelines. All participants consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX (Hawthorne, California), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the institutional review board at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members provided written informed consent for data and sample sharing.Sample collection, extraction and sequencing We sequenced analysed samples from human skin, oral and nasal environmental swabs before, during and after a 3-day mission to space. This dataset comprised paired metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing for each swab. A total of 750 samples were collected in this study by the four crew members of the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. The samples were taken from 10 body sites (Fig. 1a) across 8 collection points (3 pre-launch, 2 mid-flight and 3 post-flight) between June 2021 and December 2021. The crew additionally collected 20 samples from multiple Dragon capsules from 10 different locations. We note that some crew members (two adult male, two adult female) were using wet wipes (UPC, 036000317985) to bathe themselves in-flight in between swabbing; however, not every crew member did so, and SpaceX did not require this to be a consistent protocol among the crew. Wet wipes used by the crew were neither reused nor shared, which should limit any influence of this confounding variable. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are greater than any previous publication in this field. The crew were each provided sterile Isohelix Buccal Mini Swabs (Isohelix, MS-03) and 1.0 ml dual-barcoded screw-top tubes (Thermo Scientific, 3741-WP1D-BR/1.0 ml) prefilled with 400 μl of DNA/RNA Shield storage preservative (Zymo Research, R1100). Following sample collection, swabs were immediately transferred to the barcoded screw-top tubes and kept at room temperature for less than 4 days before being stored at 4 °C until processing. Additional descriptions of the sample collection and sequencing methods are available in companion publications37 DNA, RNA and proteins were isolated from each sample using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein kit (QIAGEN, 47054) according to manufacturer protocol, yet omitting steps one and two. To lyse biological material from each sample, 350 μl of each sample was transferred to a QIAGEN PowerBead tube with 0.1 mm glass beads and secured to a Vortex-Genie 2 using an adapter (1300-V1-24) before being homogenized for 10 min. Of the subsequent lysate, 350 μl was transferred to a spin-column before proceeding with the protocol. Concentrations of the isolated DNA, RNA and protein for each sample were measured by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit 4 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, Q33238) and a corresponding assay kit. The Qubit 1Xds DNA HS Assay kit was used for DNA concentration (Q33231) and the RNA HS Assay kit (Q32855) was used for RNA concentration. For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, library preparation for Illumina NGS platforms was performed using the Illumina DNA FLEX Library Prep kit (20018705) with IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA US indexes (20060059). Following library preparation, quality control was assessed using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent, G2939BA) and the High Sensitivity DNA assay. All libraries were pooled and sequenced on an S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150-bp paired-end reads. For metatranscriptomic sequencing, library preparation and sequencing were performed at Discovery Life Sciences (Huntsville, Alabama). The extracted RNA went through an initial purification and cleanup with DNase digestion using the Zymo Research RNA Clean & Concentrator Magbead kit (R1082) following the manufacturer-recommended protocol on the Beckman Coulter Biomek i5 liquid handler (B87583). Following cleanup, ribosomal RNA reduction for RNA-seq library reactions was performed using the New England Bioscience NEBnext rRNA Depletion kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (E6310X), and libraries were prepared using the NEBnext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit (E7760X) with GSL 8.8 IDT Plate Set B indexes. Following library preparation, quality control was assessed using the Roche KAPA Library Quantification kit (KK4824). All libraries were pooled and sequenced on an S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150-bp paired-end reads. For faecal collection, all participants were provided with DNA Genotek OMNIgene-GUT (OM-200) kits for gut microbiome DNA collection. Each participant was instructed to empty their bladder and collect a faecal sample free of urine and toilet water. From the faecal specimen, each participant used a sterile single-use spatula, provided by the OMNIgene-GUT kit, to collect the faeces and deposit it into the OMIgene-GUT tube. Once deposited and sealed, the user was instructed to shake the sealed tube for 30 s to homogenize the sample and release the storage buffer. All samples from each timepoint were stored at room temperature for less than 3 days before storing at −80 °C long term. Faecal samples collected using the OMNIgene-GUT kit are stable at room temperature (15–25 °C) for up to 60 days. DNA was isolated from each sample using the QIAGEN PowerFecal Pro DNA kit (51804). OMNIgene-GUT tubes were thawed on ice (4 °C) and vortexed for 10 s. Then, 400 μl of homogenized faeces was transferred into the QIAGEN PowerBead Pro tube with 0.1 mm glass beads and secured to a Vortex-Genie 2 using an adapter (1300-V1-24) before being homogenized at maximum speed for 10 min. The remainder of the protocol was completed as instructed by the manufacturer. The concentration of the isolated DNA was measured by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit 4 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, Q33238), and the Qubit 1Xds DNA Broad Range Assay kit was used for DNA concentration (Q33265). For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, library preparation for Illumina NGS platforms was performed using the Illumina DNA FLEX Library Prep kit (20018705) with IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA US indexes (20060059). Following library preparation, quality control was assessed using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent, G2939BA) and the High Sensitivity DNA assay. All libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150-bp paired-end reads.Sample quality control All metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples underwent the same quality control pipeline before downstream analysis. Software used was run with the default settings unless otherwise specified. The majority of our quality control pipeline makes use of bbtools (v.38.92), starting with clumpify (parameters: optical = f, dupesubs = 2,dedupe = t) to group reads, bbduk (parameters: qout = 33 trd = t hdist = 1 k = 27 ktrim = ‘r’ mink = 8 overwrite = true trimq = 10 qtrim = ‘rl’ threads = 10 minlength = 51 maxns = −1 minbasefrequency = 0.05 ecco = f) to remove adapter contamination, and tadpole (parameters: mode = correct, ecc = t, ecco = t) to remove sequencing error38. Unmatched reads were removed using bbtool’s repair function. Alignment to the human genome with Bowtie2 v.2.2.3 (parameters: –very-sensitive-local) was done to remove potentially human-contaminating reads39.Metagenomic assembly, bacterial and viral binning, and bin abundance quantification We assembled all samples with MetaSPAdes v.3.14.3 (–assembler-only)40. Assembly quality was gauged using MetaQUAST (v.5.0.2)41. We binned contigs into bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes on a sample-by-sample basis using MetaBAT2 v.2.12.1 (parameters: –minContig 1500)42. Depth files were generated with MetaBAT2’s built-in ‘jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths’ function. Alignments used in the binning process were created with Bowtie2 v.2.2.3 (parameters: —very-sensitive-local) and formatted into index bamfiles with samtools v.1.0. Genome bin quality was checked using the ‘lineage’ workflow of CheckM (v.1.2)43. Medium and high-quality bins were dereplicated using deRep v.3.2.2 (parameters: -p 15 -comp 50 -pa 0.9 -sa 0.95 -nc 0.30 -cm larger). The resulting database of non-redundant bins was formatted as an xtree database (parameters: xtree BUILD k 29 comp 2), and sample-by-sample alignments and relative abundances were completed with the same approach as before. Bins were assigned taxonomic annotations with GTDB-tK (v.2.1.1)44.Identification and taxonomic annotation of assembled viral contigs To identify putative viral contigs, we used CheckV (v.0.8.1)45. For downstream viral abundance quantification, we filtered for contigs annotated as medium quality, high quality or complete. This contig database was dereplicated using BLAST and clustered at the 99% identity threshold as described above using established and published approaches (https://github.com/snayfach/MGV/tree/master/ani_cluster)46. The non-redundant viral contigs were formatted as an xtree database (parameters: xtree BUILD k 29 comp 0), and sample-by-sample alignments and relative abundances were computed with the same approach as before, the only difference being the coverage cut-off used to filter out viral genomes, which was lowered to 1% total and 0.05% unique due to the fact that those in question came directly from the samples analysed.Gene catalogue construction and functional annotation We generated gene catalogues using an approach piloted in previous studies47–49. Bakta v.1.5.1 was used to call putative open reading frames (ORFs)50. The annotations reported in this study (for example, Fig. 5) derive directly from Bakta. We clustered predicted and translated ORFs (at 90% requisite overlap and 90% identity) into homology-based sequence clusters using MMseqs2 v.13.4511 (parameters: –easy-cluster –min-seq-id 0.9 -c 0.9)51. The resulting ‘non-redundant’ gene catalogue and its annotations were used in the functional analysis. We computed the abundance of the representative consensus sequences selected by MMseqs2 by alignment of quality-controlled reads with Diamond (v.2.0.14)52. We computed the total number of hits and computed gene relative abundance by dividing the number of aligned reads to a given gene by its length and then by the total number of aligned reads across all genes in a sample.Benchmarking short-read viral taxonomic classification against the GenBank database To identify viral taxonomic abundance via short-read alignment, we mapped reads to a database of all complete, dereplicated (by BLAST at 99% sequence identity) GenBank viral genomes. We used the Xtree aligner for this method (see below); however, given the difficulty of assigning taxonomic ranks to viral species on the basis of alignment alone, we first benchmarked this process. We used Art53 to generate synthetic viral communities at random abundances from 100 random viruses from the GenBank database. We then aligned (with Xtree) back to these genomes, filtered for 1% total coverage and/or 0.5% unique coverage, and compared expected read mapping vs observed read mapping. We additionally computed true/false positive rates on the basis of the proportion of taxa identified that were present in the mock community (true positive) versus those that were not (false positive) versus those that were present but not identified (false negative). Overall, we identified optimal classification at the genus level, with >98% true positive rate (that is, 98/100 taxa identified) and low false positive/negative rates (for example, <10 taxa not present in the sample identified) (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Species-level classification had higher false negative rates (generally arising from multimapping reads to highly similar species) and a 60–70% true positive rate. Genus-level classification also yielded a nearly perfect correlation (>0.99 on average) between expected and observed read mappings (Extended Data Fig. 10c). As a result, while we report analyses for every taxonomic rank in the supplement, in the main text we describe only genus-level viral analysis.Overview of short-read taxonomic classification via alignment In total, we used and compared seven different short-read mapping methods (MetaPhlAn4/StrainPhlAn, Xtree, Kraken2/Bracken run with four different settings, and Phanta), which together utilize five different databases that span bacterial, viral and fungal life. In addition, we identified and computed the relative abundance of non-redundant genes as well as bacterial and viral metagenome-assembled genomes. Subsequent downstream regression analyses were run on each resultant abundance table at each taxonomic rank. Unless otherwise stated, for the figures involving taxonomic data used in the main text of this paper, we used XTree (https://github.com/GabeAl/UTree) (parameters: –redistribute). XTree is a recent update to Utree54 containing an optimized alignment approach and increased ease of use. In brief, it is a k-mer-based aligner (akin to Kraken2 (ref. 55) but faster and designed for larger databases) that uses capitalist read redistribution56 to pick the highest-likelihood mapping between a read and a given reference based on the overall support of all reads in a sample for said reference. It reports the total coverage of a given query genome, as well as total unique coverage, which refers to coverage of regions found in only one genome of an entire genome database. We computed beta diversity (Bray–Curtis) metrics for taxonomic abundances using the vegan package in R57.Bacteria-specific short-read classification For bacterial alignments, we generated an Xtree k-mer database (parameters: BUILD k 29 comp 0) from the Genome Taxonomy Database representative species dataset (Release 207) and aligned both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. We filtered bacterial genomes for those that had at least 0.5% coverage and/or 0.25% unique coverage. Relative abundance was calculated by dividing the total reads assigned to a given genome by the total number of reads assigned to all genomes in a given sample. We additionally ran MetaPhlAn4 (ref. 58) (default settings) as an alternative approach to bacterial taxonomic classification.Virus-specific short-read classification For viral GenBank alignments, we generated an Xtree database (parameters: BUILD k 17 comp 0) from all complete GenBank viral genomes. We first dereplicated these sequences with BLAST 99% identity threshold via published approaches (https://github.com/snayfach/MGV/tree/master/ani_cluster)46,59. We filtered for genomes with 1%/0.5% total/unique coverage. Relative abundance was calculated identically as with the bacterial samples. We additionally ran Phanta (default settings) as an alternative to this approach for viral classification60.Kraken2 (multikingdom) short-read classification As another set of methods for measuring taxonomic sample composition, we used Kraken2 and bracken, both with the default settings, to call taxa and quantify their abundances, respectively55,61. We used the default kraken2 reference databases, which include all  listed taxa (bacteria, fungal and viral genomes) in RefSeq as of September 2022. We ran Kraken2 with four different settings: default (confidence = 0) and unmasked reads, confidence = 0 and masked reads, confidence = 0.2 and unmasked reads, and confidence = 0.2 and masked reads. In the cases where we masked reads before alignment (to filter repeats and determine whether fungal and other eukaryotic alignments were probably false positives), we used bbmask running default settings.Evaluation of bacterial and viral short-read classification To evaluate our taxonomic profiling approach, we first compared the top ten genus-level classifications by body site before and after decontamination for each classifier in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. We observed general concordance among the various classification methods; for instance, the predominant skin genera consistently identified included Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium and Corynebacterium. The oral microbiome included Streptococcus, Rothia and Fusobacterium. Kraken2, which uses a database comprising both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, identified fungi in the skin microbiome, as expected. The swabs from the Dragon capsule predominantly contained a diverse array of environmental microbes. We compared these results at additional taxonomic ranks and with other taxonomic classifiers. For example, to discern higher specificity of the viral changes, we additionally fit species-level virus associations. While species-level viral taxonomic classification can be difficult due to high read misalignments (Extended Data Fig. 10), we wanted to determine whether we could observe a higher-resolution picture of viral activity due to spaceflight, as this effect is known to be space-associated (as opposed to bacterial skin to skin transmission, which could be a result of sharing tight quarters and not a space-specific effect).Sample decontamination with negative controls We observed that many of the swabs collected, especially those from the skin sites, comprised low-biomass microbial communities; there are many documented challenges in analysing these data62,63. To filter environmental contamination and the kitome64 influencing our findings, we collected and sequenced negative controls of both (1) the water that sterile swabs were dipped in before use, as well as (2) the ambient air around the sites of sample collection and processing for sequencing. Following taxonomic classification and identification of de novo assembled microbial genes, we removed potential contaminants from samples by comparison to our negative controls. We ran the same classification approaches for each negative control sample as described in the above paragraphs. This yielded, for every taxonomy classification approach and accompanying database, a dataframe of negative controls alongside a companion dataframe of experimental data. On each of these dataframe pairs, we then used the isContaminant function (parameters: method = ‘prevalence’, threshold = 0.5) of the decontam package65 to mutually high-prevalence taxa between the negative controls and experimental samples. The guidance for implementation of the decontam package, including the parameter used, was derived from the following R vignette: https://benjjneb.github.io/decontam/vignettes/decontam_intro.html. Note that we used both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic negative control samples to decontaminate all data, regardless of whether those data were themselves metagenomic or metatranscriptomic. This decision was made to increase the overall conservatism of our approach.MAS on bacteria, viruses and genes Four mixed-model specifications were used for identifying microbial feature relationships with flight. Time is a variable encoded with three levels corresponding to the time of sampling relative to flight: pre-flight, mid-flight and post-flight. The reference group was the mid-flight timepoint, indicating that any regression coefficients had to be interpreted relative to flight (that is, a negative coefficient on the pre-launch timepoint implies that a feature was increased in-flight). We fit these models for all genes, viruses, and bacteria identified in our dataset by assembly, XTree (GTDB/GenBank), MetaPhlAn4, Kraken2 (all four algorithmic specifications), Phanta and gene catalogue construction. Each variable encoding a body site is binary, encoding whether a sample did or did not come from a particular region. To search for features that were changed across the entire body, we fit overall associations, oral associations, skin associations and nasal associations: lnmicrobial_feature_abundance+minval~β0+β1Time+1∣Crew.ID+ϵi 1 For associations with oral changes, we used: lnmicrobial_feature_abundance+minval~β0+β1Time×Oral+1∣Crew.ID+ϵi 2 For associations with nasal changes, we used: lnmicrobial_feature_abundance+minval~β0+β1Time×Nasal+1∣Crew.ID+ϵi 3 For identifying associations with skin swabs, we fit the following model: lnmicrobial_feature_abundance+minval~β0+β1Time×Armpit+β2Time×ToeWeb+β3Time×NapeOfNeck+β4Time×Postauricular+β5Time×Forehead+β6Time×BellyButton+β7Time×GlutealCrease+β8Time×TZone+1∣Crew.ID+ϵi 4 The β characters in each of the above equations refer to the beta coefficients on a given variable in that given regression. The ε characters refer to the regression residuals. Note that in the final equation (4), the reference groups are samples deriving from the nasal and oral microbiomes; this means that highlighted taxa will be those associated with time and skin sites as compared to the oral and nasal sites. We additionally fit these same model specifications without the random effect and compared the results in Extended Data Fig. 2. Data distributions were assumed to be normal but not tested for every single microbial feature. Individual data points for each feature are present in the online data stored at figshare66 and with NASA GeneLab (see Data availability). We used the lme4 (ref. 67) package to compute associations between microbial features (that is, taxa or genes) abundance and time as a function of spaceflight and body site. For all data types, we aimed to remove potential contamination before running any associations. We estimated P values on all models with the ImerTest package using its default settings67,68. We adjusted for false positives using Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment and used a q-value cut-off point of 0.05 to gauge significance.Identifying and plotting time-dependent trends in microbial features We grouped microbial features associated with flight into six different categories. These were determined since our model contained a categorical variable encoding a sample’s timing relative to flight: whether it was taken before, during or afterwards. Since the modelling reference group was ‘mid-flight’, the interpretation of any coefficients would be directionally oriented relative to mid-flight microbial feature abundances. As a result, we were able to categorize features on the basis of the jointly considered direction of association and significance for the ‘pre-flight’ and ‘post-flight’ levels of this variable. The below listed categories are all included in the association summaries provided on figshare66 (see ‘Data availability’). Transient increase in-flight—negative coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, negative coefficient on the post-flight variable, statistically significant for both Transient increase in-flight (low priority)—negative coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, negative coefficient on the post-flight variable, statistically significant for at least one of the two Transient decrease in-flight—positive coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, positive coefficient on the post-flight variable level, statistically significant for both Transient decrease in-flight (low priority)—positive coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, positive coefficient on the post-flight variable level, statistically significant for at least one of the two Potential persistent increase—negative coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, positive coefficient on the post-flight variable level, statistically significant for at least one of the two Potential persistent decrease—positive coefficient on the pre-flight variable level, negative coefficient on the post-flight variable level, statistically significant for at least one of the two We used these groups to surmise the time trends reported in the figures. It would be intractable to visualize every association of interest, so we prioritized within each category on the basis of the absolute value of beta-coefficients and adjusted P values. In Fig. 1c, we removed the ‘low priority’ categories (two and four above) and only looked at the top 100 most increased and decreased significant genes, by group, relative to flight. We did so to make fitting splines feasible (especially in the case of genes, which had so many associations) and filter out additional noise due to low association-size findings. We took a similar approach for the barplots in Figs. 2–4 and Extended Data Figs. 7–9. We again filtered out the low priority associations and selected, for each body site represented in the figure (for example, oral, skin, nasal), the top N with the greatest difference in absolute value of average L2FC relative to the mid-flight timepoints. In other words, we selected for microbial features with dramatic overall L2FCs. We maximized N on the basis of the available space in the figure in question. We note that the complete, categorized association results are available in the online data resource (see Data availability).Detecting microbial sharing between the crew and environment before, during and after flight We modelled our species/strain-sharing analysis on the basis of ref. 30. Briefly, we used the –s flag in MetaPhlAn4 to generate sam files that could be fed into StrainPhlAn. We used the sample2markers.py script to generate consensus markers and extracted markers for each identified strain using extract_markers.py. We ran StrainPhlAn with the settings recommended in ref. 30 (–markers_in_n_samples 1, –samples_with_n_markers 10 – mutation_rates –phylophlan_mode accurate). We then used the tree distance files generated by StrainPhlAn to identify strain-sharing cut-offs on the basis of the prevalence of different strains (detailed tutorial: https://github.com/biobakery/MetaPhlAn/wiki/Strain-Sharing-Inference).Association with host immune gene subtypes The single-cell sequencing approach and averaging of host genes to identify expression levels are documented in refs. 33,69. The resultant averaged expression levels across cell types were associated with microbial feature abundance/expression using lasso regression. We used the same log transformation approach as in the mixed effects modelling for the microbial features, and we centred and rescaled the immune expression data. In total, we computed one regression per immune cell type (N = 8) per relevant microbial feature, with the independent variables being all human genes (N = 30,601). We selected features on the basis of their grouping described above, picking only those that were increased transiently or persistently increased after flight. Due to the volume of gene-catalogue associations, we only analysed persistently increased genes. We report outcomes with non-zero coefficients in the text.Figure generation and additional data processing notes The GNU parallel package was used for multiprocessing on the Linux command line70. We additionally used a series of separate R packages for analysis and visualization67,68,71–76. Figures were compiled in Adobe Illustrator.Statistics and reproducibility No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size; all possible samples from all crew members (N = 4) were taken. No sequenced data were excluded from the analyses; however, samples were quality controlled before bioinformatic and statistical analysis to remove duplicated reads, trim adapters and low-quality bases, remove human contamination and remove potential microbial contamination (using negative controls). The experiments were not randomized. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (507.8KB, pdf) Supplementary Figs. 1–7.

    "title": "Spatiotemporal expression and control of haemoglobin in space",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166948/",
    "abstract": "Abstract It is now widely recognised that the environment in space activates a diverse set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways. This includes the activation of genes associated with blood homeostasis and erythropoiesis, with a particular emphasis on those involved in globin chain production. Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. Our findings reveal significant variations in globin gene expression corresponding to the distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected samples. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research. Subject terms: RNA, Genetics research, Anaemia, Transcriptomics, Erythropoiesis",
    "introduction": "Introduction An interesting phenomenon that has been observed in studies related to space medicine and biology is the clinical phenotype associated with space anaemia. In the environment on board the International Space Station, astronauts experience a reduction in their red blood cell mass, associated with anaemia, which is however resolved after a few months back on Earth1,2. The mechanism behind the incidence of space anaemia is still unknown, much like another important occurrence that deals with haemoglobin gene switching3. The globin gene switch has long been thought to act as a paradigm for studying gene switch mechanisms for both in vitro and in vivo clinical models. Perturbations in the globin switch may lead to important clinical disorders, also known as haemoglobinopathies, that include, amongst others, sickle cell disease and beta-thalassaemia4. The regulation and control of the globin genes are governed by a set of transcription factors and other key molecules that, when brought together in close proximity, will dynamically shift the beta-globin locus and express the globin genes in a developmental pattern. The fine and exquisite nature of the globin gene control, as well as their extensive studies to date on all -omic fronts, have made them the model of choice to study in one of the harshest environments that humans can experience. Erythropoiesis is a dynamic multi-step process5 involving the differentiation of early erythroid progenitors to enucleated red blood cells. Under normal circumstances, a large number of transcription factors such as GATA-1, GATA-2, LMO2, FOG, C-MYB, TAL-1, BCL11A, RUNX-1 and PU.1 and KLF1 are involved in the formation of haematopoietic cell lineages that are in turn finely controlled and regulated in producing a subset of cells capable of carrying vast quantities of the haemoglobin protein for oxygen transport to all tissues6,7. In this study, we used multiple omic datasets retrieved from several different human astronaut missions using the powerful platform made available by NASA’s GeneLab8. This platform is now an established space omics database that provides a wealth of information linking molecular biology and genetics with space medical sciences. In particular, the full astronaut blood, as well as transcriptional data from the NASA Twins Study9,10 was analysed for the globin gene expression profile as well as the extensive list of transcription factors and miRNAs involved in the globin gene switch mechanism. Our research uncovered two important conclusions. Firstly, exposing humans to orbiter effects resulted in a significantly down-regulated expression of all globin genes, seemingly confirming space anaemia as documented earlier1. The levels of expression were then returned back to normal post-flight. Key genes that play important roles in erythropoiesis were also highly perturbed during spaceflight, with some undergoing up-regulation and others down-regulated, indicating that space anaemia might occur as a combination of direct haemolysis coupled with reduced overall production of new, mature erythroid cells. Secondly, it was noted that an adult-to-fetal globin switch, similar to that observed in the amelioration of haemoglobinopathies on Earth, can be observed through the up-regulation and down-regulation of a number of genes, encoding for different globins, transcription factors and other key molecules that play a known role in globin switching mechanisms. This leads to the possible conclusion that the microgravity environment might elicit the mechanisms behind the developmental globin gene switch model and sheds an even more in-depth look at the key players involved in this intricate switch. These may constitute an important observation for those next frontier missions that look beyond the moon and further into deep space.",
    "methods": "Methods NASA twins study RNA-seq analysis Specific details related to all the methods for the NASA Twins Study RNA-seq data can be found in the following references9,53. Briefly, the NASA Twins Study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time of launch. The flight twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS while his identical twin stayed on Earth as the ground control. Blood samples were collected into 4 mL CPT tubes (BD Biosciences Cat No.362760) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cell separation was performed by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 20 min at room temperature, both on the ISS and for the ground-based samples. Ambient blood collected samples slated for immediate return on Soyuz capsule were stored at 4 °C until processing (average of 35–37 h after collection, including repatriation time). Samples collected on Earth and the ISS and planned for long-term storage were mixed by inversion and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Fresh processing of CPT tubes was performed as follows. Firstly, plasma was retrieved from the CPT tubes and flash frozen prior to long-term storage at −80 °C. Secondly, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered and washed in PBS. 0.5 million PBMCs were retrieved from one pre-flight and one post-flight sample, pelleted, flash frozen and stored at −80 °C until use for RNA extractions. The flow through from cell sorting steps was recovered as the lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction; LD and PBMC cell specimens were lysed into RLT+ buffer (Qiagen Cat No.1053393), flash frozen and stored at −80 °C until use. Cells were isolated and prepared using the BD Rhapsody platform according to the BD Rhapsody Express Single-Cell Analysis System Instrument User Guide, with a custom-designed RNA and epitope panel. Briefly, cells from each sample were labelled with sample tags and then pooled after being washed twice with FACS buffer. Combined samples were then washed an additional time before being stained with the BD AbSeq Ab-Oligo reagents. After staining, the cells were washed twice before resuspension at approximately 20,000 cells in 620 μL. These cells were then isolated using the Single-Cell Analysis System and cDNA Synthesis with the BD Rhapsody Express Single-Cell Analysis System using the manufacturers’ protocol (BD Biosciences). Cells were loaded onto 3 BD Rhapsody nanowell cartridges. Cartridges were loaded with Cell Capture Beads (BD Biosciences) before shaking for 15 s at 1000 rpm. Cells were lysed and cell capture beads were retrieved and washed prior to Exonuclease I treatment and reverse transcription. Targeted amplification of cDNA with the Human Immune Response Panel primers and custom supplemental panel was done through 10 PCR cycles. PCR products were purified, and mRNA and AbSeq products were separated by SPRIselect beads with double-sided selection. mRNA products were amplified further with 15 PCR cycles. Final libraries were indexed with 8 PCR cycles. Library quality was assessed by Bioanalyzer (D1000 HS, Agilent). Library DNA concentration was quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher, No.Q32854) on a Qubit Fluorometer. Libraries were diluted to 2 nM and multiplexed before being sequenced on three lanes of a Novaseq-6000. The mean read depth per cell was 13,244.31 mRNA reads per cell and 11,506.98 AbSeq reads per cell for a combined 243,751.30 reads per cell. FASTQ files were uploaded to Seven Bridges Genomics. Data was demultiplexed and sequences analysed with BD’s Rhapsody pipeline (BD Rhapsody Analysis Pipeline 1.4 Beta) on Seven Bridges (www.sevenbridges.com). Data was then loaded into Seurat (version 3.2.0) for analysis54. This generated a sparse matrix file of features by barcodes. This sparse matrix data was then read into R using the R package Seurat 3.2.0, and standard quality control was run to remove cells with few genes. Data was then scaled and normalised. MAST55 was used to determine DEGs between all combinations of pre-flight, return and post-flight for both TW and HR samples. Heatmaps were made for the curated globin genes on the DEG values per time point using the R package pheatmap version 1.0.12. NASA twins study miRNA-Seq analysis Specific details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twins Study miRNA-seq data can also be found in the provided references9,53. We will briefly highlight the key methods. Small RNA libraries were prepared from 50ng total RNA using the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB No.E7560) per manufacturer’s recommendations with the following modifications: adaptors and RT primer were diluted fourfold, 17 cycles of PCR were used for library amplification, and no size selection was performed. The i7 primers in the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina Dual Index Primers (NEB No.E7600, NEB No.E7780) were used to supplement the index primers in NEB No.E7560. The libraries were sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq instrument (1 × 50bp). Standard libraries were pre-processed and quality-controlled using miRTrace56. Subsequently, reads were mapped against MirGeneDB sequences57 using the miRDeep258 quantifier module. Expression values were normalised to reads per million (RPM) considering only miRNA counts. The normalised RPM value was utilised for all analysis. If the value for the miRNA was zero for all samples that miRNA was excluded from the analysis. To determine statistically significant miRNAs, ANOVA analysis with p-value < 0.2 was independently performed for each cell type. For flight-only comparisons, the same statistical significance was applied for all time points excluding the ground samples and all ambient return samples. All statistics were run independently for each cell condition/type. To determine the overlap of the miRNA signature in this paper with the Twins Study miRNA-seq data, the proposed miRNAs were used as well as all mature components of the miRNAs included in the miRNA family. Specific miRNAs related to globin pathways were plotted as heatmaps on the expression values using the R package pheatmap version 1.0.12. JAXA CFE epigenome study: RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA’s Open Science Data Repository with accession number: OSD-53059. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalised read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. Heatmaps were computed for the curated globin genes on the normalised values per time point using the R package pheatmap version 1.0.12. Differential expression analysis was carried out with DESEQ2, and subsequent volcano plots were plotted using Python’s Matplotlib package. Principal component analysis was carried out using Python’s sklearn package. Inspiration4: data collection and analysis Detailed methods for sample collection and data processing are described in ref. 60. In summary, blood samples were collected before (pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (return; R+1, R+45, and R+82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single-cell data from isolated PBMCs. Sub-populations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference. The Seurat R package was used to normalise RNA count data and calculate the average expression of each gene. For the plasma cf-RNA, plasma samples were collected in cf-DNA Blood Collection (Streck: #230470) tubes at each time point and stored at −80 °C. Plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 1300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. cfRNA was isolated from the plasma supernatant (300–800 µL) using the Norgen Plasma/Serum Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purification Mini Kit (Catalogue No. 51000, Norgen). Next, 10 mL of DNase Turbo Buffer (Catalogue No. AM2238, Invitrogen), 3 mL of DNase Turbo (Catalogue No. AM2238, Invitrogen), and 1 mL of Baseline Zero DNase (Catalogue No. DB0715K, Lucigen-Epicentre) was added to the extracted RNA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the treated RNA was concentrated into a final volume of 12 mL with the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate Kit (Catalogue No. R1015, Zymo). Sequencing libraries were prepared from 8 µL of concentrated RNA using the Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3—Pico Input Mammalian (634485, Takara) and barcoded using the SMARTer RNA Unique Dual Index Kit (634451, Takara). Library concentration was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Q33216, Invitrogen) with the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Invitrogen). Libraries were quality-controlled using an Agilent Fragment Analyser 5200 (M5310AA, Agilent) with the HS NGS Fragment kit (DNF 474-0500, Agilent). Libraries were pooled to equal concentrations and sequenced at the Cornell Genomics Core on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 machine using 150-base pair, paired-end sequencing for an average of 26 million reads per sample. All human astronaut subjects have consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented to data and sample sharing. JAXA and NASA astronaut data dissemination follows agency protocols.

    "results": "Results Obtained globin gene, transcription factor (TF) and globin miRNA expression results are hereunder showcased for the NASA Twins study, the JAXA study as well as the Inspiration4 mission. A summary of observed trends is provided in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Summary of observed differential expression in genes implicated in the globin gene switch mechanism and erythropoiesis. Open in a new tab A summary figure showcasing observed expression in a number of genes and transcription factors of interest, with observed trends across all three different astronaut cohorts for samples obtained before flight (BF), in flight (IF) and after flight (AF). A number of genes relevant to the globin switch mechanism are shown on the left, while a number of selected genes of relevance to erythropoiesis are shown on the right. Notably, repressors for fetal haemoglobin (HBF) in the haemoglobin gene switch showed in-flight down-regulation in almost all cases for both the NASA twins study and the JAXA astronaut cohort, suggesting an in-flight shift to favour the production of HBF. Erythropoiesis promoters showed a mixed in-flight and post-flight expression regulation, with some promoters down-regulated in flight and thus likely contributing to the space anaemia phenotype while other promoters were up-regulated in flight, possibly in response to space anaemia. Erythropoiesis repressors were down-regulated in flight, possibly as a response to the space anaemia condition as well. For the NASA Twins study, which constitutes a one-year mission on the ISS, globin gene and TF expression information is shown as comparisons carried out between the ground and flight twin (pre-flight), as well as comparisons made for the flight twin at different stages in the mission (i.e. pre-flight, during flight and post-flight). Different cellular fractions are separately considered, with the LD and the CPT (mononuclear cells separated by centrifugation) cell types representing the erythroid-containing cellular fractions. Due to the large number of genes and TFs considered, only those showcasing a significant down-regulation or up-regulation (p-value < 0.1) in at least one comparison instance are included in Fig. 2. Separately indicated are genes and TFs in cellular fractions that showed a higher level of differentially expressed significance, with a p-value < 0.05. Fig. 2. Diagram showcasing comparisons in expression, for a number of different cellular fractions, in the NASA Twins study. Open in a new tab Comparisons were made both between the ground and flight twin as well as comparisons made on a spatiotemporal basis for the flight twin at different mission stages. Only genes showcasing at least one expression comparison with significant variation (p-value < 0.1) are included in the diagram, to maintain diagram clarity. Genes with p-values < 0.05 are separately indicated. All log2 fold-changes and p-values were calculated using DESeq2 software. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file. Despite the primary focus being on haemoglobin control, regulation, and expression in the context of space-related anaemia, preserving and presenting data on white blood cells (WBCs) is pivotal for a comprehensive understanding of physiological changes in astronauts. WBC parameters offer valuable insights into the broader immune response, potential inflammation, and overall haematological health during space missions. Considering the interconnecting nature of erythroid and immune systems, the analysis and data of WBCs can provide crucial context to haemoglobin dynamics, ensuring a holistic interpretation of the physiological adaptations astronauts undergo in the space environment. This integrative approach enhances the scientific significance of our study and contributes to a more thorough comprehension of the impact of space travel on multiple facets of human physiology. Thus, while the erythroid-containing cellular fractions are perhaps most directly pertinent, the WBC fractions are still of relevance to this study. For the JAXA cohort, which constitutes of data from 6 astronauts who spent a 6-month period on the ISS, normalised expression values are provided for all globin genes and TFs, including timestamps for temporal resolution of specific expression readings collected in-flight and post-flight. In Fig. 3, up-regulation or down-regulation of expression for specific genes or TFs of interest can be deduced when compared to the normalised pre-flight values, also provided. Values showcased in these diagrams represent mean expression levels measured across the JAXA cohort, with expression values obtained from cell-free RNA-Seq samples. Fig. 3. Normalised expression values for known globin genes and other trans-acting factors for the JAXA astronaut cohort. Open in a new tab Genes and trans-acting factors considered were those known to be involved in the globin gene switch mechanism and/or erythropoiesis, and expression values were obtained before, during and after spaceflight, at specific intervals, for the JAXA astronaut cohort, which was composed of six JAXA astronauts. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file. Following differential expression analysis using DESEQ2, volcano plots of p-values against log2 fold-changes were computed for the JAXA study, comparing pre-flight, flight and post-flight expression readings as shown in Fig. 4. Genes are known to be involved in erythropoiesis and the globin gene switch mechanism, were labelled accordingly if found to be significantly up-regulated or down-regulated. Obtained differential expression values show that erythropoietin (EPO) was indeed significantly down-regulated in-flight, when compared to pre-flight levels, but was then up-regulated again post-flight, when compared to in-flight levels. Fig. 4. Volcano plots showing significantly differentially expressed genes for the JAXA astronaut cohort. Open in a new tab Per-gene log2 fold-changes and respective p-values for comparisons between A flight vs. post-flight, B pre-flight vs. flight and C pre-flight vs. post-flight for the JAXA astronaut cohort are shown. Volcano plots showcase significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes in red and green respectively, with genes of interest falling within the significantly differentially expressed gene sets indicated in the figure by gene symbol. All log2 fold-changes and p-values were calculated using DESeq2 software. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file. Globin genes such as HBA1, HBB and HBD are also shown to be significantly up-regulated post-flight, when compared to in-flight levels, with levels of post-flight HBA1 being also significantly up-regulated when compared to pre-flight levels. The same observation was made for ALAS2, which seems to have been significantly up-regulated post-flight when compared to both pre-flight and in-flight expression levels. Conversely, HBE1 was significantly up-regulated in-flight, when compared to pre-flight levels. Notably, KLF1 was found to be significantly up-regulated post-flight, when compared to in-flight expression levels, which is of notable significance for the globin gene switch mechanism, as further discussed in discussion section. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out accordingly for the JAXA astronauts. Specifically, PCA was performed across different features (normalised gene expressions), grouping astronaut sample data into before, during and after flight groups. The features considered are genes of interest, that is genes known to be involved in erythropoiesis, haematopoiesis and the globin gene switch. However, since cell-free RNA data was used for the JAXA cohort study, trans-acting factors and globin gene expressions are separately considered features of interest. Indeed, it is expected that looking at trans-acting factors would showcase a better representation of true variation between samples since globin gene expression would be expected to be representative when considering cellular expression (particularly in the red blood cell component, where globin gene expression is most important). There is an observable separation between the three groups when considering trans-acting factors, with considerable variance observed across multiple principal components in this regard. This is particularly evident when looking at PC1 and PC2, which collectively account for approximately 68.3% of the variance measured across the data. There is also segregation of samples by flight status when looking at globin genes, particularly along the first principal component, which accounts for almost 99% of all variance measured in the globin gene data. These plots are provided in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. PCA plots showing separation between pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight JAXA astronaut samples, based on variation in expression for genes of interest. Open in a new tab Separation between pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight samples is primarily visible along PC1, using A trans-acting factors and B globin genes as features for the JAXA astronaut cohort. For the trans-acting factors, four principal components are shown due to variance percentage contributions. Separation by flight status is visible in the PC1 vs PC2 plots for both globin genes (bottom) and trans-acting factors (top). Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file. A diagram of normalised expression levels is provided for the Inspiration4 crew in Fig. 6. For this particular case, expression values are only available pre-flight and post-flight, with no in-flight measurement data available. The cellular type here assessed constitutes the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cellular fraction. As with the JAXA cohort data, up-regulation and down-regulation post-flight can be inferred from direct comparisons with normalised expression levels pre-flight. Post-flight readings are temporally resolved. Fig. 6. Normalised expression values for select globin genes and trans-acting factors for the Inspiration 4 crew. Open in a new tab Genes and trans-acting factors selected are those known to be involved in the globin gene switch mechanism and/or erythropoiesis before, before and after spaceflight, at specific intervals, for the PBMCs cellular fraction for the Inspiration4 astronaut crew. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file. A heat-map of z-scores for normalised cell-free RNA abundance in pre-flight and post-flight samples for the Inspiration4 crew is shown in Fig. 7, with alpha globin genes, beta-globin genes and trans-acting factors separately shown. Since this analysis was carried out using data from cell-free plasma samples, trans-acting factors are also to be considered as more representative of spatiotemporal effects. Indeed, the heat-map showcases an observable difference in expression between pre-flight and post-flight time points, with overall up-regulation in most trans-acting factors. Fig. 7. Heat-map showcasing z-scores for normalised expression of several different globin genes and trans-acting factors of interest for plasma cell-free samples, with pre-flight/post-flight status indicated, for the Inspiration4 crew. Open in a new tab L− indicates days before flight, and R+ indicates days after flight for different obtained samples from the crew. Genes and trans-acting factors showcased are those known to be involved in the globin gene switch mechanism and/or erythropoiesis. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file. In addition, a PCA investigation on results obtained from cell-free RNA samples for the Inspiration4 crew was carried out, with some separation in samples visible by flight status as observed in Fig. 8 when taking into account genes of interest (globin genes and trans-acting factors). This indicates that, as expected, there is an observed difference in expression when comparing pre-flight against post-flight samples using only genes of interest, indicating that there is a significant effect on the expression of globin genes and trans-acting factors involved in erythropoiesis, haematopoiesis and the globin gene switch mechanism. Specific examples concerning the observed shift are provided in the discussion section. Fig. 8. PCA plot showcasing separation between pre-flight and post-flight samples for the plasma cell-free samples from the Inspiration4 crew. Open in a new tab The first two principal components are shown, accounting for around 60% of all variance across the features of interest in the data (globin genes and trans-acting factors) for the plasma cell-free samples obtained from the Inspiration4 crew. A separation between pre-flight and post-flight samples along the first principal component is discernible. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file. Globin miRNA expression data was also collected for the NASA Twins study. As with the globin gene and TF expression, several cellular fractions were separately investigated and cross-compared between the ground twin and the flight twin at different mission stages. These are showcased in Fig. 9, but the ground twin data, in this case, was only included for reference, with globin miRNA expression varying notably between the ground twin and the flight twin even before the flight, meaning that individual-specific variations were not negligible.

Open in a new tab Selected spatiotemporal comparisons of a number of globin miRNAs in different cellular fractions are presented. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file. Physiological data collected from several different astronauts across different missions is also provided in Fig. 10). An indication of the number of astronauts that contributed to the mean data points obtained is also included. Fig. 10. Diagram showcasing a number of physiological parameters for a cohort of astronauts from across multiple missions. Open in a new tab The figure indicates levels of different parameters before, during and after flight and also denotes the sample size for every reading, as showcased by the included legend. The number of astronauts, n, refers to the number of astronauts for whom a particular data-point was calculated, with a standard error (SEM) indicated for every data-point accordingly. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file. Although not included in Fig. 10), reference can also be made to other physiological parameters that have been measured in other studies and that are of relevance to considerations made in this study. Specifically, levels of reticulocytes and erythropoietin have been measured as shown in11, amongst others. In particular, measured red blood cell counts showcase the advent of space anaemia, with post-flight levels measured immediately upon return (and even 30 days after return) being lower than pre-flight levels (with some recovery apparent after 30 days). In congruence with this observation, a very similar trend in levels of measured haemoglobin is also showcased. In summary, for the JAXA astronauts, normalised mean values of expression from cell-free RNA samples for 6 different astronauts were obtained for different genes, specifically looking at gene clusters pertaining to loci of interest in the context of haemoglobin switching, as shown in Fig. 6. Volcano plots indicated particular, significantly differentially expressed genes of interest for the JAXA cohort (Fig. 4), with PCA analysis showcasing that separation by flight status is noticeable when looking at specific genes and trans-acting factors of interest in erythropoiesis, haematopoeisis and the globin gene switching mechanism (Fig. 5). In both the NASA twins study (Fig. 2) and for the Inspiration4 crew (Fig. 6), specific blood cellular fractions were separately analysed for expression of different genes, with the LD and CPT fractions being considered as most relevant for investigation of alpha and beta-globin gene expression in the NASA Twins study, given that they are expected to contain the erythroid blood component. For the NASA twins study, differential expression analysis showcased particular genes of interest with significant up-regulation and down-regulation between different flight status samples (Fig. 2). However, relevant observations are also quoted from the non-erythroid cellular fractions, especially where trends were congruent with those observed in cell-free RNA-seq results for the JAXA astronauts. Such comparisons are expected to be of more importance when looking at transcription factors and are done while keeping in mind other physiological data as obtained across several different astronaut cohorts, as provided in Fig. 10.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The switch from fetal to adult haemoglobin after birth is well-known but not fully understood. Certain diseases show a reversed gene switch, with higher fetal haemoglobin linked to milder symptoms. In microgravity, astronauts experience a decrease in red blood cells, possibly due to bone mineral density loss12,13. This space-induced mild anaemia is intriguing for understanding mechanisms seen in clinical anaemia. The research looked into genes involved in haemoglobin production, noting similarities between astronaut and clinical anaemia in blood cell count changes. Gene expression analysis for the alpha and beta-globin loci At the alpha globin coding locus, a strong trend of down-regulation during flight was noted for the JAXA astronauts for the HBA1 and HBA2 genes (for the duration of readings from 5 days after launch to 60 days after launch), followed by an observed up-regulation in expression immediately upon return to ground, even higher than expression recorded pre-flight. A similar up-regulation was observed in the NASA Twins study, where an increase in expression of the two genes was noted in the CD19 cellular fraction when comparing pre-flight and post-flight conditions. For HBA1, this was complemented with a significant strong down-regulation observed in CD4 cells when comparing in-flight against pre-flight conditions. In the CD8 fraction, post-flight readings showed up-regulation even when comparing it with combined pre-flight and in-flight values. For HBA1 and HBA2 expression in the Inspiration4 cohort, significant up-regulation from pre-flight levels was reported post-flight immediately upon return, with levels returning to pre-flight levels in subsequent post-flight readings. These observations seem to suggest that spaceflight down-regulates expression of genes involved in alpha globin protein production, with post-flight up-regulation suggesting a recovery period (which period seemed to last until even 120 days after the astronauts’ return). This up-regulation upon return also plays a role in the response to an overall loss of red blood cell count, a well-documented occurrence in astronauts (referred to as space anaemia) which manifests itself as a mild form of anaemia, as showcased by a slight lowering of red blood cell count across several different astronauts in Fig. fig:expression_physiology. It is to be noted that mutations in the HBA1 and HBA2 gene in patients is normally manifested as alpha-thalassaemia, an inherited disorder that can range in severity from a mild form of anaemia to very severe anaemia in combination with several other clinical characteristics, such as hepatosplenomegaly and cardiovascular deformities, typically leading to fetal death14,15. An observation of note was made in the JAXA study with HBM and its paralog, HBZ, which is involved in the production of the zeta-globin polypeptide in embryos16,17. While expression for both remained low in flight, expression of HBZ increased briefly immediately upon return while expression of HBM had a delayed up-regulation, with increased expression only recorded 60 days after return to ground. Strong HBM up-regulation was also recorded post-flight for the flight twin when comparing the CD19 cell fraction with the ground twin. On the beta-globin coding locus, for the JAXA cohort, the HBB gene shows a reduction in expression observed during flight, followed by an increase in expression post-flight, surpassing expression even beyond what was observed pre-flight and mirroring observations made for HBA1 and HBA2 in the alpha globin coding locus. The HBB gene is known to directly code for the production of beta-globins, an essential sub-unit in adult haemoglobin. This seems to suggest that post-flight recovery for astronauts in this study seemed to involve enhanced expression of HBB, possibly in an attempt to recover previous repression experienced through spaceflight or as part of an overall recovery of red blood cell count in RBC-depleted astronaut blood. For the NASA Twins study, similar up-regulation was seen for HBB when comparing post-flight CD8 cell fractions with ground twin levels, with similar observations for HBG1 and HBG2. For the Inspiration4 crew, HBB gene expression was higher than pre-flight levels immediately after return but then returned to pre-flight levels. Additionally, in-flight readings for HBG1 and HBG2 in the NASA Twins study showed down-regulation when compared to pre-flight and post-flight levels, for both the CD4 and CD8 cell fractions, as was also the case for HBB expression. Interestingly, such observations were not made for HBG1 in the JAXA CFE study, where more sporadic regulation fluctuations were observed. It was however observed, for the JAXA astronauts, that an up-regulation of HBG2 was recorded in flight. HBG2 is normally expressed in fetal bone marrow, liver and spleen, while HBE1, the epsilon globin gene, is normally expressed only at the embryonic stage. For HBE1, a similar up-regulation in flight was observed in both the JAXA astronaut cohort and in the NASA Twins study, specifically when considering the CD8 cell fraction. HBG2 was also up-regulated in post-flight readings for the Inspiration4 crew when compared to measured pre-flight levels. Such observations seem to suggest that a globin switch is also activated in the beta-globin coding locus, with a preference for globin chains with higher oxygen affinity than those observed in embryonic and fetal haemoglobin. It is hence reasonable to suggest that similar observed changes in other genes or transcription factors may also have an effect on the regulation of such a globin switch. Gene expression analysis for other erythropoietic/globin-switch genes and associated transcription factors A cohort of other genes, known to be involved in a number of different pathways in erythropoiesis, was investigated. The ALAS2 gene was found to be heavily up-regulated immediately after the JAXA astronauts’ return, an observation also mirrored in the NASA Twins study, where increased expression was observed post-flight when comparing to ground twin levels in CD4, CD8 and CPT cellular fractions, together with up-regulation when comparing to the flight twin’s expression before and in-flight combined in CD8 cells. The gene is involved in the development stage for erythroblasts, specifically in the production of 5’-aminolevulinate synthase 218 - it is indeed involved in the catalysis of this haem precursor19. Its up-regulation might indicate an increased rate of erythrocyte production in post-flight recovery. A similar increase post-flight was noted in the expression of the CD44 gene, known to be involved in erythropoiesis. Previous studies with patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes, wherein red blood cells do not achieve full maturity in the bone marrow, have shown an increased expression of CD44 in sick individuals20. Down-regulation in-flight and up-regulation post-flight were also observed in both the NASA Twins study (when looking at the LD cellular fraction) and the JAXA cohort when considering the E2F2 gene, which is a known negative regulator of haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) - with enhanced expression of E2F2 resulting in lowered HO-1 levels and vice versa20. Since HO-1 catalysers the degradation of haem, the reduction of expression of E2F2 in-flight may be one of the contributing factors resulting in space anaemia. For the Inspiration4 crew, post-flight up-regulation was also observed for E2F2 in both PBMCs and cell-free RNA. FLVCR1 was shown to have perturbed expression with phases of up-regulation observed both in-flight and post-flight in the JAXA cohort and also in post-flight readings taken for the Inspiration4 crew. This gene is known to be crucial, particularly in early erythropoiesis and encodes for two haem exporters, with FLCVR1a being involved in the expansion of erythroid cell progenitors and FLCVR1b being crucial for differentiation of said progenitors into mature erythroid cells21. Indeed, reduced expression of this gene is particularly observed in Diamond Blackfan anaemia22. Its up-regulation in both flight and post-flight observations could be seen as a response to ameliorate space anaemia, although such up-regulation was not observed in the NASA Twins study. Transcription, or trans-acting factors, refers to elements that act to control and regulate gene expression through binding on specific regions of the genome, referred to as cis-acting or trans-acting elements and resulting in the promotion or repression of other genes. Several such transcription factors may work in tandem, and a number of genes can have several transcription factors affecting their expression, directly or indirectly. A number of such trans-acting factors have been investigated in this study, with some having a more pronounced and direct effect in erythropoiesis. While both MBD2 and MBD3 were found to be down-regulated during normal erythropoiesis in murine model bone marrow, MBD2 down-regulation was particularly shown to be crucial for erythropoiesis20. MBD2 promotes the degradation of CP2c family proteins, and thus its up-regulation would result in the overall down-regulation of globin gene expression23. MBD2 levels were shown to be down-regulated during flight for the JAXA astronauts, with levels returning to pre-flight levels after returning to the ground. This suggests a reaction to the increased rate of haemolysis known to be experienced in flight. However, it must be noted that overall globin gene expression was noted to decrease, rather than increase, during flight. A number of other trans-acting factors showed an increased expression in the first few days after arriving at the ISS, with subsequent in-flight levels going down. It has been shown, in separate studies, that a significant reduction in red blood cell count is observed in the first few days of spaceflight, after which red blood cell count stabilises to almost pre-flight levels11. This seems to indicate that a number of trans-acting factors closely follow haemolytic and red blood cell counts in astronaut cohorts observed in this study. BCL11A is a well-known repressor of gamma-globin gene expression6,24–26, with down-regulation in its expression observed in-flight in the NASA Twins study (when looking at the CD4 cellular fraction) and up-regulation noted post-flight in the same study. Down-regulation in BCL11A was also noted in flight for the JAXA astronauts. Similar observations were made for SOX6 in the JAXA astronaut cohort, which is known to coordinate gamma-globin expression with BCL11A via proximal promoter binding on the gamma-globin genes27. These observations suggest that BCL11A and SOX6 expression was reduced in flight, due to space anaemia, to allow the increased expression of gamma-globin, which was indeed observed to some extent in the JAXA study but not observed in the NASA Twins study. For BCL11A, although in-flight readings were not available for the Inspiration4 astronauts, up-regulation in expression was noted post-flight. Similar observations were made in the JAXA cohort with ZBTB7A, another known down-regulator for gamma-globin gene expression28,29, although no such observation was recorded in the NASA Twins study, where a slight post-flight down-regulation, when compared to pre-flight and in-flight levels, was noted. A post-flight increase in expression for ZBTB7A was however also observed in the Inspiration4 crew. Conversely, the expression of Lin28b was found to be somewhat increased in select measurements taken in-flight for the JAXA astronauts, as well as in the NASA twins study when looking at the CPT cellular fraction. This gene is known to be involved in the increased expression of fetal haemoglobin, with its increased expression in adult erythroblasts showing a subsequent increased expression of gamma-globin30. This also suggests that an overall switch towards the production of fetal haemoglobin was activated in flight. Conversely, it was found that expression of Sin3A was down-regulated in flight in the JAXA astronaut cohort as well as in the NASA twins study (LD cellular fraction), with the gene known to be down-regulated to allow for the prevalence of higher fetal haemoglobin levels31. Indeed, Sin3A is known to worsen Beta-thalassaemia severity, possibly inhibiting the action of KLF10 which is known to ameliorate symptoms in a range of Beta-Haemoglobinopathies32. NR2C2 expression levels were also observed to decrease in flight in the JAXA cohort, which further seems to point towards an overall shift towards the expression of fetal haemoglobin. Indeed, NR2C2 is known to be involved as a direct transcriptional repressor of both embryonic and fetal haemoglobin33–35. The expression of NR2C2 was observed to decrease in-flight when considering the LD fraction of cells for the NASA Twins study as well. Another interesting observation was made with the CHD4 gene, with down-regulation noted during flight for the JAXA cohort, following up-regulation to pre-flight levels after return to Earth. CHD4 has been shown to increase the expression of both KLF1 and BCL11A, with its knockdown shown to result in higher expression of gamma-globin36. This follows the other observations made in the same astronaut cohort concerning BCL11A and KLF1. It must be noted, however, that the same observation was not made in the NASA Twins study, with up-regulation of CHD4 actually being noted in-flight in this case. For the Inspiration4 crew, delayed up-regulation of expression of CHD4 was noted post-flight, when compared to pre-flight levels, with expression levels eventually falling back to pre-flight levels. In addition, KLF1 showed a significant up-regulation in expression post-flight for the JAXA cohort, after having shown slight down-regulation in expression in-flight. In the NASA Twins study it was shown that a significant down-regulation of KLF1 was observed in-flight followed by up-regulation post-flight, when looking at the CD8 cellular fraction for the flight twin. The KLF1 gene encodes for Kruppel-like factor 1, a transcription factor known to be involved in positive regulation of the BCL11A gene6,25. It has also been shown that mutations in the beta-globin CACC box prevent KLF1 binding, causing β-thalassaemia6 KLF1 is indeed also known to be involved in the expression of beta-globin25, and the fact that the expression of KLF1 in-flight is somewhat reduced from the base expression observed pre-flight indicates that the production of adult beta-globins may be somewhat repressed, which would correlate with observations made in the expression of HBB, as aforementioned. Conversely, observations of expression of the MYB gene showed an overall reduction in expression in flight and a somewhat increased expression post-flight for the JAXA astronauts, with post-flight expression of MYB also increasing upon return for the Inspiration4 crew. Interestingly, a similar trend in expression is also seen in the NASA Twins study when considering the CD4 and CD8 cellular fractions, although an opposite observation was made in the flight expression of MYB measured for the LD cellular fraction. An in-flight repression and increased post-flight expression of MYB is in line with expectations for an in-flight adult to fetal globin switch, given that MYB is known to support erythropoiesis through activation of KLF1 and LMO2 expression37, with KLF1 being a gamma-globin repressor. EPO is one of the hallmark genes for the promotion of erythropoiesis, known to typically be up-regulated in hypoxic conditions38. It encodes for a glycosylated cytokine, erythropoietin, that binds to the erythropoietin receptor, promoting red blood cell production in the bone marrow39. EPO was found to be significantly down-regulated in-flight and up-regulated post-flight in the JAXA cohort, but remaining mostly at stable levels in both the Inspiration4 study and the NASA Twins study (for the latter, slight down-regulation post-flight was instead noted in the LD cell fraction). The observation made in the JAXA cohort seems to be in congruence with the observed phenotype of space anaemia, suggesting that the down-regulation of EPO in flight, as observed for the JAXA astronauts, might have had a negative effect on erythropoiesis and thus contributed to space anaemia. Observations of the EIF2AK1 gene show significant up-regulation in-flight in the JAXA astronauts, although similar observations were not made in the NASA Twins study. This gene is one of several known essential genes for erythropoiesis, and its activation under oxidative stress conditions has been shown to result in erythroid differentiation via activation of the ATF4 signalling pathway40. The ATF4 gene itself was found to be down-regulated post-flight, when compared to in-flight levels, for both the JAXA cohort and in the NASA Twins study, when considering the CPT cell fraction. Other genes known to be heavily involved in erythropoietic pathways showed notable variation. Particularly, the ACVR1B gene showed significant down-regulation in-flight and up-regulation post-flight, both in the NASA Twins study (when looking at LD cell fractions) and in the JAXA cohort. With this gene known to be a positive regulator of differentiation of erythrocytes, these observations suggest that one possible manner in which overall red blood cell counts decrease in astronauts in microgravity could be through disruption of expression of such genes, resulting in slower rates of erythroid differentiation and hence maturity. Conversely, however, ARID1B was also shown to be down-regulated in flight for the JAXA astronauts, with this gene known to be involved in erythropoiesis suppression. Indeed, knockdown on ARID1B has been shown to result in a hundred-fold increase in red blood cell count in hypoxic conditions41. ARID1B knockdown is also known to increase the expression of GATA1 by three-fold41, with GATA1 being involved in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells to mature erythrocytes42,43. Thus, the down-regulation of ARID1B could be interpreted as a response mechanism for space anaemia, with its reduced expression possibly opposing the reduced red blood cell counts in astronauts in flight. Observations of the prevalence of GATA1 expression showed some up-regulation in flight in the JAXA astronauts, with a more pronounced increase in GATA1 expression in this cohort seen post-flight. In the NASA Twins study, post-flight up-regulation was noted in GATA1 expression, when compared to pre-flight and in-flight levels in the LD cell fraction. This seems to suggest that if the increased expression of ARID1B had an ameliorating effect on space anaemia while in-flight in this case, this was likely achieved through pathways other than GATA1-mediated differentiation and erythroid maturation. On the other hand, the increased expression of ARID1B in flight might have also had a delayed response in increased GATA1 expression (observed post-flight) and thus amelioration of astronauts post-flight could be in part attributed to the observed GATA1 up-regulation. Conversely, the expression of LDB1 was observed to undergo up-regulation in-flight when compared with both pre-flight and post-flight levels in the NASA Twins study data, when considering the LD cellular fraction only. LDB1 is known to operate in synergy with other transcription factors such as KLF1, GATA1 and TAL1, facilitating the recruitment of LDB1-nucleated protein complexes to activation sites for alpha and beta-globin genes via long-distance interactions44. Since both alpha and beta-globin gene overall expression was actually observed to decrease in flight, particularly in the JAXA cohort, this may indicate that the up-regulated expression of LDB1 in flight may in fact be one method of counteraction for overall reduced adult globin genes observed in space anaemia. It was indeed observed that while some transcription factors involved in erythropoiesis regulation showed in-flight variation in expression, others only showcased a change in expression post-flight. TAL1, a known haematopoiesis regulator and known to be essential for erythropoiesis45–47, showed in-flight up-regulation and post-flight down-regulation in the JAXA cohort as well as in the NASA twin study (LD cell fraction). However, LMO2, which is also known to be involved in haematopoiesis and essential for erythropoiesis47, showed increased expression post-flight only. The JAXA astronauts also showed a slight in-flight increase coupled with a post-flight down-regulation in the expression of NFE2, with a similar post-flight down-regulation observed in the NASA twin study (CD4 cell fraction). NFE2 plays a role in erythroid maturation, involved in controlling the transcription of erythroid-specific genes48. In addition, NFE2 is also involved in the activation of PBGD49 and FECH50, two enzymes involved in haem biosynthesis. This suggests that the up-regulation of NFE2 may be an in-flight response to counter space anaemia. The expression of miRNAs involved in erythropoiesis and globin expression Micro RNAs (miRNAs) constitute an important regulatory mechanism at a post-transcriptional level, binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) and typically resulting in repression of expression, a mechanism termed gene silencing. A number of such miRNAs involved in the regulation of globin expression have been identified in previous studies. Apart from being involved in the regulation of globin gene expression, globin miRNAs have also been shown to play a role in the switch between embryonic and fetal haemoglobin, as well as the regulation of adult globin. Specifically, a number of miRNAs have been identified as having an effect on the expression of a number of transcription factors involved in the induction of fetal haemoglobin. An example of such miRNAs includes miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-23a, miR-26b, miR-27a and miR-451, which have been shown to modulate the effects of a number of transcription factors including BCL11A, MYB, KLF3 and Sp1, resulting in an increase in fetal haemoglobin production while suppressing beta-globin expression51,52. Globin miRNA levels measured from the NASA Twins study demonstrated significant changes in selected miRNA expression levels recorded during flight and post-flight. Figure fig:expression_mirnas_NASA shows normalised expression levels subdivided across a number of cellular fractions. Among these, the LD cellular fraction as well as the CPT fraction contain the erythroid portion of the cellular fractions here considered. A lower expression of nearly all miRNAs investigated was recorded during flight in these two fractions, except for miR-150-3p and miR-23a-5p, when compared against the expression recorded post-flight. Similar trends were also observed when assessing a number of miRNAs in the CD19 cellular fraction for expression before flight and expression after flight, while an opposite trend was observed for the CD4 cells, with higher pre-flight expression than post-flight expression. For the purposes of obtaining meaningful comparisons, ground twin expression values were not considered for discussion due to the high variation observed when comparing both twins pre-flight, suggesting strong individual variations. The down-regulation observed in-flight, followed by a stronger expression post-flight in the erythroid cell fractions (LD and CPT) seems to suggest that the investigated miRNAs may indeed play a significant role in the observed globin gene expression values provided in Fig. fig:expression_mirnas_NASA. Indeed, the down-regulation of investigated miRNAs in the erythroid fractions coincides with the down-regulation of expression of adult globin genes on the alpha and beta-globin loci. Additionally, an increased expression of the same miRNAs on return to the ground after flight also coincides with an increased expression of alpha and beta-globin genes, as well as a number of transcription factors, a trend observed in the NASA Twins study, in the JAXA astronaut cohort and the Inspiration4 crew. Concluding remarks It was observed that overall adult globin gene expression was repressed in flight, while fetal globin gene expression was enhanced. Several genes coding for transcription factors known to be involved in the fetal-to-adult haemoglobin switch also showed variable expression between pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight conditions. Indeed, such observations, discussed in this study, seem to indicate that an adult-to-fetal globin switch mechanism is indeed activated in-flight, with post-flight amelioration of space anaemia seeing a reversion of expression back to normal healthy adult levels. Several of the observed changes followed an in-flight shift in favour of fetal haemoglobin, with increased expression of genes involved in gamma-globin expression and repression of genes normally involved in beta-globin gene expression, or involved in repression of gamma-globin genes themselves (such as BCL11A and KLF1). These observations seem to indicate that fetal haemoglobin expression is favoured in flight, as seen in several haemoglobinopathies where the expression of fetal haemoglobin tends to have an ameliorating effect. This suggests that the observed in-flight switch may be a similar mechanism, in this case, to combat the effects of space anaemia. In this regard, future studies will make direct measurements of fetal haemoglobin, to shed light on the direct effects of such known haemoglobin switch actors on the actual levels of fetal haemoglobin in spaceflight and afterward. In addition, a number of genes that play a role in erythropoiesis were also found to be perturbed in flight, in some cases suggesting that the observed space anaemia condition may not only be a result of increased haemolysis but also due to down-regulation in the expression of certain genes known to play an important positive regulatory role in erythropoiesis. A number of other genes involved in erythropoiesis were seen to increase in expression in-flight as well, possibly suggesting that these could act as a response mechanism, during flight itself, to the anaemic condition. Some of these genes, as with the globin switch mechanism, only showed a delayed expression variability in post-flight readings, suggesting that they might be involved in increasing erythropoiesis rates after landing. Indeed, astronauts have been observed to recover total erythroid cell counts in the weeks following return from spaceflight, effectively recovering from space anaemia. While our study provides comprehensive insights into the impact of spaceflight on astronaut blood samples, we acknowledge the limitation regarding the diverse duration of exposure. Due to logistical constraints, our analysis primarily focuses on a specific time frame. Future research with extended mission duration would undoubtedly enhance our understanding of the temporal dynamics involved, and we encourage further exploration in this area to broaden the scope of our findings.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166948 PMID: 38862545 Abstract It is now widely recognised that the environment in space activates a diverse set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways. This includes the activation of genes associated with blood homeostasis and erythropoiesis, with a particular emphasis on those involved in globin chain production. Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. Our findings reveal significant variations in globin gene expression corresponding to the distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected samples. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research. Subject terms: RNA, Genetics research, Anaemia, Transcriptomics, Erythropoiesis Here the authors analyse the impact of space on haemoglobin gene regulation using data from NASA, JAXA and SpaceX i4 missions. They find that globin gene down-regulation leads to space anaemia with post-flight recovery, and reveal an adult-to-foetal globin switch activation.Introduction An interesting phenomenon that has been observed in studies related to space medicine and biology is the clinical phenotype associated with space anaemia. In the environment on board the International Space Station, astronauts experience a reduction in their red blood cell mass, associated with anaemia, which is however resolved after a few months back on Earth1,2. The mechanism behind the incidence of space anaemia is still unknown, much like another important occurrence that deals with haemoglobin gene switching3. The globin gene switch has long been thought to act as a paradigm for studying gene switch mechanisms for both in vitro and in vivo clinical models. Perturbations in the globin switch may lead to important clinical disorders, also known as haemoglobinopathies, that include, amongst others, sickle cell disease and beta-thalassaemia4. The regulation and control of the globin genes are governed by a set of transcription factors and other key molecules that, when brought together in close proximity, will dynamically shift the beta-globin locus and express the globin genes in a developmental pattern. The fine and exquisite nature of the globin gene control, as well as their extensive studies to date on all -omic fronts, have made them the model of choice to study in one of the harshest environments that humans can experience. Erythropoiesis is a dynamic multi-step process5 involving the differentiation of early erythroid progenitors to enucleated red blood cells. Under normal circumstances, a large number of transcription factors such as GATA-1, GATA-2, LMO2, FOG, C-MYB, TAL-1, BCL11A, RUNX-1 and PU.1 and KLF1 are involved in the formation of haematopoietic cell lineages that are in turn finely controlled and regulated in producing a subset of cells capable of carrying vast quantities of the haemoglobin protein for oxygen transport to all tissues6,7. In this study, we used multiple omic datasets retrieved from several different human astronaut missions using the powerful platform made available by NASA’s GeneLab8. This platform is now an established space omics database that provides a wealth of information linking molecular biology and genetics with space medical sciences. In particular, the full astronaut blood, as well as transcriptional data from the NASA Twins Study9,10 was analysed for the globin gene expression profile as well as the extensive list of transcription factors and miRNAs involved in the globin gene switch mechanism. Our research uncovered two important conclusions. Firstly, exposing humans to orbiter effects resulted in a significantly down-regulated expression of all globin genes, seemingly confirming space anaemia as documented earlier1. The levels of expression were then returned back to normal post-flight. Key genes that play important roles in erythropoiesis were also highly perturbed during spaceflight, with some undergoing up-regulation and others down-regulated, indicating that space anaemia might occur as a combination of direct haemolysis coupled with reduced overall production of new, mature erythroid cells. Secondly, it was noted that an adult-to-fetal globin switch, similar to that observed in the amelioration of haemoglobinopathies on Earth, can be observed through the up-regulation and down-regulation of a number of genes, encoding for different globins, transcription factors and other key molecules that play a known role in globin switching mechanisms. This leads to the possible conclusion that the microgravity environment might elicit the mechanisms behind the developmental globin gene switch model and sheds an even more in-depth look at the key players involved in this intricate switch. These may constitute an important observation for those next frontier missions that look beyond the moon and further into deep space.Results Obtained globin gene, transcription factor (TF) and globin miRNA expression results are hereunder showcased for the NASA Twins study, the JAXA study as well as the Inspiration4 mission. A summary of observed trends is provided in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Summary of observed differential expression in genes implicated in the globin gene switch mechanism and erythropoiesis. Open in a new tab A summary figure showcasing observed expression in a number of genes and transcription factors of interest, with observed trends across all three different astronaut cohorts for samples obtained before flight (BF), in flight (IF) and after flight (AF). A number of genes relevant to the globin switch mechanism are shown on the left, while a number of selected genes of relevance to erythropoiesis are shown on the right.Notably, repressors for fetal haemoglobin (HBF) in the haemoglobin gene switch showed in-flight down-regulation in almost all cases for both the NASA twins study and the JAXA astronaut cohort, suggesting an in-flight shift to favour the production of HBF. Erythropoiesis promoters showed a mixed in-flight and post-flight expression regulation, with some promoters down-regulated in flight and thus likely contributing to the space anaemia phenotype while other promoters were up-regulated in flight, possibly in response to space anaemia. Erythropoiesis repressors were down-regulated in flight, possibly as a response to the space anaemia condition as well. For the NASA Twins study, which constitutes a one-year mission on the ISS, globin gene and TF expression information is shown as comparisons carried out between the ground and flight twin (pre-flight), as well as comparisons made for the flight twin at different stages in the mission (i.e. pre-flight, during flight and post-flight). Different cellular fractions are separately considered, with the LD and the CPT (mononuclear cells separated by centrifugation) cell types representing the erythroid-containing cellular fractions. Due to the large number of genes and TFs considered, only those showcasing a significant down-regulation or up-regulation (p-value < 0.1) in at least one comparison instance are included in Fig. 2. Separately indicated are genes and TFs in cellular fractions that showed a higher level of differentially expressed significance, with a p-value < 0.05. Fig. 2. Diagram showcasing comparisons in expression, for a number of different cellular fractions, in the NASA Twins study. Open in a new tab Comparisons were made both between the ground and flight twin as well as comparisons made on a spatiotemporal basis for the flight twin at different mission stages. Only genes showcasing at least one expression comparison with significant variation (p-value < 0.1) are included in the diagram, to maintain diagram clarity. Genes with p-values < 0.05 are separately indicated. All log2 fold-changes and p-values were calculated using DESeq2 software. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file.Despite the primary focus being on haemoglobin control, regulation, and expression in the context of space-related anaemia, preserving and presenting data on white blood cells (WBCs) is pivotal for a comprehensive understanding of physiological changes in astronauts. WBC parameters offer valuable insights into the broader immune response, potential inflammation, and overall haematological health during space missions. Considering the interconnecting nature of erythroid and immune systems, the analysis and data of WBCs can provide crucial context to haemoglobin dynamics, ensuring a holistic interpretation of the physiological adaptations astronauts undergo in the space environment. This integrative approach enhances the scientific significance of our study and contributes to a more thorough comprehension of the impact of space travel on multiple facets of human physiology. Thus, while the erythroid-containing cellular fractions are perhaps most directly pertinent, the WBC fractions are still of relevance to this study. For the JAXA cohort, which constitutes of data from 6 astronauts who spent a 6-month period on the ISS, normalised expression values are provided for all globin genes and TFs, including timestamps for temporal resolution of specific expression readings collected in-flight and post-flight. In Fig. 3, up-regulation or down-regulation of expression for specific genes or TFs of interest can be deduced when compared to the normalised pre-flight values, also provided. Values showcased in these diagrams represent mean expression levels measured across the JAXA cohort, with expression values obtained from cell-free RNA-Seq samples. Fig. 3. Normalised expression values for known globin genes and other trans-acting factors for the JAXA astronaut cohort. Open in a new tab Genes and trans-acting factors considered were those known to be involved in the globin gene switch mechanism and/or erythropoiesis, and expression values were obtained before, during and after spaceflight, at specific intervals, for the JAXA astronaut cohort, which was composed of six JAXA astronauts. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file.Following differential expression analysis using DESEQ2, volcano plots of p-values against log2 fold-changes were computed for the JAXA study, comparing pre-flight, flight and post-flight expression readings as shown in Fig. 4. Genes are known to be involved in erythropoiesis and the globin gene switch mechanism, were labelled accordingly if found to be significantly up-regulated or down-regulated. Obtained differential expression values show that erythropoietin (EPO) was indeed significantly down-regulated in-flight, when compared to pre-flight levels, but was then up-regulated again post-flight, when compared to in-flight levels. Fig. 4. Volcano plots showing significantly differentially expressed genes for the JAXA astronaut cohort. Open in a new tab Per-gene log2 fold-changes and respective p-values for comparisons between A flight vs. post-flight, B pre-flight vs. flight and C pre-flight vs. post-flight for the JAXA astronaut cohort are shown. Volcano plots showcase significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes in red and green respectively, with genes of interest falling within the significantly differentially expressed gene sets indicated in the figure by gene symbol. All log2 fold-changes and p-values were calculated using DESeq2 software. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file.Globin genes such as HBA1, HBB and HBD are also shown to be significantly up-regulated post-flight, when compared to in-flight levels, with levels of post-flight HBA1 being also significantly up-regulated when compared to pre-flight levels. The same observation was made for ALAS2, which seems to have been significantly up-regulated post-flight when compared to both pre-flight and in-flight expression levels. Conversely, HBE1 was significantly up-regulated in-flight, when compared to pre-flight levels. Notably, KLF1 was found to be significantly up-regulated post-flight, when compared to in-flight expression levels, which is of notable significance for the globin gene switch mechanism, as further discussed in discussion section. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out accordingly for the JAXA astronauts. Specifically, PCA was performed across different features (normalised gene expressions), grouping astronaut sample data into before, during and after flight groups. The features considered are genes of interest, that is genes known to be involved in erythropoiesis, haematopoiesis and the globin gene switch. However, since cell-free RNA data was used for the JAXA cohort study, trans-acting factors and globin gene expressions are separately considered features of interest. Indeed, it is expected that looking at trans-acting factors would showcase a better representation of true variation between samples since globin gene expression would be expected to be representative when considering cellular expression (particularly in the red blood cell component, where globin gene expression is most important). There is an observable separation between the three groups when considering trans-acting factors, with considerable variance observed across multiple principal components in this regard. This is particularly evident when looking at PC1 and PC2, which collectively account for approximately 68.3% of the variance measured across the data. There is also segregation of samples by flight status when looking at globin genes, particularly along the first principal component, which accounts for almost 99% of all variance measured in the globin gene data. These plots are provided in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. PCA plots showing separation between pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight JAXA astronaut samples, based on variation in expression for genes of interest. Open in a new tab Separation between pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight samples is primarily visible along PC1, using A trans-acting factors and B globin genes as features for the JAXA astronaut cohort. For the trans-acting factors, four principal components are shown due to variance percentage contributions. Separation by flight status is visible in the PC1 vs PC2 plots for both globin genes (bottom) and trans-acting factors (top). Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file.A diagram of normalised expression levels is provided for the Inspiration4 crew in Fig. 6. For this particular case, expression values are only available pre-flight and post-flight, with no in-flight measurement data available. The cellular type here assessed constitutes the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cellular fraction. As with the JAXA cohort data, up-regulation and down-regulation post-flight can be inferred from direct comparisons with normalised expression levels pre-flight. Post-flight readings are temporally resolved. Fig. 6. Normalised expression values for select globin genes and trans-acting factors for the Inspiration 4 crew. Open in a new tab Genes and trans-acting factors selected are those known to be involved in the globin gene switch mechanism and/or erythropoiesis before, before and after spaceflight, at specific intervals, for the PBMCs cellular fraction for the Inspiration4 astronaut crew. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file.A heat-map of z-scores for normalised cell-free RNA abundance in pre-flight and post-flight samples for the Inspiration4 crew is shown in Fig. 7, with alpha globin genes, beta-globin genes and trans-acting factors separately shown. Since this analysis was carried out using data from cell-free plasma samples, trans-acting factors are also to be considered as more representative of spatiotemporal effects. Indeed, the heat-map showcases an observable difference in expression between pre-flight and post-flight time points, with overall up-regulation in most trans-acting factors. Fig. 7. Heat-map showcasing z-scores for normalised expression of several different globin genes and trans-acting factors of interest for plasma cell-free samples, with pre-flight/post-flight status indicated, for the Inspiration4 crew. Open in a new tab L− indicates days before flight, and R+ indicates days after flight for different obtained samples from the crew. Genes and trans-acting factors showcased are those known to be involved in the globin gene switch mechanism and/or erythropoiesis. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file.In addition, a PCA investigation on results obtained from cell-free RNA samples for the Inspiration4 crew was carried out, with some separation in samples visible by flight status as observed in Fig. 8 when taking into account genes of interest (globin genes and trans-acting factors). This indicates that, as expected, there is an observed difference in expression when comparing pre-flight against post-flight samples using only genes of interest, indicating that there is a significant effect on the expression of globin genes and trans-acting factors involved in erythropoiesis, haematopoiesis and the globin gene switch mechanism. Specific examples concerning the observed shift are provided in the discussion section. Fig. 8. PCA plot showcasing separation between pre-flight and post-flight samples for the plasma cell-free samples from the Inspiration4 crew. Open in a new tab The first two principal components are shown, accounting for around 60% of all variance across the features of interest in the data (globin genes and trans-acting factors) for the plasma cell-free samples obtained from the Inspiration4 crew. A separation between pre-flight and post-flight samples along the first principal component is discernible. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file.Globin miRNA expression data was also collected for the NASA Twins study. As with the globin gene and TF expression, several cellular fractions were separately investigated and cross-compared between the ground twin and the flight twin at different mission stages. These are showcased in Fig. 9, but the ground twin data, in this case, was only included for reference, with globin miRNA expression varying notably between the ground twin and the flight twin even before the flight, meaning that individual-specific variations were not negligible. Fig. 9. Diagram showcasing normalised values of globin miRNA expression in the NASA Twins study. Open in a new tab Selected spatiotemporal comparisons of a number of globin miRNAs in different cellular fractions are presented. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file.Physiological data collected from several different astronauts across different missions is also provided in Fig. 10). An indication of the number of astronauts that contributed to the mean data points obtained is also included. Fig. 10. Diagram showcasing a number of physiological parameters for a cohort of astronauts from across multiple missions. Open in a new tab The figure indicates levels of different parameters before, during and after flight and also denotes the sample size for every reading, as showcased by the included legend. The number of astronauts, n, refers to the number of astronauts for whom a particular data-point was calculated, with a standard error (SEM) indicated for every data-point accordingly. Source data for the figure is provided in the Source Data file.Although not included in Fig. 10), reference can also be made to other physiological parameters that have been measured in other studies and that are of relevance to considerations made in this study. Specifically, levels of reticulocytes and erythropoietin have been measured as shown in11, amongst others. In particular, measured red blood cell counts showcase the advent of space anaemia, with post-flight levels measured immediately upon return (and even 30 days after return) being lower than pre-flight levels (with some recovery apparent after 30 days). In congruence with this observation, a very similar trend in levels of measured haemoglobin is also showcased. In summary, for the JAXA astronauts, normalised mean values of expression from cell-free RNA samples for 6 different astronauts were obtained for different genes, specifically looking at gene clusters pertaining to loci of interest in the context of haemoglobin switching, as shown in Fig. 6. Volcano plots indicated particular, significantly differentially expressed genes of interest for the JAXA cohort (Fig. 4), with PCA analysis showcasing that separation by flight status is noticeable when looking at specific genes and trans-acting factors of interest in erythropoiesis, haematopoeisis and the globin gene switching mechanism (Fig. 5). In both the NASA twins study (Fig. 2) and for the Inspiration4 crew (Fig. 6), specific blood cellular fractions were separately analysed for expression of different genes, with the LD and CPT fractions being considered as most relevant for investigation of alpha and beta-globin gene expression in the NASA Twins study, given that they are expected to contain the erythroid blood component. For the NASA twins study, differential expression analysis showcased particular genes of interest with significant up-regulation and down-regulation between different flight status samples (Fig. 2). However, relevant observations are also quoted from the non-erythroid cellular fractions, especially where trends were congruent with those observed in cell-free RNA-seq results for the JAXA astronauts. Such comparisons are expected to be of more importance when looking at transcription factors and are done while keeping in mind other physiological data as obtained across several different astronaut cohorts, as provided in Fig. 10.Discussion The switch from fetal to adult haemoglobin after birth is well-known but not fully understood. Certain diseases show a reversed gene switch, with higher fetal haemoglobin linked to milder symptoms. In microgravity, astronauts experience a decrease in red blood cells, possibly due to bone mineral density loss12,13. This space-induced mild anaemia is intriguing for understanding mechanisms seen in clinical anaemia. The research looked into genes involved in haemoglobin production, noting similarities between astronaut and clinical anaemia in blood cell count changes. Gene expression analysis for the alpha and beta-globin loci At the alpha globin coding locus, a strong trend of down-regulation during flight was noted for the JAXA astronauts for the HBA1 and HBA2 genes (for the duration of readings from 5 days after launch to 60 days after launch), followed by an observed up-regulation in expression immediately upon return to ground, even higher than expression recorded pre-flight. A similar up-regulation was observed in the NASA Twins study, where an increase in expression of the two genes was noted in the CD19 cellular fraction when comparing pre-flight and post-flight conditions. For HBA1, this was complemented with a significant strong down-regulation observed in CD4 cells when comparing in-flight against pre-flight conditions. In the CD8 fraction, post-flight readings showed up-regulation even when comparing it with combined pre-flight and in-flight values. For HBA1 and HBA2 expression in the Inspiration4 cohort, significant up-regulation from pre-flight levels was reported post-flight immediately upon return, with levels returning to pre-flight levels in subsequent post-flight readings. These observations seem to suggest that spaceflight down-regulates expression of genes involved in alpha globin protein production, with post-flight up-regulation suggesting a recovery period (which period seemed to last until even 120 days after the astronauts’ return). This up-regulation upon return also plays a role in the response to an overall loss of red blood cell count, a well-documented occurrence in astronauts (referred to as space anaemia) which manifests itself as a mild form of anaemia, as showcased by a slight lowering of red blood cell count across several different astronauts in Fig. fig:expression_physiology. It is to be noted that mutations in the HBA1 and HBA2 gene in patients is normally manifested as alpha-thalassaemia, an inherited disorder that can range in severity from a mild form of anaemia to very severe anaemia in combination with several other clinical characteristics, such as hepatosplenomegaly and cardiovascular deformities, typically leading to fetal death14,15. An observation of note was made in the JAXA study with HBM and its paralog, HBZ, which is involved in the production of the zeta-globin polypeptide in embryos16,17. While expression for both remained low in flight, expression of HBZ increased briefly immediately upon return while expression of HBM had a delayed up-regulation, with increased expression only recorded 60 days after return to ground. Strong HBM up-regulation was also recorded post-flight for the flight twin when comparing the CD19 cell fraction with the ground twin. On the beta-globin coding locus, for the JAXA cohort, the HBB gene shows a reduction in expression observed during flight, followed by an increase in expression post-flight, surpassing expression even beyond what was observed pre-flight and mirroring observations made for HBA1 and HBA2 in the alpha globin coding locus. The HBB gene is known to directly code for the production of beta-globins, an essential sub-unit in adult haemoglobin. This seems to suggest that post-flight recovery for astronauts in this study seemed to involve enhanced expression of HBB, possibly in an attempt to recover previous repression experienced through spaceflight or as part of an overall recovery of red blood cell count in RBC-depleted astronaut blood. For the NASA Twins study, similar up-regulation was seen for HBB when comparing post-flight CD8 cell fractions with ground twin levels, with similar observations for HBG1 and HBG2. For the Inspiration4 crew, HBB gene expression was higher than pre-flight levels immediately after return but then returned to pre-flight levels. Additionally, in-flight readings for HBG1 and HBG2 in the NASA Twins study showed down-regulation when compared to pre-flight and post-flight levels, for both the CD4 and CD8 cell fractions, as was also the case for HBB expression. Interestingly, such observations were not made for HBG1 in the JAXA CFE study, where more sporadic regulation fluctuations were observed. It was however observed, for the JAXA astronauts, that an up-regulation of HBG2 was recorded in flight. HBG2 is normally expressed in fetal bone marrow, liver and spleen, while HBE1, the epsilon globin gene, is normally expressed only at the embryonic stage. For HBE1, a similar up-regulation in flight was observed in both the JAXA astronaut cohort and in the NASA Twins study, specifically when considering the CD8 cell fraction. HBG2 was also up-regulated in post-flight readings for the Inspiration4 crew when compared to measured pre-flight levels. Such observations seem to suggest that a globin switch is also activated in the beta-globin coding locus, with a preference for globin chains with higher oxygen affinity than those observed in embryonic and fetal haemoglobin. It is hence reasonable to suggest that similar observed changes in other genes or transcription factors may also have an effect on the regulation of such a globin switch.Gene expression analysis for other erythropoietic/globin-switch genes and associated transcription factors A cohort of other genes, known to be involved in a number of different pathways in erythropoiesis, was investigated. The ALAS2 gene was found to be heavily up-regulated immediately after the JAXA astronauts’ return, an observation also mirrored in the NASA Twins study, where increased expression was observed post-flight when comparing to ground twin levels in CD4, CD8 and CPT cellular fractions, together with up-regulation when comparing to the flight twin’s expression before and in-flight combined in CD8 cells. The gene is involved in the development stage for erythroblasts, specifically in the production of 5’-aminolevulinate synthase 218 - it is indeed involved in the catalysis of this haem precursor19. Its up-regulation might indicate an increased rate of erythrocyte production in post-flight recovery. A similar increase post-flight was noted in the expression of the CD44 gene, known to be involved in erythropoiesis. Previous studies with patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes, wherein red blood cells do not achieve full maturity in the bone marrow, have shown an increased expression of CD44 in sick individuals20. Down-regulation in-flight and up-regulation post-flight were also observed in both the NASA Twins study (when looking at the LD cellular fraction) and the JAXA cohort when considering the E2F2 gene, which is a known negative regulator of haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) - with enhanced expression of E2F2 resulting in lowered HO-1 levels and vice versa20. Since HO-1 catalysers the degradation of haem, the reduction of expression of E2F2 in-flight may be one of the contributing factors resulting in space anaemia. For the Inspiration4 crew, post-flight up-regulation was also observed for E2F2 in both PBMCs and cell-free RNA. FLVCR1 was shown to have perturbed expression with phases of up-regulation observed both in-flight and post-flight in the JAXA cohort and also in post-flight readings taken for the Inspiration4 crew. This gene is known to be crucial, particularly in early erythropoiesis and encodes for two haem exporters, with FLCVR1a being involved in the expansion of erythroid cell progenitors and FLCVR1b being crucial for differentiation of said progenitors into mature erythroid cells21. Indeed, reduced expression of this gene is particularly observed in Diamond Blackfan anaemia22. Its up-regulation in both flight and post-flight observations could be seen as a response to ameliorate space anaemia, although such up-regulation was not observed in the NASA Twins study. Transcription, or trans-acting factors, refers to elements that act to control and regulate gene expression through binding on specific regions of the genome, referred to as cis-acting or trans-acting elements and resulting in the promotion or repression of other genes. Several such transcription factors may work in tandem, and a number of genes can have several transcription factors affecting their expression, directly or indirectly. A number of such trans-acting factors have been investigated in this study, with some having a more pronounced and direct effect in erythropoiesis. While both MBD2 and MBD3 were found to be down-regulated during normal erythropoiesis in murine model bone marrow, MBD2 down-regulation was particularly shown to be crucial for erythropoiesis20. MBD2 promotes the degradation of CP2c family proteins, and thus its up-regulation would result in the overall down-regulation of globin gene expression23. MBD2 levels were shown to be down-regulated during flight for the JAXA astronauts, with levels returning to pre-flight levels after returning to the ground. This suggests a reaction to the increased rate of haemolysis known to be experienced in flight. However, it must be noted that overall globin gene expression was noted to decrease, rather than increase, during flight. A number of other trans-acting factors showed an increased expression in the first few days after arriving at the ISS, with subsequent in-flight levels going down. It has been shown, in separate studies, that a significant reduction in red blood cell count is observed in the first few days of spaceflight, after which red blood cell count stabilises to almost pre-flight levels11. This seems to indicate that a number of trans-acting factors closely follow haemolytic and red blood cell counts in astronaut cohorts observed in this study. BCL11A is a well-known repressor of gamma-globin gene expression6,24–26, with down-regulation in its expression observed in-flight in the NASA Twins study (when looking at the CD4 cellular fraction) and up-regulation noted post-flight in the same study. Down-regulation in BCL11A was also noted in flight for the JAXA astronauts. Similar observations were made for SOX6 in the JAXA astronaut cohort, which is known to coordinate gamma-globin expression with BCL11A via proximal promoter binding on the gamma-globin genes27. These observations suggest that BCL11A and SOX6 expression was reduced in flight, due to space anaemia, to allow the increased expression of gamma-globin, which was indeed observed to some extent in the JAXA study but not observed in the NASA Twins study. For BCL11A, although in-flight readings were not available for the Inspiration4 astronauts, up-regulation in expression was noted post-flight. Similar observations were made in the JAXA cohort with ZBTB7A, another known down-regulator for gamma-globin gene expression28,29, although no such observation was recorded in the NASA Twins study, where a slight post-flight down-regulation, when compared to pre-flight and in-flight levels, was noted. A post-flight increase in expression for ZBTB7A was however also observed in the Inspiration4 crew. Conversely, the expression of Lin28b was found to be somewhat increased in select measurements taken in-flight for the JAXA astronauts, as well as in the NASA twins study when looking at the CPT cellular fraction. This gene is known to be involved in the increased expression of fetal haemoglobin, with its increased expression in adult erythroblasts showing a subsequent increased expression of gamma-globin30. This also suggests that an overall switch towards the production of fetal haemoglobin was activated in flight. Conversely, it was found that expression of Sin3A was down-regulated in flight in the JAXA astronaut cohort as well as in the NASA twins study (LD cellular fraction), with the gene known to be down-regulated to allow for the prevalence of higher fetal haemoglobin levels31. Indeed, Sin3A is known to worsen Beta-thalassaemia severity, possibly inhibiting the action of KLF10 which is known to ameliorate symptoms in a range of Beta-Haemoglobinopathies32. NR2C2 expression levels were also observed to decrease in flight in the JAXA cohort, which further seems to point towards an overall shift towards the expression of fetal haemoglobin. Indeed, NR2C2 is known to be involved as a direct transcriptional repressor of both embryonic and fetal haemoglobin33–35. The expression of NR2C2 was observed to decrease in-flight when considering the LD fraction of cells for the NASA Twins study as well. Another interesting observation was made with the CHD4 gene, with down-regulation noted during flight for the JAXA cohort, following up-regulation to pre-flight levels after return to Earth. CHD4 has been shown to increase the expression of both KLF1 and BCL11A, with its knockdown shown to result in higher expression of gamma-globin36. This follows the other observations made in the same astronaut cohort concerning BCL11A and KLF1. It must be noted, however, that the same observation was not made in the NASA Twins study, with up-regulation of CHD4 actually being noted in-flight in this case. For the Inspiration4 crew, delayed up-regulation of expression of CHD4 was noted post-flight, when compared to pre-flight levels, with expression levels eventually falling back to pre-flight levels. In addition, KLF1 showed a significant up-regulation in expression post-flight for the JAXA cohort, after having shown slight down-regulation in expression in-flight. In the NASA Twins study it was shown that a significant down-regulation of KLF1 was observed in-flight followed by up-regulation post-flight, when looking at the CD8 cellular fraction for the flight twin. The KLF1 gene encodes for Kruppel-like factor 1, a transcription factor known to be involved in positive regulation of the BCL11A gene6,25. It has also been shown that mutations in the beta-globin CACC box prevent KLF1 binding, causing β-thalassaemia6 KLF1 is indeed also known to be involved in the expression of beta-globin25, and the fact that the expression of KLF1 in-flight is somewhat reduced from the base expression observed pre-flight indicates that the production of adult beta-globins may be somewhat repressed, which would correlate with observations made in the expression of HBB, as aforementioned. Conversely, observations of expression of the MYB gene showed an overall reduction in expression in flight and a somewhat increased expression post-flight for the JAXA astronauts, with post-flight expression of MYB also increasing upon return for the Inspiration4 crew. Interestingly, a similar trend in expression is also seen in the NASA Twins study when considering the CD4 and CD8 cellular fractions, although an opposite observation was made in the flight expression of MYB measured for the LD cellular fraction. An in-flight repression and increased post-flight expression of MYB is in line with expectations for an in-flight adult to fetal globin switch, given that MYB is known to support erythropoiesis through activation of KLF1 and LMO2 expression37, with KLF1 being a gamma-globin repressor. EPO is one of the hallmark genes for the promotion of erythropoiesis, known to typically be up-regulated in hypoxic conditions38. It encodes for a glycosylated cytokine, erythropoietin, that binds to the erythropoietin receptor, promoting red blood cell production in the bone marrow39. EPO was found to be significantly down-regulated in-flight and up-regulated post-flight in the JAXA cohort, but remaining mostly at stable levels in both the Inspiration4 study and the NASA Twins study (for the latter, slight down-regulation post-flight was instead noted in the LD cell fraction). The observation made in the JAXA cohort seems to be in congruence with the observed phenotype of space anaemia, suggesting that the down-regulation of EPO in flight, as observed for the JAXA astronauts, might have had a negative effect on erythropoiesis and thus contributed to space anaemia. Observations of the EIF2AK1 gene show significant up-regulation in-flight in the JAXA astronauts, although similar observations were not made in the NASA Twins study. This gene is one of several known essential genes for erythropoiesis, and its activation under oxidative stress conditions has been shown to result in erythroid differentiation via activation of the ATF4 signalling pathway40. The ATF4 gene itself was found to be down-regulated post-flight, when compared to in-flight levels, for both the JAXA cohort and in the NASA Twins study, when considering the CPT cell fraction. Other genes known to be heavily involved in erythropoietic pathways showed notable variation. Particularly, the ACVR1B gene showed significant down-regulation in-flight and up-regulation post-flight, both in the NASA Twins study (when looking at LD cell fractions) and in the JAXA cohort. With this gene known to be a positive regulator of differentiation of erythrocytes, these observations suggest that one possible manner in which overall red blood cell counts decrease in astronauts in microgravity could be through disruption of expression of such genes, resulting in slower rates of erythroid differentiation and hence maturity. Conversely, however, ARID1B was also shown to be down-regulated in flight for the JAXA astronauts, with this gene known to be involved in erythropoiesis suppression. Indeed, knockdown on ARID1B has been shown to result in a hundred-fold increase in red blood cell count in hypoxic conditions41. ARID1B knockdown is also known to increase the expression of GATA1 by three-fold41, with GATA1 being involved in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells to mature erythrocytes42,43. Thus, the down-regulation of ARID1B could be interpreted as a response mechanism for space anaemia, with its reduced expression possibly opposing the reduced red blood cell counts in astronauts in flight. Observations of the prevalence of GATA1 expression showed some up-regulation in flight in the JAXA astronauts, with a more pronounced increase in GATA1 expression in this cohort seen post-flight. In the NASA Twins study, post-flight up-regulation was noted in GATA1 expression, when compared to pre-flight and in-flight levels in the LD cell fraction. This seems to suggest that if the increased expression of ARID1B had an ameliorating effect on space anaemia while in-flight in this case, this was likely achieved through pathways other than GATA1-mediated differentiation and erythroid maturation. On the other hand, the increased expression of ARID1B in flight might have also had a delayed response in increased GATA1 expression (observed post-flight) and thus amelioration of astronauts post-flight could be in part attributed to the observed GATA1 up-regulation. Conversely, the expression of LDB1 was observed to undergo up-regulation in-flight when compared with both pre-flight and post-flight levels in the NASA Twins study data, when considering the LD cellular fraction only. LDB1 is known to operate in synergy with other transcription factors such as KLF1, GATA1 and TAL1, facilitating the recruitment of LDB1-nucleated protein complexes to activation sites for alpha and beta-globin genes via long-distance interactions44. Since both alpha and beta-globin gene overall expression was actually observed to decrease in flight, particularly in the JAXA cohort, this may indicate that the up-regulated expression of LDB1 in flight may in fact be one method of counteraction for overall reduced adult globin genes observed in space anaemia. It was indeed observed that while some transcription factors involved in erythropoiesis regulation showed in-flight variation in expression, others only showcased a change in expression post-flight. TAL1, a known haematopoiesis regulator and known to be essential for erythropoiesis45–47, showed in-flight up-regulation and post-flight down-regulation in the JAXA cohort as well as in the NASA twin study (LD cell fraction). However, LMO2, which is also known to be involved in haematopoiesis and essential for erythropoiesis47, showed increased expression post-flight only. The JAXA astronauts also showed a slight in-flight increase coupled with a post-flight down-regulation in the expression of NFE2, with a similar post-flight down-regulation observed in the NASA twin study (CD4 cell fraction). NFE2 plays a role in erythroid maturation, involved in controlling the transcription of erythroid-specific genes48. In addition, NFE2 is also involved in the activation of PBGD49 and FECH50, two enzymes involved in haem biosynthesis. This suggests that the up-regulation of NFE2 may be an in-flight response to counter space anaemia.The expression of miRNAs involved in erythropoiesis and globin expression Micro RNAs (miRNAs) constitute an important regulatory mechanism at a post-transcriptional level, binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) and typically resulting in repression of expression, a mechanism termed gene silencing. A number of such miRNAs involved in the regulation of globin expression have been identified in previous studies. Apart from being involved in the regulation of globin gene expression, globin miRNAs have also been shown to play a role in the switch between embryonic and fetal haemoglobin, as well as the regulation of adult globin. Specifically, a number of miRNAs have been identified as having an effect on the expression of a number of transcription factors involved in the induction of fetal haemoglobin. An example of such miRNAs includes miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-23a, miR-26b, miR-27a and miR-451, which have been shown to modulate the effects of a number of transcription factors including BCL11A, MYB, KLF3 and Sp1, resulting in an increase in fetal haemoglobin production while suppressing beta-globin expression51,52. Globin miRNA levels measured from the NASA Twins study demonstrated significant changes in selected miRNA expression levels recorded during flight and post-flight. Figure fig:expression_mirnas_NASA shows normalised expression levels subdivided across a number of cellular fractions. Among these, the LD cellular fraction as well as the CPT fraction contain the erythroid portion of the cellular fractions here considered. A lower expression of nearly all miRNAs investigated was recorded during flight in these two fractions, except for miR-150-3p and miR-23a-5p, when compared against the expression recorded post-flight. Similar trends were also observed when assessing a number of miRNAs in the CD19 cellular fraction for expression before flight and expression after flight, while an opposite trend was observed for the CD4 cells, with higher pre-flight expression than post-flight expression. For the purposes of obtaining meaningful comparisons, ground twin expression values were not considered for discussion due to the high variation observed when comparing both twins pre-flight, suggesting strong individual variations. The down-regulation observed in-flight, followed by a stronger expression post-flight in the erythroid cell fractions (LD and CPT) seems to suggest that the investigated miRNAs may indeed play a significant role in the observed globin gene expression values provided in Fig. fig:expression_mirnas_NASA. Indeed, the down-regulation of investigated miRNAs in the erythroid fractions coincides with the down-regulation of expression of adult globin genes on the alpha and beta-globin loci. Additionally, an increased expression of the same miRNAs on return to the ground after flight also coincides with an increased expression of alpha and beta-globin genes, as well as a number of transcription factors, a trend observed in the NASA Twins study, in the JAXA astronaut cohort and the Inspiration4 crew.Concluding remarks It was observed that overall adult globin gene expression was repressed in flight, while fetal globin gene expression was enhanced. Several genes coding for transcription factors known to be involved in the fetal-to-adult haemoglobin switch also showed variable expression between pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight conditions. Indeed, such observations, discussed in this study, seem to indicate that an adult-to-fetal globin switch mechanism is indeed activated in-flight, with post-flight amelioration of space anaemia seeing a reversion of expression back to normal healthy adult levels. Several of the observed changes followed an in-flight shift in favour of fetal haemoglobin, with increased expression of genes involved in gamma-globin expression and repression of genes normally involved in beta-globin gene expression, or involved in repression of gamma-globin genes themselves (such as BCL11A and KLF1). These observations seem to indicate that fetal haemoglobin expression is favoured in flight, as seen in several haemoglobinopathies where the expression of fetal haemoglobin tends to have an ameliorating effect. This suggests that the observed in-flight switch may be a similar mechanism, in this case, to combat the effects of space anaemia. In this regard, future studies will make direct measurements of fetal haemoglobin, to shed light on the direct effects of such known haemoglobin switch actors on the actual levels of fetal haemoglobin in spaceflight and afterward. In addition, a number of genes that play a role in erythropoiesis were also found to be perturbed in flight, in some cases suggesting that the observed space anaemia condition may not only be a result of increased haemolysis but also due to down-regulation in the expression of certain genes known to play an important positive regulatory role in erythropoiesis. A number of other genes involved in erythropoiesis were seen to increase in expression in-flight as well, possibly suggesting that these could act as a response mechanism, during flight itself, to the anaemic condition. Some of these genes, as with the globin switch mechanism, only showed a delayed expression variability in post-flight readings, suggesting that they might be involved in increasing erythropoiesis rates after landing. Indeed, astronauts have been observed to recover total erythroid cell counts in the weeks following return from spaceflight, effectively recovering from space anaemia. While our study provides comprehensive insights into the impact of spaceflight on astronaut blood samples, we acknowledge the limitation regarding the diverse duration of exposure. Due to logistical constraints, our analysis primarily focuses on a specific time frame. Future research with extended mission duration would undoubtedly enhance our understanding of the temporal dynamics involved, and we encourage further exploration in this area to broaden the scope of our findings.Methods NASA twins study RNA-seq analysis Specific details related to all the methods for the NASA Twins Study RNA-seq data can be found in the following references9,53. Briefly, the NASA Twins Study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time of launch. The flight twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS while his identical twin stayed on Earth as the ground control. Blood samples were collected into 4 mL CPT tubes (BD Biosciences Cat No.362760) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cell separation was performed by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 20 min at room temperature, both on the ISS and for the ground-based samples. Ambient blood collected samples slated for immediate return on Soyuz capsule were stored at 4 °C until processing (average of 35–37 h after collection, including repatriation time). Samples collected on Earth and the ISS and planned for long-term storage were mixed by inversion and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Fresh processing of CPT tubes was performed as follows. Firstly, plasma was retrieved from the CPT tubes and flash frozen prior to long-term storage at −80 °C. Secondly, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered and washed in PBS. 0.5 million PBMCs were retrieved from one pre-flight and one post-flight sample, pelleted, flash frozen and stored at −80 °C until use for RNA extractions. The flow through from cell sorting steps was recovered as the lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction; LD and PBMC cell specimens were lysed into RLT+ buffer (Qiagen Cat No.1053393), flash frozen and stored at −80 °C until use. Cells were isolated and prepared using the BD Rhapsody platform according to the BD Rhapsody Express Single-Cell Analysis System Instrument User Guide, with a custom-designed RNA and epitope panel. Briefly, cells from each sample were labelled with sample tags and then pooled after being washed twice with FACS buffer. Combined samples were then washed an additional time before being stained with the BD AbSeq Ab-Oligo reagents. After staining, the cells were washed twice before resuspension at approximately 20,000 cells in 620 μL. These cells were then isolated using the Single-Cell Analysis System and cDNA Synthesis with the BD Rhapsody Express Single-Cell Analysis System using the manufacturers’ protocol (BD Biosciences). Cells were loaded onto 3 BD Rhapsody nanowell cartridges. Cartridges were loaded with Cell Capture Beads (BD Biosciences) before shaking for 15 s at 1000 rpm. Cells were lysed and cell capture beads were retrieved and washed prior to Exonuclease I treatment and reverse transcription. Targeted amplification of cDNA with the Human Immune Response Panel primers and custom supplemental panel was done through 10 PCR cycles. PCR products were purified, and mRNA and AbSeq products were separated by SPRIselect beads with double-sided selection. mRNA products were amplified further with 15 PCR cycles. Final libraries were indexed with 8 PCR cycles. Library quality was assessed by Bioanalyzer (D1000 HS, Agilent). Library DNA concentration was quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher, No.Q32854) on a Qubit Fluorometer. Libraries were diluted to 2 nM and multiplexed before being sequenced on three lanes of a Novaseq-6000. The mean read depth per cell was 13,244.31 mRNA reads per cell and 11,506.98 AbSeq reads per cell for a combined 243,751.30 reads per cell. FASTQ files were uploaded to Seven Bridges Genomics. Data was demultiplexed and sequences analysed with BD’s Rhapsody pipeline (BD Rhapsody Analysis Pipeline 1.4 Beta) on Seven Bridges (www.sevenbridges.com). Data was then loaded into Seurat (version 3.2.0) for analysis54. This generated a sparse matrix file of features by barcodes. This sparse matrix data was then read into R using the R package Seurat 3.2.0, and standard quality control was run to remove cells with few genes. Data was then scaled and normalised. MAST55 was used to determine DEGs between all combinations of pre-flight, return and post-flight for both TW and HR samples. Heatmaps were made for the curated globin genes on the DEG values per time point using the R package pheatmap version 1.0.12.NASA twins study miRNA-Seq analysis Specific details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twins Study miRNA-seq data can also be found in the provided references9,53. We will briefly highlight the key methods. Small RNA libraries were prepared from 50ng total RNA using the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB No.E7560) per manufacturer’s recommendations with the following modifications: adaptors and RT primer were diluted fourfold, 17 cycles of PCR were used for library amplification, and no size selection was performed. The i7 primers in the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina Dual Index Primers (NEB No.E7600, NEB No.E7780) were used to supplement the index primers in NEB No.E7560. The libraries were sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq instrument (1 × 50bp). Standard libraries were pre-processed and quality-controlled using miRTrace56. Subsequently, reads were mapped against MirGeneDB sequences57 using the miRDeep258 quantifier module. Expression values were normalised to reads per million (RPM) considering only miRNA counts. The normalised RPM value was utilised for all analysis. If the value for the miRNA was zero for all samples that miRNA was excluded from the analysis. To determine statistically significant miRNAs, ANOVA analysis with p-value < 0.2 was independently performed for each cell type. For flight-only comparisons, the same statistical significance was applied for all time points excluding the ground samples and all ambient return samples. All statistics were run independently for each cell condition/type. To determine the overlap of the miRNA signature in this paper with the Twins Study miRNA-seq data, the proposed miRNAs were used as well as all mature components of the miRNAs included in the miRNA family. Specific miRNAs related to globin pathways were plotted as heatmaps on the expression values using the R package pheatmap version 1.0.12.JAXA CFE epigenome study: RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA’s Open Science Data Repository with accession number: OSD-53059. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalised read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. Heatmaps were computed for the curated globin genes on the normalised values per time point using the R package pheatmap version 1.0.12. Differential expression analysis was carried out with DESEQ2, and subsequent volcano plots were plotted using Python’s Matplotlib package. Principal component analysis was carried out using Python’s sklearn package.Inspiration4: data collection and analysis Detailed methods for sample collection and data processing are described in ref. 60. In summary, blood samples were collected before (pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (return; R+1, R+45, and R+82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single-cell data from isolated PBMCs. Sub-populations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference. The Seurat R package was used to normalise RNA count data and calculate the average expression of each gene. For the plasma cf-RNA, plasma samples were collected in cf-DNA Blood Collection (Streck: #230470) tubes at each time point and stored at −80 °C. Plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 1300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. cfRNA was isolated from the plasma supernatant (300–800 µL) using the Norgen Plasma/Serum Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purification Mini Kit (Catalogue No. 51000, Norgen). Next, 10 mL of DNase Turbo Buffer (Catalogue No. AM2238, Invitrogen), 3 mL of DNase Turbo (Catalogue No. AM2238, Invitrogen), and 1 mL of Baseline Zero DNase (Catalogue No. DB0715K, Lucigen-Epicentre) was added to the extracted RNA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the treated RNA was concentrated into a final volume of 12 mL with the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate Kit (Catalogue No. R1015, Zymo). Sequencing libraries were prepared from 8 µL of concentrated RNA using the Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3—Pico Input Mammalian (634485, Takara) and barcoded using the SMARTer RNA Unique Dual Index Kit (634451, Takara). Library concentration was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Q33216, Invitrogen) with the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Invitrogen). Libraries were quality-controlled using an Agilent Fragment Analyser 5200 (M5310AA, Agilent) with the HS NGS Fragment kit (DNF 474-0500, Agilent). Libraries were pooled to equal concentrations and sequenced at the Cornell Genomics Core on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 machine using 150-base pair, paired-end sequencing for an average of 26 million reads per sample. All human astronaut subjects have consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented to data and sample sharing.

    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight induces an immune response in astronauts. To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a “spaceflight signature” of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health. Subject terms: Epigenomics, Immunogenetics",
    "introduction": "Introduction Human spaceflight exposes individuals and their immune systems to unique environmental factors, including microgravity, fluid shifts, and radiation1,2. Since 1961, over 675 astronauts have traveled to space; studies on some crew members have shown significant immune stress related to spaceflight3. Given that more individuals with diverse physical and biomedical backgrounds are traveling into space—and that many more commercial missions are planned (e.g., Polaris Dawn, Axiom)—an urgent goal of aerospace medicine is to understand better how the immune system responds to and recovers from spaceflight for the broader civilian population. Moreover, such profiles of cellular and molecular changes in commercial crews can guide personalized countermeasures for the missions and eventually lead to better crew performance and safety4. Immune-related clinical symptoms from spaceflight are prevalent among astronauts and span many phenotypes, including inflammation, infection, and viral reactivation5,6. Indeed, clinical symptoms associated with immune dysregulation were reported with 3.4 events per flight year, representing 46% of crew members6. While these findings show that the spaceflight environment affects the human immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies. Also, since spaceflight phenocopies many of the effects of aging and aging-related disease (e.g., bone density and muscle loss)7, a better characterization of immune system changes during the extreme physiological stressor of spaceflight can offer insights into immune dysregulation and functional deterioration on Earth. Multi-omic studies provide unique advantages for understanding biological changes, including spaceflight-associated immune system alterations. For example, the NASA Twins Study used gene expression to investigate immune changes stemming from a year-long mission, and found unprecedented levels of cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10, and gene expression changes in both B-cells and T-cells7–9. However, a major limitation of that study was the sample size, as it involved only one flight subject. It additionally used a bulk-cell analysis for most of the transcriptome (preventing observations at a single-cell resolution) and lacked a chromatin analysis using assays for transposase-accessible chromatin accessibility (ATAC) data8,9, which is critical for understanding changes in genome regulation and long-term stress response. Thus, a high-resolution map of the immune system’s response to spaceflight is still needed. With these needs in mind, we report here findings on the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, an all civilian-crewed commercial orbital spaceflight, including multi-omic, in-depth immune system profiling at the single-cell level for the four-member crew with a broad age range (29-50 years old at launch) and biomedical backgrounds. We longitudinally analyzed single-nucleus gene expression (snRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq), and single-cell T/B cell antigen receptor sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, we integrated this multi-omics data with a clinical profile of a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and cytokine/chemokine/growth factor/metabolite measures. We also profiled cell frequencies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), biochemical profiling, differential gene/peak expression, enriched biological pathways, over-represented transcription factor binding site (TFBS), antibody isotype, mutation profiles of BCR/TCR, cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma, and association with skin, oral, and nasal microbiome changes. Here, we provide a detailed report of these findings, illustrating a unique set of immune system changes induced by high-elevation spaceflight, and conclude with potential countermeasures derived from these data, all of which can guide and inform future studies and missions.",
    "methods": "Methods IRB statement human subjects research All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented to data and sample sharing. Tissue samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use of the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials. The procedure followed guidelines set by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and operated under IRB-approved protocols. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). PBMC isolation and single-cell library preparation For each crew member, 8 mL of venous blood was collected in EDTA anticoagulant tubes. Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from whole blood using the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µL/mL of blood) for 20 min at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identified using side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or multiomic (GEX and ATAC) libraries. To capture T-cell and B-cell V(D)J repertoire, single cell gel beads-in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ v2, 10X Genomics). Prior to single cell multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µL of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% digitonin, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 4 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 mL cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), nuclei were resuspended in a diluted nuclei buffer (10X Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6000 nuclei per µL. Single-cell libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing In total, six timepoints were sequenced, including 92 days pre-flight (June), 44 days pre-flight (August), pre-flight (Pre-September), post-flight (Post-September), 45 days post-flight (November), 82 days post-flight (December). The libraries sequenced for each timepoint included ATAC, GEX, and VDJ (TCR + BCR) libraries. Four libraries corresponding to the four astronauts were prepared for each timepoint and library type, except for the June and August timepoints for which VDJ libraries were not prepared. In total, there were 24 ATAC and GEX libraries and 32 VDJ libraries, which were sequenced in three batches. The concentration of each library was taken using the Invitrogen Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit and run on Agilent Tapestation 2100 using Agilent Technologies D1000 reagents and Screentape for fragment analysis. The nanomolarity of each sample was calculated using the formula ((concentration (ng/µl)/ (660 g/mol)* fragment size (bp))*10^6. After the nanomolarity was obtained for each sample, the target nanomolarity was determined using the lowest nanomolarity of the sample libraries. The desired number of reads per sample was determined based on the following criterion: 35,000 read pairs per cell for ATAC libraries, 25,000 read pairs per cell for GEX libraries, and 5000 read pairs per cell for VDJ libraries. Following this, the total number of reads per pool of samples was determined by adding all the read pairs per sample, and the percentage of total read pairs of each pool that is made up of each sample was determined using this formula (desired read pairs for sample/total read pairs for the pool) × 100. The target volume (µL) for each pool was determined based on requirements for sequencing, final molarity, etc. In this case, 200 µL was used for the ATAC library pool, and 100 µL was used for both the VDJ and GEX library pools. The target volume (µL) for each sample was then calculated based on the percentage of the total pool calculated earlier, using the desired final pool volume. Based on the target nanomolarity, sample nanomolarity, and sample target volume, the input volume (uL) for each sample was calculated using the following formula ((target nanomolarity * sample target volume)/sample nanomolarity). If the volume of each individual sample does not meet the target sample volume the rest of the volume can be made up using nuclease-free water. The total volume of both the samples and nuclease-free water should add up to the target pool volume. Following these pooling protocols, the samples were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system. Alignment GEX and ATAC libraries were processed using Cell Ranger arc v2.0.0. VDJ libraries were processed using Cell Ranger v6.1.1. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome. We generated single-cell combined transcriptome and ATAC data from PBMCs from individuals with Inspiration4 mission crews across three pre-flight (June 2021: L-92, August 2021: L-44, September Pre-launch: L-3) and three postflight (September Post-launch: R + 1, November 2021: R + 45, December 2021: R + 82). We mapped the single-cell multi-ome (GEX + ATAC) data using 10X chromium cellranger-arc (10X Genomics). We followed the 10X single-cell multi-ome analysis pipeline as previously reported and adpated for this data as decribes in this Methods section11. 151,411 cells passed quality control after quality control (minimum of 200 genes, maximum of 4500 gene counts, maximum of 20% mitochondrial reads, maximum of 100,000 peak counts, maximum of two nucleosome signal, and minimum of TSS enrichment per cell). Data were integrated using Harmony70. Processing of single-cell data To identify putative cell types, Azimuth (version 0.3.2) pipeline was used with the reference dataset of Human. We annotated PBMCs subpopulations by supervised analysis guided by the Azimuth PBMC reference generated from single-cell transcriptome and CITE-seq71. For cellular proportion comparison after spaceflight, a p-value less than 0.05 with Wilcoxon rank sum test is considered significant. Differentially expressed genes and differentially accessible regions were identified with the FindMarkers function in Seurat (v4.2.0) packages (|log2FC | > 0.25 and padj < 0.05 with the default setting for other parameters). FindMotifs function in Seurat packages with default settings was used to identify the enriched transcription factor based on DARs. By running chromVAR, we computed a per-cell motif activity score (chromVAR deviation z-score of TF motifs) to visualize motif activities per cell. GeneActivity function in Signac package with default settings was used to quantify gene activity from ATAC, which generate a rough estimate of the transcriptional activity of each gene by quantifying ATAC-seq counts in the 2 kb-upstream region and gene body. AddModuleScore function in Seurat package with default setting was used to calculate the average expression levels of each program (cluster) on single cell level, subtracted by the aggregated expression of control feature sets. TCR and BCR-aligned data were analyzed with the VGenes package (https://github.com/WilsonImmunologyLab/VGenes). Biochemical profiling (BCP) and complete blood count (CBC) Complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panels were completed by Quest Diagnostics. One 4 mL tube of whole blood collected in a K2 EDTA tube was used for the CBC, test code 6399. 500 µL of serum from a serum separator tube (SST) was submitted for the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), test code 10231. Serum samples were submitted to Eve Technologies for the biomarker profiling panels (1) Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HD71) and (2) Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9). Concentration values were extrapolated using a four of five parameter logic standard curve. Samples were normalized by the mean of the preflight value of each crew. For BCP and CBC, a p value less than 0.05 with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test is considered significant. We analyzed the previously reported astronaut BCPs57 by further delineating the effect of sex- and time by Two-way ANOVA with a post hoc Bonferroni t-test. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of immune cells The granulocyte-depleted peripheral blood samples were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting to sort out different subsets of immune cells. Briefly, the frozen samples were thawed, and washed in cell staining buffer (Biolegend, cat no.420201). The cells were resuspended and incubated with monocyte blocking solution (Biolegend, cat no. 426102) and Fc Receptor Blocking Solution (Biolegend, cat no. 422301) for 20 min, followed by incubation with CD3 (T cells) (BD, cat no. 555342), CD19 (B cells) (Biolegend, cat no.302207), CD14 (Monocyte) (BD, cat no. 563420), and CD56 (for NK cells) (BD, cat no. 564058) for 30 min, washed twice in the cell staining buffer and resuspended in the same buffer. Right before sorting DAPI was added to eliminate dead cells during sorting. The gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3d. The different immune cells were directly sorted into RNAlater for RNA extraction for further validation studies. Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (qPCR) FACS-isolated T cells were used for RNA extraction with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, cat no.74134). cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. 18080051). TaqMan™ Fast Advanced system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. 4444557 used for qPCR quantification. qPCR primers are as follows. • ACTB: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4331182, assay ID: Hs01060665_g1 • FOXP3: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs01085834_m1 • TNFRSF9: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00155512_m1 • IL1R1: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00991010_m1 • IL1R2: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00174759_m1 • ENTPD1: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00969556_m1 • IL2RA: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00907777_m1 • VPS51: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4448892, assay ID: Hs00203146_m1 • VPS52: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4448892, assay ID: Hs00224000_m1 • VPS53: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4448892, assay ID: Hs00217606_m1 • VPS54: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4448892, assay ID: Hs00212957_m1 Meta-analysis of GeneLab RNA-seq data from 817 samples across 27 datasets encompassing ten different mouse tissues FASTQ files were programmatically downloaded from GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov/) and processed using the MTD pipeline72. A meta-analysis of the GeneLab data was performed in two steps. Firstly, we performed batch correction using Combat-seq73 to standardize data across different datasets. Subsequently, DESeq274 was used to perform differential expression analysis between the spaceflight and ground control mice while adjusting for age, sex, tissue, sacrifice site, and mission duration. The meta-analysis was done using DeSeq2 (wald test, two-tailed) based on batch(study)-corrected count matrix calculated with combat-seq. Multiple testing adjustment was done using Benjamini-hochberg. This analysis resulted in a ‘spaceflight signature in mice’ consisting of 2184 differentially expressed genes (1288 up-regulated and 896 down-regulated). To visually confirm that the genes in the spaceflight signature were changing in a similar direction across datasets based on differential expression analysis on each dataset separately grouping by tissue, sex, age, and mission duration. Principal component analysis Prcomp function of R was used to calculate principal components from gene expression and peak expression profiles. Enrichment analysis ssGSEA ssGSEA package was used to calculate the normalized enrichment score with MSigDB pathways. For T cell activity score, GO:2000566,GO:0043372,GO:0043378,GO:0043382,GO:0042104,GO:0045585,GO:0045588,GO:2000516,GO:2000568,GO:1903905,GO:2000563,GO:1900281,GO:2001187,GO:2001193,GO:0033091,GO:0045591,GO:2000451,GO:2000454,GO:1905404 were used.

For monocytes activity score, GO:0042117,GO:0045657,GO:2000439,GO:1900625,GO:0090026,GO:0071639,GO:0030887 were used.

Here is an example of the pre-ranked GSEA pipeline we performed. (a). Prepare the pathway collection In our case, we used MSigDB, “spaceflight signature of mice”, or DEGs from the selected study (b). Prepare the ranked list of genes. We ranked the gene sets by the adjusted p value, a combination of log2FC multiplied by −log10 (adjusted p value (or p value)), or stat. There are several ways to rank the gene sets by correlation, p value, adjusted p value, log2FC, stat, or combination of log2FC and adjusted p value (or p value) derived from the differential expression analysis. (c). Run GSEAOver-representation analysis gProfiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/) was used to identify significantly enriched (padj < 0.05) GO or KEGG pathways. All DEGs, up-regulated DEGs, downregulated DEGs, microbiome-associated DEGs were used as input. Canonical pathway analysis Data were analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, version 01-22-01) (QIAGEN Inc.) software with DEGs, FDR < 0.05. Common DEGs between females and males and sex-specific DEGs were used for canonical pathways. Gene and pathway overlap analysis I4 and GeneLab mouse data comparison To compare the spaceflight signature in mice against the gene expression changes in Inspiration 4, we mapped the mouse genes to their human equivalent using Ensembl Biomart75, which resulted in 1942 human orthologues (1147 upregulated and 795 downregulated). These human orthologues were then compared against differentially expressed (padj < 0.05) in I4.Fisher’s exact test To calculate the significance of the overlap we used Fisher’s exact test implemented in the R package GeneOverlap (https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/GeneOverlap). P values for the overlaps were adjusted by multiple tests using Benjamini-Hochberg method76. We found that 80% of the comparisons in level 1 cell annotation were statistically significant, while 56% were significant in level 2 annotation. Notably, all comparisons involving down-regulated genes in the spaceflight signature in mice and I4 showed statistical significance. None of the comparisons between down-regulated gene sets in Inspiration 4 against up-regulated genes in the spaceflight signature in mice (and vice versa) yielded statistical significance in either level 1 or 2 cell annotations.GSEA-based overlap analysis By GSEA, ranking the genes from the GeneLab meta-analysis by the negative logarithm of the p-value multiplied by the sign of the fold change (i.e., 1 if positive, −1 if negative) and evaluating whether genes differentially expressed in each cell type in I4 were enriched in either direction of the ranked ordered list. For this calculation, we used the R package fgsea77.I4 skin spatial transcriptomics Skin biopsy samples from the four crew members were collected and frozen in cryovials pre and post flight. Collected skin was flash embedded in OCT blocks. Four replicate of OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide, per astronaut,including pre and post flight replicates. Tissues were then cryosectioned at 5 µm thickness and attached to glass microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, cat# 22-037-246). Immunofluorescent visualization marker for Pan-Cytokeratin (PanCK, Novus cat# NBP2-33200, Alexa Fluor® 532, clone ID AE1 + AE3), fibroblast activation protein (FAP, Abcam cat# ab222924, Alexa Fluor® 594, clone ID EPR20021) and smooth muscle actin (SMA, R&D Systems cat# IC1420R, Alexa Fluor® 647, clone 1A4) were used for region or interest (ROI) selection. The DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to assess genes collected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides were thawed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) at 4 °C followed by PBS washes for thorough fixation. After washes, slides were prepared following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Preparation Protocol for fixed frozen samples, digesting samples with 1.0 µg/mL proteinase K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at 100 °C (NanoString, no. MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM final concentration were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology markers were prepared for four slides concurrently using Syto13 (DNA), PanCK, FAP and SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per slide. Slides incubated with 225 µl of morphology marker solution at RT for 1 h, then washed in SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP instrument. The 20× scan was used to select freeform ROIs to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. OE ROIs covered spinous and granular layers, while IE ROIs covered the basal layer, identified from the staining of the tissue. To ensure proper selection and to avoid overlaps across different ROI types, small gaps between each ROI type were made. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI. FASTQ files were then converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. Additional methods can be found in ref. 42.Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics DNA/RNA isolation, sequencing, and analysis Briefly, we ran all metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples through standard microbiome quality control pipelines using bbtools78 (deduplication, quality trimming, adapter removal, human read decontamination), and then computed taxonomic abundances with a variety of methods, those relevant to this manuscript being Xtree aligning to the Genome Taxonomy Database r20779, Xtree aligning to the complete set of non-redundant genomes in GenBank, MetaPhlAn480, and Phanta81. We report results from all four of these approaches in the manuscript at the phylum, genus, and species ranks. We used two approaches to identify associations between differentially expressed human genes and bacteria/viruses. First, we used Lasso regression to identify relationships between all DEGs for a given cell type and microbial features, characterizing any non-zero Lasso coefficient as a “potential association.” We use this phrasing because Lasso regression does not implicitly include statistical inference, therefore not controlling for false positive rates. We fit models of the form: humangene~microbe1+...+microben 1 We fit different models for bacteria and viruses (e.g., for one model, microbe1..x would be all bacteria, for another it would be all viruses). Prior to regressing, we centered and scaled the human gene abundances. We computed lasso models with both log transformed microbial abundances as well as Center-Log-Ratio transformed abundances, adding a pseudocount in the form of the smallest abundance value for a given matrix beforehand in both cases. As a second form of association identification with the added benefit of statistical inference to control for false positives, we used a mixed effect linear regression approach for each microbe/DEG pair that had a non-zero coefficient coming out of the Lasso regressions. We transformed the gene/microbe abundances with the same approaches as above and fit models of the form: humangene~microbe+(1∣CrewID) 2 CrewID is a random effect corresponding to the different individuals meant to account for interindividual variation in microbial feature abundance. We used Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing, computing the threshold cutoff per cell type based on as the total number of microbes in a given rank and domain (e.g., all bacterial phyla, all bacterial genera, all bacterial species, all viral phyla, all viral genera) times the number of DEGs for a given cell type. This was meant to minimize the overall Bonferroni threshold. Additional methods for generating the bacterial and viral taxonomic abundance data used in the immune-microbiome associations are described in companion manuscripts58,82. I4 cfRNA processing Plasma was frozen at −80 °C until processed. Before RNA extraction, plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 1300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. cfRNA was isolated from the plasma supernatant (300–800 µL) using the Norgen Plasma/Serum Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purification Mini Kit (Catalog No. 51000, Norgen). Next, 10 mL of DNase Turbo Buffer (Catalog No. AM2238, Invitrogen), 3 mL of DNase Turbo (Catalog No. AM2238, Invitrogen), and 1 mL of Baseline Zero DNase (Catalog No. DB0715K, Lucigen-Epicenter) was added to the extracted RNA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the treated RNA was concentrated into a final volume of 12 mL with the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate Kit (Catalog No. R1015, Zymo). Sequencing libraries prepared from 8 μL of concentrated RNA using the Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3—Pico Input Mammalian (634485, Takara) and barcoded using the SMARTer RNA Unique Dual Index Kit (634451, Takara). Library concentration was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Q33216, Invitrogen) with the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Invitrogen). Libraries were quality-controlled using an Agilent Fragment Analyzer 5200 (M5310AA, Agilent) with the HS NGS Fragment kit (DNF-474-0500, Agilent). Libraries were pooled to equal concentrations and sequenced at Cornell Genomics on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 machine using 150-base pair, paired-end sequencing for an average of 26 million reads per sample. Sequencing data was processed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline utilizing the Snakemake workflow management system (v7.7.0). Reads were quality filtered and trimmed using BBDUK (v38.90), aligned to the Gencode GRCh38 human reference genome (v38, primary assembly) using STAR (v2.7.0f) default parameters, deduplicated using UMI tools (v1.1.2), and features quantified using featureCount (v2.0.0). Mitochondrial, ribosomal, X, and Y chromosome genes were removed prior to analysis. cfRNA sample quality was determined by calculating DNA contamination (intron/exon ratio), rRNA contamination, number of feature counts, and RNA degradation. All samples passed QC. Read counts of technical duplicate samples were combined for downstream analyses. Cell-type deconvolution was performed using BayesPrism (v2.0) with the Tabula Sapiens single cell RNA-seq atlas (Release 1)83,84. Cells from the Tabula Sapiens atlas were grouped as previously described in ref. 85. Comparative analysis of DEGs was performed using a negative binomial model as implemented in the DESeq2 package (v1.34.0) using a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value cutoff < 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Variance stabilization transformation was used for comparing and plotting gene counts, unless otherwise stated. I4 secretome data Plasma samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min and then Extracellular Vesicles and Particles (EVPs) were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min. EVPs were then washed in PBS and again collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS. Two micrograms of enriched EVPs were digested and analyzed with LC-MS/MS in data-dependent acquisition mode. The list of differentially abundant proteins from the plasma proteomics data was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 1. Heatmaps were generated with mitochondrial and oxidative stress genes using R package pheatmap. Additional protocol details on EVP proteomic profiling is described in ref. 86. NASA twins study RNA-seq data Gene set enrichment analysis and gene expression data have been downloaded from the previous publication7. In brief, one astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the ISS, and his identical twin sibling was also monitored at the same time, serving as a genetically matched ground control for this study. JAXA CFE cfRNA data Plasma cell-free RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA’s GeneLab platform with accession number GLDS-530/OSD-530. Briefly, blood samples were collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Total RNA was purified from plasma samples and processed for RNA-seq analysis. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. Single-cell microgravity simulated in vitro PBMCs Single-cell RNA-seq data was generated from donor PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity (μG) for 25 h, with a continual motion machine (Rotating Wall Vessel) serving as an in vitro model for microgravity. DEGs were calculated as μG vs. 1 G (control) for pooled data after two donor sequencing reactions (one male and one female). Detailed methods can be found in ref. 44. Bulk RNA-sequencing from mouse tissues All mouse RNA-sequencing datasets used were previously published and are publicly available. Brown adipose tissue, kidney, liver, mandibular bone, spleen, temporal bone, thymus, white adipose tissue and soleus were collected from mice that had spent 31 days on the ISS, two days after returning to Earth87,88. A different group of soleus samples were collected from mice that had spent 34.1 days in microgravity, 3.3 days after returning to Earth89. The tibialis anterior samples were obtained from the Rodent Research-23 mission. Briefly, mice were maintained in microgravity for 38 days and were euthanized and dissected after 24 hours from returning to Earth. A more thorough description of the experimental design can be found at NASA GeneLab, Doi: 10.26030/zw7z-bj40. Raw reads were trimmed galore, then aligned using STAR2 alignment to mm10 or Salmon to Ensembl transcripts. Gene counties were obtained using featurecounts. All RNAseq differential expression analyses were performed using DESeq2(1.38.3) in RStudio (R, 4.2.3). Heatmaps and volcano plots were produced using the R packages ComplexHeatmap (2.15.1) and EnhancedVolcano (1.16.0), respectively. Compound analysis FDA-approved drugs (n = 1692) are selected from the DrugBank database and food compounds (n = 7962) are selected from the FoodDB database. LINCS compounds (n = 5414) are obtained from LINCS L1000 project. “Compound” is used as a general term for “drug”, “food compound” and “LINCS compound” throughout the document. Compound-protein interactions are extracted from the STITCH database v5.069 by matching the InChI keys of drugs/food/LINCS compounds. STITCH collects information from multiple sources and individual scores from each source are combined into an overall confidence score. After processing, three data sets are obtained: i) drug-gene interaction dataset containing 1890 drugs and 16,654 genes with 542,577 interactions ii) food compound - gene interaction dataset containing 7,654 compounds and 116,375 genes and 818,737 interactions iii) LINCS compound—gene interaction dataset containing 5414 compounds and 16,794 genes and 692,152 interactions. The universal gene set contains all genes that interact with at least one compound. The compound with low p-value interacts with a higher proportion of the DEGs than that expected by chance. Statistically significant compounds were then obtained after Bonferroni adjustment of p values. The pipeline for this compound analysis is implemented in the gcea R package (https://github.com/nguyenkhiemv/gcea). Further protocol and sample processing information Sample collection methods and data generation have been detailed in full in the paper86.

    "results": "Results Immune-metabolic changes after spaceflight and recovery To characterize the immune and metabolic changes induced by spaceflight, we collected serum and whole blood from the crew before and after the spaceflight (Fig. 1a) and first performed CBC and CMP assays to measure cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and metabolites. The crew’s baseline values (pre-flight) were compared to those obtained 24 h after returning to Earth (R + 1) and post-flight (R + 45, 82, 194), which revealed a set of cytokines with significant increase (n = 13) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b, Wilcoxon-rank sum test, adjusted p value < 0.05) and a smaller set (n = 5) of molecules with a significant decrease (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b, Wilcoxon-rank sum test, adjusted p value < 0.05). The IL-6, IL-10, CRP, and MCP-1 increases were consistent with changes observed in other astronauts following long duration (3–6-month or 12-month duration) missions (Supplementary Fig. 1c)7–10. Moreover, several other pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-27, CRP) and chemokines (IP-10, ENA-78, Fractalkine) were also significantly up-regulated at R + 1 (Fig. 1b). Although IL-6 and TNFα are well-known pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase reactants like fibrinogen, hemoglobin, and SAP levels did not significantly change (Supplementary Fig. 1b), indicating that the immune reaction was not pervasive, and no other significant changes were observed in the basic metabolic blood panel (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Fig. 1. Immune-metabolic changes after 3-day spaceflight and recovery. Open in a new tab a Overview of I4 mission single cell GEX + ATAC, single cell TCR/BCR V(D)J repertoire, biochemical profiles (BCP) of 97 analytes, and complete blood count (CBC) of 15 analytes data collection and analysis, created with BioRender.com. b Heatmap of significantly changed biochemicals (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) in serum before spaceflight (Pre-flight: mean of L-92, L-44, L-3) and after spaceflight (Immediately Post-flight: R + 1, and Long-term Post-flight: R + 45, R + 82, R + 194). A significant increase in concentration is observed immediately after spaceflight (R + 1) in IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-27, MCP-1, TNFα, IP-10, ENA-78, CRP and Fractalkine. On the other hand, IL-9, IL-17E/IL-25, MIP-1α, MCP-2 and MCP-4 showed a significant decrease in their serum levels after spaceflight (R + 1). Wilcoxon-rank sum test (padj <0.05, two-sided). c GSEA of the ‘spaceflight signatures of the I4 astronauts’ (Hallmark, KEGG, and wikipathways: filtered with padj <0.05, GOBP and C2: top10 of positive and negative NES, padj < 0.05, padj calculated by fGSEA R package). d Overlap percentage of the GSEA pathways across the I4 immune cells (Fisher’s exact test, two-sided, padj < 0.05. Except for the Hallmark CD14 Mono: P value = 0.09). e Activity scores of top enriched motifs from pseudo-bulk PBMCs over time. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.These data suggest that a high elevation, 3-day spaceflight is sufficient to induce the production of some established spaceflight cytokine signatures (e.g., IL-6, IL-10) as well as previously undocumented, responsive cytokines (e.g., ENA-78). These proteins have critical roles in immune response, muscle homeostasis, and hematopoiesis8, but are not normally associated with systemic inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Moreover, some cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-1RA, and Fractalkine) are considered exerkines, cytokines produced by the muscle and other tissues during exercise. As such, we then examined if muscle tissues could be the source of these immune markers. Significant increases in some myokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-7) were indeed observed, further supporting muscles as a possible source (Fig. 1b) of these molecules, and indicating a physiological response to microgravity rather than a purely inflammatory response8. We next mined RNA-sequencing data from dissected, space-flown mouse tissues to assess a possible tissue-of-origin for the circulating cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 2a). While non-muscle tissues (e.g., mandibular bone, brown and white adipose tissues) did not show changes in IL-6 or IL-10, (Supplementary Fig. 2b, d), the soleus showed a significant increase in the chemokine Ccl2/Mcp-1 (padj < 0.05, logFC > 1), which is a chemokine associated with muscle exertion. These samples also showed high CD68 expression, a surface marker highly expressed in differentiating (M0) macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 2e–h). Also, the tibialis anterior muscle showed an increase in interleukins, with the largest increase upon landing for the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-5 (log2FC = 2.3, p value < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 2i), further suggesting muscles as a potential source for the cytokines found in the I4 crew. A spaceflight gene expression signature in Inspiration4 astronauts PBMCs were used to generate single-nuclei gene expression (GEX) and ATAC data (Fig. 1a, b, Fig. 2). We combined GEX and ATAC analysis of PBMCs across 151,411 nuclei (filtered with minimum of 200 genes, maximum of 4500 gene counts, maximum of 20% mitochondrial reads, maximum of 100,000 peak counts, maximum of 2 nucleosome signal, and minimum of TSS enrichment per cell) by adapting the multi-omic pipeline reported11, spanning 9 immune cell types: CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, other T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, CD14 monocytes, CD16 monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and all remaining cells (“other”) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). We validated the expression of markers specific for each subpopulation in annotated PBMC subpopulations based on reference expression for each cell type (Supplementary Fig. 3a), quantified the distribution of cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and confirmed that overall cell proportions were stable across spaceflight in the combined single-nuclei multi-ome and FACS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3c–e) and CBC data (Supplementary Fig. 3f), and mapped principal component analysis (PCA) clustering of GEX and ATAC data across the timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 4, 5).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accessible regions (DARs) (padj <0.05, |log2FC | > 0.25) were calculated from the snRNA-seq snATAC-seq data, respectively, comparing immediate (R + 1) and post-flight differences (R + 45, R + 82) relative to pre-flight levels (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The number of DEGs and DARs were highest at R + 1, but decreased for subsequent timepoints among PBMCs, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 6b). However, a wide range of responses to spaceflight was observed, with some cell types more affected than others. For example, CD14 monocytes showed the highest number of DARs and DEGs at R + 1, yet CD4 T and CD8 T cells were the least perturbed (Supplementary Fig. 6b–c). Notably, chromatin accessibility responses to spaceflight exhibited even greater cell type-specificity (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c) than DEGs, with the most changes still appearing at R + 1. In addition to the cell-specific responses to spaceflight, a core set of pan-cellular gene expression changes was observed at R + 1. Specifically, a set of 144 consistent DEGs was observed across all nine cell types (Supplementary Fig. 6c). PBMCs DEGs were significantly conserved in I4 immune cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d), thus, we used the PBMCs DEGs as the “spaceflight signatures of the I4 astronauts” for further analysis. Given this spaceflight signature set of genes, we then examined the enriched pathways using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which showed enrichment of ribosomal translation, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondrial metabolism, UV response, TCF21 targets, mitotic spindle, and immune pathways (padj < 0.05) (Fig. 1c). Additionally, we confirmed that the GSEA result was conserved across all I4 immune cell sub-types (Fig. 1d). We cross-validated the GSEA findings with over-representation analysis through Gene Ontology pathways of these DEGs, which also showed down-regulated DEGs were enriched (padj < 0.05) in ribosomal translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial metabolism (Supplementary Data. 1). Up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in response to stimulus, signaling, and metabolism (Supplementary Data. 1). Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) also showed inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and translation (EIF2 signaling) pathways and activation of mitochondrial dysfunction across cell types (Supplementary Data 2). Also, the core set of altered regions of chromatin (DARs) on R + 1 included over-represented motifs for SPIB, SPI1, CEBPD, SPIC, EHF, CEBPA, ELF3, IKZF1, EWSR1-FLI1, FOSL2, and KLF4 (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 6e, Supplementary Data 3). Their normalized motif activity score (chromVAR deviation z-scores of TF motifs) were increased at R + 1 and recovered over time (Fig. 1e). Of note, while CEBPA12, EHF13, SMAD14, EWSR1-FLI115, c-Fos16, and TCF2117,18 have been implicated in spaceflight before, the others have not been previously described in astronauts. Cell subpopulation changes after 3-day spaceflight and recovery To better understand spaceflight’s impact on each cell type, we examined the cell profiles with more granular sub-typing (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d), mutation rates in B cells and T cells (Supplementary Fig. 7e–h) and used single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) on the DEGs for each immune cell population (Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Data 4). First, overall cell proportions of granular annotation were stable across spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). Second, we found that the TCR V(D)J repertoire from L-3 to R + 82 was stable in terms of mutations (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f). Conversely, the total number of BCR mutations increases relative to pre-flight at R + 1 (64.6 vs 61.6) and R + 45 (65.5 vs 61.6) (Supplementary Fig. 7g, h). Moreover, we found that cell differentiation and cell proliferation pathway scores were decreased (around 5–10%) at R + 1 for both CD4 T and CD8 T cells, which mirrors the T cell suppression previously observed in simulated GCR irradiation19, simulated microgravity20, and Space Shuttle missions21 (Supplementary Data 4). Similarly, the CD4 central memory T cell (CD4 TCM) differentiation pathway and memory T cell activation scores were decreased in CD4 effector memory T cells (CD4 TEM) and CD8 central memory T cells (CD8 TCM) at R + 1. However, monocytes and DCs showed more mixed phenotypes, with activation, differentiation, aggregation, and extravasation scores all dysregulated at R + 1. These findings are consistent with previous reports of changes in phagocytic capacity, degranulation, and cytokine production for DC22,23 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Upon return to Earth, the astronauts’ serum showed higher concentrations of cytokines associated with inflammation, such as IL-6, TNF-α, APR (acute phase reactants), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (Fig. 1b). These changes were concomitant with an increase in cytokines with anti-inflammatory activity, such as IL-1ra, IL-10, and cytokines linked to a Th2 profile (IL-4 and IL-5) (Fig. 1b), which likely balances the inflammation from returning to Earth. However, the Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-secreted cytokines in CD4 TCM subset24–28 showed no significant changes (Supplementary Fig. 9a); GSEA analysis of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell pathways confirmed no significant changes (Supplementary Fig. 9b, padj > 0.05), further indicating the cell-type specificity of these responses. Interestingly, significant changes were also observed in chemokines related to the migration of monocytes (increased MCP-1, decreased MIP-1α, and MCP-2/4) and neutrophils (higher IP-10 and ENA-78) (Fig. 1b). To examine the cellular impact of these cytokine changes, we mapped known vs. novel pathways associated with spaceflight7, as well as TF accessibility and the cell-type specificity of these responses. Of note, the CD16 monocytes showed the highest number of enriched, known pathways (Supplementary Fig. 9c), and CD14 monocytes showed the longest persistence of these changes, indicating a slower recovery after spaceflight. We then used the DARs’ chromatin accessibility data to compare over-represented TF motifs at R + 1 (Supplementary Data 3), and intersected these TFs with the literature. For the top 12 motifs from T cells, a novel set of spaceflight-responsive TFs was identified (KFL16, ETV1, ZNF148, RREB1, GABPA, KLF9), as well as some known, including MAZ29, Wt130,31, KLF413, and KLF532. For B cells, novel TFs included SPIB, ZKSCAN5, IKZF1, and EBF3, while previously identified TFs included STAT33, IRF134, EHF13, and Arid3a18. Interestingly, these TFs are all key to B cell function: STATs mediate cytokine responses (IL735, B cell differentiation, and control of the germinal center reaction36,37); SPIB regulates the expression of the B cell receptor, CD40L, BAFF, and TLR ligands38, and IKZF1 is a transcription factor essential for B cell activation, maturation, and differentiation39. For monocytes and DCs, novel TFs included SPIB, SPIC, HLF, IKZF1, ELF3, CTCFL, and ZKSCAN5, and known TFs included CEBPD40, STAT140, CTCF41, EHF13, Arid3a18, and IRF134. Finally, we observed that the motif activity scores of CD14 monocytes and DCs recovered more slowly than CD16 monocytes, taking until the last time point to recover (Supplementary Fig. 9d), further evidence that the CD14 population was the slowest to recover from spaceflight. Conserved responses from other missions and possible countermeasures To further validate and contextualize the I4 spaceflight signature, we next compared differential genes and pathways to several other data sets, including gene expression data in NASA’s GeneLab database, the NASA Twins Study7, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomomes42, I4 plasma cfRNA, I4 EVP and plasma proteomics43, the JAXA cfRNA study, and microgravity-simulated PBMCs44. First, we analyzed 27 murine datasets from GeneLab (n = 817 samples) for spaceflight-specific DEGs, and found 2184 total DEGs (1288 upregulated and 896 downregulated) (Fig. 2a) common across the 27 datasets (Supplementary Data 5). When comparing orthologous genes to the human I4 data, we found overlapping DEGs for both upregulated (5–12%) and downregulated (16–30%) genes (Fig. 2b). Moreover, compared to the human data, the “murine spaceflight signature” was directionally consistent in all comparisons (20/20, 100%) and statistically significant (18/20 pathways, 90%) by GSEA for both up and down-regulated genes (padj < 0.05) (Fig. 2c) and Fisher’s exact test (padj < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 10a), indicating a core set of human and murine responses to spaceflight. We next expanded the human and mouse comparisons at the pathway level. Over-representation analysis of the murine spaceflight signature showed enrichment of ribosomal translation and metabolism in down-regulated DEGs and signaling, response to stimulus, and metabolism in upregulated DEGs, overlapping with the I4 pathways (Supplementary Data 1 and 6). The GSEA result of the I4 data and the murine spaceflight signature showed statistically significant overlap (Fisher’s exact test. padj; Hallmark: 3.845e-02, C2: 3.317e-47, C5: 2.341e-83) (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Down-regulated pathways consistent across both cohorts included OXPHOS, Myc targets, ribosome, infectious disease, viral gene expression, influenza infection, and translation pathways (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Also, mitotic spindle, UV response DN pathway, and TCF21 targets pathway were also consistently, significantly up-regulated (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Of note, the pathway scores (−log10(padj)*sign(NES)) were positively correlated in the I4 murine signatures (Pearson correlation, R = 0.82, slope: 0.69) (Fig. 2d). Next, we compared the I4 data to the NASA Twins study immune cell RNA-seq7–9, and found that the immune cell DEGs were statistically significantly for up- and down-regulated DEGs when compared to the I4 data (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Additionally, the Twins’ GSEA profiles overlapped with the I4 GSEA profiles, showing enrichment in OXPHOS, Myc targets v1, and UV response, consistent with the I4 signature (Fig. 2e). These results were confirmed in the I4 skin spatial transcriptome data, where the skin and subregion down-regulated DEGs were statistically significantly (padj < 0.05) down-regulated in I4 data (Fig. 2f) and the pathway scores were positively correlated in the I4 (Fig. 2g), including ribosomal translation, OXPHOS, UV response pathways (padj < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 10d) in response to spaceflight. However, EVP and plasma proteomics data45 (Supplementary Fig 10e, padj < 0.05, GSEA) were distinct from the OXPHOS pathways, but did overlap with NPM1, immunoglobulin complex, and blood microparticle pathways. Changes in gravity and radiation both occur in spaceflight, but are confounded in most studies, making it difficult to delineate which factor leads to the cellular changes observed in astronauts. To better distinguish between the contributions of radiation and microgravity, we compared the I4 data to a set of 375 DEGs observed in single-cell RNA-seq data from in vitro PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity (μG) for 25 h. Monocytes (e.g., CD14) and dendritic cells, which are myeloid-derived cells, showed higher DEG overlap (16–43%) vs. the lymphoid-derived cells (2–5% for T cells, B cells, and NK cells), giving further evidence that lymphoid-derived cells are less sensitive to microgravity (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 10f). GSEA analysis of μG-simulated DEGs showed no significant enrichment in OXPHOS, ribosomal translation, and UV response (Supplementary Fig. 10g), indicating that most of the responses in PBMCs are likely from radiation and other spaceflight stressors, rather than changes in gravity. Since the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) and Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) markers is known to change after spaceflight46, we further analyzed the expression of CDs and HLAs in our immune cells. We found the long-term suppression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, B2M) in the I4 immune cells (Fig. 2h). This long-term suppression was cross-validated in the NASA Twins Study data, the JAXA cfRNA profiles, and the I4 plasma cfRNA, which showed sometimes a spike in activity in flight, but a consistent and significant (q value < 0.05, FDR-corrected) decrease of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, B2M) genes post-flight across all missions and most cell types (Supplementary Fig. 11). Finally, to identify potential drugs or supplements that can reverse these effects on the immune system, we used a novel compound-gene interactome machine learning algorithm to identify drugs and vitamins that significantly map to altered genes44. Using these algorithms, we identified 148 compounds that significantly map to DEGs of PBMCs and subpopulations (Supplementary Data 7). Based on PBMC subpopulation alterations, these potential compounds could identify biological targets for countermeasure development to optimize human performance and could be tested to mitigate potential negative health effects resulting from spaceflight exposure2,47. Spaceflight-induced immune dysregulation mirrors monocyte dysregulation, infection phenotypes, TCF21, and FOXP3 regulation The prolonged dysregulation of CD14 monocytes observed in our data (Supplementary Fig. 9c) led us to next examine immune-associated clinical symptoms reported with spaceflight6,48, especially since monocytes are responsible for cytokine production, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation. First, to validate the CD14 dysregulation, we compared the I4 CD14 monocyte data to previously reported monocyte dysregulation markers linked to clinical symptoms22,23,49, which confirmed the down-regulation of five known markers in the I4 CD14 monocytes (e.g., SELL, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB5, IL6, CD14) and an increase in TLR4 across both gene expression and ATAC-seq data (Fig. 3a). When examining I4 immune cell DEGs (padj < 0.05) (Supplementary Data 8), we also found a decrease in the pathways associated with response to infection, including COVID-19, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, CMV, tuberculosis, graft-versus-host defense, and Salmonella infection (KEGG pathways, p-adj < 0.05, Supplementary Data 8), and validated with a GSEA analysis (Fig. 3b). Finally, to examine the capacity for B-cell function, we examined the increased BCR mutation rate (Supplementary Fig. 7g), which is caused by somatic hypermutation secondary to antigen exposure or inflammatory stimuli. Indeed, single-cell expression data suggested possible up-regulation of BCR signaling pathway genes in B cells immediately post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Fig. 3.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Given the TCF21 and FOXP3 pathway changes (Fig. 1c, Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 12b, c), we next examined the activity of target genes in cellular subtypes. For all immune cells, the TCF21 target gene enrichment score was increased at R + 1 (Fig. 3c). And it is confirmed by the motif activity score of ATAC data in T and B cells (Supplementary Fig. 9d). In T cells, FOXP3 target gene enrichment score was increased (Fig. 3d), and again confirmed by the motif activity score of ATAC data (Supplementary Fig. 9d). Changes in FOXP3 suggested changes in T cell regulation during spaceflight50–52, and potentially altered immune function post-flight, which is in line with the GSEA results and KEGG pathways (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 8). We further validated FOXP3 upregulation in T cells and Treg cell activation after spaceflight by analyzing Treg activation markers53 and FOXP3 target genes across T cells (Fig. 3e, f, Supplementary Fig. 12d). Our data indeed showed an increase in Treg activation markers at R + 1, which recovered over time in both gene expression and ATAC data in both T cells and Treg cells (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 12d). Finally, we orthogonally validated the FOXP3 expression and Treg activation markers53 in FACS-isolated T cells by qPCR, which showed a post-flight increase in expression at R + 1 in all targets (Fig. 3g), and a statistically significant increase (Student’s t test, padj < 0.1) for FOXP3, IL1R1, IL1R2, IL2RA, VPS53, and VPS54. Sex-dependent differences in response to spaceflight and recovery Since little is known about sex-dependent differences in response to spaceflight54,55, we next examined differential effects on the immune systems of the I4 crew by sex. First, we compared the ratio of up- and down-regulated DEGs (Fig. 4a) between males and females, which showed a higher number of DEGs in males for almost all cell types. Second, the overlap of up-/down-regulated DEGs between females and males showed a partial overlap (Fig. 4b), with down-regulated DEGs showing a higher overlap percentage (average of up-regulated genes: 51.9%, average of down-regulated genes: 84.1%). Next, GSEA was performed to gain a pathway-based view of sex-dependent gene expression changes. Down-regulated pathways for OXPHOS and Myc targets and up-regulated pathways for mitotic spindle and UV response were conserved between the sexes (Supplementary Fig. 13a). To expand upon these results, we used Ingenuity IPA for the sex-specific DEGs (padj < 0.05). More pathways were altered in males at R + 1 across almost all cell types (Supplementary Data 9). Notably, gene expression differences in estrogen signaling have also been observed in female vs. male B cells56. Fig. 4. Sex-dependent differences in response to spaceflight and recovery. Open in a new tab a Log2 Female to male DEGs ratio immediately post-flight (Top) and long-term post-flight (Bottom). The dotted line represents a Log2 ratio of 0. b Heatmap plot represents the overlap of up-regulated DEGs (Orange) and down-regulated DEGs (Purple) from females and males of PBMC and subpopulations. F Females, M Males. c Common and sex-specific HLA and CD expressions in immune cells, created with BioRender.com. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.We further analyzed the CD and HLA genes with sex-specific or common, DEGs in the immune cells (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Data 10). Both CD79A and CD79B were down-regulated (adj-p value < 0.01) in females (R + 1), and other CDs also showed negative or positive female-to-male (F/M) log2FC ratios (Fig. 4c). In B cells, CD69 and CD83 showed down-regulation at landing for both sexes, yet CD55 was upregulated only in females. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C were all down-regulated in all immune cells in both sexes, immediately post-flight (Fig. 4c), but only males showed persistent HLA-A downregulation post-flight. In DCs, NK cells, and CD4 T cells, males showed down-regulation of ribosomal protein-encoding genes and OXPHOS (Supplementary Data 9). OXPHOS was inhibited in female B cells, and mitochondrial genes were also downregulated only in females. The CD4 and CD8 DEGs showed activation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling (z-scores: 2 and 2.449, respectively) at R + 1 in females (Supplementary Data 9). In contrast, TCR signaling was inhibited, with unique DEGs in male DCs. There was also a significant up-regulation (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p value < 0.01) of HLA-DQB1 F/M ratio in DCs (Supplementary Data 10). Leveraging the ATAC-seq data, we compared the male/female activity scores of enriched DNA motifs at R + 1 for all cell types. In CD4 and CD8 T cells, the motif activity scores at R + 1 were higher in females, but the recovery pattern was similar (Supplementary Fig. 13b, Supplementary Data 11). In B cells and CD16 monocytes, the motif activity scores were higher in females at R + 1 but higher in males at R + 45, indicating these chromatin changes persisted longer in males. In NK cells and other cell types, the motif activity scores were higher in males at R + 1. Additionally, the activity scores of CEBPB, CEBPD, and CEBPE were higher in males at R + 45 in CD14 monocytes, further pointing to CD14’s significance and long-term chromatin disruption. Finally, to discern the generalizability of sex-specific changes, we used a replication cohort of 64 NASA astronauts and compared it to the I4 mission, and we also examined sex-dependent changes in serum BCPs from a study with 27 other targets57 (Supplementary Data 12). These additional data showed that cytokine and acute phase reactant proteins (i.e., IL-8, CRP, and fibrinogen) confirmed differences across sex and mission length. In both males and females, mean serum CRP levels were higher on R + 0 compared to L-180 (2.1 ± 2.4 vs 1.3 ± 1.9 mg/L and 3.7 ± 5.7 vs 1.7 ± 2.2 mg/L, respectively), and mean CRP values were higher in females than males (Supplementary Data 12). Sex and time interaction was observed in IL-6, IL-8, and fibrinogen, and there was a significant difference between males and females for IL-8 and fibrinogen (Post hoc Bonferroni t-test, q value < 0.05). Spaceflight-associated immune cell gene expression changes potentially associated with microbiome abundance Given our observation that spaceflight-associated immune change bears a resemblance to infection, we next aimed to identify if there were observable correlations between DEGs and specific bacterial and viral microbiome features as a function of flight. Specifically, the abundance of bacterial and viral taxonomies correlated with DEGs was examined across all cell types. We used a regression-based approach (See Methods) to illuminate relationships between DEGs and bacterial/viral taxonomic abundances across 10 body sites derived from shotgun metatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequencing (Supplementary Data 13)58. We compared the results of our associations across regularized (LASSO) regression and linear mixed models across different normalization methods and different taxonomic classifiers and ranks, finding overall concordant results (Supplementary Figs. 14, 15). We note that this effort is meant to be exploratory; the overall low sample size and number of statistical tests being executed could inflate false positives. It is for this reason we emphasize (Fig. 5) total magnitude of FDR/nominally significant associations per cell type and opt not to focus heavily on specific host gene/microbiome gene interactions. Fig. 5. The landscape of microbiome-immune associations. Open in a new tab a GSEA of all immune cells with the significantly enriched GO-BP pathways from the microbiome-associated immune cell DEGs related to immune function (padj <0.2). The fgsea analysis employs a one-sided permutation-based test to determine the significance of gene set enrichment, with raw p-values adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR). b We compared the associations reported in the main text to associations run on randomized data, computing the overlap therein at different stringency levels for controlling false positives. The three bars in each sub-panel correspond to the number of associations in the “real” (log-transformed) data versus randomized data and the overlap therein at different stringency levels in controlling for false positives. c The number of Bonferroni <0.05, positive significant microbiome associations by cell type. d The human genes, per cell type, with the greatest number of microbial associations that themselves had low or Bonferroni-significant p values (Two-sided). Each point in the plot bodies represent a different bacterial species (top) or viral genus (bottom). For each cell type, we ranked genes with non-zero LASSO coefficients first by the number of Bonferroni < 0.2 findings then by the total number of nominally associated (p value < 0.05) microbial features (bacteria or viruses). We report up to ten human genes per sub-panel. Source data are provided through the github link.Numerous genes known for involvement in immune response to bacterial and viral invasion were highly correlated to microbiome abundance changes before and after flight. GO term overrepresentation analysis indicated enrichment (padj < 0.05) for diverse pathways related to bacterial and viral response and immune cell change (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Data 14). Null hypothesis testing on randomized data had limited overlap with the results from the real analysis, both in terms of LASSO coefficients as well as nominal and Bonferroni-adjusted p-values (Fig. 5b). When considering only genes that were Bonferroni significant and had non-zero lasso coefficients, CD14 monocytes had the most bacterial associations (Fig. 5c). Viral associations were, by comparison, predominantly in NK cells and T cells. As such, the enrichment of pathogen-response pathways linked to microbial features indicates that microbiome shifts may drive a portion of immune response to spaceflight. Various genes for cell proliferation (i.e., STAT1), ribosomal genes, and various pathways of pathogen infection (RPL28, RPS27A, RPL10, RPL13, RPL11, RPSA, UBA52) were associated with bacteria (Fig. 5d, top panel), notably in CD14 monocytes. Viruses (Fig. 5d, bottom panel) were also associated with genes involved in inflammatory response but with some distinct associations. These included inflammatory cytokine signaling (JAK2, STAT3, STAT1), immune cell differentiation (HLA-DQA2, HLA-DPA1), and immune cell adhesion (ITGA4). Viruses were notably associated with HLA gene expression across CD16 monocytes, NK cells, and DCs.",
    "discussion": "Discussion This study provides the most comprehensive immune profiling of astronauts to date, including single-cell multi-omics data, antibody isotypes, cfRNA abundance, BCR/TCR diversity, TFBS enrichments, sex-dependent changes, microbiome interactions, integration of other astronaut and mouse missions, and potential countermeasures. The I4 crew showed several cytokine and gene regulatory changes that mirrored longer-duration missions, including increased IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 and post-flight decreases in MHC class I genes. The post-flight decrease in MHC class I genes was conserved in the I4 immune cells, I4 plasma cfRNA, JAXA plasma cfRNA, and NASA Twins Study immune cells. Of note, the ‘spaceflight signatures of I4 astronauts’ were also conserved in the I4 immune cells, the NASA Twins Study, and the meta-analysis of 27 GeneLab mouse spaceflight studies, which consistently showed dysregulated OXPHOS, translation, UV response, and TCF21 pathways (Supplementary Data 15). Moreover, these data showed a pronounced sex- and cell-type specificity regarding responsiveness and recovery from spaceflight, with the most and least sensitive cells being CD14 monocytes and CD16 monocytes and T cells, respectively. With these results, the I4 data enabled a unique molecular portrait of a civilian crew with a more diverse genetic and biomedical background than most NASA crews, which are generally restrictive cohorts. While promising in terms of cellular recovery profiles, the I4 mission was not designed to determine the safety of spaceflight for all civilians, nor should these data alone be used to make judgments for future crew selection, number, age, sex, or fitness for spaceflight. Moreover, some functions of chromatin accessibility or gene regulation differences are inferred (e.g., chromVAR), and will need additional characterization in future studies. Nonetheless, the molecular measures from the I4 crew enabled new comparisons to prior missions (e.g., the NASA Twins Study, NASA JSC data, JAXA cfRNA) and meta-analysis of the space-flown mouse studies (817 samples across 27 datasets encompassing 10 different mouse tissues), which mostly confirmed our observations for the significantly altered pathways. Overall, a rapid gene and chromatin recovery was seen for the crew across most cell types, save for the CD14 monocytes and 16 monocytes, and these data can serve as additional baseline biomedical data and context for future missions. Repeated measures of pre- and post-flight metrics of crews will enable better contextualization and statistical rigor by researchers and clinicians and enable guidance for how astronauts can serve as their own controls (within-subjects design) by using their pre-flight immune marker levels as a reference. A limitation of this study was the relatively low number of participants, which is a common challenge in spaceflight studies. While the collection workflows and timing were standardized to minimize variation (e.g., morning blood draws, crew training, and oversight during collection), some cell and sample variations can still occur. As such, our results focused on significantly shifted genes and pathways consistently observed across all crew members. In addition, we utilized a battery of other studies to validate our observations, including other astronaut data, NASA Twins Study data, JAXA CFE data, in vitro microgravity-simulated PBMCs, I4 cfRNA data, meta-analysis of the GeneLab mouse studies, as well as other omics data from the I4 mission. Of particular interest are the differential changes between I4 PBMCs and the in vitro-simulated microgravity PBMCs, which enabled a novel way to differentiate the likely impact of radiation vs. microgravity on human PBMCs, which indicates that radiation is a likely larger driver of the cellular responses. Of course, simulated cells can still be influenced by other experimental factors (e.g., space radiation, fluid shifts, environment, temperature), and future studies should seek to confirm and expand these DEGs related to radiation vs. microgravity. Sex-specific variation in immune response is frequently observed in clinical settings, but poorly understood, and this phenomenon has yet to be investigated in-depth at the single-cell level during spaceflight. Here, we observed that males appear to be more affected by spaceflight, for almost all cell types and metrics, experiencing more DEGs, slower recovery to the baseline of DEGs, and a slower recovery of the chromatin accessibility. In addition, IL-6, IL-8, and fibrinogen differences by sex were confirmed in the replication cohort of NASA astronauts (n = 64). Sex differences also were observed in certain CD and HLA genes (Supplementary Data 9, 10), including a greater number of downregulated HLA genes in male DCs (Supplementary Data 10). For example, CD83 is expressed on mature dendritic cells, and it was downregulated in male DCs at R + 1 (Supplementary Data 10). Under simulated microgravity, DCs had decreased expressions of HLA-DR and impaired phagocytosis59, which aligns with our results. While dysregulation of immune function, oxidative phosphorylation, and Myc target pathways were conserved in both males and females, the aggregate data thus far indicates that the gene regulatory and immune response to spaceflight is more sensitive in males. More studies will be needed to confirm these trends, but such results can have implications for recovery times and possibly crew selection (e.g., more females) for high-altitude, lunar, and deep space missions. We additionally observed increased expression in many immune cell pathways associated with pathogens. Immune cell activity is known to be specifically associated with shifts in host bacterial and viral content60–63. Microgravity has the potential to affect gene regulations in various tissues, including interactions between the host immune system and microbiome64. Bacteria can directly regulate immune cell activity and viral activation65–68, and herpes virus reactivation is associated with spaceflight69. When associating microbiome features with DEGs, we identified that many of the pathways most associated with bacterial and viral shifts before and after flight were additionally related to pathogen colonization. As a result, we hypothesize that a portion of the immune activation in flight could be arising from microbiome shifts. However, our microbiome integration results are descriptive and, in future studies, could be further strengthened by mechanistic experiments, targeted microbiome interventions, and larger sample sizes. Further, although we used techniques standard for the field, other microbiome analytic methods (i.e., gene-level analysis and other machine-learning approaches) could tease further signals from the data. Indeed, the substantial differences between bacterial and viral responses indicate discrete mechanisms of immune response and provide targets for future studies. In conclusion, these convergent signatures of spaceflight begin to detail the core, consistent set of human cellular and molecular responses to spaceflight and can help narrow the targets for countermeasures and monitoring in future studies. Moreover, any potential long-term changes need to be monitored longitudinally to scan for any reversion or exacerbation of the phenotypes before pharmacological or biomedical interventions can be considered. Exploring the data introduced here is enabled through our interactive data portal (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu) and downloadable through public and controlled-access repositories (NASA Open Science Data Repositories and GeneLab/ALSDA). In the coming years, NASA plans to put the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, and such ambitious missions can leverage the data shown here, which details cell-, person-, and sex-specific molecular data, thus guiding more precise risk mitigation, crew health monitoring, and long-term countermeasure development.",

To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a “spaceflight signature” of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health. Subject terms: Epigenomics, Immunogenetics Multiple omics platforms and deep single-cell profiling in the I4 astronauts reveal both conserved and distinct immune system disruptions across missions, provide a single-cell immune reference for future missions.Introduction Human spaceflight exposes individuals and their immune systems to unique environmental factors, including microgravity, fluid shifts, and radiation1,2. Since 1961, over 675 astronauts have traveled to space; studies on some crew members have shown significant immune stress related to spaceflight3. Given that more individuals with diverse physical and biomedical backgrounds are traveling into space—and that many more commercial missions are planned (e.g., Polaris Dawn, Axiom)—an urgent goal of aerospace medicine is to understand better how the immune system responds to and recovers from spaceflight for the broader civilian population. Moreover, such profiles of cellular and molecular changes in commercial crews can guide personalized countermeasures for the missions and eventually lead to better crew performance and safety4. Immune-related clinical symptoms from spaceflight are prevalent among astronauts and span many phenotypes, including inflammation, infection, and viral reactivation5,6. Indeed, clinical symptoms associated with immune dysregulation were reported with 3.4 events per flight year, representing 46% of crew members6. While these findings show that the spaceflight environment affects the human immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies. Also, since spaceflight phenocopies many of the effects of aging and aging-related disease (e.g., bone density and muscle loss)7, a better characterization of immune system changes during the extreme physiological stressor of spaceflight can offer insights into immune dysregulation and functional deterioration on Earth. Multi-omic studies provide unique advantages for understanding biological changes, including spaceflight-associated immune system alterations. For example, the NASA Twins Study used gene expression to investigate immune changes stemming from a year-long mission, and found unprecedented levels of cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10, and gene expression changes in both B-cells and T-cells7–9. However, a major limitation of that study was the sample size, as it involved only one flight subject. It additionally used a bulk-cell analysis for most of the transcriptome (preventing observations at a single-cell resolution) and lacked a chromatin analysis using assays for transposase-accessible chromatin accessibility (ATAC) data8,9, which is critical for understanding changes in genome regulation and long-term stress response. Thus, a high-resolution map of the immune system’s response to spaceflight is still needed. With these needs in mind, we report here findings on the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, an all civilian-crewed commercial orbital spaceflight, including multi-omic, in-depth immune system profiling at the single-cell level for the four-member crew with a broad age range (29-50 years old at launch) and biomedical backgrounds. We longitudinally analyzed single-nucleus gene expression (snRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq), and single-cell T/B cell antigen receptor sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, we integrated this multi-omics data with a clinical profile of a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and cytokine/chemokine/growth factor/metabolite measures. We also profiled cell frequencies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), biochemical profiling, differential gene/peak expression, enriched biological pathways, over-represented transcription factor binding site (TFBS), antibody isotype, mutation profiles of BCR/TCR, cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma, and association with skin, oral, and nasal microbiome changes. Here, we provide a detailed report of these findings, illustrating a unique set of immune system changes induced by high-elevation spaceflight, and conclude with potential countermeasures derived from these data, all of which can guide and inform future studies and missions.Results Immune-metabolic changes after spaceflight and recovery To characterize the immune and metabolic changes induced by spaceflight, we collected serum and whole blood from the crew before and after the spaceflight (Fig. 1a) and first performed CBC and CMP assays to measure cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and metabolites. The crew’s baseline values (pre-flight) were compared to those obtained 24 h after returning to Earth (R + 1) and post-flight (R + 45, 82, 194), which revealed a set of cytokines with significant increase (n = 13) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b, Wilcoxon-rank sum test, adjusted p value < 0.05) and a smaller set (n = 5) of molecules with a significant decrease (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b, Wilcoxon-rank sum test, adjusted p value < 0.05). The IL-6, IL-10, CRP, and MCP-1 increases were consistent with changes observed in other astronauts following long duration (3–6-month or 12-month duration) missions (Supplementary Fig. 1c)7–10. Moreover, several other pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-27, CRP) and chemokines (IP-10, ENA-78, Fractalkine) were also significantly up-regulated at R + 1 (Fig. 1b). Although IL-6 and TNFα are well-known pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase reactants like fibrinogen, hemoglobin, and SAP levels did not significantly change (Supplementary Fig. 1b), indicating that the immune reaction was not pervasive, and no other significant changes were observed in the basic metabolic blood panel (Supplementary Fig. 1d).

A significant increase in concentration is observed immediately after spaceflight (R + 1) in IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-27, MCP-1, TNFα, IP-10, ENA-78, CRP and Fractalkine. On the other hand, IL-9, IL-17E/IL-25, MIP-1α, MCP-2 and MCP-4 showed a significant decrease in their serum levels after spaceflight (R + 1).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.These data suggest that a high elevation, 3-day spaceflight is sufficient to induce the production of some established spaceflight cytokine signatures (e.g., IL-6, IL-10) as well as previously undocumented, responsive cytokines (e.g., ENA-78). These proteins have critical roles in immune response, muscle homeostasis, and hematopoiesis8, but are not normally associated with systemic inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Moreover, some cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-1RA, and Fractalkine) are considered exerkines, cytokines produced by the muscle and other tissues during exercise. As such, we then examined if muscle tissues could be the source of these immune markers. Significant increases in some myokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-7) were indeed observed, further supporting muscles as a possible source (Fig. 1b) of these molecules, and indicating a physiological response to microgravity rather than a purely inflammatory response8. We next mined RNA-sequencing data from dissected, space-flown mouse tissues to assess a possible tissue-of-origin for the circulating cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 2a). While non-muscle tissues (e.g., mandibular bone, brown and white adipose tissues) did not show changes in IL-6 or IL-10, (Supplementary Fig. 2b, d), the soleus showed a significant increase in the chemokine Ccl2/Mcp-1 (padj < 0.05, logFC > 1), which is a chemokine associated with muscle exertion. These samples also showed high CD68 expression, a surface marker highly expressed in differentiating (M0) macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 2e–h). Also, the tibialis anterior muscle showed an increase in interleukins, with the largest increase upon landing for the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-5 (log2FC = 2.3, p value < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 2i), further suggesting muscles as a potential source for the cytokines found in the I4 crew.A spaceflight gene expression signature in Inspiration4 astronauts PBMCs were used to generate single-nuclei gene expression (GEX) and ATAC data (Fig. 1a, b, Fig. 2). We combined GEX and ATAC analysis of PBMCs across 151,411 nuclei (filtered with minimum of 200 genes, maximum of 4500 gene counts, maximum of 20% mitochondrial reads, maximum of 100,000 peak counts, maximum of 2 nucleosome signal, and minimum of TSS enrichment per cell) by adapting the multi-omic pipeline reported11, spanning 9 immune cell types: CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, other T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, CD14 monocytes, CD16 monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and all remaining cells (“other”) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). We validated the expression of markers specific for each subpopulation in annotated PBMC subpopulations based on reference expression for each cell type (Supplementary Fig. 3a), quantified the distribution of cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and confirmed that overall cell proportions were stable across spaceflight in the combined single-nuclei multi-ome and FACS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3c–e) and CBC data (Supplementary Fig. 3f), and mapped principal component analysis (PCA) clustering of GEX and ATAC data across the timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 4, 5).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accessible regions (DARs) (padj <0.05, |log2FC | > 0.25) were calculated from the snRNA-seq snATAC-seq data, respectively, comparing immediate (R + 1) and post-flight differences (R + 45, R + 82) relative to pre-flight levels (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The number of DEGs and DARs were highest at R + 1, but decreased for subsequent timepoints among PBMCs, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 6b). However, a wide range of responses to spaceflight was observed, with some cell types more affected than others. For example, CD14 monocytes showed the highest number of DARs and DEGs at R + 1, yet CD4 T and CD8 T cells were the least perturbed (Supplementary Fig. 6b–c). Notably, chromatin accessibility responses to spaceflight exhibited even greater cell type-specificity (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c) than DEGs, with the most changes still appearing at R + 1. In addition to the cell-specific responses to spaceflight, a core set of pan-cellular gene expression changes was observed at R + 1. Specifically, a set of 144 consistent DEGs was observed across all nine cell types (Supplementary Fig. 6c). PBMCs DEGs were significantly conserved in I4 immune cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d), thus, we used the PBMCs DEGs as the “spaceflight signatures of the I4 astronauts” for further analysis. Given this spaceflight signature set of genes, we then examined the enriched pathways using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which showed enrichment of ribosomal translation, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondrial metabolism, UV response, TCF21 targets, mitotic spindle, and immune pathways (padj < 0.05) (Fig. 1c). Additionally, we confirmed that the GSEA result was conserved across all I4 immune cell sub-types (Fig. 1d). We cross-validated the GSEA findings with over-representation analysis through Gene Ontology pathways of these DEGs, which also showed down-regulated DEGs were enriched (padj < 0.05) in ribosomal translation, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial metabolism (Supplementary Data. 1). Up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in response to stimulus, signaling, and metabolism (Supplementary Data. 1). Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) also showed inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and translation (EIF2 signaling) pathways and activation of mitochondrial dysfunction across cell types (Supplementary Data 2). Also, the core set of altered regions of chromatin (DARs) on R + 1 included over-represented motifs for SPIB, SPI1, CEBPD, SPIC, EHF, CEBPA, ELF3, IKZF1, EWSR1-FLI1, FOSL2, and KLF4 (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 6e, Supplementary Data 3). Their normalized motif activity score (chromVAR deviation z-scores of TF motifs) were increased at R + 1 and recovered over time (Fig. 1e). Of note, while CEBPA12, EHF13, SMAD14, EWSR1-FLI115, c-Fos16, and TCF2117,18 have been implicated in spaceflight before, the others have not been previously described in astronauts.Cell subpopulation changes after 3-day spaceflight and recovery To better understand spaceflight’s impact on each cell type, we examined the cell profiles with more granular sub-typing (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d), mutation rates in B cells and T cells (Supplementary Fig. 7e–h) and used single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) on the DEGs for each immune cell population (Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Data 4). First, overall cell proportions of granular annotation were stable across spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). Second, we found that the TCR V(D)J repertoire from L-3 to R + 82 was stable in terms of mutations (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f). Conversely, the total number of BCR mutations increases relative to pre-flight at R + 1 (64.6 vs 61.6) and R + 45 (65.5 vs 61.6) (Supplementary Fig. 7g, h). Moreover, we found that cell differentiation and cell proliferation pathway scores were decreased (around 5–10%) at R + 1 for both CD4 T and CD8 T cells, which mirrors the T cell suppression previously observed in simulated GCR irradiation19, simulated microgravity20, and Space Shuttle missions21 (Supplementary Data 4). Similarly, the CD4 central memory T cell (CD4 TCM) differentiation pathway and memory T cell activation scores were decreased in CD4 effector memory T cells (CD4 TEM) and CD8 central memory T cells (CD8 TCM) at R + 1. However, monocytes and DCs showed more mixed phenotypes, with activation, differentiation, aggregation, and extravasation scores all dysregulated at R + 1. These findings are consistent with previous reports of changes in phagocytic capacity, degranulation, and cytokine production for DC22,23 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Upon return to Earth, the astronauts’ serum showed higher concentrations of cytokines associated with inflammation, such as IL-6, TNF-α, APR (acute phase reactants), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (Fig. 1b). These changes were concomitant with an increase in cytokines with anti-inflammatory activity, such as IL-1ra, IL-10, and cytokines linked to a Th2 profile (IL-4 and IL-5) (Fig. 1b), which likely balances the inflammation from returning to Earth. However, the Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-secreted cytokines in CD4 TCM subset24–28 showed no significant changes (Supplementary Fig. 9a); GSEA analysis of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell pathways confirmed no significant changes (Supplementary Fig. 9b, padj > 0.05), further indicating the cell-type specificity of these responses. Interestingly, significant changes were also observed in chemokines related to the migration of monocytes (increased MCP-1, decreased MIP-1α, and MCP-2/4) and neutrophils (higher IP-10 and ENA-78) (Fig. 1b). To examine the cellular impact of these cytokine changes, we mapped known vs. novel pathways associated with spaceflight7, as well as TF accessibility and the cell-type specificity of these responses. Of note, the CD16 monocytes showed the highest number of enriched, known pathways (Supplementary Fig. 9c), and CD14 monocytes showed the longest persistence of these changes, indicating a slower recovery after spaceflight. We then used the DARs’ chromatin accessibility data to compare over-represented TF motifs at R + 1 (Supplementary Data 3), and intersected these TFs with the literature. For the top 12 motifs from T cells, a novel set of spaceflight-responsive TFs was identified (KFL16, ETV1, ZNF148, RREB1, GABPA, KLF9), as well as some known, including MAZ29, Wt130,31, KLF413, and KLF532. For B cells, novel TFs included SPIB, ZKSCAN5, IKZF1, and EBF3, while previously identified TFs included STAT33, IRF134, EHF13, and Arid3a18. Interestingly, these TFs are all key to B cell function: STATs mediate cytokine responses (IL735, B cell differentiation, and control of the germinal center reaction36,37); SPIB regulates the expression of the B cell receptor, CD40L, BAFF, and TLR ligands38, and IKZF1 is a transcription factor essential for B cell activation, maturation, and differentiation39. For monocytes and DCs, novel TFs included SPIB, SPIC, HLF, IKZF1, ELF3, CTCFL, and ZKSCAN5, and known TFs included CEBPD40, STAT140, CTCF41, EHF13, Arid3a18, and IRF134. Finally, we observed that the motif activity scores of CD14 monocytes and DCs recovered more slowly than CD16 monocytes, taking until the last time point to recover (Supplementary Fig. 9d), further evidence that the CD14 population was the slowest to recover from spaceflight.Conserved responses from other missions and possible countermeasures To further validate and contextualize the I4 spaceflight signature, we next compared differential genes and pathways to several other data sets, including gene expression data in NASA’s GeneLab database, the NASA Twins Study7, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomomes42, I4 plasma cfRNA, I4 EVP and plasma proteomics43, the JAXA cfRNA study, and microgravity-simulated PBMCs44. First, we analyzed 27 murine datasets from GeneLab (n = 817 samples) for spaceflight-specific DEGs, and found 2184 total DEGs (1288 upregulated and 896 downregulated) (Fig. 2a) common across the 27 datasets (Supplementary Data 5). When comparing orthologous genes to the human I4 data, we found overlapping DEGs for both upregulated (5–12%) and downregulated (16–30%) genes (Fig. 2b). Moreover, compared to the human data, the “murine spaceflight signature” was directionally consistent in all comparisons (20/20, 100%) and statistically significant (18/20 pathways, 90%) by GSEA for both up and down-regulated genes (padj < 0.05) (Fig. 2c) and Fisher’s exact test (padj < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 10a), indicating a core set of human and murine responses to spaceflight. We next expanded the human and mouse comparisons at the pathway level. Over-representation analysis of the murine spaceflight signature showed enrichment of ribosomal translation and metabolism in down-regulated DEGs and signaling, response to stimulus, and metabolism in upregulated DEGs, overlapping with the I4 pathways (Supplementary Data 1 and 6). The GSEA result of the I4 data and the murine spaceflight signature showed statistically significant overlap (Fisher’s exact test. padj; Hallmark: 3.845e-02, C2: 3.317e-47, C5: 2.341e-83) (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Down-regulated pathways consistent across both cohorts included OXPHOS, Myc targets, ribosome, infectious disease, viral gene expression, influenza infection, and translation pathways (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Also, mitotic spindle, UV response DN pathway, and TCF21 targets pathway were also consistently, significantly up-regulated (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Of note, the pathway scores (−log10(padj)*sign(NES)) were positively correlated in the I4 murine signatures (Pearson correlation, R = 0.82, slope: 0.69) (Fig. 2d). Next, we compared the I4 data to the NASA Twins study immune cell RNA-seq7–9, and found that the immune cell DEGs were statistically significantly for up- and down-regulated DEGs when compared to the I4 data (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Additionally, the Twins’ GSEA profiles overlapped with the I4 GSEA profiles, showing enrichment in OXPHOS, Myc targets v1, and UV response, consistent with the I4 signature (Fig. 2e). These results were confirmed in the I4 skin spatial transcriptome data, where the skin and subregion down-regulated DEGs were statistically significantly (padj < 0.05) down-regulated in I4 data (Fig. 2f) and the pathway scores were positively correlated in the I4 (Fig. 2g), including ribosomal translation, OXPHOS, UV response pathways (padj < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 10d) in response to spaceflight. However, EVP and plasma proteomics data45 (Supplementary Fig 10e, padj < 0.05, GSEA) were distinct from the OXPHOS pathways, but did overlap with NPM1, immunoglobulin complex, and blood microparticle pathways. Changes in gravity and radiation both occur in spaceflight, but are confounded in most studies, making it difficult to delineate which factor leads to the cellular changes observed in astronauts. To better distinguish between the contributions of radiation and microgravity, we compared the I4 data to a set of 375 DEGs observed in single-cell RNA-seq data from in vitro PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity (μG) for 25 h. Monocytes (e.g., CD14) and dendritic cells, which are myeloid-derived cells, showed higher DEG overlap (16–43%) vs. the lymphoid-derived cells (2–5% for T cells, B cells, and NK cells), giving further evidence that lymphoid-derived cells are less sensitive to microgravity (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 10f). GSEA analysis of μG-simulated DEGs showed no significant enrichment in OXPHOS, ribosomal translation, and UV response (Supplementary Fig. 10g), indicating that most of the responses in PBMCs are likely from radiation and other spaceflight stressors, rather than changes in gravity. Since the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) and Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) markers is known to change after spaceflight46, we further analyzed the expression of CDs and HLAs in our immune cells. We found the long-term suppression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, B2M) in the I4 immune cells (Fig. 2h). This long-term suppression was cross-validated in the NASA Twins Study data, the JAXA cfRNA profiles, and the I4 plasma cfRNA, which showed sometimes a spike in activity in flight, but a consistent and significant (q value < 0.05, FDR-corrected) decrease of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, B2M) genes post-flight across all missions and most cell types (Supplementary Fig. 11). Finally, to identify potential drugs or supplements that can reverse these effects on the immune system, we used a novel compound-gene interactome machine learning algorithm to identify drugs and vitamins that significantly map to altered genes44. Using these algorithms, we identified 148 compounds that significantly map to DEGs of PBMCs and subpopulations (Supplementary Data 7). Based on PBMC subpopulation alterations, these potential compounds could identify biological targets for countermeasure development to optimize human performance and could be tested to mitigate potential negative health effects resulting from spaceflight exposure2,47.Spaceflight-induced immune dysregulation mirrors monocyte dysregulation, infection phenotypes, TCF21, and FOXP3 regulation The prolonged dysregulation of CD14 monocytes observed in our data (Supplementary Fig. 9c) led us to next examine immune-associated clinical symptoms reported with spaceflight6,48, especially since monocytes are responsible for cytokine production, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation. First, to validate the CD14 dysregulation, we compared the I4 CD14 monocyte data to previously reported monocyte dysregulation markers linked to clinical symptoms22,23,49, which confirmed the down-regulation of five known markers in the I4 CD14 monocytes (e.g., SELL, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB5, IL6, CD14) and an increase in TLR4 across both gene expression and ATAC-seq data (Fig. 3a). When examining I4 immune cell DEGs (padj < 0.05) (Supplementary Data 8), we also found a decrease in the pathways associated with response to infection, including COVID-19, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, CMV, tuberculosis, graft-versus-host defense, and Salmonella infection (KEGG pathways, p-adj < 0.05, Supplementary Data 8), and validated with a GSEA analysis (Fig. 3b). Finally, to examine the capacity for B-cell function, we examined the increased BCR mutation rate (Supplementary Fig. 7g), which is caused by somatic hypermutation secondary to antigen exposure or inflammatory stimuli. Indeed, single-cell expression data suggested possible up-regulation of BCR signaling pathway genes in B cells immediately post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Fig. 3.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Given the TCF21 and FOXP3 pathway changes (Fig. 1c, Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 12b, c), we next examined the activity of target genes in cellular subtypes. For all immune cells, the TCF21 target gene enrichment score was increased at R + 1 (Fig. 3c). And it is confirmed by the motif activity score of ATAC data in T and B cells (Supplementary Fig. 9d). In T cells, FOXP3 target gene enrichment score was increased (Fig. 3d), and again confirmed by the motif activity score of ATAC data (Supplementary Fig. 9d). Changes in FOXP3 suggested changes in T cell regulation during spaceflight50–52, and potentially altered immune function post-flight, which is in line with the GSEA results and KEGG pathways (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 8). We further validated FOXP3 upregulation in T cells and Treg cell activation after spaceflight by analyzing Treg activation markers53 and FOXP3 target genes across T cells (Fig. 3e, f, Supplementary Fig. 12d). Our data indeed showed an increase in Treg activation markers at R + 1, which recovered over time in both gene expression and ATAC data in both T cells and Treg cells (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 12d). Finally, we orthogonally validated the FOXP3 expression and Treg activation markers53 in FACS-isolated T cells by qPCR, which showed a post-flight increase in expression at R + 1 in all targets (Fig. 3g), and a statistically significant increase (Student’s t test, padj < 0.1) for FOXP3, IL1R1, IL1R2, IL2RA, VPS53, and VPS54.Sex-dependent differences in response to spaceflight and recovery Since little is known about sex-dependent differences in response to spaceflight54,55, we next examined differential effects on the immune systems of the I4 crew by sex. First, we compared the ratio of up- and down-regulated DEGs (Fig. 4a) between males and females, which showed a higher number of DEGs in males for almost all cell types. Second, the overlap of up-/down-regulated DEGs between females and males showed a partial overlap (Fig. 4b), with down-regulated DEGs showing a higher overlap percentage (average of up-regulated genes: 51.9%, average of down-regulated genes: 84.1%). Next, GSEA was performed to gain a pathway-based view of sex-dependent gene expression changes. Down-regulated pathways for OXPHOS and Myc targets and up-regulated pathways for mitotic spindle and UV response were conserved between the sexes (Supplementary Fig. 13a). To expand upon these results, we used Ingenuity IPA for the sex-specific DEGs (padj < 0.05). More pathways were altered in males at R + 1 across almost all cell types (Supplementary Data 9). Notably, gene expression differences in estrogen signaling have also been observed in female vs. male B cells56. Fig. 4. Sex-dependent differences in response to spaceflight and recovery. Open in a new tab a Log2 Female to male DEGs ratio immediately post-flight (Top) and long-term post-flight (Bottom).

F Females, M Males. c Common and sex-specific HLA and CD expressions in immune cells, created with BioRender.com. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.We further analyzed the CD and HLA genes with sex-specific or common, DEGs in the immune cells (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Data 10). Both CD79A and CD79B were down-regulated (adj-p value < 0.01) in females (R + 1), and other CDs also showed negative or positive female-to-male (F/M) log2FC ratios (Fig. 4c). In B cells, CD69 and CD83 showed down-regulation at landing for both sexes, yet CD55 was upregulated only in females. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C were all down-regulated in all immune cells in both sexes, immediately post-flight (Fig. 4c), but only males showed persistent HLA-A downregulation post-flight. In DCs, NK cells, and CD4 T cells, males showed down-regulation of ribosomal protein-encoding genes and OXPHOS (Supplementary Data 9). OXPHOS was inhibited in female B cells, and mitochondrial genes were also downregulated only in females. The CD4 and CD8 DEGs showed activation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling (z-scores: 2 and 2.449, respectively) at R + 1 in females (Supplementary Data 9). In contrast, TCR signaling was inhibited, with unique DEGs in male DCs. There was also a significant up-regulation (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p value < 0.01) of HLA-DQB1 F/M ratio in DCs (Supplementary Data 10). Leveraging the ATAC-seq data, we compared the male/female activity scores of enriched DNA motifs at R + 1 for all cell types. In CD4 and CD8 T cells, the motif activity scores at R + 1 were higher in females, but the recovery pattern was similar (Supplementary Fig. 13b, Supplementary Data 11). In B cells and CD16 monocytes, the motif activity scores were higher in females at R + 1 but higher in males at R + 45, indicating these chromatin changes persisted longer in males. In NK cells and other cell types, the motif activity scores were higher in males at R + 1. Additionally, the activity scores of CEBPB, CEBPD, and CEBPE were higher in males at R + 45 in CD14 monocytes, further pointing to CD14’s significance and long-term chromatin disruption. Finally, to discern the generalizability of sex-specific changes, we used a replication cohort of 64 NASA astronauts and compared it to the I4 mission, and we also examined sex-dependent changes in serum BCPs from a study with 27 other targets57 (Supplementary Data 12). These additional data showed that cytokine and acute phase reactant proteins (i.e., IL-8, CRP, and fibrinogen) confirmed differences across sex and mission length. In both males and females, mean serum CRP levels were higher on R + 0 compared to L-180 (2.1 ± 2.4 vs 1.3 ± 1.9 mg/L and 3.7 ± 5.7 vs 1.7 ± 2.2 mg/L, respectively), and mean CRP values were higher in females than males (Supplementary Data 12). Sex and time interaction was observed in IL-6, IL-8, and fibrinogen, and there was a significant difference between males and females for IL-8 and fibrinogen (Post hoc Bonferroni t-test, q value < 0.05).Spaceflight-associated immune cell gene expression changes potentially associated with microbiome abundance Given our observation that spaceflight-associated immune change bears a resemblance to infection, we next aimed to identify if there were observable correlations between DEGs and specific bacterial and viral microbiome features as a function of flight. Specifically, the abundance of bacterial and viral taxonomies correlated with DEGs was examined across all cell types. We used a regression-based approach (See Methods) to illuminate relationships between DEGs and bacterial/viral taxonomic abundances across 10 body sites derived from shotgun metatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequencing (Supplementary Data 13)58. We compared the results of our associations across regularized (LASSO) regression and linear mixed models across different normalization methods and different taxonomic classifiers and ranks, finding overall concordant results (Supplementary Figs. 14, 15). We note that this effort is meant to be exploratory; the overall low sample size and number of statistical tests being executed could inflate false positives. It is for this reason we emphasize (Fig. 5) total magnitude of FDR/nominally significant associations per cell type and opt not to focus heavily on specific host gene/microbiome gene interactions. Fig. 5. The landscape of microbiome-immune associations. Open in a new tab a GSEA of all immune cells with the significantly enriched GO-BP pathways from the microbiome-associated immune cell DEGs related to immune function (padj <0.2). The fgsea analysis employs a one-sided permutation-based test to determine the significance of gene set enrichment, with raw p-values adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR). b We compared the associations reported in the main text to associations run on randomized data, computing the overlap therein at different stringency levels for controlling false positives. The three bars in each sub-panel correspond to the number of associations in the “real” (log-transformed) data versus randomized data and the overlap therein at different stringency levels in controlling for false positives. c The number of Bonferroni <0.05, positive significant microbiome associations by cell type. d The human genes, per cell type, with the greatest number of microbial associations that themselves had low or Bonferroni-significant p values (Two-sided). Each point in the plot bodies represent a different bacterial species (top) or viral genus (bottom). For each cell type, we ranked genes with non-zero LASSO coefficients first by the number of Bonferroni < 0.2 findings then by the total number of nominally associated (p value < 0.05) microbial features (bacteria or viruses). We report up to ten human genes per sub-panel. Source data are provided through the github link.Numerous genes known for involvement in immune response to bacterial and viral invasion were highly correlated to microbiome abundance changes before and after flight. GO term overrepresentation analysis indicated enrichment (padj < 0.05) for diverse pathways related to bacterial and viral response and immune cell change (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Data 14). Null hypothesis testing on randomized data had limited overlap with the results from the real analysis, both in terms of LASSO coefficients as well as nominal and Bonferroni-adjusted p-values (Fig. 5b). When considering only genes that were Bonferroni significant and had non-zero lasso coefficients, CD14 monocytes had the most bacterial associations (Fig. 5c). Viral associations were, by comparison, predominantly in NK cells and T cells. As such, the enrichment of pathogen-response pathways linked to microbial features indicates that microbiome shifts may drive a portion of immune response to spaceflight. Various genes for cell proliferation (i.e., STAT1), ribosomal genes, and various pathways of pathogen infection (RPL28, RPS27A, RPL10, RPL13, RPL11, RPSA, UBA52) were associated with bacteria (Fig. 5d, top panel), notably in CD14 monocytes. Viruses (Fig. 5d, bottom panel) were also associated with genes involved in inflammatory response but with some distinct associations. These included inflammatory cytokine signaling (JAK2, STAT3, STAT1), immune cell differentiation (HLA-DQA2, HLA-DPA1), and immune cell adhesion (ITGA4). Viruses were notably associated with HLA gene expression across CD16 monocytes, NK cells, and DCs.Discussion This study provides the most comprehensive immune profiling of astronauts to date, including single-cell multi-omics data, antibody isotypes, cfRNA abundance, BCR/TCR diversity, TFBS enrichments, sex-dependent changes, microbiome interactions, integration of other astronaut and mouse missions, and potential countermeasures. The I4 crew showed several cytokine and gene regulatory changes that mirrored longer-duration missions, including increased IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 and post-flight decreases in MHC class I genes. The post-flight decrease in MHC class I genes was conserved in the I4 immune cells, I4 plasma cfRNA, JAXA plasma cfRNA, and NASA Twins Study immune cells. Of note, the ‘spaceflight signatures of I4 astronauts’ were also conserved in the I4 immune cells, the NASA Twins Study, and the meta-analysis of 27 GeneLab mouse spaceflight studies, which consistently showed dysregulated OXPHOS, translation, UV response, and TCF21 pathways (Supplementary Data 15). Moreover, these data showed a pronounced sex- and cell-type specificity regarding responsiveness and recovery from spaceflight, with the most and least sensitive cells being CD14 monocytes and CD16 monocytes and T cells, respectively. With these results, the I4 data enabled a unique molecular portrait of a civilian crew with a more diverse genetic and biomedical background than most NASA crews, which are generally restrictive cohorts. While promising in terms of cellular recovery profiles, the I4 mission was not designed to determine the safety of spaceflight for all civilians, nor should these data alone be used to make judgments for future crew selection, number, age, sex, or fitness for spaceflight. Moreover, some functions of chromatin accessibility or gene regulation differences are inferred (e.g., chromVAR), and will need additional characterization in future studies. Nonetheless, the molecular measures from the I4 crew enabled new comparisons to prior missions (e.g., the NASA Twins Study, NASA JSC data, JAXA cfRNA) and meta-analysis of the space-flown mouse studies (817 samples across 27 datasets encompassing 10 different mouse tissues), which mostly confirmed our observations for the significantly altered pathways. Overall, a rapid gene and chromatin recovery was seen for the crew across most cell types, save for the CD14 monocytes and 16 monocytes, and these data can serve as additional baseline biomedical data and context for future missions. Repeated measures of pre- and post-flight metrics of crews will enable better contextualization and statistical rigor by researchers and clinicians and enable guidance for how astronauts can serve as their own controls (within-subjects design) by using their pre-flight immune marker levels as a reference. A limitation of this study was the relatively low number of participants, which is a common challenge in spaceflight studies. While the collection workflows and timing were standardized to minimize variation (e.g., morning blood draws, crew training, and oversight during collection), some cell and sample variations can still occur. As such, our results focused on significantly shifted genes and pathways consistently observed across all crew members. In addition, we utilized a battery of other studies to validate our observations, including other astronaut data, NASA Twins Study data, JAXA CFE data, in vitro microgravity-simulated PBMCs, I4 cfRNA data, meta-analysis of the GeneLab mouse studies, as well as other omics data from the I4 mission. Of particular interest are the differential changes between I4 PBMCs and the in vitro-simulated microgravity PBMCs, which enabled a novel way to differentiate the likely impact of radiation vs. microgravity on human PBMCs, which indicates that radiation is a likely larger driver of the cellular responses. Of course, simulated cells can still be influenced by other experimental factors (e.g., space radiation, fluid shifts, environment, temperature), and future studies should seek to confirm and expand these DEGs related to radiation vs. microgravity. Sex-specific variation in immune response is frequently observed in clinical settings, but poorly understood, and this phenomenon has yet to be investigated in-depth at the single-cell level during spaceflight. Here, we observed that males appear to be more affected by spaceflight, for almost all cell types and metrics, experiencing more DEGs, slower recovery to the baseline of DEGs, and a slower recovery of the chromatin accessibility. In addition, IL-6, IL-8, and fibrinogen differences by sex were confirmed in the replication cohort of NASA astronauts (n = 64). Sex differences also were observed in certain CD and HLA genes (Supplementary Data 9, 10), including a greater number of downregulated HLA genes in male DCs (Supplementary Data 10). For example, CD83 is expressed on mature dendritic cells, and it was downregulated in male DCs at R + 1 (Supplementary Data 10). Under simulated microgravity, DCs had decreased expressions of HLA-DR and impaired phagocytosis59, which aligns with our results. While dysregulation of immune function, oxidative phosphorylation, and Myc target pathways were conserved in both males and females, the aggregate data thus far indicates that the gene regulatory and immune response to spaceflight is more sensitive in males. More studies will be needed to confirm these trends, but such results can have implications for recovery times and possibly crew selection (e.g., more females) for high-altitude, lunar, and deep space missions. We additionally observed increased expression in many immune cell pathways associated with pathogens. Immune cell activity is known to be specifically associated with shifts in host bacterial and viral content60–63. Microgravity has the potential to affect gene regulations in various tissues, including interactions between the host immune system and microbiome64. Bacteria can directly regulate immune cell activity and viral activation65–68, and herpes virus reactivation is associated with spaceflight69. When associating microbiome features with DEGs, we identified that many of the pathways most associated with bacterial and viral shifts before and after flight were additionally related to pathogen colonization. As a result, we hypothesize that a portion of the immune activation in flight could be arising from microbiome shifts. However, our microbiome integration results are descriptive and, in future studies, could be further strengthened by mechanistic experiments, targeted microbiome interventions, and larger sample sizes. Further, although we used techniques standard for the field, other microbiome analytic methods (i.e., gene-level analysis and other machine-learning approaches) could tease further signals from the data. Indeed, the substantial differences between bacterial and viral responses indicate discrete mechanisms of immune response and provide targets for future studies. In conclusion, these convergent signatures of spaceflight begin to detail the core, consistent set of human cellular and molecular responses to spaceflight and can help narrow the targets for countermeasures and monitoring in future studies. Moreover, any potential long-term changes need to be monitored longitudinally to scan for any reversion or exacerbation of the phenotypes before pharmacological or biomedical interventions can be considered. Exploring the data introduced here is enabled through our interactive data portal (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu) and downloadable through public and controlled-access repositories (NASA Open Science Data Repositories and GeneLab/ALSDA). In the coming years, NASA plans to put the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, and such ambitious missions can leverage the data shown here, which details cell-, person-, and sex-specific molecular data, thus guiding more precise risk mitigation, crew health monitoring, and long-term countermeasure development.Methods IRB statement human subjects research All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented to data and sample sharing. Tissue samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use of the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials. The procedure followed guidelines set by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and operated under IRB-approved protocols. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569).PBMC isolation and single-cell library preparation For each crew member, 8 mL of venous blood was collected in EDTA anticoagulant tubes. Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from whole blood using the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µL/mL of blood) for 20 min at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identified using side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or multiomic (GEX and ATAC) libraries. To capture T-cell and B-cell V(D)J repertoire, single cell gel beads-in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ v2, 10X Genomics). Prior to single cell multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µL of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% digitonin, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 4 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 mL cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), nuclei were resuspended in a diluted nuclei buffer (10X Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6000 nuclei per µL. Single-cell libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Sequencing In total, six timepoints were sequenced, including 92 days pre-flight (June), 44 days pre-flight (August), pre-flight (Pre-September), post-flight (Post-September), 45 days post-flight (November), 82 days post-flight (December). The libraries sequenced for each timepoint included ATAC, GEX, and VDJ (TCR + BCR) libraries. Four libraries corresponding to the four astronauts were prepared for each timepoint and library type, except for the June and August timepoints for which VDJ libraries were not prepared. In total, there were 24 ATAC and GEX libraries and 32 VDJ libraries, which were sequenced in three batches. The concentration of each library was taken using the Invitrogen Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit and run on Agilent Tapestation 2100 using Agilent Technologies D1000 reagents and Screentape for fragment analysis. The nanomolarity of each sample was calculated using the formula ((concentration (ng/µl)/ (660 g/mol)* fragment size (bp))*10^6. After the nanomolarity was obtained for each sample, the target nanomolarity was determined using the lowest nanomolarity of the sample libraries. The desired number of reads per sample was determined based on the following criterion: 35,000 read pairs per cell for ATAC libraries, 25,000 read pairs per cell for GEX libraries, and 5000 read pairs per cell for VDJ libraries. Following this, the total number of reads per pool of samples was determined by adding all the read pairs per sample, and the percentage of total read pairs of each pool that is made up of each sample was determined using this formula (desired read pairs for sample/total read pairs for the pool) × 100. The target volume (µL) for each pool was determined based on requirements for sequencing, final molarity, etc. In this case, 200 µL was used for the ATAC library pool, and 100 µL was used for both the VDJ and GEX library pools. The target volume (µL) for each sample was then calculated based on the percentage of the total pool calculated earlier, using the desired final pool volume. Based on the target nanomolarity, sample nanomolarity, and sample target volume, the input volume (uL) for each sample was calculated using the following formula ((target nanomolarity * sample target volume)/sample nanomolarity). If the volume of each individual sample does not meet the target sample volume the rest of the volume can be made up using nuclease-free water. The total volume of both the samples and nuclease-free water should add up to the target pool volume. Following these pooling protocols, the samples were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system.Alignment GEX and ATAC libraries were processed using Cell Ranger arc v2.0.0. VDJ libraries were processed using Cell Ranger v6.1.1. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome. We generated single-cell combined transcriptome and ATAC data from PBMCs from individuals with Inspiration4 mission crews across three pre-flight (June 2021: L-92, August 2021: L-44, September Pre-launch: L-3) and three postflight (September Post-launch: R + 1, November 2021: R + 45, December 2021: R + 82). We mapped the single-cell multi-ome (GEX + ATAC) data using 10X chromium cellranger-arc (10X Genomics). We followed the 10X single-cell multi-ome analysis pipeline as previously reported and adpated for this data as decribes in this Methods section11. 151,411 cells passed quality control after quality control (minimum of 200 genes, maximum of 4500 gene counts, maximum of 20% mitochondrial reads, maximum of 100,000 peak counts, maximum of two nucleosome signal, and minimum of TSS enrichment per cell). Data were integrated using Harmony70.Processing of single-cell data To identify putative cell types, Azimuth (version 0.3.2) pipeline was used with the reference dataset of Human. We annotated PBMCs subpopulations by supervised analysis guided by the Azimuth PBMC reference generated from single-cell transcriptome and CITE-seq71. For cellular proportion comparison after spaceflight, a p-value less than 0.05 with Wilcoxon rank sum test is considered significant. Differentially expressed genes and differentially accessible regions were identified with the FindMarkers function in Seurat (v4.2.0) packages (|log2FC | > 0.25 and padj < 0.05 with the default setting for other parameters). FindMotifs function in Seurat packages with default settings was used to identify the enriched transcription factor based on DARs. By running chromVAR, we computed a per-cell motif activity score (chromVAR deviation z-score of TF motifs) to visualize motif activities per cell. GeneActivity function in Signac package with default settings was used to quantify gene activity from ATAC, which generate a rough estimate of the transcriptional activity of each gene by quantifying ATAC-seq counts in the 2 kb-upstream region and gene body. AddModuleScore function in Seurat package with default setting was used to calculate the average expression levels of each program (cluster) on single cell level, subtracted by the aggregated expression of control feature sets. TCR and BCR-aligned data were analyzed with the VGenes package (https://github.com/WilsonImmunologyLab/VGenes).Biochemical profiling (BCP) and complete blood count (CBC) Complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panels were completed by Quest Diagnostics. One 4 mL tube of whole blood collected in a K2 EDTA tube was used for the CBC, test code 6399. 500 µL of serum from a serum separator tube (SST) was submitted for the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), test code 10231. Serum samples were submitted to Eve Technologies for the biomarker profiling panels (1) Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HD71) and (2) Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9). Concentration values were extrapolated using a four of five parameter logic standard curve. Samples were normalized by the mean of the preflight value of each crew. For BCP and CBC, a p value less than 0.05 with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test is considered significant. We analyzed the previously reported astronaut BCPs57 by further delineating the effect of sex- and time by Two-way ANOVA with a post hoc Bonferroni t-test.Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of immune cells The granulocyte-depleted peripheral blood samples were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting to sort out different subsets of immune cells. Briefly, the frozen samples were thawed, and washed in cell staining buffer (Biolegend, cat no.420201). The cells were resuspended and incubated with monocyte blocking solution (Biolegend, cat no. 426102) and Fc Receptor Blocking Solution (Biolegend, cat no. 422301) for 20 min, followed by incubation with CD3 (T cells) (BD, cat no. 555342), CD19 (B cells) (Biolegend, cat no.302207), CD14 (Monocyte) (BD, cat no. 563420), and CD56 (for NK cells) (BD, cat no. 564058) for 30 min, washed twice in the cell staining buffer and resuspended in the same buffer. Right before sorting DAPI was added to eliminate dead cells during sorting. The gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3d. The different immune cells were directly sorted into RNAlater for RNA extraction for further validation studies.Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (qPCR) FACS-isolated T cells were used for RNA extraction with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, cat no.74134). cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. 18080051). TaqMan™ Fast Advanced system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. 4444557 used for qPCR quantification. qPCR primers are as follows. • ACTB: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4331182, assay ID: Hs01060665_g1 • FOXP3: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs01085834_m1 • TNFRSF9: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00155512_m1 • IL1R1: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00991010_m1 • IL1R2: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00174759_m1 • ENTPD1: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00969556_m1 • IL2RA: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4453320, assay ID: Hs00907777_m1 • VPS51: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4448892, assay ID: Hs00203146_m1 • VPS52: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4448892, assay ID: Hs00224000_m1 • VPS53: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4448892, assay ID: Hs00217606_m1 • VPS54: Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no.4448892, assay ID: Hs00212957_m1Meta-analysis of GeneLab RNA-seq data from 817 samples across 27 datasets encompassing ten different mouse tissues FASTQ files were programmatically downloaded from GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov/) and processed using the MTD pipeline72. A meta-analysis of the GeneLab data was performed in two steps. Firstly, we performed batch correction using Combat-seq73 to standardize data across different datasets. Subsequently, DESeq274 was used to perform differential expression analysis between the spaceflight and ground control mice while adjusting for age, sex, tissue, sacrifice site, and mission duration. The meta-analysis was done using DeSeq2 (wald test, two-tailed) based on batch(study)-corrected count matrix calculated with combat-seq. Multiple testing adjustment was done using Benjamini-hochberg. This analysis resulted in a ‘spaceflight signature in mice’ consisting of 2184 differentially expressed genes (1288 up-regulated and 896 down-regulated). To visually confirm that the genes in the spaceflight signature were changing in a similar direction across datasets based on differential expression analysis on each dataset separately grouping by tissue, sex, age, and mission duration.Principal component analysis Prcomp function of R was used to calculate principal components from gene expression and peak expression profiles.Enrichment analysis ssGSEA ssGSEA package was used to calculate the normalized enrichment score with MSigDB pathways. For T cell activity score, GO:2000566,GO:0043372,GO:0043378,GO:0043382,GO:0042104,GO:0045585,GO:0045588,GO:2000516,GO:2000568,GO:1903905,GO:2000563,GO:1900281,GO:2001187,GO:2001193,GO:0033091,GO:0045591,GO:2000451,GO:2000454,GO:1905404 were used. For B cells activity score, GO:0050871,GO:2000538,GO:0002663,GO:0002904,GO:0030890,GO:0045579,GO:0050861 were used. For NK cell activity score, GO:2000503,GO:0043323,GO:0032816,GO:0032819,GO:0032825,GO:0045954,GO:0002717,GO:0002729,GO:0002857,GO:0002860 were used. For monocytes activity score, GO:0042117,GO:0045657,GO:2000439,GO:1900625,GO:0090026,GO:0071639,GO:0030887 were used. For dendritic cell scores, GO:0030887,GO:2001200,GO:2000670,GO:2000549,GO:2000529,GO:2000510,GO:0002732,GO:0002735,GO:0002606 were used.fgsea fGSEA package was used to calculate the normalized enrichment score and the adjusted p-value with MSigDB Hallmark, MSigDB C2, MSigDB C5, and custom pathways generated with ranked gene sets from various datasets. Here is an example of the pre-ranked GSEA pipeline we performed. (a). Prepare the pathway collection In our case, we used MSigDB, “spaceflight signature of mice”, or DEGs from the selected study (b). Prepare the ranked list of genes. We ranked the gene sets by the adjusted p value, a combination of log2FC multiplied by −log10 (adjusted p value (or p value)), or stat. There are several ways to rank the gene sets by correlation, p value, adjusted p value, log2FC, stat, or combination of log2FC and adjusted p value (or p value) derived from the differential expression analysis. (c). Run GSEAOver-representation analysis gProfiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/) was used to identify significantly enriched (padj < 0.05) GO or KEGG pathways. All DEGs, up-regulated DEGs, downregulated DEGs, microbiome-associated DEGs were used as input.Canonical pathway analysis Data were analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, version 01-22-01) (QIAGEN Inc.) software with DEGs, FDR < 0.05. Common DEGs between females and males and sex-specific DEGs were used for canonical pathways.Gene and pathway overlap analysis I4 and GeneLab mouse data comparison To compare the spaceflight signature in mice against the gene expression changes in Inspiration 4, we mapped the mouse genes to their human equivalent using Ensembl Biomart75, which resulted in 1942 human orthologues (1147 upregulated and 795 downregulated). These human orthologues were then compared against differentially expressed (padj < 0.05) in I4.Fisher’s exact test To calculate the significance of the overlap we used Fisher’s exact test implemented in the R package GeneOverlap (https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/GeneOverlap). P values for the overlaps were adjusted by multiple tests using Benjamini-Hochberg method76. We found that 80% of the comparisons in level 1 cell annotation were statistically significant, while 56% were significant in level 2 annotation. Notably, all comparisons involving down-regulated genes in the spaceflight signature in mice and I4 showed statistical significance. None of the comparisons between down-regulated gene sets in Inspiration 4 against up-regulated genes in the spaceflight signature in mice (and vice versa) yielded statistical significance in either level 1 or 2 cell annotations.GSEA-based overlap analysis By GSEA, ranking the genes from the GeneLab meta-analysis by the negative logarithm of the p-value multiplied by the sign of the fold change (i.e., 1 if positive, −1 if negative) and evaluating whether genes differentially expressed in each cell type in I4 were enriched in either direction of the ranked ordered list. For this calculation, we used the R package fgsea77.I4 skin spatial transcriptomics Skin biopsy samples from the four crew members were collected and frozen in cryovials pre and post flight. Collected skin was flash embedded in OCT blocks. Four replicate of OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide, per astronaut,including pre and post flight replicates. Tissues were then cryosectioned at 5 µm thickness and attached to glass microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, cat# 22-037-246). Immunofluorescent visualization marker for Pan-Cytokeratin (PanCK, Novus cat# NBP2-33200, Alexa Fluor® 532, clone ID AE1 + AE3), fibroblast activation protein (FAP, Abcam cat# ab222924, Alexa Fluor® 594, clone ID EPR20021) and smooth muscle actin (SMA, R&D Systems cat# IC1420R, Alexa Fluor® 647, clone 1A4) were used for region or interest (ROI) selection. The DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to assess genes collected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides were thawed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) at 4 °C followed by PBS washes for thorough fixation. After washes, slides were prepared following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Preparation Protocol for fixed frozen samples, digesting samples with 1.0 µg/mL proteinase K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at 100 °C (NanoString, no. MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM final concentration were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology markers were prepared for four slides concurrently using Syto13 (DNA), PanCK, FAP and SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per slide. Slides incubated with 225 µl of morphology marker solution at RT for 1 h, then washed in SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP instrument. The 20× scan was used to select freeform ROIs to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. OE ROIs covered spinous and granular layers, while IE ROIs covered the basal layer, identified from the staining of the tissue. To ensure proper selection and to avoid overlaps across different ROI types, small gaps between each ROI type were made. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI. FASTQ files were then converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. Additional methods can be found in ref. 42.Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics DNA/RNA isolation, sequencing, and analysis Briefly, we ran all metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples through standard microbiome quality control pipelines using bbtools78 (deduplication, quality trimming, adapter removal, human read decontamination), and then computed taxonomic abundances with a variety of methods, those relevant to this manuscript being Xtree aligning to the Genome Taxonomy Database r20779, Xtree aligning to the complete set of non-redundant genomes in GenBank, MetaPhlAn480, and Phanta81. We report results from all four of these approaches in the manuscript at the phylum, genus, and species ranks. We used two approaches to identify associations between differentially expressed human genes and bacteria/viruses. First, we used Lasso regression to identify relationships between all DEGs for a given cell type and microbial features, characterizing any non-zero Lasso coefficient as a “potential association.” We use this phrasing because Lasso regression does not implicitly include statistical inference, therefore not controlling for false positive rates. We fit models of the form: humangene~microbe1+...+microben 1 We fit different models for bacteria and viruses (e.g., for one model, microbe1..x would be all bacteria, for another it would be all viruses). Prior to regressing, we centered and scaled the human gene abundances. We computed lasso models with both log transformed microbial abundances as well as Center-Log-Ratio transformed abundances, adding a pseudocount in the form of the smallest abundance value for a given matrix beforehand in both cases. As a second form of association identification with the added benefit of statistical inference to control for false positives, we used a mixed effect linear regression approach for each microbe/DEG pair that had a non-zero coefficient coming out of the Lasso regressions. We transformed the gene/microbe abundances with the same approaches as above and fit models of the form: humangene~microbe+(1∣CrewID) 2 CrewID is a random effect corresponding to the different individuals meant to account for interindividual variation in microbial feature abundance. We used Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing, computing the threshold cutoff per cell type based on as the total number of microbes in a given rank and domain (e.g., all bacterial phyla, all bacterial genera, all bacterial species, all viral phyla, all viral genera) times the number of DEGs for a given cell type. This was meant to minimize the overall Bonferroni threshold. Additional methods for generating the bacterial and viral taxonomic abundance data used in the immune-microbiome associations are described in companion manuscripts58,82.I4 cfRNA processing Plasma was frozen at −80 °C until processed. Before RNA extraction, plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 1300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. cfRNA was isolated from the plasma supernatant (300–800 µL) using the Norgen Plasma/Serum Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purification Mini Kit (Catalog No. 51000, Norgen). Next, 10 mL of DNase Turbo Buffer (Catalog No. AM2238, Invitrogen), 3 mL of DNase Turbo (Catalog No. AM2238, Invitrogen), and 1 mL of Baseline Zero DNase (Catalog No. DB0715K, Lucigen-Epicenter) was added to the extracted RNA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the treated RNA was concentrated into a final volume of 12 mL with the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate Kit (Catalog No. R1015, Zymo). Sequencing libraries prepared from 8 μL of concentrated RNA using the Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3—Pico Input Mammalian (634485, Takara) and barcoded using the SMARTer RNA Unique Dual Index Kit (634451, Takara). Library concentration was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Q33216, Invitrogen) with the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Invitrogen). Libraries were quality-controlled using an Agilent Fragment Analyzer 5200 (M5310AA, Agilent) with the HS NGS Fragment kit (DNF-474-0500, Agilent). Libraries were pooled to equal concentrations and sequenced at Cornell Genomics on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 machine using 150-base pair, paired-end sequencing for an average of 26 million reads per sample. Sequencing data was processed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline utilizing the Snakemake workflow management system (v7.7.0). Reads were quality filtered and trimmed using BBDUK (v38.90), aligned to the Gencode GRCh38 human reference genome (v38, primary assembly) using STAR (v2.7.0f) default parameters, deduplicated using UMI tools (v1.1.2), and features quantified using featureCount (v2.0.0). Mitochondrial, ribosomal, X, and Y chromosome genes were removed prior to analysis. cfRNA sample quality was determined by calculating DNA contamination (intron/exon ratio), rRNA contamination, number of feature counts, and RNA degradation. All samples passed QC. Read counts of technical duplicate samples were combined for downstream analyses. Cell-type deconvolution was performed using BayesPrism (v2.0) with the Tabula Sapiens single cell RNA-seq atlas (Release 1)83,84. Cells from the Tabula Sapiens atlas were grouped as previously described in ref. 85. Comparative analysis of DEGs was performed using a negative binomial model as implemented in the DESeq2 package (v1.34.0) using a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value cutoff < 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Variance stabilization transformation was used for comparing and plotting gene counts, unless otherwise stated.I4 secretome data Plasma samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min and then Extracellular Vesicles and Particles (EVPs) were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min. EVPs were then washed in PBS and again collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS. Two micrograms of enriched EVPs were digested and analyzed with LC-MS/MS in data-dependent acquisition mode. The list of differentially abundant proteins from the plasma proteomics data was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 1. Heatmaps were generated with mitochondrial and oxidative stress genes using R package pheatmap. Additional protocol details on EVP proteomic profiling is described in ref. 86.NASA twins study RNA-seq data Gene set enrichment analysis and gene expression data have been downloaded from the previous publication7. In brief, one astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the ISS, and his identical twin sibling was also monitored at the same time, serving as a genetically matched ground control for this study.JAXA CFE cfRNA data Plasma cell-free RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA’s GeneLab platform with accession number GLDS-530/OSD-530. Briefly, blood samples were collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Total RNA was purified from plasma samples and processed for RNA-seq analysis. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point.Single-cell microgravity simulated in vitro PBMCs Single-cell RNA-seq data was generated from donor PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity (μG) for 25 h, with a continual motion machine (Rotating Wall Vessel) serving as an in vitro model for microgravity. DEGs were calculated as μG vs. 1 G (control) for pooled data after two donor sequencing reactions (one male and one female). Detailed methods can be found in ref. 44.Bulk RNA-sequencing from mouse tissues All mouse RNA-sequencing datasets used were previously published and are publicly available. Brown adipose tissue, kidney, liver, mandibular bone, spleen, temporal bone, thymus, white adipose tissue and soleus were collected from mice that had spent 31 days on the ISS, two days after returning to Earth87,88. A different group of soleus samples were collected from mice that had spent 34.1 days in microgravity, 3.3 days after returning to Earth89. The tibialis anterior samples were obtained from the Rodent Research-23 mission. Briefly, mice were maintained in microgravity for 38 days and were euthanized and dissected after 24 hours from returning to Earth. A more thorough description of the experimental design can be found at NASA GeneLab, Doi: 10.26030/zw7z-bj40. Raw reads were trimmed galore, then aligned using STAR2 alignment to mm10 or Salmon to Ensembl transcripts. Gene counties were obtained using featurecounts. All RNAseq differential expression analyses were performed using DESeq2(1.38.3) in RStudio (R, 4.2.3). Heatmaps and volcano plots were produced using the R packages ComplexHeatmap (2.15.1) and EnhancedVolcano (1.16.0), respectively.Compound analysis FDA-approved drugs (n = 1692) are selected from the DrugBank database and food compounds (n = 7962) are selected from the FoodDB database. LINCS compounds (n = 5414) are obtained from LINCS L1000 project. “Compound” is used as a general term for “drug”, “food compound” and “LINCS compound” throughout the document. Compound-protein interactions are extracted from the STITCH database v5.069 by matching the InChI keys of drugs/food/LINCS compounds. STITCH collects information from multiple sources and individual scores from each source are combined into an overall confidence score. After processing, three data sets are obtained: i) drug-gene interaction dataset containing 1890 drugs and 16,654 genes with 542,577 interactions ii) food compound - gene interaction dataset containing 7,654 compounds and 116,375 genes and 818,737 interactions iii) LINCS compound—gene interaction dataset containing 5414 compounds and 16,794 genes and 692,152 interactions. The universal gene set contains all genes that interact with at least one compound. The compound with low p-value interacts with a higher proportion of the DEGs than that expected by chance. Statistically significant compounds were then obtained after Bonferroni adjustment of p values. The pipeline for this compound analysis is implemented in the gcea R package (https://github.com/nguyenkhiemv/gcea).Further protocol and sample processing information Sample collection methods and data generation have been detailed in full in the paper86.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (14MB, pdf) Peer Review File (143.1KB, pdf) 41467_2024_49211_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (89.6KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1-15 (16.5MB, zip) Reporting Summary (91.8KB, pdf) Source data Source Data (26.8MB, xlsx) Acknowledgements C.E.M. thanks the WorldQuant Foundation, NASA (NNX14AH50G, NNX17AB26G, 80NSSC23K0832, 80NSSC22K0254, NNH18ZTT001N-FG2), the National Institutes of Health (R01MH117406, R01AI151059, P01CA214274, R01CA249054), and the LLS (MCL7001-18, LLS 9238-16, 7029-23).

    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166937/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space. Subject terms: Adaptive immunity, Innate immunity, Gene regulation in immune cells, Space physics",
    "introduction": "Introduction Astronauts in low earth orbit (LEO), such as on the international space station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction associated with the microgravity environment. Multiple studies have described immune dysregulation in short or long-term simulated1–4 or actual microgravity5–9. For the most part, such studies have described impaired T-cell responses, coupled with some form of heightened innate immunity7,10, though some innate immune cells, like natural killer (NK) cells, also show impaired function11. Consistent with altered adaptive immunity, potentially due to impaired cytotoxic and Th1 T cell function, and reduced NK cell function, astronauts develop increased reactivation of latent viruses, including herpes viruses (EBV, CMV, VZV)3,7,12–15. In one study, viral shedding after 9–14 days of spaceflight was linked to changes in serum cytokines, including a preferential large increase in IL-4 compared to interferon (IFN)γ, indicating a possible shift away from Th1 immunity towards Th2 immunity16. Consistently, some astronauts report heightened hypersensitivity reactions, such as increased allergic and Th2-like responses in space7. Multiple studies using higher throughput approaches have started to add insight into pathways impacted by spaceflight. In the Twins study17, a one-year ISS mission altered innate, adaptive, and NK cell-mediated immunity across bulk RNA sequencing analysis. In T cells, increases in DNA methylation were seen in the promoters of notch3 for CD4+ T cells, linked to T cell differentiation, and in scl1a5/asct2, linked to activation, for CD8+ T cells. A total of 50 of 62 assayed cytokines were also altered by spaceflight or landing17. During a recent multi-omic analysis, including bulk RNA and DNA methylation sequencing, of astronauts and mice in space, mouse organs such as the liver and kidney demonstrated reduced IFN signatures, coupled to altered methylation patterns of these gene sets, while muscles had increased IFNγ, IL-1, and TNF10. Serum inflammatory markers from 59 astronauts in this study (and in a similar companion study) showed increased VEGF-1, IGF-1, and IL-1 during spaceflight, which resolved upon returning to Earth4,10. This same study also identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a major response of different non-hematolymphoid tissues to spaceflight10. More recently, another study using a NASA-developed Rotating Wall Vessel, which was employed in our current work, utilized a 41-parameter mass cytometry approach to show that short-term (18–22 hours) simulated microgravity can dampen NK cell, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell responses to Concanavalin A/anti-CD28 stimulation, but potentiates STAT5 signaling to boost Tregs18. Despite these important advances, the core fundamental mechanisms, genes, and pathways that are directly altered by microgravity to adversely impact immunity, including at single-cell resolution, are largely unknown. Interestingly, mechanical forces are emerging as critical orchestrators of immune cell function, whereby mechanotransduction tunes immune cell responsiveness to danger signals19. Some of these effects occur through environmental modulation of mechanosensing pathways that alter ion currents in cells, metabolism, or directly act on the cytoskeleton19. Thus, a spaceflight environment, which alters forces such as gravity, associated hydrostatic pressure, and shear force20,21 onto immune cells likely directly contributes to immune system dysfunction. Here, using a common ground-based analog, the NASA developed low shear modeled microgravity Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)2,18,22, we examine in depth how short-term (25 hours) exposure to simulated microgravity impacts the human peripheral blood mononuclear immune system in detail at single-cell resolution. Combining this data with validation experiments from mice and crewmembers in LEO, as well as machine learning algorithms, we identify numerous core genes and pathways in immune cells that are altered by simulated microgravity or spaceflight, and identify numerous potential compounds that directly map onto immune cell transcriptional signatures in simulated microgravity.",
    "methods": "Methods Studies were conducted under the supervision and in accordance with ethical guidelines of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. In particular, protocols for the purchasing of human blood products from Stanford University are described in the next section below. Human blood sample and cell culture De-identified peripheral blood buffy coat samples were obtained from the Stanford University Blood Center under official signed contract agreements with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, following the Stanford Blood Center’s Certification of Human Subjects Approval for minimal risk research-related activities (IRB eProtocol# 13942). A total of 27 healthy human buffy coats between the ages of 20 and 46 were purchased from the Stanford University Blood Center. PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll gradient method. PBMCs were counted and resuspended in complete media at 1 × 106 cells/ml (RPMI 1640, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential Amino acid,1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol,10 mM HEPES). To generate simulated microgravity, the cell suspension was loaded into 10 ml disposable high aspect ratio vessels (Synthecon, Houston, TX) and rotated at 15 rpm for 25 hours. For the 1G control, the cell suspension was plated in standard 6-well culture plates, as standard static culture plates or culture flasks have been shown to be comparable to static high aspect ratio vessels by others in major immunological assays2. 1G and simulated microgravity cultures were simultaneously placed in the same 37 C, 5% CO2 incubator. To stimulate PBMCs, samples were mixed with 1 μM R848 (TLR7/8 agonist, Invivogen, San Diego, CA) after 16 hours, for 9 hours of stimulation. At the end of each experiment, the cell suspension was quickly collected, spun down at 500 × g, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and used for downstream analysis. For super-resolution imaging cells were fixed before centrifuging. Single-cell RNA sequencing 1 × 104 PBMCs from each condition were counted and loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller and the libraries were prepared using Chromium Next GEM Single-Cell 5’ Reagent Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The quality of libraries was assessed using Agilent TapeStation 4200 (Santa Clara, CA), and test-sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550 (San Diego, CA). The full sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by SeqMatic (Fremont, CA). Processing of single-cell RNA-seq data Data processing was performed using 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v6.1.2 and MTD26 pipelines. The “cellranger count” was used to perform transcriptome alignment, filtering, and UMI counting from the FASTQ (raw data) files. Alignment was done against the human genome GRCh38-2020-A. Cell numbers after processing were: 1G unstimulated 13,304 cells, uG unstimulated 21,709 cells, 1G stimulated 16,397 cells, and uG stimulated 14,913 cells. The MTD pipeline was used to generate the single-cell microbiome count matrix from the FASTQ files. Downstream analyses were performed in R (version 4.2.0), primarily using the Seurat R package (version 4.1.1)65,66 and custom analysis scripts. First, we executed a quality control step that removed the cells containing >10% mitochondrial RNA and ≤250 genes/features. The doublet cells were identified and removed from the downstream analysis by using the DoubletFinder R package (version 2.0.3)67 with parameters PCs = 1:30, pN = 0.25, and nExp = 7.5%. To avoid the influence of hemoglobin transcripts on the analysis, we filtered out the putative red blood cells (defined by the method below) before the following process. A total of 55,648 cells remained for subsequent analysis. Raw RNA counts were first normalized and stabilized with the SCTransform v2 function (SCT), then followed by the CCA integration workflow for joint analysis of single-cell datasets. In doing so, the top 3000 highly variable genes/features among the datasets were used to run SCT; and then 3000 highly variable genes/features and the 30 top principal components (PCs) with k.anchor = 5 were used to find “anchors” for integration. The clustering step was executed by using the 30 top PCs summarizing the RNA expression of each cell with a resolution parameter of 0.8. To identify putative cell types, Azimuth (version 0.3.2)65 pipeline was used with the reference dataset of Human–PBMC celltype.l2. Cell type annotation results from Azimuth were validated by checking the markers of each cell type (Supplementary Data 3). Gene differential expression analyses were done by Seurat PrepSCTFindMarkers then FindAllMarkers/FindMarkers functions with MAST68 algorithm. The pseudo-bulk analysis was conducted to find overall DEGs of uG against 1G in either unstimulated or stimulated PBMCs, using the FindMarker function with parameter min.pct = 0.005 and logFC = 0.1. To compare the stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs under uG and 1G conditions, we subtracted log2FC values of their DEGs (uG−1G). The top 50 most upregulated DEGs between stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs under 1G were used for comparison. FindConservedMarkers function was used to find DEGs that are conserved between the groups with the same parameter settings as FinderMarkers. The top 50 conserved DEGs specifically sensitive to uG were selected based on the rank of the absolute sum of log2FC values, derived separately from the sum of positive log2FC values and the sum of negative log2FC values. Rank-Rank Hypergeometric Overlap (RRHO) analysis69,70 was performed by using RRHO2 R package (version 1.0) to compare the differential expression patterns between 1G and uG of stimulated vs unstimulated PBMCs. The ranks of the genes in the two gene lists were determined by calculating −log10(adj.pvalue)*log2FC. Pathway analysis Following differential expression, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) was used to discover changes in enriched pathways in each comparison. DEGs with p values < 0.05 and |Log2FC|> 0.1 were incorporated into the IPA canonical pathway analysis. Trajectory analysis To study the inferred trajectory of PBMC differentiation, cell trajectory analysis was performed by using the Monocle 3 R package (version 1.2.9)71,72. We first subsetted Seurat data to uG and 1G groups then run the functions as.cell_data_set(), cluster_cells(), and learn_graph(). Then, we ran order_cells() with the selection of cell types representing early development stages (CD4 naive, B naive, plasmablast, and HSPC) as the roots of the trajectory. Calculating cell scores of inflammatory aging and cellular senescence The inflammatory aging (iAge)24 index was calculated by the sum of the cell scores that count by multiplying normalized and transformed gene expression with the corresponding coefficient of the gene in the iAge gene set. Cellular senescence was scored using Seurat AddModuleScore function65,73 on the SenMayo gene set25. Viral and microbial abundance analysis The output reads counts from MTD pipeline were then combined with the host reads and analyzed in R with Seurat package and other customized scripts. The relative abundance (frequency) of a virus or microbe was determined by dividing its reads count by the total reads count (host and non-host) in that sample. The classification results were further validated using a different method Magic-BLAST74. APCs to T cell intercellular communication To study the difference in intercellular communication from APCs to T cells between uG and 1G, we used nichenetr R packages (version 1.1.0)27 to analyze cells in the dataset belonging to APCs (B cells, DCs, or monocytes) and T cell types. The “Differential NicheNet” workflow was implemented. The expressed genes in sender cells—APCs were selected if they were expressed in at least 10% of that APC cell population. The gene set of interest in receiver cells—T cells was defined by adjusted p value ≤ 0.05 and Log2FC ≥ 0.25 in the DEGs. Top 30 ligands that were further used to predict activated target genes and construct an activated ligand-receptor network. Default settings were used for all other parameters. Bulk RNA sequencing Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Cat# 74134, Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity check, preparation of RNA library, and mRNA sequencing were conducted by Novogene Co., LTD (CA, US). About 20 million paired-end 150 bp reads per sample were generated from Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System. FASTQ raw reads were analyzed using the MTD pipeline26. Differential gene expression analysis between groups was done by DESeq2 R package (version 1.36.0)75 with control for the subject effect. Genes with adjusted p value < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed. DEGs with p values < 0.05 and |Log2FC|>0.5 were used for the IPA canonical pathway analysis. Different from single-cell (SC), to calculate the iAge index for bulk RNA-seq, normalized and transformed gene expression was multiplied with the gene’s coefficient in the iAge gene set, then summed for each sample. Cellular senescence was scored using the ssGSEA76 method on the SenMayo gene set. Cell Type Frequency Changes within PBMCs were predicted by CIBERSORTx Docker image–Fractions Mode version 1.0. Our single-cell RNA-seq data from PBMCs was used to build the Signature Matrix File as the reference to predict the cell proportion in the bulk RNA-seq data. Mouse spleen bulk RNA-seq analysis Mouse spleen Bulk RNA-seq raw data was acquired from NASA GeneLab Data Repository with the accession ID: GLDS-420. Ten mice in space flight and ten mice in ground control (GC) were used in the experiment. The detailed study description and experiment protocols are on the data repository https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-420. MTD pipeline was used to process the FASTQ raw data, generate the count matrix, and then analyze differentially expressed genes between Flight and Ground groups. Gene set overlapping analysis The p value of gene overlapping between two datasets was calculated by Fisher’s Exact Test in GeneOverlap R package [Shen L, Sinai ISoMaM (2022)]. GeneOverlap: Test and visualize gene overlaps. R package version 1.32.0 [http://shenlab-sinai.github.io/shenlab-sinai/]. The 375 DEGs in uG vs. 1G from unstimulated PBMCs single-cell RNA-seq results were used to match with the genes from PBMC bulk RNA-seq, I4, or JAXA studies. For the mouse genes in GLDS-420, we first convert them to the human orthologous before the analysis. In the matched genes, those expressions that were in the same log2FC direction as 375 DEGs as well as with p value < 0.05, were considered overlapping (except for I4, where either direction was considered overlapping). Complete linkage hierarchical clustering was used to analyze dissimilarities in genes or pathways between datasets, and the results were visualized by the ComplexHeatmap R package (version 2.12.0)77. Moreover, the IPA canonical pathway analysis was performed on the matched genes of I4 and Twins studies. The 106 core gene set was constituted by DEGs that consistently change their log2FC directions in both SC and bulk data of PBMCs. The alteration of the core gene set by the compound was measured by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)76,78 and Pearson correlation test. Compound analysis FDA-approved drugs (n = 1692) are selected from the DrugBank database and food compounds (n = 7962) are selected from the FoodDB database as previously described32. LINCS compounds (n = 5414) are obtained from the LINCS L1000 project. ‘Compound’ is used as a general term for ‘drug’, ‘food compound’ and ‘LINCS compound’ throughout the document. Compound-protein interactions are extracted from the STITCH database v5.079 by matching the InChI keys of drugs/food/LINCS compounds. STITCH collects information from multiple sources and individual scores from each source are combined into an overall confidence score. After processing, three datasets are obtained: (i) drug-gene interaction dataset containing 1890 drugs and 16,654 genes with 542,577 interactions (ii) food compound-gene interaction dataset containing 7654 compounds and 116,375 genes and 818,737 interactions (iii) LINCS compound-gene interaction dataset containing 5414 compounds and 16,794 genes and 692,152 interactions. Statistical significance for the overlap between compound genes and the DEGs from the uG vs 1G of the unstimulated PBMCs single-cell RNA-seq is calculated using Fisher’s Exact Test. The universal gene set contains all genes that interact with at least one compound. The compound with a low p value interacts with a higher proportion of the DEGs than that expected by chance. Statistically significant compounds were then obtained after the Bonferroni adjustment of p values. The pipeline for this compound analysis is implemented in the R script GCEA. Cell staining and imaging (super-resolution microscopy) Live PBMCs were stained with 60 nM MitoTracker Red-CMX-Ros (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) either in 6-well plates or in the microgravity chambers for the last 2 hr of the microgravity simulation. At the end of the microgravity simulation cells were immediately fixed by 1:1 mixing the cell suspensions with 2× concentrated fixative (10% Sucrose (w/v) 120 mM KCl, 1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, 8% (w/v) PFA pH 7.4) and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature followed by 15 minutes on ice. Fixed cells were washed and stored in PBS until further staining for up to a week at 4 °C. 1 million fixed cells were resuspended in 1 mL of permeabilization solution (0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS) for 5 minutes. After twice washing in PBS, pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL 1% BSA PBS containing Phalloidin-iFluor-488 (cat# ab176753, Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK) at the manufacturer’s recommended dilution, and were incubated for 90 minutes with gentle agitation. After washing in PBS, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 µg/mL in PBS) for 10 minutes. The fixed-stained cells were immobilized at 3 × 105 cells per well density in glass-bottom 96-well microplates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC), which were pre-coated with polyethyleneimine (1:15,000 (w/v)) for 16 hours in a 37 °C incubator, and washed twice with PBS. Microplates with the cell suspensions were centrifuged in a swing plate rotor centrifuge (Eppendorf 5810 R) at 400 × g and for 10 min and then fixed on the surface by adding an equal volume of 8% (w/v) PFA for 5 min. Finally, the fixative was replaced with 100 µL of antifade reagent (Vector Prolong Gold (ThermoFisher)). Samples were imaged immediately after this procedure. Image acquisition Immobilized fixed-stained PBMCs were imaged on a Zeiss LSM980 Airyscan2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, White Plains, NY). Single PBMCs were manually selected for recording based on low-resolution preview scans showing only nuclei. All singlet cells were selected in a small neighborhood to avoid biases. In each microscopy session, 24-40 cells were selected for recording in one well for each condition. This was performed in an interleaved manner, capturing 6-8 cells at a time, and then moving to the next well and then repeating this multiple times using the Experiment Designer module for automation. Super-resolution volumes of (358 × 358 × 70 pixels, 0.035 × 0.035 × 0.13 µm/voxel resolution) were recorded in the above-determined positions using Definite Focus autofocusing. A Plan-Apochromat 63 × 1.40 Oil lens, Airyscan2 SR (super-resolution) mode with optimal sampling and frame switching between 3 fluorescence channels to minimize spectral cross-bleed were used. MitoTracker Red, iFluor488, and Hoechs33342 were excited with 561, 488, and 405 nm solid-state lasers, respectively, using the optimal emission filter for each channel. 3D Airyscan2 processing was performed with standard filtering settings. With PBMCs from four donors, in six staining and microscopy sessions total of 930 valid volumes have been recorded, and are available at 10.5281/zenodo.8415196. 2-dimensional image analyses Staining intensities, mitochondrial size, and punctate over diffuse index (defined as variance over mean) were determined in Image Analyst MKII 4.1.14 (Image Analyst Software, Novato, CA) in maximum intensity projection images using a custom pipeline available at https://github.com/gerencserlab/Superresolution-actin-and-mitochondria-analysis. Cellpose 2.0 with the “cyto2” neural network was used for finding cells in the images based on nuclear and actin staining80. Protruding actin bundles were analyzed by first binarizing projection images of actin using the trainable LABKIT segmentation81, and this was followed by separation of protrusions and measurement of their maximal distance from the bulk of the cell using morphological erosion and distance image functions in Image Analyst MKII. Rescaled projection images were saved and further analyzed in CellProfiler 4.2.482, where images were segmented for nuclei and these segments were extended to the cell boundaries based on the phalloidin staining. These profiles were used for measuring shape, granularity spectrum, and texture in actin, mitochondria, and nuclei. For actin granularity spectrum measurement the following parameters were used in CellProfiler MeasureGranularity function: “Subsampling factor for granularity measurements” = 1, “Subsampling factor for background reduction = 0.125”, “Radius of structuring element” = 12, “Range of granular spectrum” = 16. Similar results were obtained using a set of discrete Fourier transformation-based Butterworth bandpass filters in Image Analyst MKII for analysis of actin granularity spectrum changes in simulated microgravity and TLR stimulation. Here a series of 16 adjacent 4-pixels wide (in Fourier space of a 512 × 512 pixels image), 300-order bandpass filters with “Corrected Integral” normalization and absolute value calculation83 were used starting at 1 pixel, and mean pixel intensities over whole cells in the filtered images were normalized to the unfiltered image. We have previously shown that this technique is primarily sensitive to sub-resolution changes in thickness of underlying filamentous structures84, such as actin bundles in this case. We found no changes in granularity spectra measured by CellProfiler or Image Analyst MKII when analyzing mitochondria or nuclei of the same cells, excluding optical biases. 3-dimensional image analyses Mitochondria:cell volume fraction was measured using a modification of the “Mitochondria:cell volume fractionator (basic)” pipeline in Image Analyst MKII85, using the hole-filled actin image as cell marker and MitoTracker Red as mitochondrial marker, and all image planes to measure areas of mitochondrial and cell profiles. Cell and nucleus volumes and surface areas were measured using Imaris 9.9 (Oxford Instruments, Concord, MA) using the Cell and Batch modules. For 2D and 3D image analyses, tabular data generated by Image Analyst MKII, CellProfiler, and Imaris were matched to conditions in Microsoft Excel and in Mathematica 13 (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL) and visualized in Prism 9 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) for statistical analysis. Two-tailed Welch’s t test is used for all comparisons. Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA G-LISA activation assay PBMCs from different conditions were collected and 7 × 106 cells were lysed and snap-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysate protein concentrations were measured using Precision Red Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (cat# ADV02, Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) and equalized. The GTP-bound Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA levels were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (cat# BK127-S, BK128-S, and BK124-S respectively, Cytoskeleton Inc.) and measured with a spectrophotometer at 490 nm. ROS detection The abundance of ROS was measured via 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA). Collected cells (100,000 cells per well) from each condition were incubated with 10 μM DCFDA Staining Buffer in dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes as per the manufacturer’s suggestions (cat# 601520; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The fluorescence was measured with a Pherastar FSx (BMG Labtech Inc., Cary, NC) microplate reader with the excitation wavelength at 495 nm, and emission at 530 nm. Luminex bead array Cell culture media (supernatant) from all experimental conditions were separately collected and snap-frozen. Samples were sent to the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center and MILLIPLEX 48 Plex Premixed Magnetic Bead Panel (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) was performed per the manufacturers’ instructions. IFN ELISA level measurement Cell culture media (supernatant) from microgravity and 1G ± R848 were separately collected at each experiment and snap-frozen. The samples were then thawed and used to detect the levels of IFNγ (cat# 430104; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA), IFNα all subtypes (cat# 41135; Pestka Biomedical Laboratories, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) per the manufacturers’ instructions. IL ELISA level measurement Cell culture media (supernatant) from microgravity and 1G were separately collected at each experiment and snap-frozen. The samples were then thawed and used to detect the levels of IL-8 (cat# 431504; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA), IL-6 (cat# 430504; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA), IL-1β (cat# 437004; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA) per the manufacturers’ instructions. Flow cytometry Single-cell suspensions from different donors and conditions were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain kit (cat# L34962; Invitrogen) for viability followed by Fc-blocking with human IgG (cat# AG714, Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 10 mins. For staining of intracellular cytokines, single-cell suspension was stimulated with 1 μM R848 in the presence of 2.5ug/ml Brefeldin A (cat# 420601; Biolegend) for 9 hours prior to surface staining. The cells were further stained with fluorophore-conjugated surface antibodies for 20 min at 4 °C and intracellular antibodies for 30 min at room temperature following fixation and permeabilization using Foxp3 staining buffer set (cat# 00-5523-00; eBioscience). The surface and intracellular antibody panel are listed in Supplementary Data 19. Cell phenotyping was analyzed on a Cytek Aurora instrument and analyzed using FlowJo. JAXA transcriptomic data JAXA cell-free RNA differential expression data was shared by Dr. Masafumi Muratani at the University of Tsukuba. Briefly, blood samples were collected from six astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. For this mission, we specifically made use of data from the samples of six astronauts, pooled into a single count, at day 5 and also at day 30, post-launch (i.e., in-flight), compared to pre-launch. In this study, human blood from astronauts was collected using Vacutainer EDTA-plasma separate gel collection tubes and centrifuged for 30 min at 3800 rpm (1239 × g, ISS) or 1600 × g (ground) before freezing at −95 °C (ISS) or −80 °C (ground). Cell-free RNA was purified from plasma samples through a TRIzol/chloroform method, sequenced (SMART-seq Stranded Kit, Takara Bio), and analyzed by the team leading the JAXA collaboration. Data was provided in csv format as normalized mean counts and normalized SEM of each gene at preflight and inflight time points. DEGs between 30 days in-flight and preflight time points were calculated by log2FC with p value < 0.05. The overlapping DEGs that are consistent in their log2FC directions with SC 375 gene signature are shown in Supplementary Fig. 16B. Inspiration4 mission data Four astronauts’ transcriptomic data from the Inspiration4 (I4) mission was collected by Dr. Christopher E. Mason and his team at Cornell University. Blood samples were collected before (preflight L-92, L-44, and L-3), during, and after (R + 1) the 3-day spaceflight in the SpaceX Dragon capsule. For this mission, we made use of data provided to us from the samples of the four astronauts comparing post-flight (R + 1) vs preflight (L-44) DEGs. Referring to the analysis workflow used by the I4 Cornell team, a list of fold change and p values based on post flight vs preflight findings was generated. The Seurat FindMarker parameters used to calculate I4 DEGs were the same as those used for our 375 DEGs. Next, the DEGs and pathway overlap from I4 single-cell analysis were calculated by using the methods described above in the section on Gene set overlapping analysis. NASA Twins study data Gene expression data from the NASA Twins study17 was provided by Cem Meydan in the Mason Lab in csv format and organized by Dr. Afshin Beheshti as normalized mean counts for four immune cell types. In brief, one astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the ISS, and his identical twin sibling was also monitored at the same time serving as a genetically matched ground control for this study. The NASA Twins study team provided DEGs in their four immune cell types with a list of fold change and p values based on inflight vs preflight findings. We reclustered our identified cell populations and computed DEGs accordingly. Next, the DEGs and pathway overlap from the Twins analysis were calculated by using the methods described above in the section on Gene set overlapping analysis. ROS reduction compound Quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) stock solution was prepared with DMSO at 1000×. In the cell culture experiments utilizing quercetin, the concentration of quercetin was decided based on existing literature86–89. After incubation with quercetin, cells were counted with a Cellometer Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter (Nexcelom, San Diego, CA), which utilizes Acridine Orange and Propidium iodide dual-staining systems to accurately distinguish live vs dead cells. After 25 hours of 50 μM quercetin treatment, the cell viability across PBMCs in both 1G and simulated microgravity conditions were at least 93%. There were no statistical differences in viability observed between the groups with and without quercetin treatment. Statistical analyses In addition to the methods described above, the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was used to assess whether the distributions of data from cell score or microbial abundance were significantly different between the 1G and uG cell populations from single-cell data. The association between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq in gene expressions was tested by Spearman’s correlation. Mann–Whitney test was performed on ROS reduction by quercetin. Unpaired parametric two-tailed t tests were performed on single-cell iAge, SenMayo, and imaging analyses for statistics. G-LISA, ELISA, Luminex, and DCFDA results were assessed by paired parametric two-tailed t test. However, given our existing transcriptomic and cytokine data showed decreased interferon coupled to increased IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 production in microgravity, for validation the flow cytometry results were assessed by one-tail paired parametric t test. In PBMCs bulk RNA-seq results, the difference in iAge and SenMayo scores of samples with or without compound treatment was evaluated by two-tailed paired parametric t test. R (version 4.2.0) and GraphPad Prism 9 were used to conduct the statistical analyses. Significance was set at 0.05. Outliers in datasets were assessed using Grubbs’ test (alpha = 0.01) and specified in figure legends if any were removed.

    "results": "Results Simulated microgravity alters the transcriptional landscape of individual immune cells To begin understanding how simulated microgravity impacts immune cell function, we loaded PBMC samples from two young healthy CMV+ donors, one male, and one female, into either RWV simulated microgravity (uG) or normal gravity (1G) static controls for 16 hours of conditioning. The 16-hour-conditioning time point was chosen based on prior work that used approximately the same time and tracked transcriptional or proteomic changes on immune cells to simulated microgravity1,18. PBMCs were either left unstimulated or stimulated for an additional 9 hours with R848, a standard TLR7/8 agonist. We chose TLR7/8 as a putative target since it mimics viral infection, and is expressed on most human immune cells, including T cells23. Using this methodology, we next developed a single-cell atlas of 55,648 human PBMCs exposed to these conditions. In the unstimulated state, after 25 hours of simulated microgravity, we identified 28 clusters of immune cells visualized by UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), including cell types such as mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells), double negative T cells, γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which have rarely been studied in simulated microgravity (Fig. 1A). Simulated microgravity altered proportions of immune cell clusters to a mild extent, with B intermediate cells, and MAIT cell proportions being most negatively impacted, and CD14+ monocytes, and CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cells being most increased based on percent change (Fig. 1B). Across all immune populations, simulated microgravity altered expression of over 4500 genes with adj P cutoff of <0.05 (Supplementary Data 1). This list was refined to a core list of ~375 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with an additional cutoff of |log2FC|> 0.1. This list was further condensed to visualize on a Volcano plot with |log2FC|> 0.25 (Fig. 1C), showing only the very top positively and negatively altered genes. Volcano plots of DEGs for individual immune cell clusters are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Across all immune cells, some of the most induced genes in simulated microgravity included acute response genes such as s100a8, s100a9, s100a12, thbs1, heat-shock genes such hsp90ab1, chemokines like ccl2, ccl4, iron storage genes (fth1, ftl), and matrix metalloproteinases (mmp9). The most reduced genes in simulated microgravity included interferon response (stat1) and associated guanylate binding proteins (gbp1), and cold shock genes (rbm3, cirbp). Expression of the top DEGs (with mitochondrial encoded genes excluded for visual simplicity) across 22 populations of immune cells are shown in Fig. 1D. CD14+ classical monocytes, CD16+ nonclassical monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells exhibited the most pronounced changes across major gene sets, consistent with short term simulated microgravity’s direct effect at reprogramming transcriptional changes most prominently in innate immunity. Consistently, using single-cell trajectory analysis, we identify numerous trajectories mainly in the innate immune cell clusters, especially the monocyte cluster, in response to simulated microgravity. Trajectory analysis is used to construct a path that describes how cells move through different states, and the numerous states seen in the monocyte cluster in simulated microgravity may reflect an increased capacity to generate distinct transcriptional states to simulated microgravity (Fig. 1E). Fig. 1. Simulated microgravity without pattern recognition receptor stimulation alters the single-cell transcriptional landscape of human PBMCs.

C Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across all immune cell types between uG and 1G; DEGs (including log2FC and adj. p) were calculated by the MAST method. The Benjamini–Hochberg (B-H) method was used for multiple comparison adjustments. Adjusted p value (adj. p) cutoff is 0.05, and log2FC cutoff is 0.25. D Dot plot showing the top DEGs from C and their expression levels across 22 immune cell populations. DEGs (including log2FC and adj. p) were calculated by the MAST method.

White circles represent the root nodes of the trajectory. Black circles indicate branch nodes, where cells can travel to a variety of outcomes. Light gray circles designate different trajectory outcomes. F Canonical pathway enrichment analysis obtained from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) is shown across 19 immune cell clusters. Spot color reflects IPA z-score enrichment of simulated uG vs 1G, with red meaning predicted activation of the pathway in uG and blue meaning repression of the pathway in uG. Spot size shows the level of significance via −log10 (adj. p). Adj. p was calculated by the Fisher’s Exact Test (right-tailed) followed by B-H adjustment.Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (Fig. 1F, Supplementary Data 2) generated using our core list of 375 genes from the overall populations, as well as the DEGs in major immune cell types (Supplementary Data 3) revealed that monocytes, conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2)s, double negative (dn)T cells and NK cells show the most notable pathway alterations. Major pathways altered by simulated microgravity across immune cells included reductions in oxidative phosphorylation, interferon signaling like protein kinase R (PKR) in interferon response, nuclear receptor signaling (LXR/RXR, PPAR, AHR), RHOA and pyroptosis signaling, as well as increases in BAG2 (heat-shock protein 70 interactor) signaling, fibrosis signaling, actin-based motility, RAC, HIF1 signaling, acute phase response, oxidative stress and sirtuin signaling, amongst others. Given that multiple pathways we detected were associated with inflammatory processes linked to aging (i.e., increased innate immunity coupled to reduced adaptive immunity), we next determined whether acute exposure to simulated microgravity mimicked inflammatory aging processes in immune cells. We mapped the gene expression signatures of individual immune cells, and overall immune signatures, against two recently developed inflammatory signatures of aging, the inflammatory age (iAge) clock24, and the SenMayo list of senescence associated secretory inflammatory products25. Simulated microgravity induced a significant enrichment in inflammaging related genes, consistent with the notion that short term simulated microgravity can induce aging-like inflammatory changes in unstimulated immune cells (Fig. 2A, B, Supplementary Fig. 2A). Next, because both spaceflight and aging are associated with reactivation of latent viruses, we mined the meta-transcriptome of our single-cell analysis with meta-transcriptome detector (MTD) pipeline26. Surprisingly, we saw that as little as 25 hours of simulated microgravity could induce the transcription of latent retroviruses and mycobacteria within human immune cells (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Figs. 2B, C and 3), directly implicating microgravity itself as a contributing trigger for latent pathogen activation. We confirmed the meta-transcriptome results with a different alignment tool, and we could still detect increases in Gammaretrovirus and Mycobacterium canettii transcripts seen with MTD pipeline (Supplementary Fig. 2B, C). Fig. 2. Simulated microgravity induces predictive functional alterations in immune cells.

The bar plot shows the mean with an error bar representing the standard error of the mean (SEM). For Mycobacterium canettii (p value < 0.0001), mean of 1G = 2.5e-4 ± 9.0e-6 and uG = 5.5e-4 ± 1.4e-5.

(D to F) NicheNet predicted significant ligand-receptor interaction between total T cells (Receiver) and the antigen-presenting cells (Sender) as D B cells, E DCs, and F monocytes in uG vs 1G condition (i.e., induced in uG over 1G).Finally, as we identified strong changes in gene expression pathways linked to innate cells, including those with the capacity to present antigen, we leveraged this knowledge to utilize NicheNet27 algorithms to generate a comprehensive predicted ligand:receptor interactome map of human antigen-presenting cells (APCs, plus plasmacytoid dendritic cells) and T cells in simulated microgravity vs 1G (Fig. 2D–F). Across APC donors and recipient T cells, we identified numerous significantly predicted ligand-receptor interactions to be elevated in simulated microgravity vs 1G. For instance, monocytes and dendritic cells induced IL-1 proteins while some B cells provided IL-23A, and IL-7. All APCs provided unique chemokine signals to T cells. Mmp9, ccl2, and thbs1 were amongst our most significantly induced genes in simulated microgravity, and the products of these genes show differential predicted receptor expression (e.g., CD44, CD47, ITGB1, CCR4, CCR5) in T cells (Supplementary Figs. 4–6) but all show predicted enhanced target gene expression in T cells. Thus, while simulated microgravity itself likely induces direct transcriptional changes in immune cells, we cannot exclude local paracrine effects of secreted products from one immune cell to another also contributing to our overall gene expression and pathway changes. After stimulating PBMCs with a TLR7/8 agonist in 1G and simulated microgravity, we characterized 23 clusters of immune cells by UMAP (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the unstimulated conditions, stimulation with a TLR7/8 agonist induced a robust preferential expansion of CD4+ central memory (TCM) cells (Fig. 3B). The microgravity itself impacted differential response to stimulation. Consistent with previous reports, simulated microgravity dampened expansion/responses of NK cells, and CD8+ TEM cells to a lesser extent in the donors examined18, as well as MAIT cell numbers, a cell type with previously unknown responses to microgravity. Simulated microgravity drove a preferential increase in CD14+ monocytes over 1G controls, indicating that this cell type is especially sensitive to the combination of simulated microgravity and TLR7/8 activation.

Spot size shows the level of significance via −log10 (adj. p). Adj. p was calculated by the Fisher’s Exact Test (right-tailed) followed by B-H adjustment.Across all cell types, the combination of simulated microgravity and TLR7/8 stimulation altered the expression of over 9000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with adj P cutoff of <0.05 (Supplementary Data 4). As with the unstimulated data, we refined this list to a core gene list of ~317 DEGs based on |log2FC| of >0.2. This list was further reduced to visualize on a Volcano plot with |log2FC|>0.25 (Fig. 3C), showing only the most positively and negatively altered genes. Some of the most induced genes by simulated microgravity over 1G in response to TLR7/8 agonist included cytokines and chemokines, such as ccl8, ccl4, ccl7, cxcl8, and il1b, and acute response proteins like s100a8, s100a9, s100a11, and thbs1. Additional genes induced in simulated microgravity were linked to tryptophan breakdown (ido1), mitochondrial antioxidant defense (sod2), the cytoskeleton (rhoq), and iron storage genes like fth1, ftl. The most downregulated genes when comparing simulated microgravity to 1G during TLR7/8 stimulation, included genes belonging to guanylate binding proteins (gbp1, gbp2, gbp4, gbp5), which were the most reduced set of genes by fold change and adj P, as well as interferon pathway genes, like irf1, stat1, isg20, ifi16, cold shock genes (rbm3, cirbp), cell killing genes (prf1, gzmb) and T/NK cell activation markers like cd69. Many of these genes were consistently altered by simulated microgravity alone without stimulation, indicating a conserved response, even in the setting of additional exogenous stimulation with a TLR ligand. Expression of top DEGs across 19 populations of immune cells is shown in Fig. 3D. Volcano plots of DEGs for individual immune cell clusters are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. CD14+ monocytes, NK cells, CD8+ TEM, and CD4+ TCM cells showed the most significant changes in the top most altered genes induced by TLR7/8 agonist stimulation in simulated microgravity. Interestingly, using single-cell trajectory analysis (Fig. 3E), we identified fewer trajectories in simulated microgravity stimulated with TLR7/8 compared to the 1G control. These findings suggest that under simulated microgravity, cells display reduced differentiation states in response to stimulation. IPA results (Fig. 3F, Supplementary Data 5) generated using our core list of approximately 317 genes from the overall populations, as well as the DEGs in major immune cell types (Supplementary Data 6) demonstrated that nearly all immune cells show changes across numerous pathways during microgravity and TLR7/8 induction. Major pathways reduced across most immune cells in simulated microgravity included PKR in interferon response (and associated eif2 signaling), interferon signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, pyroptosis signaling, cytotoxic T cell mediated killing of target cells and death receptor signaling. Major pathways induced by short term simulated microgravity included sirtuin signaling, fibrosis signaling, signaling by Rho GTPases, BAG2 (heat-shock protein 70 interactor) signaling, HIF1α signaling, acute phase response and associated HMGB1 signaling, amongst others. These pathways are consistent with microgravity facilitating innate like inflammation at the expense of interferon driven adaptive immunity and adaptive immune effector function (e.g., CD8+ T cell killing). Despite some similarities in pathways altered to simulated microgravity alone (Fig. 1F), we actually detected a lower iAge score globally across all immune populations in simulated microgravity plus TLR7/8 compared to 1G controls (Fig. 4A). While the reason for this finding is unclear, it appears to have been driven by a highly significant reduction in score by naive B cells, naive CD4+ T cells, and reductions in lesser studied PBMC populations, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC)s and double negative T cells. Lower iAge also could be reflective of altered immune activation in simulated microgravity, such as seen in CD16+ monocytes (Fig. 4A, right panel). Despite a reduction in iAge, we still observed an increased SenMayo score in simulated PBMCs (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. 8), illustrating different compositions of genes in these two gene sets.

C–E NicheNet predicted significant ligand-receptor interaction between total T cells (Receiver) and the antigen-presenting cells (Sender) as C B cells, D DCs, and E monocytes in TLR7/8 agonist activated simulated uG vs 1G condition (i.e., induced in uG over 1G).NicheNet analysis across major APC types to T cells post TLR7/8 agonist in simulated microgravity vs 1G (Fig. 4C–E, and Supplementary Figs. 9–11) illustrated some of the significant cytokines, chemokines, surface molecule ligands and receptors used in simulated microgravity upon TLR7/8 stimulation. Compared to the unstimulated interactome (Fig. 2D–F), we saw increased production and diversity of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines used. We again noted IL-1 produced in APCs, but also noted increased TNF superfamily products like TNF, TNFSF12 (TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis, TWEAK) and TNFSF15 (vascular endothelial growth inhibitor, VEGI), and lymphotoxin (LTA) preferentially produced to modulate T cell function. Next, we assessed the differential responsiveness of immune cells to TLR7/8 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Data 7). Under 1G conditions, stimulation led to a marked induction of CD4+ TCM, at the expense of CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ naive T cells, coupled to an expected pronounced inflammatory gene signature, including marked induction of interferon inducible genes, gbp transcripts, and chemokines across most immune cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 12A–E). Under simulated microgravity, TLR7/8 stimulation also induced CD4+ TCM, at the expense of naive CD4+ T cells, though proportions of CD14+ monocyte populations did not reduce as seen in 1G (Supplementary Fig. 12F, G). In simulated microgravity, TLR7/8 stimulation also induced a robust expression of inflammatory genes, including interferon inducing genes across most cell types (Supplementary Fig. 12H–J). Next, to determine the sensitivity of individual immune cell populations to TLR7/8 agonist in 1G vs simulated microgravity, we compared the differences in responsiveness to stimulation. We subtracted the fold change induction in 1G from induction in simulated microgravity to determine sensitivity to stimulation. Remarkably, across overall immune cells, we see a pattern of reduced responsiveness to TLR7/8 simulation in simulated microgravity to most of the highest genes induced at 1G (Supplementary Fig. 13A), with T cells and NK cells showing the most reduced inflammatory gene induction. T cells, NK cells, and overall across all cells exhibited blunting of induction of numerous genes in interferon signaling, and gbp genes in simulated microgravity in response to TLR7/8 agonist. Interestingly, monocytes tended to maintain such responses better in simulated microgravity, consistent with their predisposition to some inflammatory pathways in simulated microgravity. Some chemokines, such as ccl3, ccl4, ccl8, and cxcl10 appeared to be induced better in simulated uG across overall immune cell populations, though monocytes actually showed reduced induction of some of these chemokines, likely due to their capacity to produce them in simulated microgravity without stimulation (Fig. 1D). Nonetheless, the overall effects in sensitivity to stimulation in the “overall” category of immune cells largely followed the same pattern seen in the total magnitude of response of stimulated microgravity vs stimulated 1G (Fig. 3D). Next, we sought to identify genes uniquely altered by simulated microgravity irrespective of stimulation, as well as genes unique to microgravity under stimulation. First, to identify unique genes, regardless of stimulation, altered by simulated microgravity, we plotted out the most significant DEGs by the absolute sum of fold change under both stimulated and unstimulated conditions (Supplementary Fig. 13B, Supplementary Data 8). Across overall immune cells, regardless of stimulation, we still identified conserved increases in chemokines and acute response factors, coupled to reduced gbp expression and other interferon genes (e.g., irf1, stat1) imparted by simulated microgravity. Next, we mapped out the overall overlap of gene signatures and common genes between post-stimulation in 1G vs simulated microgravity (Supplementary Fig. 13C–E and Supplementary Data 9), and found that microgravity imparts a number of unique genes to TLR ligation that are not seen in 1G. Overall, these findings identify core-conserved DEGs specifically sensitive to simulated microgravity as well as unique signatures to simulated microgravity. Finally, we assessed if sex plays a role in the magnitude of response to simulated microgravity. In the unstimulated state, female cells showed only slightly more DEGs induced, while the male cells had slightly more genes reduced (Supplementary Fig. 14A). Male NK cells and monocytes were more sensitive to microgravity while female B cells showed more sensitivity than male B cells. Upon stimulation, male cells overall were more sensitive to simulated microgravity, especially in having more downregulated DEGs (Supplementary Fig. 14B). Volcano plots of DEGs across all cell types between the female and male are shown in Supplementary Fig. 14C–F and Supplementary Data 10. In both male and female cells, acute phase response and inflammatory genes like mmp9, ccl2, s100a8, and thbs1 were among the most induced genes, while reduced interferon regulators like stat1 and reduced cold shock genes like rbm3 and cirbp were consistently downregulated in both sexes in simulated microgravity. Upon stimulation, both sexes again show increases in the total magnitude of acute inflammatory, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related, and acute phase genes like chemokines, thbs1, mmp9, ncf1, and sod2 in simulated microgravity coupled to reduced interferon, gbps, cold shock, and some ribosomal protein genes in simulated microgravity. Many of these changes are reflected in IPA pathway analysis by sex (Supplementary Fig. 14G) and many of these core features were also conserved when data from sexes were pooled (Figs. 1F, 3F). Single-cell validation identifies core features of immune dysfunction in microgravity and spaceflight Next, to better validate conserved genes and pathways from our single-cell signatures without TLR7/8 agonist in simulated microgravity, we compared our core signature of 375 DEGs against additional datasets. First, we repeated experiments in a validation cohort of freshly isolated PBMCs from young donors (n = 6, age range 20–46), and spun these PBMCs for 25 hours, prior to performing bulk RNA-seq analysis. Using CIBERSORTx28, we first mapped predicted changes in population frequency and were able to confirm increased CD14+ monocyte frequencies in simulated microgravity, consistent with our single-cell data (Supplementary Fig. 15, Supplementary Data 11). Between validation samples spun in simulated microgravity vs 1G controls, we identified 2149 genes differentially expressed (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Data 12). Despite the variability of data inherent to bulk RNA-seq of different populations of cells between donors, we still saw a highly significant correlation in normalized gene counts per specific gene between datasets both at 1G and in simulated microgravity (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we identified overlap in over 28% of our core signature genes (same directionality) across all immune cells from our single-cell analysis (106/375 = 28.3%) (Fig. 5C). Many of the overlapping genes induced were consistent with our most robustly altered core pathways from the single-cell data. For instance, we saw shared overlapping genes induced in acute immune responses (such as s100a8, s100a12, thbs1, il1b), chemokines (like cxcl8), heat-shock proteins (hsp90aa1, hspa1a, hspb1), autophagy (atg7) and the actin cytoskeleton (rhou). Overlapping reduced genes in simulated microgravity, like in our single-cell datasets, included interferon response (stat1, irf1) and associated guanylate binding proteins (gbp1, gbp2, gbp4, gbp5), and cold shock genes (rbm3), amongst others. Overall, there was a highly significant enrichment and over representation of our core single-cell DEGs across our bulk validation cohort by Fisher’s Exact Test for gene overlap (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5. Validation of single-cell signatures identifies overlapping features of immune dysfunction in simulated microgravity and spaceflight.

Red indicates a predicted activation in pathways, whereas blue indicates a predicted inhibition in pathways.We next sought to validate overlapping genes against mice and people flown in LEO. While multiple stressors exist in LEO, the proximity to Earth and the presence of the Earth’s magnetic field negates some effects of galactic cosmic rays, especially at the altitude of the ISS. Thus, microgravity plays an important role in driving phenotypic changes in LEO. To accomplish this goal, we first mined data from NASA’s GeneLab database for its largest study looking at a major immune organ, the spleen, in mice flown on the ISS. The GLDS-420 study provides data from the spleens of ten mice housed on the ISS for 33 days compared to ten ground controls. Though this cohort represents longer exposure to microgravity than our single-cell data’s more acute exposure, any overlapping genes could represent persistent microgravity-sensitive immune cell genes across longer duration exposure. From the GLDS-420 dataset, we identified 1448 significant DEGs (Fig. 5D), of which 50/375 (13.3%) overlapped in the same direction as our single-cell core list (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, many of the overlapping genes were represented as part of altered core pathways from the single-cell data. For instance, we saw shared induced overlapping genes in acute immune responses or complement (such as c3), autophagy (atg7), heat-shock responses (hsp90ab1, hsp90aa1, hspa1a, hspa1), and the cytoskeleton (dynll1). Overlapping reduced genes included interferon response (stat1), and again, cold shock genes (cirbp, rbm3), amongst others. Overall, we saw a significant enrichment in our core single-cell DEGs across mouse spleens flown in space by Fisher’s Exact Test for gene overlap (Fig. 5E). Pathway analysis with IPA was next performed to identify major canonical pathways altered across all four complete datasets (single-cell unstimulated, single-cell stimulated with TLR7/8 agonist, Bulk RNA-seq validation unstimulated, and GLDS-420), including overlapping pathways shared across all datasets. These pathways are displayed in a heat map for comparison (see below), and will be described at that point. To better translate the usefulness of our single-cell atlas to human spaceflight, we compared our core list of 375 DEGs across single cells in simulated microgravity to changes across all single cells from the Inspiration Four (I4) crew members. The I4 mission provides a compelling comparison since crew members spent up to three days in LEO, a timeline not too different from our 25-hour time point. Moreover, I4 gene lists were also generated by single-cell sequencing, making it a comparable technology for our analysis. However, it is important to note that the I4 datasets contain a few important caveats. First, the altitude flown by I4 crew (585 km/364miles) predispose the astronauts to higher radiation exposures than what would typically be experienced on the ISS (408 km/254miles altitude). Additionally, the I4 datasets were derived from PBMC gene expression comparisons between post-flight (1 day after Return/R + 1 in our case) vs preflight (44 days before launch/L-44 in our case). Since the changes from the I4 single-cell data represent changes encompassing effects of spaceflight, plus return to the ground, including short-term exposures to hyper-gravity, and one day of return to 1 g gravity (all which manifest as increased gravity exposure to inflight conditions), we considered overlapping immune cell genes in either direction on return to be gravity sensitive genes. Remarkably, despite these caveats, we found a very robust overlap of nearly 60% of DEGs in PBMCs in simulated microgravity (210/375 = 56%) to be also significantly altered across all immune cells in the I4 mission (Fig. 5F, Supplementary Data 13). Of these significantly altered genes across I4 data, 122 were altered in the same direction as I4 data, and 88 in the opposite direction. To gain a better understanding of the pathways and mechanisms impacted by gravity and spaceflight in the immune system, we compared pathways between simulated microgravity and the entire I4 dataset (Fig. 5G, Supplementary Data 14, and Supplementary Fig. 16A). While we consider all of these pathways to be potentially gravity sensitive, we considered pathways altered in the opposite directions to be potentially acutely sensitive to gravity, while those pathways altered in the same direction likely take longer to normalize from a microgravity environment upon return. Both simulated microgravity and the I4 mission pathway results indicated reduced T-cell effector subset development, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and increased pathways associated with innate immunity (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis, FcR phagocytosis in monocytes, cytokine storm, chemokine signaling, ROS production in macrophages), as well as hypoxia and glycolytic metabolism (HIF1α signaling) and cell stress (e.g., sirtuin signaling). Interestingly, the return to gravity seen in the I4 mission reversed reductions in natural killer cell signaling and reversed pathways linked to poor adaptive immunity like IL-15 signaling, suggesting these pathways may be sensitive to acute changes in gravity (Fig. 5G, Supplementary Data 14). From the I4 dataset, we also noticed a consistent reduction in ribosomal subunit genes in the I4 data (Fig. 5F), which might be reflective of a stress response and reduced protein translation upon return to earth), and only some of these genes were reduced in simulated microgravity. Consistently, there was a marked reduction in EIF2 signaling in the provided I4 DEGs. Across all pathways, regardless of direction, we noticed many pathways pertaining to the cytoskeleton or to a mechanical extracellular environment (e.g., fibrosis, RAC, Rho family GTPases, RHOA, integrin signaling, leukocyte extravasation signaling, healing signaling etc.) to be altered by simulated microgravity or by spaceflight on immune cells. Next, to look for overlapping genes relevant to longer exposures to human spaceflight, we compared our core simulated microgravity signature of immune cells against available data from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome study in LEO (GLDS-530) and the Twins study17. For the JAXA mission, we had access to cell-free RNA data, which can sometimes give insight into changes to PBMCs, amongst other cells29. During this mission, blood was sampled from 6 astronauts, with data pooled into a single count, at days 5, 30, 60, 120 post launch. Given that cell-free RNA is not a fully ideal comparison to RNA-seq from isolated PBMCs, we focused only on the two early time points, 5 days and 30 days post launch, because we saw significant overlap between our single-cell data in both the three-day I4 mission and in the 33-day GLDS-420 dataset. Thus, we compared 5 days and 30 days in-flight vs preflight differentially altered cell free RNA signatures for any possible overlap with our single-cell data in simulated microgravity. While we did not observe much overlap in our core 375 immune gene signature at 5 days (less than 10 genes), we did see significant overlap by 30 days (42/375 = 11.2% overlap in the same direction) (Supplementary Fig. 16B). Interestingly, it was observed that cell-free RNA levels generally decreased across most genes in flight. Consequently, we hypothesized that identifying genes exhibiting increased expression could be particularly important for identifying over-represented processes. Remarkably, we did note that the most significantly elevated gene at 30 days in-flight vs preflight was cdc42, a key modulator of the cytoskeleton, as well as dynll1 a dynein gene that was also upregulated in our single-cell analysis. We next reclustered our single-cell data (Supplementary Data 15) to compare the DEGs in our equivalent single-cell populations with those obtained from sorted CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and lymphocyte-depleted immune cells from the NASA Twins study, which compares in-flight vs ground twin control17. The Twins study provides intriguing data on the impact of LEO on the immune system, but has caveats in that exposure to LEO was calculated in only a single individual through bulk RNA-seq, and at multiple time points across one full year in space, a different duration than our shorter gene sets. Nonetheless, compared to our reclustered CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ gene sets, we found significant overlap in some genes comparing the effects of simulated microgravity to spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. 17A–C). Across multiple cell types, we saw changes in genes involved in redox regulation (e.g., reduced txnip), and in genes involved in interferon responses (e.g., reduced stat1 and gbp5). Interestingly, we saw significantly reduced cold shock gene, cirbp, a similar functioning gene to rbm3, in B cells in space. In our lymphocyte depleted (i.e., myeloid) recluster, we saw a large and highly significant overlap of about 163 genes with the Twins lymphocyte-depleted bulk RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig. 17D). Many of the overlapping genes induced by simulated microgravity or spaceflight included genes involved in innate immunity and inflammation (e.g., il1b, s100a12, thbs1 etc.), the cytoskeleton (rhoq, rhou), and hypoxia signaling (e.g., hif1α). Some interesting downregulated genes in both datasets in myeloid cells included again gbp5, cirbp, txnip like seen in T and B cells from the Twins study. We also noted a number of overlapping downregulated genes in antigen presentation (e.g., tap1, tap2, hla-e, hla-dp1a, etc). IPA analysis on this data largely captured the increases in innate immune inflammatory pathways, including increases in fibrosis signaling, IL-6 signaling, acute phase response, cytokine storm, and HIF1α signaling seen across some of our previous datasets (Supplementary Fig. 17E, Supplementary Data 16). Overall, these data enforce the idea of classically activated basal myeloid inflammatory changes in microgravity and spaceflight. Given that many of our altered pathways in simulated microgravity involved predicted mitochondrial dysfunction and/or the cytoskeleton, we used Airyscan super-resolution confocal microscopy to characterize immune cell mitochondrial and actin morphological networks to look for alterations in simulated microgravity compared to 1G controls. Interestingly, while 25 hours of simulated microgravity did not alter mean cell area across PBMCs, it did alter actin granularity parameters, as well as intensity and variance, consistent with cytoskeletal changes in acute simulated microgravity (Fig. 6A–C), though these differences are mostly subtle to the naked eye. Using three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution imaging, 25 hours of simulated microgravity did not alter cell or nucleus volume, or nucleus shape, but it increased mean cell surface area and actin spike length, and decreased sphericity of the cells across PBMCs (Fig. 6A, B, D, Supplementary Fig. 18A, B). Remarkably, 1G immune cells and simulated microgravity immune cells demonstrate unique spectral changes to actin rearrangement post TLR stimulation, such that TLR stimulation resulted in a different pattern of actin granularity spectral change in 1G compared to stimulation in simulated microgravity (Fig. 6C). The effect of microgravity on the cytoskeleton in unstimulated immune cells was similar to the effect of TLR activation in 1G. During TLR stimulation in simulated microgravity, immune cells followed a unique dynamic actin rearrangement pattern, potentially even reversing the pattern observed in 1G with TLR stimulation. These results suggest that simulated microgravity itself may induce immune cytoskeleton alterations, which may mimic aspects of TLR ligation on the cytoskeleton. Short-term exposure to simulated microgravity showed some increases in the mitochondrial MitoTracker Red staining intensity and variance in the unstimulated conditions, without changes to fiber length, size, or volume (Supplementary Fig. 18C). Fig. 6. Simulated microgravity induces distinct modifications to immune cell cytoskeletal morphology and cytokine production.

Data are plotted as mean ± SEM and source data are provided with this paper.Since we detected morphological changes to the actin network, as well as noting changes in multiple altered cytoskeleton-related pathways across multiple datasets, including in the pathways “Signaling by Rho Family GTPases” or “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho”, we next sought to screen for active GTP-bound Rho GTPases, Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42, using G-LISA technology30 across further batches of isolated paired PBMCs. After 25 hours of simulated microgravity, regardless of stimulation conditions, we saw elevated levels of active GTP-bound Cdc42, consistent with cytoskeleton mobilization and the increase in actin spikes (indicative of filopodia)31 observed due to simulated microgravity (Fig. 6E). Active GTP-Rac1 was not altered at baseline in simulated microgravity, though showed a trend to induction with TLR7/8 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 18D, E). Levels of active GTP-RhoA were low in our samples, but trended lower in simulated microgravity without stimulation, and higher under stimulation, analogous to our single-cell data predictions (Supplementary Fig. 18D, E). Overall, these data suggest that simulated microgravity changes some Rho GTPase activity consistent with our transcriptional data, though ultimate impacts on cytoskeleton shape, variance, and dynamics likely involve additional contributing factors, including possibly other Rho GTPase family members not assessed. We next sought to investigate our core signature of reduced IFN signaling elicited in microgravity across immune cells (Fig. 6F, Supplemental Fig. 19A, B). Specifically, we assessed whether reduced interferon signaling was due to reduced local production of interferons. Supernatants from 25 hours unstimulated or 9 hours R848 simulated (25 hours total culture) PBMCs were assessed by ELISA for total IFNα (detecting 12 IFNα subtypes), and IFNγ. Simulated microgravity significantly reduced both IFNα and IFNγ secretion with TLR7/8 stimulation. At baseline, the levels of these cytokines were low, and variable, and thus not significantly different between 1G and simulated microgravity. These findings point to reduced production of IFNs in simulated microgravity, at least under TLR stimulation, as measured by ELISA, potentially as one contributing mechanism to reduced interferon signaling observed at the transcriptional level. Finally, to functionally validate how simulated microgravity impacts overall immune cell cytokine production, with and without TLR7/8 stimulation, across many cytokines simultaneously, we performed a 48-plex Luminex assay on cytokines secreted by PBMCs from 12 donors (Supplementary Fig. 19C, D). Consistent with our single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data, simulated microgravity was associated with increased or trending increases in mainly innate/monocyte immune cell-derived inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p40, CCL4), coupled to a reduction in cytokines that associate with T cell activation or proliferation (e.g., IL-2, IL-7, IL-15). Concurrently, the Luminex results showed a significant IFNγ and a trending IFNα2 reduction upon TLR7/8 agonist stimulation in simulated microgravity, consistent with our above ELISA data (Fig. 6F). IL-1, commonly induced in our sequencing data, also appeared elevated in simulated microgravity, though it exhibited high variability, precluding significance in the unstimulated state. In the stimulated state, IL-1β was significantly increased in simulated microgravity by Luminex analysis. Given the overlapping similarities between cytokines in the Luminex data and sequencing data for IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, we further assessed these cytokines by ELISA validation. Both IL-6 and IL-8 showed significant or near-significant increases by ELISA in simulated microgravity, while IL-1β demonstrated a trending increase (Fig. 6G, Supplementary Fig. 19E). Upon stimulation, simulated microgravity further facilitated near-significant increases in IL-1β and IL-8 as validated by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 19F). To better understand how certain cell populations respond to TLR7/8 stimulation in simulated microgravity, we further validated key cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFNγ, by intracellular flow cytometry in monocyte, NK, and T cell subsets exposed to simulated microgravity compared to 1G conditions (Supplementary Figs. 20, 21). Consistent with Luminex and ELISA data, we saw increased IL-1β production across all characterized monocyte populations (Supplementary Fig. 21A, B). Interestingly, despite no overall differences in IL-6 by Luminex or ELISA in simulated microgravity to TLR7/8 stimulation, we still detected significant increases in a subset of monocytes only, as well as in NK cells (Supplementary Fig. 21C, E). Despite increased cytokine production, we did not detect increases in the activation marker, HLA-DR, in monocyte populations (Supplementary Fig. 21D). NK cells also showed a reduction in the proportion producing IFNγ, as well as reduced proportions of expression in the activation marker, CD69, and degranulation marker, LAMP-1, consistent with reduced functionality and response to stimulation in simulated microgravity (Supplementary Fig. 21F, G). T cell subsets were less altered, though we still detected near significant or significant reductions in the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ central memory T cells expressing activation marker, CD69, and in effector memory CD4+ T cells expressing proliferation marker, Ki67 (Supplementary Fig. 21H). Taken together with our ELISA and Luminex data, these findings demonstrate that simulated microgravity, alone or in the presence of TLR7/8 agonist, can functionally alter cytokine production across immune cells. In general, consistent with sequencing data, the features demonstrate monocyte inflammatory function coupled to impaired T cell and NK cell functionality in simulated microgravity. Thus, changes in cytokine signaling observed in simulated microgravity may occur at least in part to changes in upstream cytokine production. Reversing simulated microgravity effects on the immune system We have characterized multiple genes and pathways altered by simulated microgravity in the immune system; however, whether there are specific drugs or supplements that can directly target microgravity effects on immune cells is poorly characterized. Thus, we have utilized an in-house compound-gene interactome machine learning technology (Gene Compound Enrichment Analysis, GCEA), building on the HyperFoods model32, for the identification of drugs and food supplements that significantly map to altered genes in a dataset. Overall, our pipeline assesses >2 million interactions between genes, drugs, and foods, across DrugBank, LINCS, and FoodDB32 (Fig. 7A). Using these algorithms across our core signature of 375 DEGs altered by simulated microgravity across the immune system, we identified 115 compounds with adj p < 0.05, and 474 compounds with p < 0.05 that significantly map to our signature (Fig. 7B and Supplementary Data 17). Figure 7B shows the top 50 most significantly overlapping compounds to enriched DEGs. We next chose one compound, quercetin, based on its widespread availability for future travelers to space, and for its prominence as an anti-aging supplement, to validate whether it can reverse transcriptional insults of microgravity on the immune system. PBMCs (donors from the Fig. 5A cohort) were subjected to 25 hours in simulated microgravity, with or without quercetin (50 μM), for bulk RNA-seq analysis. Fig. 7. Reversing simulated microgravity effects on the immune system with quercetin. Open in a new tab A Pipeline of microgravity and gene interacting compounds from discovery to validation. B Heatmap of top 50 simulated uG altered gene to compound interaction candidates. Compounds are listed on the right, and the predicted interacting genes are listed at the bottom. The color indicates the STITCH confidence score for compound-gene interaction. C Quercetin (50 μM) reverses the core gene expression signatures in simulated uG (25 hours). Log2FC levels of 106 core DEGs from simulated uG vs. 1G are plotted side-by-side to quercetin-treated uG vs. 1G in the heatmap. Red indicates positive log2FC, and blue indicates negative log2FC. 70% of the genes are reversed after quercetin treatment. The scatter plot below shows a negative association (Pearson correlation R = −0.35, p < 0.001) between the log2FC levels of the 106 core genes from simulated uG vs. 1G and quercetin-treated uG vs. 1G. D Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) shows the reversal effect of quercetin on the 106 core DEGs plotted in C heatmap. Quercetin treatment inverts the enrichment score (ES) in the upregulated core genes (from 0.8 to −0.64) and increases the ES of the downregulated core genes (from −0.75 to −0.55). All p values are <0.0001. E IPA Canonical pathways altered by quercetin. Heatmap plots the comparison of quercetin-treated samples against non-treated bulk RNA-seq controls, single-cell TLR7/8 agonist stimulated and unstimulated samples, and GLDS-420 mouse spleens in space. Red indicates a predicted activation in pathways, whereas blue indicates a predicted inhibition in pathways. The datasets were clustered by quercetin treatment into 2 major groups via complete linkage hierarchical clustering method. F Quercetin reduces senescence and age-associated inflammatory gene outputs. Both SenMayo scores and iAge index are reduced in the quercetin-treated group with p value of 0.0746 and 0.0268 respectively. Compared with the untreated group, quercetin downregulates more senescence-related and age-associated inflammatory genes (from ↓48.8% to ↓63.2%). n = 6, donors were 3 males (age 37, 22, 32 years old) and 3 females (age 27, 26, 40 years old). Two-tailed paired t test, *p ≤ 0.05. G Quercetin (25 hours treatment) reduces ROS levels measured by 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) assay. n = 6 for 1G vs uG, donors were males (32, 37, and 38 years old) and females (34, 32, 37 years old). 34 yrs and 32 yrs female samples were not treated with quercetin, resulting in n = 4 for comparisons between 1G vs 1G+Quercetin and uG vs uG+ Quercetin. Two-tailed paired parametric t test was used, *p ≤ 0.05. Data are plotted as mean ± SEM and source data are provided with the paper.Remarkably, at the gene level, quercetin reversed the direction of expression of 70% (74/106) of the 106 genes (Fig. 5C) core signature generated as significantly overlapping genes between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq validation (Fig. 7C). Reversal of gene expression was significant by correlation analysis (Fig. 7C) and demonstrated by GSEA enrichment plot (Fig. 7D). IPA pathway analysis was then performed to characterize pathways altered by quercetin, and compared against non-treated bulk RNA-seq controls, as well as pathways altered across our other 3 major datasets, including single-cell sequencing and GLDS-420 spleens in space. Overall, pathway analysis across all datasets showed consistent impacts of simulated and actual microgravity on pathways essential for optimal immunity (Fig. 7E, Supplementary Data 18). Some of the most consistently induced pathways in simulated microgravity and/or space included “coronavirus pathogenesis pathway” (linked to innate immune activation), acute phase responses, leukocyte extravasation signaling, IL-6 signaling, BAG2 signaling (linked to heat-shock proteins and proteostasis), sirtuin signaling, and to a lesser extent “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho”, RAC signaling, PKA signaling, and oxidative stress response. Major pathways attenuated by microgravity were linked to immunity, including antimicrobial immunity, pyroptosis signaling, as well as “interferon signaling” (including PKR in IFN induction). Other reduced pathways across most datasets included reduced nuclear receptor activation (including LXR/RXR, PPAR, AHR) and reduced T cell NUR77 (activation) signaling. Interestingly, we noted some genes were consistently reduced across all datasets, though were not properly represented in pathway analysis. The most striking of these genes is rbm3, a cold-shock protein, which was significantly reduced in all four of the microgravity datasets, as well as in the I4 and JAXA mission (30-day timepoint). Rbm3 was also reduced in the Twins study inflight data across all sorted immune cells, though not reaching significance. Administration of quercetin in simulated microgravity could reverse many of the altered transcriptional signatures elicited by simulated microgravity on the immune system (Fig. 7E). Some of the major pathways it could reverse include “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho”, leukocyte extravasation signaling, RAC signaling, LXR/RXR, PPAR signaling, NUR77 signaling in T cells, “coronavirus pathogenesis” (innate immunity), acute phase response, fibrosis, IL-6 signaling, amongst others. Though quercetin has gained prominence for its senolytic properties33, our results show that reducing senescence pathways was only one of many (approximately 174) pathway effects this compound has on immune cells in simulated microgravity (Supplementary Data 18). Nonetheless, in simulated microgravity, quercetin could reduce senescence and age-associated inflammatory gene outputs, as demonstrated by reductions in both the SenMayo and iAge index scores (Fig. 7F). These changes occurred for the most part by downregulating inflammatory genes. Despite the marked transcriptional reversal in simulated microgravity observed with one compound, quercetin failed to reverse reductions in interferon signaling, a major hallmark of microgravity on immune system dysfunction from our data. Other studies have also linked microgravity and spaceflight to mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production10,34,35. In this regard, quercetin also showed a robust capacity to reduce ROS levels after 25 hours of simulated microgravity (Fig. 7G), though ROS was only marginally increased as a trend by simulated microgravity itself after 25 hours, likely due to the expression of endogenous antioxidant systems at this timepoint34. Consistently, we also observed increased oxidative stress responses, such as NRF2-mediated or sirtuin signaling in many of our transcriptomic datasets by IPA analysis (Fig. 7E).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Immune dysfunction during spaceflight is an important health risk, and manifests primarily as increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections, including latent viral reactivation3. Latent viruses can reactivate on both short- and long-term spaceflights, and commonly involve herpes viruses (HSV1, EBV, CMV, VZV)12–15. Astronauts also experience heightened skin sensitivity reactions3,13,36, and this mechanism was thought to be related to a possible Type 2 immune bias in space7,16,36. Recent work in simulated microgravity has also shown reduced JAK/STAT signaling in CD8+ T cells, coupled to increased pSTAT5 signaling in Tregs. Despite these important advances, major mechanisms explaining these phenotypes of immune dysfunction, in simulated microgravity have remained unclear. We have identified numerous core pathways and genes altered across human immune cells in simulated microgravity, with validation against datasets of humans in LEO, as well as spleens from mice flow on the ISS. Overall, we noted changes consistent with basal innate immune cell inflammatory changes in simulated microgravity, coupled with distinct pathways of dysfunction in multiple immune cells. Specifically, the most consistently reproduced pathways impacted by simulated microgravity across immune cells in both single-cell and validation cohorts included changes to pathways and signaling linked to acute phase response signaling, Coronavirus pathogenesis, IL-6 signaling, the cytoskeleton, interferon response, pyroptosis, heat-shock, nuclear receptors, and sirtuin biology. The link between the cytoskeleton and other pathways here may be especially relevant in immune dysfunction. Cytoskeleton dynamics are controlled by a number of factors, but small GTPases, including Ras homology (Rho) GTPases, are major orchestrators with critical impact on immune cell function, migration, gene expression, trafficking, phagocytosis, proliferation, and antigen recognition31. Of note, Rho GTPases have been implicated in response to simulated microgravity in other cell types, but this connection is understudied in immune cells37. Across most datasets, we saw changes to Rho GTPase signaling, including individually in RAC, RHOA, or CDC42 signaling, or combined in a global “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho” pathway in IPA. While we did notice some variability between our initial unstimulated vs stimulated single-cell data in these pathways, these pathways tended to show reduced RHOA signaling without stimulation, coupled with increased RAC signaling, analogous to what we observed from the I4 crew members upon landing. The JAXA6 dataset also demonstrated cdc42 to be the most significantly induced cell-free transcript in astronauts after 30 days in space. Pathways strongly linked to cytoskeletal remodeling, such as leukocyte extravasation, were also typically induced in most of our datasets. We also observed changes in some active Rho GTPases by G-LISA, as well as in F-actin granularity, variance, 3D surface area, sphericity, actin protrusion length, and dynamic change to TLR stimulation by super-resolution microscopy, providing further evidence for changes in actin, including possibly immune cytoskeleton alteration or dysfunction, in simulated microgravity. Importantly, changes to the actin cytoskeleton are now being linked to the ability of an immune cell to mount an interferon response. Indeed, danger-sensing molecules like TLRs utilize Rho GTPases to facilitate IFN responses38,39, or antiviral sensors can directly modulate actin rearrangement40. One example is the PKR antiviral response, which was consistently downregulated by simulated microgravity in our datasets. In this system, PKR binds gelsolin to enforce basal innate immune defense, though upon viral sensing, PKR dissociates from gelsolin, leading to the severing of actin, and activation of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)s signaling and interferon response41. Other antiviral sensors like RIG-I directly bind F-actin in resting cells, and then relocalize to the mitochondria via actin rearrangements on viral infection, to induce type 1 IFN42,43. In single-cell data, reduced interferon signaling without stimulation was seen mainly in monocytes, linking it to innate immunity, though with TLR7/8 stimulation, reduced interferon signaling was seen across many cells, including most T cell subsets, and NK cells, displaying the broad importance of this pathway across most immune cells to microgravity. In simulated microgravity, we saw reduced IFNα production by ELISA with stimulation, so we cannot rule out the possibility that the reduced IFN signaling seen in simulated microgravity starts with reduced capacity for IFN production in some conditions, in addition to potential defects in downstream signaling itself. While we have focused on type 1 IFN signaling, some reduced interferon responses are also linked to reduced signaling from the IFN gamma receptor (IFNGR). Consistently, we also noted reduced IFNγ production in simulated microgravity upon TLR7/8 stimulation. Whether the cytoskeleton is needed for IFNGR clustering and signaling remains to be seen44. Consistent with reduced interferon signaling in simulated microgravity, we noticed a reduction in some IFN-inducible GTPase superfamily genes, namely guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) across our datasets. Various GBPs (e.g., gbp5) were reduced as well in the Twins study. Interestingly, GBPs, which are heavily induced by IFNγ signaling, have been shown to be critical in maintaining responses to mycobacterium tuberculosis45,46, and we see reactivation of similar bacteria (in addition to some retroviruses) in simulated microgravity after as little as 25 hours of exposure. GBPs and associated IFN responses also help direct inflammasome activation and pyroptosis (an inflammatory form of cell death) linked to antimicrobial defense that was consistently down in monocytes and B cells in simulated microgravity, and in nearly all immune cells in response to TLR7/8 stimulation in simulated microgravity46,47. Interestingly, pyroptosis and inflammasome activation can also be directly controlled by Rho GTPases and the cytoskeleton48,49. Another pathway found consistently down across datasets included LXR signaling. Interestingly, LXR signaling also can promote antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Macrophage LXR has been shown to reduce bacterial infection by reducing intracellular NAD+ in a CD38 manner, with mechanistic impacts on the cytoskeleton50. Whether NAD+ levels fall in microgravity remains to be seen, though we did see an interesting increase in sirtuin signaling across datasets, including in the I4 mission. Sirtuins may be functioning to counter acute oxidative stress in microgravity34,51. We also saw reduced oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional signatures across all unstimulated immune cells in simulated microgravity. Altered metabolite levels (and possibly ROS) from impaired oxidative phosphorylation might also contribute to HIF1α stabilization52 as observed in some of our simulated microgravity and spaceflight datasets. Reduced oxidative phosphorylation can be associated with increased glycolysis in immune cells53, fueling “M1-like” pro-inflammatory changes in macrophages, potentiating NF-κb signaling, acute responses and IL-6 or IL-1 release, cytokines frequently induced in microgravity. Consistently, we did notice a preferential enrichment of predicted “macrophage classical activation” signatures across our gene sets in the Twins study. Interestingly, we noted frequent increases in heat-shock genes, coupled to increased associated BAG signaling pathways across antigen-presenting cells (monocytes, B cells, and DCs), as well as in double negative T cells. Heat-shock expression may be reflective of altered proteostasis in simulated microgravity10, and may be required for adaptation to mechanical unloading in some cells34, though this may also be linked to higher temperatures. Across all gene sets, we noticed a reduction in the cold shock gene, rbm3, which was reduced in nearly all immune cells in our single-cell data. Increased heat-shock coupled with reduced cold shock genes raises the possibility of higher intracellular temperatures directly induced by microgravity, but whether microgravity, or associated increase in cytokines or binding partners such as IL-1ra, directly induce the observed “space fever” in astronauts requires further insight54. Interestingly, we did notice a number of significant IL-1 ligands in innate cell to T cell interactions in our microgravity Interactome, highlighting the possible importance of this cytokine family and downstream interacting molecules. Pertaining the aforementioned skin lesions in astronauts, it has been postulated that persistent skin hypersensitivity reactions in some crew members may be linked to allergic responses7,16. While analysis of our datasets cannot rule out this possibility, we did not observe increased Th2 signatures across our simulated microgravity systems, or with our specific gene sets validated across the I4 mission. We also saw inconsistent changes to IL-23 and IL-17 signaling across our datasets, though these cytokines are known contributors to skin disease55. While the root causes of such lesions cannot be inferred from our data analysis, it likely involves changes in the crosstalk with the skin microbiome, in addition to intrinsic immune cell abnormalities. Interestingly, we did see reduced aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling in most of our datasets, especially in CD14 monocytes and conventional type 2 dendritic cells, raising the idea of reduced AHR signaling in space to contribute to skin lesions56,57. However, we saw AHR signaling was enriched in the Twins study gene set result and so more experimentation is needed to tease out a possible role for the AHR in astronaut skin lesions. Using in house machine learning algorithms, we identified numerous compounds mapping to microgravity’s transcriptional response to the immune system. This algorithm focuses on the strength of interaction and does not specify direction. However, we tested one of the most significantly interacting compounds, the flavonol, quercetin, for its ability to reverse transcriptional changes to simulated microgravity on the immune system, and found that it could reverse approximately 70% of altered core genes. Of note, quercetin reversed numerous pathways, including core pathways such as reduced nuclear receptor activation, sirtuin signaling, Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway, associated acute phase responses and IL-6 signaling. Quercetin also showed impact on the cytoskeleton, favoring a freezing of pathways linked to its mobility in microgravity, by reducing genes associated with Rho GTPase signaling (e.g., reducing RAC, RHOA and CDC42 signaling), and boosting RHOGDI signaling. Despite these changes, quercetin was unable to revert the core immunosuppression pathway of reduced interferon responses. However, since actin skeleton mobility is needed to induce an IFN response in many instances40, too much interference could contribute to a persistent lack of IFN signaling here, and might represent a further mechanism of immune suppression mediated by quercetin that requires more study. Interestingly, after 25 hours in simulated microgravity, we saw variable results on the induction of senescence pathways, though quercetin markedly reduced senescence associated transcripts in our data. Thus, while quercetin acts in part through its senotherapeutic mechanisms32, the large breadth of additional other pathways suggests multiple beneficial modes of activity for immune modulation in microgravity. Our data support a hypothetical model where microgravity alters forces sensed by immune cells, leading to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, and nuclear receptor signaling, coupled to changes in core pathways in space such as mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Recent work in other cells, such as endothelial cells, has identified cytoskeletal abnormalities as a key feature of simulated microgravity that drives autophagy and a reduction in mitochondrial mass after 72 hours of exposure35. Our datasets would support some of these findings. Combined, these pathways would contribute to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and associated basal inflammatory processes, as well as reduced viral sensing pathways, associated reduced interferon responses and altered pyroptosis capability. Reduced interferon responses and signaling, impact both innate cells like monocytes and NK cells, as well as adaptive cells like T cells. Such changes could cumulate in viral or mycobacterial reactivation in microgravity. These processes would also be complemented by the psychological and physiological stresses of spaceflight, which also may independently associate with viral reactivation12,14,58. Thus, an important future direction of research is to address whether altered cytoskeleton, or associated reductions in interferon related gene products, including GBPs, are actively driving the reactivation of mycobacteria and latent viruses that we see in simulated microgravity. Another related important avenue of future research is to better understand how changes to force action on immune cells link to the mitochondria dysfunction hallmark of spaceflight and metabolic alterations, and to map such changes to immune cell metabolism as has been done to other mechanical forces19,59. Moreover, the immune system in spaceflight is also under the influence of changing pressure gradients, such as increased pressures in parts of the upper body60, coupled to lower central venous pressure and potentially altered shear force61–63. These changes may also contribute to altered immune function, including the increased IL-1 and IL-6, two cytokines sensitive to external force cues, seen in spaceflight, with potential for intersecting signaling nodes across mechanotransduction and other pathways such as mitochondrial dysfunction within immune cells19. More work is needed to understand how these additional changes in force impact innate and adaptive immunity during spaceflight and how they interact with the effects of microgravity. Finally, despite the multiple proposed mechanisms resulting from this study, much of it was produced using simulated microgravity as a model system, which has its own caveats18, though we did identify core reproduced pathways from spleens in mice on the ISS and some overlap with the I4 mission and Twins study. Further studies applying single cell-omic technologies to immune cells during in-flight missions will no doubt provide answers to refine the proposed mechanisms of immune dysfunction in space. As well, integrating more in-depth chromatin and analytical approaches, such as ATAC-seq, can help detail the regulatory changes that might be underlying these immune phenotypes64. Overall, our current work provides a resource to better understand “astroimmunology”, in particular how and why the immune system changes in simulated microgravity and spaceflight. These results also provide opportunities to develop countermeasures that will help normalize immune cell function in microgravity and spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166937 PMID: 38862487 Abstract Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space. Subject terms: Adaptive immunity, Innate immunity, Gene regulation in immune cells, Space physics The phenotype and function of immune cells could change during spaceflight. Here the authors use simulated microgravity, coupled to validation with spaceflight data, to assess whether there are distinct gene expression changes in resting and TLR 7/8 stimulated PBMCs and found conserved changes in IFN signalling, the cytoskeleton, IL-6 and sirtuin signalling.Introduction Astronauts in low earth orbit (LEO), such as on the international space station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction associated with the microgravity environment. Multiple studies have described immune dysregulation in short or long-term simulated1–4 or actual microgravity5–9. For the most part, such studies have described impaired T-cell responses, coupled with some form of heightened innate immunity7,10, though some innate immune cells, like natural killer (NK) cells, also show impaired function11. Consistent with altered adaptive immunity, potentially due to impaired cytotoxic and Th1 T cell function, and reduced NK cell function, astronauts develop increased reactivation of latent viruses, including herpes viruses (EBV, CMV, VZV)3,7,12–15. In one study, viral shedding after 9–14 days of spaceflight was linked to changes in serum cytokines, including a preferential large increase in IL-4 compared to interferon (IFN)γ, indicating a possible shift away from Th1 immunity towards Th2 immunity16. Consistently, some astronauts report heightened hypersensitivity reactions, such as increased allergic and Th2-like responses in space7. Multiple studies using higher throughput approaches have started to add insight into pathways impacted by spaceflight. In the Twins study17, a one-year ISS mission altered innate, adaptive, and NK cell-mediated immunity across bulk RNA sequencing analysis. In T cells, increases in DNA methylation were seen in the promoters of notch3 for CD4+ T cells, linked to T cell differentiation, and in scl1a5/asct2, linked to activation, for CD8+ T cells. A total of 50 of 62 assayed cytokines were also altered by spaceflight or landing17. During a recent multi-omic analysis, including bulk RNA and DNA methylation sequencing, of astronauts and mice in space, mouse organs such as the liver and kidney demonstrated reduced IFN signatures, coupled to altered methylation patterns of these gene sets, while muscles had increased IFNγ, IL-1, and TNF10. Serum inflammatory markers from 59 astronauts in this study (and in a similar companion study) showed increased VEGF-1, IGF-1, and IL-1 during spaceflight, which resolved upon returning to Earth4,10. This same study also identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a major response of different non-hematolymphoid tissues to spaceflight10. More recently, another study using a NASA-developed Rotating Wall Vessel, which was employed in our current work, utilized a 41-parameter mass cytometry approach to show that short-term (18–22 hours) simulated microgravity can dampen NK cell, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell responses to Concanavalin A/anti-CD28 stimulation, but potentiates STAT5 signaling to boost Tregs18. Despite these important advances, the core fundamental mechanisms, genes, and pathways that are directly altered by microgravity to adversely impact immunity, including at single-cell resolution, are largely unknown. Interestingly, mechanical forces are emerging as critical orchestrators of immune cell function, whereby mechanotransduction tunes immune cell responsiveness to danger signals19. Some of these effects occur through environmental modulation of mechanosensing pathways that alter ion currents in cells, metabolism, or directly act on the cytoskeleton19. Thus, a spaceflight environment, which alters forces such as gravity, associated hydrostatic pressure, and shear force20,21 onto immune cells likely directly contributes to immune system dysfunction. Here, using a common ground-based analog, the NASA developed low shear modeled microgravity Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)2,18,22, we examine in depth how short-term (25 hours) exposure to simulated microgravity impacts the human peripheral blood mononuclear immune system in detail at single-cell resolution. Combining this data with validation experiments from mice and crewmembers in LEO, as well as machine learning algorithms, we identify numerous core genes and pathways in immune cells that are altered by simulated microgravity or spaceflight, and identify numerous potential compounds that directly map onto immune cell transcriptional signatures in simulated microgravity.Results Simulated microgravity alters the transcriptional landscape of individual immune cells To begin understanding how simulated microgravity impacts immune cell function, we loaded PBMC samples from two young healthy CMV+ donors, one male, and one female, into either RWV simulated microgravity (uG) or normal gravity (1G) static controls for 16 hours of conditioning. The 16-hour-conditioning time point was chosen based on prior work that used approximately the same time and tracked transcriptional or proteomic changes on immune cells to simulated microgravity1,18. PBMCs were either left unstimulated or stimulated for an additional 9 hours with R848, a standard TLR7/8 agonist. We chose TLR7/8 as a putative target since it mimics viral infection, and is expressed on most human immune cells, including T cells23. Using this methodology, we next developed a single-cell atlas of 55,648 human PBMCs exposed to these conditions. In the unstimulated state, after 25 hours of simulated microgravity, we identified 28 clusters of immune cells visualized by UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), including cell types such as mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells), double negative T cells, γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which have rarely been studied in simulated microgravity (Fig. 1A). Simulated microgravity altered proportions of immune cell clusters to a mild extent, with B intermediate cells, and MAIT cell proportions being most negatively impacted, and CD14+ monocytes, and CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cells being most increased based on percent change (Fig. 1B). Across all immune populations, simulated microgravity altered expression of over 4500 genes with adj P cutoff of <0.05 (Supplementary Data 1). This list was refined to a core list of ~375 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with an additional cutoff of |log2FC|> 0.1. This list was further condensed to visualize on a Volcano plot with |log2FC|> 0.25 (Fig. 1C), showing only the very top positively and negatively altered genes. Volcano plots of DEGs for individual immune cell clusters are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Across all immune cells, some of the most induced genes in simulated microgravity included acute response genes such as s100a8, s100a9, s100a12, thbs1, heat-shock genes such hsp90ab1, chemokines like ccl2, ccl4, iron storage genes (fth1, ftl), and matrix metalloproteinases (mmp9). The most reduced genes in simulated microgravity included interferon response (stat1) and associated guanylate binding proteins (gbp1), and cold shock genes (rbm3, cirbp). Expression of the top DEGs (with mitochondrial encoded genes excluded for visual simplicity) across 22 populations of immune cells are shown in Fig. 1D. CD14+ classical monocytes, CD16+ nonclassical monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells exhibited the most pronounced changes across major gene sets, consistent with short term simulated microgravity’s direct effect at reprogramming transcriptional changes most prominently in innate immunity. Consistently, using single-cell trajectory analysis, we identify numerous trajectories mainly in the innate immune cell clusters, especially the monocyte cluster, in response to simulated microgravity. Trajectory analysis is used to construct a path that describes how cells move through different states, and the numerous states seen in the monocyte cluster in simulated microgravity may reflect an increased capacity to generate distinct transcriptional states to simulated microgravity (Fig. 1E).

Spot size shows the level of significance via −log10 (adj. p). Adj. p was calculated by the Fisher’s Exact Test (right-tailed) followed by B-H adjustment.Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (Fig. 1F, Supplementary Data 2) generated using our core list of 375 genes from the overall populations, as well as the DEGs in major immune cell types (Supplementary Data 3) revealed that monocytes, conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2)s, double negative (dn)T cells and NK cells show the most notable pathway alterations. Major pathways altered by simulated microgravity across immune cells included reductions in oxidative phosphorylation, interferon signaling like protein kinase R (PKR) in interferon response, nuclear receptor signaling (LXR/RXR, PPAR, AHR), RHOA and pyroptosis signaling, as well as increases in BAG2 (heat-shock protein 70 interactor) signaling, fibrosis signaling, actin-based motility, RAC, HIF1 signaling, acute phase response, oxidative stress and sirtuin signaling, amongst others. Given that multiple pathways we detected were associated with inflammatory processes linked to aging (i.e., increased innate immunity coupled to reduced adaptive immunity), we next determined whether acute exposure to simulated microgravity mimicked inflammatory aging processes in immune cells. We mapped the gene expression signatures of individual immune cells, and overall immune signatures, against two recently developed inflammatory signatures of aging, the inflammatory age (iAge) clock24, and the SenMayo list of senescence associated secretory inflammatory products25. Simulated microgravity induced a significant enrichment in inflammaging related genes, consistent with the notion that short term simulated microgravity can induce aging-like inflammatory changes in unstimulated immune cells (Fig. 2A, B, Supplementary Fig. 2A). Next, because both spaceflight and aging are associated with reactivation of latent viruses, we mined the meta-transcriptome of our single-cell analysis with meta-transcriptome detector (MTD) pipeline26. Surprisingly, we saw that as little as 25 hours of simulated microgravity could induce the transcription of latent retroviruses and mycobacteria within human immune cells (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Figs. 2B, C and 3), directly implicating microgravity itself as a contributing trigger for latent pathogen activation. We confirmed the meta-transcriptome results with a different alignment tool, and we could still detect increases in Gammaretrovirus and Mycobacterium canettii transcripts seen with MTD pipeline (Supplementary Fig. 2B, C).

(D to F) NicheNet predicted significant ligand-receptor interaction between total T cells (Receiver) and the antigen-presenting cells (Sender) as D B cells, E DCs, and F monocytes in uG vs 1G condition (i.e., induced in uG over 1G).Finally, as we identified strong changes in gene expression pathways linked to innate cells, including those with the capacity to present antigen, we leveraged this knowledge to utilize NicheNet27 algorithms to generate a comprehensive predicted ligand:receptor interactome map of human antigen-presenting cells (APCs, plus plasmacytoid dendritic cells) and T cells in simulated microgravity vs 1G (Fig. 2D–F). Across APC donors and recipient T cells, we identified numerous significantly predicted ligand-receptor interactions to be elevated in simulated microgravity vs 1G. For instance, monocytes and dendritic cells induced IL-1 proteins while some B cells provided IL-23A, and IL-7. All APCs provided unique chemokine signals to T cells. Mmp9, ccl2, and thbs1 were amongst our most significantly induced genes in simulated microgravity, and the products of these genes show differential predicted receptor expression (e.g., CD44, CD47, ITGB1, CCR4, CCR5) in T cells (Supplementary Figs. 4–6) but all show predicted enhanced target gene expression in T cells. Thus, while simulated microgravity itself likely induces direct transcriptional changes in immune cells, we cannot exclude local paracrine effects of secreted products from one immune cell to another also contributing to our overall gene expression and pathway changes. After stimulating PBMCs with a TLR7/8 agonist in 1G and simulated microgravity, we characterized 23 clusters of immune cells by UMAP (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the unstimulated conditions, stimulation with a TLR7/8 agonist induced a robust preferential expansion of CD4+ central memory (TCM) cells (Fig. 3B). The microgravity itself impacted differential response to stimulation. Consistent with previous reports, simulated microgravity dampened expansion/responses of NK cells, and CD8+ TEM cells to a lesser extent in the donors examined18, as well as MAIT cell numbers, a cell type with previously unknown responses to microgravity. Simulated microgravity drove a preferential increase in CD14+ monocytes over 1G controls, indicating that this cell type is especially sensitive to the combination of simulated microgravity and TLR7/8 activation.

Adj. p was calculated by the Fisher’s Exact Test (right-tailed) followed by B-H adjustment.Across all cell types, the combination of simulated microgravity and TLR7/8 stimulation altered the expression of over 9000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with adj P cutoff of <0.05 (Supplementary Data 4). As with the unstimulated data, we refined this list to a core gene list of ~317 DEGs based on |log2FC| of >0.2. This list was further reduced to visualize on a Volcano plot with |log2FC|>0.25 (Fig. 3C), showing only the most positively and negatively altered genes. Some of the most induced genes by simulated microgravity over 1G in response to TLR7/8 agonist included cytokines and chemokines, such as ccl8, ccl4, ccl7, cxcl8, and il1b, and acute response proteins like s100a8, s100a9, s100a11, and thbs1. Additional genes induced in simulated microgravity were linked to tryptophan breakdown (ido1), mitochondrial antioxidant defense (sod2), the cytoskeleton (rhoq), and iron storage genes like fth1, ftl. The most downregulated genes when comparing simulated microgravity to 1G during TLR7/8 stimulation, included genes belonging to guanylate binding proteins (gbp1, gbp2, gbp4, gbp5), which were the most reduced set of genes by fold change and adj P, as well as interferon pathway genes, like irf1, stat1, isg20, ifi16, cold shock genes (rbm3, cirbp), cell killing genes (prf1, gzmb) and T/NK cell activation markers like cd69. Many of these genes were consistently altered by simulated microgravity alone without stimulation, indicating a conserved response, even in the setting of additional exogenous stimulation with a TLR ligand. Expression of top DEGs across 19 populations of immune cells is shown in Fig. 3D. Volcano plots of DEGs for individual immune cell clusters are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. CD14+ monocytes, NK cells, CD8+ TEM, and CD4+ TCM cells showed the most significant changes in the top most altered genes induced by TLR7/8 agonist stimulation in simulated microgravity. Interestingly, using single-cell trajectory analysis (Fig. 3E), we identified fewer trajectories in simulated microgravity stimulated with TLR7/8 compared to the 1G control. These findings suggest that under simulated microgravity, cells display reduced differentiation states in response to stimulation. IPA results (Fig. 3F, Supplementary Data 5) generated using our core list of approximately 317 genes from the overall populations, as well as the DEGs in major immune cell types (Supplementary Data 6) demonstrated that nearly all immune cells show changes across numerous pathways during microgravity and TLR7/8 induction. Major pathways reduced across most immune cells in simulated microgravity included PKR in interferon response (and associated eif2 signaling), interferon signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, pyroptosis signaling, cytotoxic T cell mediated killing of target cells and death receptor signaling. Major pathways induced by short term simulated microgravity included sirtuin signaling, fibrosis signaling, signaling by Rho GTPases, BAG2 (heat-shock protein 70 interactor) signaling, HIF1α signaling, acute phase response and associated HMGB1 signaling, amongst others. These pathways are consistent with microgravity facilitating innate like inflammation at the expense of interferon driven adaptive immunity and adaptive immune effector function (e.g., CD8+ T cell killing). Despite some similarities in pathways altered to simulated microgravity alone (Fig. 1F), we actually detected a lower iAge score globally across all immune populations in simulated microgravity plus TLR7/8 compared to 1G controls (Fig. 4A). While the reason for this finding is unclear, it appears to have been driven by a highly significant reduction in score by naive B cells, naive CD4+ T cells, and reductions in lesser studied PBMC populations, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC)s and double negative T cells. Lower iAge also could be reflective of altered immune activation in simulated microgravity, such as seen in CD16+ monocytes (Fig. 4A, right panel). Despite a reduction in iAge, we still observed an increased SenMayo score in simulated PBMCs (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. 8), illustrating different compositions of genes in these two gene sets. Fig. 4. Simulated microgravity induces predictive functional alterations in immune cells following TLR7/8 stimulation.

C–E NicheNet predicted significant ligand-receptor interaction between total T cells (Receiver) and the antigen-presenting cells (Sender) as C B cells, D DCs, and E monocytes in TLR7/8 agonist activated simulated uG vs 1G condition (i.e., induced in uG over 1G).NicheNet analysis across major APC types to T cells post TLR7/8 agonist in simulated microgravity vs 1G (Fig. 4C–E, and Supplementary Figs. 9–11) illustrated some of the significant cytokines, chemokines, surface molecule ligands and receptors used in simulated microgravity upon TLR7/8 stimulation. Compared to the unstimulated interactome (Fig. 2D–F), we saw increased production and diversity of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines used. We again noted IL-1 produced in APCs, but also noted increased TNF superfamily products like TNF, TNFSF12 (TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis, TWEAK) and TNFSF15 (vascular endothelial growth inhibitor, VEGI), and lymphotoxin (LTA) preferentially produced to modulate T cell function. Next, we assessed the differential responsiveness of immune cells to TLR7/8 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Data 7). Under 1G conditions, stimulation led to a marked induction of CD4+ TCM, at the expense of CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ naive T cells, coupled to an expected pronounced inflammatory gene signature, including marked induction of interferon inducible genes, gbp transcripts, and chemokines across most immune cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 12A–E). Under simulated microgravity, TLR7/8 stimulation also induced CD4+ TCM, at the expense of naive CD4+ T cells, though proportions of CD14+ monocyte populations did not reduce as seen in 1G (Supplementary Fig. 12F, G). In simulated microgravity, TLR7/8 stimulation also induced a robust expression of inflammatory genes, including interferon inducing genes across most cell types (Supplementary Fig. 12H–J). Next, to determine the sensitivity of individual immune cell populations to TLR7/8 agonist in 1G vs simulated microgravity, we compared the differences in responsiveness to stimulation. We subtracted the fold change induction in 1G from induction in simulated microgravity to determine sensitivity to stimulation. Remarkably, across overall immune cells, we see a pattern of reduced responsiveness to TLR7/8 simulation in simulated microgravity to most of the highest genes induced at 1G (Supplementary Fig. 13A), with T cells and NK cells showing the most reduced inflammatory gene induction. T cells, NK cells, and overall across all cells exhibited blunting of induction of numerous genes in interferon signaling, and gbp genes in simulated microgravity in response to TLR7/8 agonist. Interestingly, monocytes tended to maintain such responses better in simulated microgravity, consistent with their predisposition to some inflammatory pathways in simulated microgravity. Some chemokines, such as ccl3, ccl4, ccl8, and cxcl10 appeared to be induced better in simulated uG across overall immune cell populations, though monocytes actually showed reduced induction of some of these chemokines, likely due to their capacity to produce them in simulated microgravity without stimulation (Fig. 1D). Nonetheless, the overall effects in sensitivity to stimulation in the “overall” category of immune cells largely followed the same pattern seen in the total magnitude of response of stimulated microgravity vs stimulated 1G (Fig. 3D). Next, we sought to identify genes uniquely altered by simulated microgravity irrespective of stimulation, as well as genes unique to microgravity under stimulation. First, to identify unique genes, regardless of stimulation, altered by simulated microgravity, we plotted out the most significant DEGs by the absolute sum of fold change under both stimulated and unstimulated conditions (Supplementary Fig. 13B, Supplementary Data 8). Across overall immune cells, regardless of stimulation, we still identified conserved increases in chemokines and acute response factors, coupled to reduced gbp expression and other interferon genes (e.g., irf1, stat1) imparted by simulated microgravity. Next, we mapped out the overall overlap of gene signatures and common genes between post-stimulation in 1G vs simulated microgravity (Supplementary Fig. 13C–E and Supplementary Data 9), and found that microgravity imparts a number of unique genes to TLR ligation that are not seen in 1G. Overall, these findings identify core-conserved DEGs specifically sensitive to simulated microgravity as well as unique signatures to simulated microgravity. Finally, we assessed if sex plays a role in the magnitude of response to simulated microgravity. In the unstimulated state, female cells showed only slightly more DEGs induced, while the male cells had slightly more genes reduced (Supplementary Fig. 14A). Male NK cells and monocytes were more sensitive to microgravity while female B cells showed more sensitivity than male B cells. Upon stimulation, male cells overall were more sensitive to simulated microgravity, especially in having more downregulated DEGs (Supplementary Fig. 14B). Volcano plots of DEGs across all cell types between the female and male are shown in Supplementary Fig. 14C–F and Supplementary Data 10. In both male and female cells, acute phase response and inflammatory genes like mmp9, ccl2, s100a8, and thbs1 were among the most induced genes, while reduced interferon regulators like stat1 and reduced cold shock genes like rbm3 and cirbp were consistently downregulated in both sexes in simulated microgravity. Upon stimulation, both sexes again show increases in the total magnitude of acute inflammatory, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related, and acute phase genes like chemokines, thbs1, mmp9, ncf1, and sod2 in simulated microgravity coupled to reduced interferon, gbps, cold shock, and some ribosomal protein genes in simulated microgravity. Many of these changes are reflected in IPA pathway analysis by sex (Supplementary Fig. 14G) and many of these core features were also conserved when data from sexes were pooled (Figs. 1F, 3F).Single-cell validation identifies core features of immune dysfunction in microgravity and spaceflight Next, to better validate conserved genes and pathways from our single-cell signatures without TLR7/8 agonist in simulated microgravity, we compared our core signature of 375 DEGs against additional datasets. First, we repeated experiments in a validation cohort of freshly isolated PBMCs from young donors (n = 6, age range 20–46), and spun these PBMCs for 25 hours, prior to performing bulk RNA-seq analysis. Using CIBERSORTx28, we first mapped predicted changes in population frequency and were able to confirm increased CD14+ monocyte frequencies in simulated microgravity, consistent with our single-cell data (Supplementary Fig. 15, Supplementary Data 11). Between validation samples spun in simulated microgravity vs 1G controls, we identified 2149 genes differentially expressed (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Data 12). Despite the variability of data inherent to bulk RNA-seq of different populations of cells between donors, we still saw a highly significant correlation in normalized gene counts per specific gene between datasets both at 1G and in simulated microgravity (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we identified overlap in over 28% of our core signature genes (same directionality) across all immune cells from our single-cell analysis (106/375 = 28.3%) (Fig. 5C). Many of the overlapping genes induced were consistent with our most robustly altered core pathways from the single-cell data. For instance, we saw shared overlapping genes induced in acute immune responses (such as s100a8, s100a12, thbs1, il1b), chemokines (like cxcl8), heat-shock proteins (hsp90aa1, hspa1a, hspb1), autophagy (atg7) and the actin cytoskeleton (rhou). Overlapping reduced genes in simulated microgravity, like in our single-cell datasets, included interferon response (stat1, irf1) and associated guanylate binding proteins (gbp1, gbp2, gbp4, gbp5), and cold shock genes (rbm3), amongst others. Overall, there was a highly significant enrichment and over representation of our core single-cell DEGs across our bulk validation cohort by Fisher’s Exact Test for gene overlap (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5. Validation of single-cell signatures identifies overlapping features of immune dysfunction in simulated microgravity and spaceflight.

Red indicates a predicted activation in pathways, whereas blue indicates a predicted inhibition in pathways.We next sought to validate overlapping genes against mice and people flown in LEO. While multiple stressors exist in LEO, the proximity to Earth and the presence of the Earth’s magnetic field negates some effects of galactic cosmic rays, especially at the altitude of the ISS. Thus, microgravity plays an important role in driving phenotypic changes in LEO. To accomplish this goal, we first mined data from NASA’s GeneLab database for its largest study looking at a major immune organ, the spleen, in mice flown on the ISS. The GLDS-420 study provides data from the spleens of ten mice housed on the ISS for 33 days compared to ten ground controls. Though this cohort represents longer exposure to microgravity than our single-cell data’s more acute exposure, any overlapping genes could represent persistent microgravity-sensitive immune cell genes across longer duration exposure. From the GLDS-420 dataset, we identified 1448 significant DEGs (Fig. 5D), of which 50/375 (13.3%) overlapped in the same direction as our single-cell core list (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, many of the overlapping genes were represented as part of altered core pathways from the single-cell data. For instance, we saw shared induced overlapping genes in acute immune responses or complement (such as c3), autophagy (atg7), heat-shock responses (hsp90ab1, hsp90aa1, hspa1a, hspa1), and the cytoskeleton (dynll1). Overlapping reduced genes included interferon response (stat1), and again, cold shock genes (cirbp, rbm3), amongst others. Overall, we saw a significant enrichment in our core single-cell DEGs across mouse spleens flown in space by Fisher’s Exact Test for gene overlap (Fig. 5E). Pathway analysis with IPA was next performed to identify major canonical pathways altered across all four complete datasets (single-cell unstimulated, single-cell stimulated with TLR7/8 agonist, Bulk RNA-seq validation unstimulated, and GLDS-420), including overlapping pathways shared across all datasets. These pathways are displayed in a heat map for comparison (see below), and will be described at that point. To better translate the usefulness of our single-cell atlas to human spaceflight, we compared our core list of 375 DEGs across single cells in simulated microgravity to changes across all single cells from the Inspiration Four (I4) crew members. The I4 mission provides a compelling comparison since crew members spent up to three days in LEO, a timeline not too different from our 25-hour time point. Moreover, I4 gene lists were also generated by single-cell sequencing, making it a comparable technology for our analysis. However, it is important to note that the I4 datasets contain a few important caveats. First, the altitude flown by I4 crew (585 km/364miles) predispose the astronauts to higher radiation exposures than what would typically be experienced on the ISS (408 km/254miles altitude). Additionally, the I4 datasets were derived from PBMC gene expression comparisons between post-flight (1 day after Return/R + 1 in our case) vs preflight (44 days before launch/L-44 in our case). Since the changes from the I4 single-cell data represent changes encompassing effects of spaceflight, plus return to the ground, including short-term exposures to hyper-gravity, and one day of return to 1 g gravity (all which manifest as increased gravity exposure to inflight conditions), we considered overlapping immune cell genes in either direction on return to be gravity sensitive genes. Remarkably, despite these caveats, we found a very robust overlap of nearly 60% of DEGs in PBMCs in simulated microgravity (210/375 = 56%) to be also significantly altered across all immune cells in the I4 mission (Fig. 5F, Supplementary Data 13). Of these significantly altered genes across I4 data, 122 were altered in the same direction as I4 data, and 88 in the opposite direction. To gain a better understanding of the pathways and mechanisms impacted by gravity and spaceflight in the immune system, we compared pathways between simulated microgravity and the entire I4 dataset (Fig. 5G, Supplementary Data 14, and Supplementary Fig. 16A). While we consider all of these pathways to be potentially gravity sensitive, we considered pathways altered in the opposite directions to be potentially acutely sensitive to gravity, while those pathways altered in the same direction likely take longer to normalize from a microgravity environment upon return. Both simulated microgravity and the I4 mission pathway results indicated reduced T-cell effector subset development, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and increased pathways associated with innate immunity (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis, FcR phagocytosis in monocytes, cytokine storm, chemokine signaling, ROS production in macrophages), as well as hypoxia and glycolytic metabolism (HIF1α signaling) and cell stress (e.g., sirtuin signaling). Interestingly, the return to gravity seen in the I4 mission reversed reductions in natural killer cell signaling and reversed pathways linked to poor adaptive immunity like IL-15 signaling, suggesting these pathways may be sensitive to acute changes in gravity (Fig. 5G, Supplementary Data 14). From the I4 dataset, we also noticed a consistent reduction in ribosomal subunit genes in the I4 data (Fig. 5F), which might be reflective of a stress response and reduced protein translation upon return to earth), and only some of these genes were reduced in simulated microgravity. Consistently, there was a marked reduction in EIF2 signaling in the provided I4 DEGs. Across all pathways, regardless of direction, we noticed many pathways pertaining to the cytoskeleton or to a mechanical extracellular environment (e.g., fibrosis, RAC, Rho family GTPases, RHOA, integrin signaling, leukocyte extravasation signaling, healing signaling etc.) to be altered by simulated microgravity or by spaceflight on immune cells. Next, to look for overlapping genes relevant to longer exposures to human spaceflight, we compared our core simulated microgravity signature of immune cells against available data from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome study in LEO (GLDS-530) and the Twins study17. For the JAXA mission, we had access to cell-free RNA data, which can sometimes give insight into changes to PBMCs, amongst other cells29. During this mission, blood was sampled from 6 astronauts, with data pooled into a single count, at days 5, 30, 60, 120 post launch. Given that cell-free RNA is not a fully ideal comparison to RNA-seq from isolated PBMCs, we focused only on the two early time points, 5 days and 30 days post launch, because we saw significant overlap between our single-cell data in both the three-day I4 mission and in the 33-day GLDS-420 dataset. Thus, we compared 5 days and 30 days in-flight vs preflight differentially altered cell free RNA signatures for any possible overlap with our single-cell data in simulated microgravity. While we did not observe much overlap in our core 375 immune gene signature at 5 days (less than 10 genes), we did see significant overlap by 30 days (42/375 = 11.2% overlap in the same direction) (Supplementary Fig. 16B). Interestingly, it was observed that cell-free RNA levels generally decreased across most genes in flight. Consequently, we hypothesized that identifying genes exhibiting increased expression could be particularly important for identifying over-represented processes. Remarkably, we did note that the most significantly elevated gene at 30 days in-flight vs preflight was cdc42, a key modulator of the cytoskeleton, as well as dynll1 a dynein gene that was also upregulated in our single-cell analysis. We next reclustered our single-cell data (Supplementary Data 15) to compare the DEGs in our equivalent single-cell populations with those obtained from sorted CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and lymphocyte-depleted immune cells from the NASA Twins study, which compares in-flight vs ground twin control17. The Twins study provides intriguing data on the impact of LEO on the immune system, but has caveats in that exposure to LEO was calculated in only a single individual through bulk RNA-seq, and at multiple time points across one full year in space, a different duration than our shorter gene sets. Nonetheless, compared to our reclustered CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ gene sets, we found significant overlap in some genes comparing the effects of simulated microgravity to spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. 17A–C). Across multiple cell types, we saw changes in genes involved in redox regulation (e.g., reduced txnip), and in genes involved in interferon responses (e.g., reduced stat1 and gbp5). Interestingly, we saw significantly reduced cold shock gene, cirbp, a similar functioning gene to rbm3, in B cells in space. In our lymphocyte depleted (i.e., myeloid) recluster, we saw a large and highly significant overlap of about 163 genes with the Twins lymphocyte-depleted bulk RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig. 17D). Many of the overlapping genes induced by simulated microgravity or spaceflight included genes involved in innate immunity and inflammation (e.g., il1b, s100a12, thbs1 etc.), the cytoskeleton (rhoq, rhou), and hypoxia signaling (e.g., hif1α). Some interesting downregulated genes in both datasets in myeloid cells included again gbp5, cirbp, txnip like seen in T and B cells from the Twins study. We also noted a number of overlapping downregulated genes in antigen presentation (e.g., tap1, tap2, hla-e, hla-dp1a, etc). IPA analysis on this data largely captured the increases in innate immune inflammatory pathways, including increases in fibrosis signaling, IL-6 signaling, acute phase response, cytokine storm, and HIF1α signaling seen across some of our previous datasets (Supplementary Fig. 17E, Supplementary Data 16). Overall, these data enforce the idea of classically activated basal myeloid inflammatory changes in microgravity and spaceflight. Given that many of our altered pathways in simulated microgravity involved predicted mitochondrial dysfunction and/or the cytoskeleton, we used Airyscan super-resolution confocal microscopy to characterize immune cell mitochondrial and actin morphological networks to look for alterations in simulated microgravity compared to 1G controls. Interestingly, while 25 hours of simulated microgravity did not alter mean cell area across PBMCs, it did alter actin granularity parameters, as well as intensity and variance, consistent with cytoskeletal changes in acute simulated microgravity (Fig. 6A–C), though these differences are mostly subtle to the naked eye. Using three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution imaging, 25 hours of simulated microgravity did not alter cell or nucleus volume, or nucleus shape, but it increased mean cell surface area and actin spike length, and decreased sphericity of the cells across PBMCs (Fig. 6A, B, D, Supplementary Fig. 18A, B). Remarkably, 1G immune cells and simulated microgravity immune cells demonstrate unique spectral changes to actin rearrangement post TLR stimulation, such that TLR stimulation resulted in a different pattern of actin granularity spectral change in 1G compared to stimulation in simulated microgravity (Fig. 6C). The effect of microgravity on the cytoskeleton in unstimulated immune cells was similar to the effect of TLR activation in 1G. During TLR stimulation in simulated microgravity, immune cells followed a unique dynamic actin rearrangement pattern, potentially even reversing the pattern observed in 1G with TLR stimulation. These results suggest that simulated microgravity itself may induce immune cytoskeleton alterations, which may mimic aspects of TLR ligation on the cytoskeleton. Short-term exposure to simulated microgravity showed some increases in the mitochondrial MitoTracker Red staining intensity and variance in the unstimulated conditions, without changes to fiber length, size, or volume (Supplementary Fig. 18C). Fig. 6. Simulated microgravity induces distinct modifications to immune cell cytoskeletal morphology and cytokine production.

Two-tailed paired parametric t test was used, *p ≤ 0.05. Data are plotted as mean ± SEM and source data are provided with this paper.Since we detected morphological changes to the actin network, as well as noting changes in multiple altered cytoskeleton-related pathways across multiple datasets, including in the pathways “Signaling by Rho Family GTPases” or “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho”, we next sought to screen for active GTP-bound Rho GTPases, Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42, using G-LISA technology30 across further batches of isolated paired PBMCs. After 25 hours of simulated microgravity, regardless of stimulation conditions, we saw elevated levels of active GTP-bound Cdc42, consistent with cytoskeleton mobilization and the increase in actin spikes (indicative of filopodia)31 observed due to simulated microgravity (Fig. 6E). Active GTP-Rac1 was not altered at baseline in simulated microgravity, though showed a trend to induction with TLR7/8 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 18D, E). Levels of active GTP-RhoA were low in our samples, but trended lower in simulated microgravity without stimulation, and higher under stimulation, analogous to our single-cell data predictions (Supplementary Fig. 18D, E). Overall, these data suggest that simulated microgravity changes some Rho GTPase activity consistent with our transcriptional data, though ultimate impacts on cytoskeleton shape, variance, and dynamics likely involve additional contributing factors, including possibly other Rho GTPase family members not assessed. We next sought to investigate our core signature of reduced IFN signaling elicited in microgravity across immune cells (Fig. 6F, Supplemental Fig. 19A, B). Specifically, we assessed whether reduced interferon signaling was due to reduced local production of interferons. Supernatants from 25 hours unstimulated or 9 hours R848 simulated (25 hours total culture) PBMCs were assessed by ELISA for total IFNα (detecting 12 IFNα subtypes), and IFNγ. Simulated microgravity significantly reduced both IFNα and IFNγ secretion with TLR7/8 stimulation. At baseline, the levels of these cytokines were low, and variable, and thus not significantly different between 1G and simulated microgravity. These findings point to reduced production of IFNs in simulated microgravity, at least under TLR stimulation, as measured by ELISA, potentially as one contributing mechanism to reduced interferon signaling observed at the transcriptional level. Finally, to functionally validate how simulated microgravity impacts overall immune cell cytokine production, with and without TLR7/8 stimulation, across many cytokines simultaneously, we performed a 48-plex Luminex assay on cytokines secreted by PBMCs from 12 donors (Supplementary Fig. 19C, D). Consistent with our single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data, simulated microgravity was associated with increased or trending increases in mainly innate/monocyte immune cell-derived inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p40, CCL4), coupled to a reduction in cytokines that associate with T cell activation or proliferation (e.g., IL-2, IL-7, IL-15). Concurrently, the Luminex results showed a significant IFNγ and a trending IFNα2 reduction upon TLR7/8 agonist stimulation in simulated microgravity, consistent with our above ELISA data (Fig. 6F). IL-1, commonly induced in our sequencing data, also appeared elevated in simulated microgravity, though it exhibited high variability, precluding significance in the unstimulated state. In the stimulated state, IL-1β was significantly increased in simulated microgravity by Luminex analysis. Given the overlapping similarities between cytokines in the Luminex data and sequencing data for IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, we further assessed these cytokines by ELISA validation. Both IL-6 and IL-8 showed significant or near-significant increases by ELISA in simulated microgravity, while IL-1β demonstrated a trending increase (Fig. 6G, Supplementary Fig. 19E). Upon stimulation, simulated microgravity further facilitated near-significant increases in IL-1β and IL-8 as validated by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 19F). To better understand how certain cell populations respond to TLR7/8 stimulation in simulated microgravity, we further validated key cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFNγ, by intracellular flow cytometry in monocyte, NK, and T cell subsets exposed to simulated microgravity compared to 1G conditions (Supplementary Figs. 20, 21). Consistent with Luminex and ELISA data, we saw increased IL-1β production across all characterized monocyte populations (Supplementary Fig. 21A, B). Interestingly, despite no overall differences in IL-6 by Luminex or ELISA in simulated microgravity to TLR7/8 stimulation, we still detected significant increases in a subset of monocytes only, as well as in NK cells (Supplementary Fig. 21C, E). Despite increased cytokine production, we did not detect increases in the activation marker, HLA-DR, in monocyte populations (Supplementary Fig. 21D). NK cells also showed a reduction in the proportion producing IFNγ, as well as reduced proportions of expression in the activation marker, CD69, and degranulation marker, LAMP-1, consistent with reduced functionality and response to stimulation in simulated microgravity (Supplementary Fig. 21F, G). T cell subsets were less altered, though we still detected near significant or significant reductions in the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ central memory T cells expressing activation marker, CD69, and in effector memory CD4+ T cells expressing proliferation marker, Ki67 (Supplementary Fig. 21H). Taken together with our ELISA and Luminex data, these findings demonstrate that simulated microgravity, alone or in the presence of TLR7/8 agonist, can functionally alter cytokine production across immune cells. In general, consistent with sequencing data, the features demonstrate monocyte inflammatory function coupled to impaired T cell and NK cell functionality in simulated microgravity. Thus, changes in cytokine signaling observed in simulated microgravity may occur at least in part to changes in upstream cytokine production.Reversing simulated microgravity effects on the immune system We have characterized multiple genes and pathways altered by simulated microgravity in the immune system; however, whether there are specific drugs or supplements that can directly target microgravity effects on immune cells is poorly characterized. Thus, we have utilized an in-house compound-gene interactome machine learning technology (Gene Compound Enrichment Analysis, GCEA), building on the HyperFoods model32, for the identification of drugs and food supplements that significantly map to altered genes in a dataset. Overall, our pipeline assesses >2 million interactions between genes, drugs, and foods, across DrugBank, LINCS, and FoodDB32 (Fig. 7A). Using these algorithms across our core signature of 375 DEGs altered by simulated microgravity across the immune system, we identified 115 compounds with adj p < 0.05, and 474 compounds with p < 0.05 that significantly map to our signature (Fig. 7B and Supplementary Data 17). Figure 7B shows the top 50 most significantly overlapping compounds to enriched DEGs. We next chose one compound, quercetin, based on its widespread availability for future travelers to space, and for its prominence as an anti-aging supplement, to validate whether it can reverse transcriptional insults of microgravity on the immune system. PBMCs (donors from the Fig. 5A cohort) were subjected to 25 hours in simulated microgravity, with or without quercetin (50 μM), for bulk RNA-seq analysis. Fig. 7. Reversing simulated microgravity effects on the immune system with quercetin. Open in a new tab A Pipeline of microgravity and gene interacting compounds from discovery to validation. B Heatmap of top 50 simulated uG altered gene to compound interaction candidates. Compounds are listed on the right, and the predicted interacting genes are listed at the bottom. The color indicates the STITCH confidence score for compound-gene interaction. C Quercetin (50 μM) reverses the core gene expression signatures in simulated uG (25 hours). Log2FC levels of 106 core DEGs from simulated uG vs. 1G are plotted side-by-side to quercetin-treated uG vs. 1G in the heatmap. Red indicates positive log2FC, and blue indicates negative log2FC. 70% of the genes are reversed after quercetin treatment. The scatter plot below shows a negative association (Pearson correlation R = −0.35, p < 0.001) between the log2FC levels of the 106 core genes from simulated uG vs. 1G and quercetin-treated uG vs. 1G. D Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) shows the reversal effect of quercetin on the 106 core DEGs plotted in C heatmap. Quercetin treatment inverts the enrichment score (ES) in the upregulated core genes (from 0.8 to −0.64) and increases the ES of the downregulated core genes (from −0.75 to −0.55). All p values are <0.0001. E IPA Canonical pathways altered by quercetin. Heatmap plots the comparison of quercetin-treated samples against non-treated bulk RNA-seq controls, single-cell TLR7/8 agonist stimulated and unstimulated samples, and GLDS-420 mouse spleens in space. Red indicates a predicted activation in pathways, whereas blue indicates a predicted inhibition in pathways. The datasets were clustered by quercetin treatment into 2 major groups via complete linkage hierarchical clustering method. F Quercetin reduces senescence and age-associated inflammatory gene outputs. Both SenMayo scores and iAge index are reduced in the quercetin-treated group with p value of 0.0746 and 0.0268 respectively. Compared with the untreated group, quercetin downregulates more senescence-related and age-associated inflammatory genes (from ↓48.8% to ↓63.2%). n = 6, donors were 3 males (age 37, 22, 32 years old) and 3 females (age 27, 26, 40 years old). Two-tailed paired t test, *p ≤ 0.05. G Quercetin (25 hours treatment) reduces ROS levels measured by 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) assay. n = 6 for 1G vs uG, donors were males (32, 37, and 38 years old) and females (34, 32, 37 years old). 34 yrs and 32 yrs female samples were not treated with quercetin, resulting in n = 4 for comparisons between 1G vs 1G+Quercetin and uG vs uG+ Quercetin. Two-tailed paired parametric t test was used, *p ≤ 0.05. Data are plotted as mean ± SEM and source data are provided with the paper.Remarkably, at the gene level, quercetin reversed the direction of expression of 70% (74/106) of the 106 genes (Fig. 5C) core signature generated as significantly overlapping genes between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq validation (Fig. 7C). Reversal of gene expression was significant by correlation analysis (Fig. 7C) and demonstrated by GSEA enrichment plot (Fig. 7D). IPA pathway analysis was then performed to characterize pathways altered by quercetin, and compared against non-treated bulk RNA-seq controls, as well as pathways altered across our other 3 major datasets, including single-cell sequencing and GLDS-420 spleens in space. Overall, pathway analysis across all datasets showed consistent impacts of simulated and actual microgravity on pathways essential for optimal immunity (Fig. 7E, Supplementary Data 18). Some of the most consistently induced pathways in simulated microgravity and/or space included “coronavirus pathogenesis pathway” (linked to innate immune activation), acute phase responses, leukocyte extravasation signaling, IL-6 signaling, BAG2 signaling (linked to heat-shock proteins and proteostasis), sirtuin signaling, and to a lesser extent “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho”, RAC signaling, PKA signaling, and oxidative stress response. Major pathways attenuated by microgravity were linked to immunity, including antimicrobial immunity, pyroptosis signaling, as well as “interferon signaling” (including PKR in IFN induction). Other reduced pathways across most datasets included reduced nuclear receptor activation (including LXR/RXR, PPAR, AHR) and reduced T cell NUR77 (activation) signaling. Interestingly, we noted some genes were consistently reduced across all datasets, though were not properly represented in pathway analysis. The most striking of these genes is rbm3, a cold-shock protein, which was significantly reduced in all four of the microgravity datasets, as well as in the I4 and JAXA mission (30-day timepoint). Rbm3 was also reduced in the Twins study inflight data across all sorted immune cells, though not reaching significance. Administration of quercetin in simulated microgravity could reverse many of the altered transcriptional signatures elicited by simulated microgravity on the immune system (Fig. 7E). Some of the major pathways it could reverse include “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho”, leukocyte extravasation signaling, RAC signaling, LXR/RXR, PPAR signaling, NUR77 signaling in T cells, “coronavirus pathogenesis” (innate immunity), acute phase response, fibrosis, IL-6 signaling, amongst others. Though quercetin has gained prominence for its senolytic properties33, our results show that reducing senescence pathways was only one of many (approximately 174) pathway effects this compound has on immune cells in simulated microgravity (Supplementary Data 18). Nonetheless, in simulated microgravity, quercetin could reduce senescence and age-associated inflammatory gene outputs, as demonstrated by reductions in both the SenMayo and iAge index scores (Fig. 7F). These changes occurred for the most part by downregulating inflammatory genes. Despite the marked transcriptional reversal in simulated microgravity observed with one compound, quercetin failed to reverse reductions in interferon signaling, a major hallmark of microgravity on immune system dysfunction from our data. Other studies have also linked microgravity and spaceflight to mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production10,34,35. In this regard, quercetin also showed a robust capacity to reduce ROS levels after 25 hours of simulated microgravity (Fig. 7G), though ROS was only marginally increased as a trend by simulated microgravity itself after 25 hours, likely due to the expression of endogenous antioxidant systems at this timepoint34. Consistently, we also observed increased oxidative stress responses, such as NRF2-mediated or sirtuin signaling in many of our transcriptomic datasets by IPA analysis (Fig. 7E).Discussion Immune dysfunction during spaceflight is an important health risk, and manifests primarily as increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections, including latent viral reactivation3. Latent viruses can reactivate on both short- and long-term spaceflights, and commonly involve herpes viruses (HSV1, EBV, CMV, VZV)12–15. Astronauts also experience heightened skin sensitivity reactions3,13,36, and this mechanism was thought to be related to a possible Type 2 immune bias in space7,16,36. Recent work in simulated microgravity has also shown reduced JAK/STAT signaling in CD8+ T cells, coupled to increased pSTAT5 signaling in Tregs. Despite these important advances, major mechanisms explaining these phenotypes of immune dysfunction, in simulated microgravity have remained unclear. We have identified numerous core pathways and genes altered across human immune cells in simulated microgravity, with validation against datasets of humans in LEO, as well as spleens from mice flow on the ISS. Overall, we noted changes consistent with basal innate immune cell inflammatory changes in simulated microgravity, coupled with distinct pathways of dysfunction in multiple immune cells. Specifically, the most consistently reproduced pathways impacted by simulated microgravity across immune cells in both single-cell and validation cohorts included changes to pathways and signaling linked to acute phase response signaling, Coronavirus pathogenesis, IL-6 signaling, the cytoskeleton, interferon response, pyroptosis, heat-shock, nuclear receptors, and sirtuin biology. The link between the cytoskeleton and other pathways here may be especially relevant in immune dysfunction. Cytoskeleton dynamics are controlled by a number of factors, but small GTPases, including Ras homology (Rho) GTPases, are major orchestrators with critical impact on immune cell function, migration, gene expression, trafficking, phagocytosis, proliferation, and antigen recognition31. Of note, Rho GTPases have been implicated in response to simulated microgravity in other cell types, but this connection is understudied in immune cells37. Across most datasets, we saw changes to Rho GTPase signaling, including individually in RAC, RHOA, or CDC42 signaling, or combined in a global “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho” pathway in IPA. While we did notice some variability between our initial unstimulated vs stimulated single-cell data in these pathways, these pathways tended to show reduced RHOA signaling without stimulation, coupled with increased RAC signaling, analogous to what we observed from the I4 crew members upon landing. The JAXA6 dataset also demonstrated cdc42 to be the most significantly induced cell-free transcript in astronauts after 30 days in space. Pathways strongly linked to cytoskeletal remodeling, such as leukocyte extravasation, were also typically induced in most of our datasets. We also observed changes in some active Rho GTPases by G-LISA, as well as in F-actin granularity, variance, 3D surface area, sphericity, actin protrusion length, and dynamic change to TLR stimulation by super-resolution microscopy, providing further evidence for changes in actin, including possibly immune cytoskeleton alteration or dysfunction, in simulated microgravity. Importantly, changes to the actin cytoskeleton are now being linked to the ability of an immune cell to mount an interferon response. Indeed, danger-sensing molecules like TLRs utilize Rho GTPases to facilitate IFN responses38,39, or antiviral sensors can directly modulate actin rearrangement40. One example is the PKR antiviral response, which was consistently downregulated by simulated microgravity in our datasets. In this system, PKR binds gelsolin to enforce basal innate immune defense, though upon viral sensing, PKR dissociates from gelsolin, leading to the severing of actin, and activation of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)s signaling and interferon response41. Other antiviral sensors like RIG-I directly bind F-actin in resting cells, and then relocalize to the mitochondria via actin rearrangements on viral infection, to induce type 1 IFN42,43. In single-cell data, reduced interferon signaling without stimulation was seen mainly in monocytes, linking it to innate immunity, though with TLR7/8 stimulation, reduced interferon signaling was seen across many cells, including most T cell subsets, and NK cells, displaying the broad importance of this pathway across most immune cells to microgravity. In simulated microgravity, we saw reduced IFNα production by ELISA with stimulation, so we cannot rule out the possibility that the reduced IFN signaling seen in simulated microgravity starts with reduced capacity for IFN production in some conditions, in addition to potential defects in downstream signaling itself. While we have focused on type 1 IFN signaling, some reduced interferon responses are also linked to reduced signaling from the IFN gamma receptor (IFNGR). Consistently, we also noted reduced IFNγ production in simulated microgravity upon TLR7/8 stimulation. Whether the cytoskeleton is needed for IFNGR clustering and signaling remains to be seen44. Consistent with reduced interferon signaling in simulated microgravity, we noticed a reduction in some IFN-inducible GTPase superfamily genes, namely guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) across our datasets. Various GBPs (e.g., gbp5) were reduced as well in the Twins study. Interestingly, GBPs, which are heavily induced by IFNγ signaling, have been shown to be critical in maintaining responses to mycobacterium tuberculosis45,46, and we see reactivation of similar bacteria (in addition to some retroviruses) in simulated microgravity after as little as 25 hours of exposure. GBPs and associated IFN responses also help direct inflammasome activation and pyroptosis (an inflammatory form of cell death) linked to antimicrobial defense that was consistently down in monocytes and B cells in simulated microgravity, and in nearly all immune cells in response to TLR7/8 stimulation in simulated microgravity46,47. Interestingly, pyroptosis and inflammasome activation can also be directly controlled by Rho GTPases and the cytoskeleton48,49. Another pathway found consistently down across datasets included LXR signaling. Interestingly, LXR signaling also can promote antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Macrophage LXR has been shown to reduce bacterial infection by reducing intracellular NAD+ in a CD38 manner, with mechanistic impacts on the cytoskeleton50. Whether NAD+ levels fall in microgravity remains to be seen, though we did see an interesting increase in sirtuin signaling across datasets, including in the I4 mission. Sirtuins may be functioning to counter acute oxidative stress in microgravity34,51. We also saw reduced oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional signatures across all unstimulated immune cells in simulated microgravity. Altered metabolite levels (and possibly ROS) from impaired oxidative phosphorylation might also contribute to HIF1α stabilization52 as observed in some of our simulated microgravity and spaceflight datasets. Reduced oxidative phosphorylation can be associated with increased glycolysis in immune cells53, fueling “M1-like” pro-inflammatory changes in macrophages, potentiating NF-κb signaling, acute responses and IL-6 or IL-1 release, cytokines frequently induced in microgravity. Consistently, we did notice a preferential enrichment of predicted “macrophage classical activation” signatures across our gene sets in the Twins study. Interestingly, we noted frequent increases in heat-shock genes, coupled to increased associated BAG signaling pathways across antigen-presenting cells (monocytes, B cells, and DCs), as well as in double negative T cells. Heat-shock expression may be reflective of altered proteostasis in simulated microgravity10, and may be required for adaptation to mechanical unloading in some cells34, though this may also be linked to higher temperatures. Across all gene sets, we noticed a reduction in the cold shock gene, rbm3, which was reduced in nearly all immune cells in our single-cell data. Increased heat-shock coupled with reduced cold shock genes raises the possibility of higher intracellular temperatures directly induced by microgravity, but whether microgravity, or associated increase in cytokines or binding partners such as IL-1ra, directly induce the observed “space fever” in astronauts requires further insight54. Interestingly, we did notice a number of significant IL-1 ligands in innate cell to T cell interactions in our microgravity Interactome, highlighting the possible importance of this cytokine family and downstream interacting molecules. Pertaining the aforementioned skin lesions in astronauts, it has been postulated that persistent skin hypersensitivity reactions in some crew members may be linked to allergic responses7,16. While analysis of our datasets cannot rule out this possibility, we did not observe increased Th2 signatures across our simulated microgravity systems, or with our specific gene sets validated across the I4 mission. We also saw inconsistent changes to IL-23 and IL-17 signaling across our datasets, though these cytokines are known contributors to skin disease55. While the root causes of such lesions cannot be inferred from our data analysis, it likely involves changes in the crosstalk with the skin microbiome, in addition to intrinsic immune cell abnormalities. Interestingly, we did see reduced aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling in most of our datasets, especially in CD14 monocytes and conventional type 2 dendritic cells, raising the idea of reduced AHR signaling in space to contribute to skin lesions56,57. However, we saw AHR signaling was enriched in the Twins study gene set result and so more experimentation is needed to tease out a possible role for the AHR in astronaut skin lesions. Using in house machine learning algorithms, we identified numerous compounds mapping to microgravity’s transcriptional response to the immune system. This algorithm focuses on the strength of interaction and does not specify direction. However, we tested one of the most significantly interacting compounds, the flavonol, quercetin, for its ability to reverse transcriptional changes to simulated microgravity on the immune system, and found that it could reverse approximately 70% of altered core genes. Of note, quercetin reversed numerous pathways, including core pathways such as reduced nuclear receptor activation, sirtuin signaling, Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway, associated acute phase responses and IL-6 signaling. Quercetin also showed impact on the cytoskeleton, favoring a freezing of pathways linked to its mobility in microgravity, by reducing genes associated with Rho GTPase signaling (e.g., reducing RAC, RHOA and CDC42 signaling), and boosting RHOGDI signaling. Despite these changes, quercetin was unable to revert the core immunosuppression pathway of reduced interferon responses. However, since actin skeleton mobility is needed to induce an IFN response in many instances40, too much interference could contribute to a persistent lack of IFN signaling here, and might represent a further mechanism of immune suppression mediated by quercetin that requires more study. Interestingly, after 25 hours in simulated microgravity, we saw variable results on the induction of senescence pathways, though quercetin markedly reduced senescence associated transcripts in our data. Thus, while quercetin acts in part through its senotherapeutic mechanisms32, the large breadth of additional other pathways suggests multiple beneficial modes of activity for immune modulation in microgravity. Our data support a hypothetical model where microgravity alters forces sensed by immune cells, leading to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, and nuclear receptor signaling, coupled to changes in core pathways in space such as mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Recent work in other cells, such as endothelial cells, has identified cytoskeletal abnormalities as a key feature of simulated microgravity that drives autophagy and a reduction in mitochondrial mass after 72 hours of exposure35. Our datasets would support some of these findings. Combined, these pathways would contribute to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and associated basal inflammatory processes, as well as reduced viral sensing pathways, associated reduced interferon responses and altered pyroptosis capability. Reduced interferon responses and signaling, impact both innate cells like monocytes and NK cells, as well as adaptive cells like T cells. Such changes could cumulate in viral or mycobacterial reactivation in microgravity. These processes would also be complemented by the psychological and physiological stresses of spaceflight, which also may independently associate with viral reactivation12,14,58. Thus, an important future direction of research is to address whether altered cytoskeleton, or associated reductions in interferon related gene products, including GBPs, are actively driving the reactivation of mycobacteria and latent viruses that we see in simulated microgravity. Another related important avenue of future research is to better understand how changes to force action on immune cells link to the mitochondria dysfunction hallmark of spaceflight and metabolic alterations, and to map such changes to immune cell metabolism as has been done to other mechanical forces19,59. Moreover, the immune system in spaceflight is also under the influence of changing pressure gradients, such as increased pressures in parts of the upper body60, coupled to lower central venous pressure and potentially altered shear force61–63. These changes may also contribute to altered immune function, including the increased IL-1 and IL-6, two cytokines sensitive to external force cues, seen in spaceflight, with potential for intersecting signaling nodes across mechanotransduction and other pathways such as mitochondrial dysfunction within immune cells19. More work is needed to understand how these additional changes in force impact innate and adaptive immunity during spaceflight and how they interact with the effects of microgravity. Finally, despite the multiple proposed mechanisms resulting from this study, much of it was produced using simulated microgravity as a model system, which has its own caveats18, though we did identify core reproduced pathways from spleens in mice on the ISS and some overlap with the I4 mission and Twins study. Further studies applying single cell-omic technologies to immune cells during in-flight missions will no doubt provide answers to refine the proposed mechanisms of immune dysfunction in space. As well, integrating more in-depth chromatin and analytical approaches, such as ATAC-seq, can help detail the regulatory changes that might be underlying these immune phenotypes64. Overall, our current work provides a resource to better understand “astroimmunology”, in particular how and why the immune system changes in simulated microgravity and spaceflight. These results also provide opportunities to develop countermeasures that will help normalize immune cell function in microgravity and spaceflight.Methods Studies were conducted under the supervision and in accordance with ethical guidelines of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. In particular, protocols for the purchasing of human blood products from Stanford University are described in the next section below. Human blood sample and cell culture De-identified peripheral blood buffy coat samples were obtained from the Stanford University Blood Center under official signed contract agreements with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, following the Stanford Blood Center’s Certification of Human Subjects Approval for minimal risk research-related activities (IRB eProtocol# 13942). A total of 27 healthy human buffy coats between the ages of 20 and 46 were purchased from the Stanford University Blood Center. PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll gradient method. PBMCs were counted and resuspended in complete media at 1 × 106 cells/ml (RPMI 1640, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential Amino acid,1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol,10 mM HEPES). To generate simulated microgravity, the cell suspension was loaded into 10 ml disposable high aspect ratio vessels (Synthecon, Houston, TX) and rotated at 15 rpm for 25 hours. For the 1G control, the cell suspension was plated in standard 6-well culture plates, as standard static culture plates or culture flasks have been shown to be comparable to static high aspect ratio vessels by others in major immunological assays2. 1G and simulated microgravity cultures were simultaneously placed in the same 37 C, 5% CO2 incubator. To stimulate PBMCs, samples were mixed with 1 μM R848 (TLR7/8 agonist, Invivogen, San Diego, CA) after 16 hours, for 9 hours of stimulation. At the end of each experiment, the cell suspension was quickly collected, spun down at 500 × g, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and used for downstream analysis. For super-resolution imaging cells were fixed before centrifuging.Single-cell RNA sequencing 1 × 104 PBMCs from each condition were counted and loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller and the libraries were prepared using Chromium Next GEM Single-Cell 5’ Reagent Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The quality of libraries was assessed using Agilent TapeStation 4200 (Santa Clara, CA), and test-sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550 (San Diego, CA). The full sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by SeqMatic (Fremont, CA).Processing of single-cell RNA-seq data Data processing was performed using 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v6.1.2 and MTD26 pipelines. The “cellranger count” was used to perform transcriptome alignment, filtering, and UMI counting from the FASTQ (raw data) files. Alignment was done against the human genome GRCh38-2020-A. Cell numbers after processing were: 1G unstimulated 13,304 cells, uG unstimulated 21,709 cells, 1G stimulated 16,397 cells, and uG stimulated 14,913 cells. The MTD pipeline was used to generate the single-cell microbiome count matrix from the FASTQ files. Downstream analyses were performed in R (version 4.2.0), primarily using the Seurat R package (version 4.1.1)65,66 and custom analysis scripts. First, we executed a quality control step that removed the cells containing >10% mitochondrial RNA and ≤250 genes/features. The doublet cells were identified and removed from the downstream analysis by using the DoubletFinder R package (version 2.0.3)67 with parameters PCs = 1:30, pN = 0.25, and nExp = 7.5%. To avoid the influence of hemoglobin transcripts on the analysis, we filtered out the putative red blood cells (defined by the method below) before the following process. A total of 55,648 cells remained for subsequent analysis. Raw RNA counts were first normalized and stabilized with the SCTransform v2 function (SCT), then followed by the CCA integration workflow for joint analysis of single-cell datasets. In doing so, the top 3000 highly variable genes/features among the datasets were used to run SCT; and then 3000 highly variable genes/features and the 30 top principal components (PCs) with k.anchor = 5 were used to find “anchors” for integration. The clustering step was executed by using the 30 top PCs summarizing the RNA expression of each cell with a resolution parameter of 0.8. To identify putative cell types, Azimuth (version 0.3.2)65 pipeline was used with the reference dataset of Human–PBMC celltype.l2. Cell type annotation results from Azimuth were validated by checking the markers of each cell type (Supplementary Data 3). Gene differential expression analyses were done by Seurat PrepSCTFindMarkers then FindAllMarkers/FindMarkers functions with MAST68 algorithm. The pseudo-bulk analysis was conducted to find overall DEGs of uG against 1G in either unstimulated or stimulated PBMCs, using the FindMarker function with parameter min.pct = 0.005 and logFC = 0.1. To compare the stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs under uG and 1G conditions, we subtracted log2FC values of their DEGs (uG−1G). The top 50 most upregulated DEGs between stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs under 1G were used for comparison. FindConservedMarkers function was used to find DEGs that are conserved between the groups with the same parameter settings as FinderMarkers. The top 50 conserved DEGs specifically sensitive to uG were selected based on the rank of the absolute sum of log2FC values, derived separately from the sum of positive log2FC values and the sum of negative log2FC values. Rank-Rank Hypergeometric Overlap (RRHO) analysis69,70 was performed by using RRHO2 R package (version 1.0) to compare the differential expression patterns between 1G and uG of stimulated vs unstimulated PBMCs. The ranks of the genes in the two gene lists were determined by calculating −log10(adj.pvalue)*log2FC.Pathway analysis Following differential expression, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) was used to discover changes in enriched pathways in each comparison. DEGs with p values < 0.05 and |Log2FC|> 0.1 were incorporated into the IPA canonical pathway analysis.Trajectory analysis To study the inferred trajectory of PBMC differentiation, cell trajectory analysis was performed by using the Monocle 3 R package (version 1.2.9)71,72. We first subsetted Seurat data to uG and 1G groups then run the functions as.cell_data_set(), cluster_cells(), and learn_graph(). Then, we ran order_cells() with the selection of cell types representing early development stages (CD4 naive, B naive, plasmablast, and HSPC) as the roots of the trajectory.Calculating cell scores of inflammatory aging and cellular senescence The inflammatory aging (iAge)24 index was calculated by the sum of the cell scores that count by multiplying normalized and transformed gene expression with the corresponding coefficient of the gene in the iAge gene set. Cellular senescence was scored using Seurat AddModuleScore function65,73 on the SenMayo gene set25.Viral and microbial abundance analysis The output reads counts from MTD pipeline were then combined with the host reads and analyzed in R with Seurat package and other customized scripts. The relative abundance (frequency) of a virus or microbe was determined by dividing its reads count by the total reads count (host and non-host) in that sample. The classification results were further validated using a different method Magic-BLAST74.APCs to T cell intercellular communication To study the difference in intercellular communication from APCs to T cells between uG and 1G, we used nichenetr R packages (version 1.1.0)27 to analyze cells in the dataset belonging to APCs (B cells, DCs, or monocytes) and T cell types. The “Differential NicheNet” workflow was implemented. The expressed genes in sender cells—APCs were selected if they were expressed in at least 10% of that APC cell population. The gene set of interest in receiver cells—T cells was defined by adjusted p value ≤ 0.05 and Log2FC ≥ 0.25 in the DEGs. Top 30 ligands that were further used to predict activated target genes and construct an activated ligand-receptor network. Default settings were used for all other parameters.Bulk RNA sequencing Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Cat# 74134, Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity check, preparation of RNA library, and mRNA sequencing were conducted by Novogene Co., LTD (CA, US). About 20 million paired-end 150 bp reads per sample were generated from Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System. FASTQ raw reads were analyzed using the MTD pipeline26. Differential gene expression analysis between groups was done by DESeq2 R package (version 1.36.0)75 with control for the subject effect. Genes with adjusted p value < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed. DEGs with p values < 0.05 and |Log2FC|>0.5 were used for the IPA canonical pathway analysis. Different from single-cell (SC), to calculate the iAge index for bulk RNA-seq, normalized and transformed gene expression was multiplied with the gene’s coefficient in the iAge gene set, then summed for each sample. Cellular senescence was scored using the ssGSEA76 method on the SenMayo gene set. Cell Type Frequency Changes within PBMCs were predicted by CIBERSORTx Docker image–Fractions Mode version 1.0. Our single-cell RNA-seq data from PBMCs was used to build the Signature Matrix File as the reference to predict the cell proportion in the bulk RNA-seq data.Mouse spleen bulk RNA-seq analysis Mouse spleen Bulk RNA-seq raw data was acquired from NASA GeneLab Data Repository with the accession ID: GLDS-420. Ten mice in space flight and ten mice in ground control (GC) were used in the experiment. The detailed study description and experiment protocols are on the data repository https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-420. MTD pipeline was used to process the FASTQ raw data, generate the count matrix, and then analyze differentially expressed genes between Flight and Ground groups.Gene set overlapping analysis The p value of gene overlapping between two datasets was calculated by Fisher’s Exact Test in GeneOverlap R package [Shen L, Sinai ISoMaM (2022)]. GeneOverlap: Test and visualize gene overlaps. R package version 1.32.0 [http://shenlab-sinai.github.io/shenlab-sinai/]. The 375 DEGs in uG vs. 1G from unstimulated PBMCs single-cell RNA-seq results were used to match with the genes from PBMC bulk RNA-seq, I4, or JAXA studies. For the mouse genes in GLDS-420, we first convert them to the human orthologous before the analysis. In the matched genes, those expressions that were in the same log2FC direction as 375 DEGs as well as with p value < 0.05, were considered overlapping (except for I4, where either direction was considered overlapping). Complete linkage hierarchical clustering was used to analyze dissimilarities in genes or pathways between datasets, and the results were visualized by the ComplexHeatmap R package (version 2.12.0)77. Moreover, the IPA canonical pathway analysis was performed on the matched genes of I4 and Twins studies. The 106 core gene set was constituted by DEGs that consistently change their log2FC directions in both SC and bulk data of PBMCs. The alteration of the core gene set by the compound was measured by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)76,78 and Pearson correlation test.Compound analysis FDA-approved drugs (n = 1692) are selected from the DrugBank database and food compounds (n = 7962) are selected from the FoodDB database as previously described32. LINCS compounds (n = 5414) are obtained from the LINCS L1000 project. ‘Compound’ is used as a general term for ‘drug’, ‘food compound’ and ‘LINCS compound’ throughout the document. Compound-protein interactions are extracted from the STITCH database v5.079 by matching the InChI keys of drugs/food/LINCS compounds. STITCH collects information from multiple sources and individual scores from each source are combined into an overall confidence score. After processing, three datasets are obtained: (i) drug-gene interaction dataset containing 1890 drugs and 16,654 genes with 542,577 interactions (ii) food compound-gene interaction dataset containing 7654 compounds and 116,375 genes and 818,737 interactions (iii) LINCS compound-gene interaction dataset containing 5414 compounds and 16,794 genes and 692,152 interactions. Statistical significance for the overlap between compound genes and the DEGs from the uG vs 1G of the unstimulated PBMCs single-cell RNA-seq is calculated using Fisher’s Exact Test. The universal gene set contains all genes that interact with at least one compound. The compound with a low p value interacts with a higher proportion of the DEGs than that expected by chance. Statistically significant compounds were then obtained after the Bonferroni adjustment of p values. The pipeline for this compound analysis is implemented in the R script GCEA.Cell staining and imaging (super-resolution microscopy) Live PBMCs were stained with 60 nM MitoTracker Red-CMX-Ros (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) either in 6-well plates or in the microgravity chambers for the last 2 hr of the microgravity simulation. At the end of the microgravity simulation cells were immediately fixed by 1:1 mixing the cell suspensions with 2× concentrated fixative (10% Sucrose (w/v) 120 mM KCl, 1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, 8% (w/v) PFA pH 7.4) and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature followed by 15 minutes on ice. Fixed cells were washed and stored in PBS until further staining for up to a week at 4 °C. 1 million fixed cells were resuspended in 1 mL of permeabilization solution (0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS) for 5 minutes. After twice washing in PBS, pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL 1% BSA PBS containing Phalloidin-iFluor-488 (cat# ab176753, Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK) at the manufacturer’s recommended dilution, and were incubated for 90 minutes with gentle agitation. After washing in PBS, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 µg/mL in PBS) for 10 minutes. The fixed-stained cells were immobilized at 3 × 105 cells per well density in glass-bottom 96-well microplates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC), which were pre-coated with polyethyleneimine (1:15,000 (w/v)) for 16 hours in a 37 °C incubator, and washed twice with PBS. Microplates with the cell suspensions were centrifuged in a swing plate rotor centrifuge (Eppendorf 5810 R) at 400 × g and for 10 min and then fixed on the surface by adding an equal volume of 8% (w/v) PFA for 5 min. Finally, the fixative was replaced with 100 µL of antifade reagent (Vector Prolong Gold (ThermoFisher)). Samples were imaged immediately after this procedure.Image acquisition Immobilized fixed-stained PBMCs were imaged on a Zeiss LSM980 Airyscan2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, White Plains, NY). Single PBMCs were manually selected for recording based on low-resolution preview scans showing only nuclei. All singlet cells were selected in a small neighborhood to avoid biases. In each microscopy session, 24-40 cells were selected for recording in one well for each condition. This was performed in an interleaved manner, capturing 6-8 cells at a time, and then moving to the next well and then repeating this multiple times using the Experiment Designer module for automation. Super-resolution volumes of (358 × 358 × 70 pixels, 0.035 × 0.035 × 0.13 µm/voxel resolution) were recorded in the above-determined positions using Definite Focus autofocusing. A Plan-Apochromat 63 × 1.40 Oil lens, Airyscan2 SR (super-resolution) mode with optimal sampling and frame switching between 3 fluorescence channels to minimize spectral cross-bleed were used. MitoTracker Red, iFluor488, and Hoechs33342 were excited with 561, 488, and 405 nm solid-state lasers, respectively, using the optimal emission filter for each channel. 3D Airyscan2 processing was performed with standard filtering settings. With PBMCs from four donors, in six staining and microscopy sessions total of 930 valid volumes have been recorded, and are available at 10.5281/zenodo.8415196.2-dimensional image analyses Staining intensities, mitochondrial size, and punctate over diffuse index (defined as variance over mean) were determined in Image Analyst MKII 4.1.14 (Image Analyst Software, Novato, CA) in maximum intensity projection images using a custom pipeline available at https://github.com/gerencserlab/Superresolution-actin-and-mitochondria-analysis. Cellpose 2.0 with the “cyto2” neural network was used for finding cells in the images based on nuclear and actin staining80. Protruding actin bundles were analyzed by first binarizing projection images of actin using the trainable LABKIT segmentation81, and this was followed by separation of protrusions and measurement of their maximal distance from the bulk of the cell using morphological erosion and distance image functions in Image Analyst MKII. Rescaled projection images were saved and further analyzed in CellProfiler 4.2.482, where images were segmented for nuclei and these segments were extended to the cell boundaries based on the phalloidin staining. These profiles were used for measuring shape, granularity spectrum, and texture in actin, mitochondria, and nuclei. For actin granularity spectrum measurement the following parameters were used in CellProfiler MeasureGranularity function: “Subsampling factor for granularity measurements” = 1, “Subsampling factor for background reduction = 0.125”, “Radius of structuring element” = 12, “Range of granular spectrum” = 16. Similar results were obtained using a set of discrete Fourier transformation-based Butterworth bandpass filters in Image Analyst MKII for analysis of actin granularity spectrum changes in simulated microgravity and TLR stimulation. Here a series of 16 adjacent 4-pixels wide (in Fourier space of a 512 × 512 pixels image), 300-order bandpass filters with “Corrected Integral” normalization and absolute value calculation83 were used starting at 1 pixel, and mean pixel intensities over whole cells in the filtered images were normalized to the unfiltered image. We have previously shown that this technique is primarily sensitive to sub-resolution changes in thickness of underlying filamentous structures84, such as actin bundles in this case. We found no changes in granularity spectra measured by CellProfiler or Image Analyst MKII when analyzing mitochondria or nuclei of the same cells, excluding optical biases.3-dimensional image analyses Mitochondria:cell volume fraction was measured using a modification of the “Mitochondria:cell volume fractionator (basic)” pipeline in Image Analyst MKII85, using the hole-filled actin image as cell marker and MitoTracker Red as mitochondrial marker, and all image planes to measure areas of mitochondrial and cell profiles. Cell and nucleus volumes and surface areas were measured using Imaris 9.9 (Oxford Instruments, Concord, MA) using the Cell and Batch modules. For 2D and 3D image analyses, tabular data generated by Image Analyst MKII, CellProfiler, and Imaris were matched to conditions in Microsoft Excel and in Mathematica 13 (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL) and visualized in Prism 9 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) for statistical analysis. Two-tailed Welch’s t test is used for all comparisons.Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA G-LISA activation assay PBMCs from different conditions were collected and 7 × 106 cells were lysed and snap-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysate protein concentrations were measured using Precision Red Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (cat# ADV02, Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) and equalized. The GTP-bound Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA levels were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (cat# BK127-S, BK128-S, and BK124-S respectively, Cytoskeleton Inc.) and measured with a spectrophotometer at 490 nm.ROS detection The abundance of ROS was measured via 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA). Collected cells (100,000 cells per well) from each condition were incubated with 10 μM DCFDA Staining Buffer in dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes as per the manufacturer’s suggestions (cat# 601520; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The fluorescence was measured with a Pherastar FSx (BMG Labtech Inc., Cary, NC) microplate reader with the excitation wavelength at 495 nm, and emission at 530 nm.Luminex bead array Cell culture media (supernatant) from all experimental conditions were separately collected and snap-frozen. Samples were sent to the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center and MILLIPLEX 48 Plex Premixed Magnetic Bead Panel (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) was performed per the manufacturers’ instructions.IFN ELISA level measurement Cell culture media (supernatant) from microgravity and 1G ± R848 were separately collected at each experiment and snap-frozen. The samples were then thawed and used to detect the levels of IFNγ (cat# 430104; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA), IFNα all subtypes (cat# 41135; Pestka Biomedical Laboratories, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) per the manufacturers’ instructions.IL ELISA level measurement Cell culture media (supernatant) from microgravity and 1G were separately collected at each experiment and snap-frozen. The samples were then thawed and used to detect the levels of IL-8 (cat# 431504; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA), IL-6 (cat# 430504; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA), IL-1β (cat# 437004; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA) per the manufacturers’ instructions.Flow cytometry Single-cell suspensions from different donors and conditions were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain kit (cat# L34962; Invitrogen) for viability followed by Fc-blocking with human IgG (cat# AG714, Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 10 mins. For staining of intracellular cytokines, single-cell suspension was stimulated with 1 μM R848 in the presence of 2.5ug/ml Brefeldin A (cat# 420601; Biolegend) for 9 hours prior to surface staining. The cells were further stained with fluorophore-conjugated surface antibodies for 20 min at 4 °C and intracellular antibodies for 30 min at room temperature following fixation and permeabilization using Foxp3 staining buffer set (cat# 00-5523-00; eBioscience). The surface and intracellular antibody panel are listed in Supplementary Data 19. Cell phenotyping was analyzed on a Cytek Aurora instrument and analyzed using FlowJo.JAXA transcriptomic data JAXA cell-free RNA differential expression data was shared by Dr. Masafumi Muratani at the University of Tsukuba. Briefly, blood samples were collected from six astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. For this mission, we specifically made use of data from the samples of six astronauts, pooled into a single count, at day 5 and also at day 30, post-launch (i.e., in-flight), compared to pre-launch. In this study, human blood from astronauts was collected using Vacutainer EDTA-plasma separate gel collection tubes and centrifuged for 30 min at 3800 rpm (1239 × g, ISS) or 1600 × g (ground) before freezing at −95 °C (ISS) or −80 °C (ground). Cell-free RNA was purified from plasma samples through a TRIzol/chloroform method, sequenced (SMART-seq Stranded Kit, Takara Bio), and analyzed by the team leading the JAXA collaboration. Data was provided in csv format as normalized mean counts and normalized SEM of each gene at preflight and inflight time points. DEGs between 30 days in-flight and preflight time points were calculated by log2FC with p value < 0.05. The overlapping DEGs that are consistent in their log2FC directions with SC 375 gene signature are shown in Supplementary Fig. 16B.Inspiration4 mission data Four astronauts’ transcriptomic data from the Inspiration4 (I4) mission was collected by Dr. Christopher E. Mason and his team at Cornell University. Blood samples were collected before (preflight L-92, L-44, and L-3), during, and after (R + 1) the 3-day spaceflight in the SpaceX Dragon capsule. For this mission, we made use of data provided to us from the samples of the four astronauts comparing post-flight (R + 1) vs preflight (L-44) DEGs. Referring to the analysis workflow used by the I4 Cornell team, a list of fold change and p values based on post flight vs preflight findings was generated. The Seurat FindMarker parameters used to calculate I4 DEGs were the same as those used for our 375 DEGs. Next, the DEGs and pathway overlap from I4 single-cell analysis were calculated by using the methods described above in the section on Gene set overlapping analysis.NASA Twins study data Gene expression data from the NASA Twins study17 was provided by Cem Meydan in the Mason Lab in csv format and organized by Dr. Afshin Beheshti as normalized mean counts for four immune cell types. In brief, one astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the ISS, and his identical twin sibling was also monitored at the same time serving as a genetically matched ground control for this study. The NASA Twins study team provided DEGs in their four immune cell types with a list of fold change and p values based on inflight vs preflight findings. We reclustered our identified cell populations and computed DEGs accordingly. Next, the DEGs and pathway overlap from the Twins analysis were calculated by using the methods described above in the section on Gene set overlapping analysis.ROS reduction compound Quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) stock solution was prepared with DMSO at 1000×. In the cell culture experiments utilizing quercetin, the concentration of quercetin was decided based on existing literature86–89. After incubation with quercetin, cells were counted with a Cellometer Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter (Nexcelom, San Diego, CA), which utilizes Acridine Orange and Propidium iodide dual-staining systems to accurately distinguish live vs dead cells. After 25 hours of 50 μM quercetin treatment, the cell viability across PBMCs in both 1G and simulated microgravity conditions were at least 93%. There were no statistical differences in viability observed between the groups with and without quercetin treatment.Statistical analyses In addition to the methods described above, the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was used to assess whether the distributions of data from cell score or microbial abundance were significantly different between the 1G and uG cell populations from single-cell data. The association between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq in gene expressions was tested by Spearman’s correlation. Mann–Whitney test was performed on ROS reduction by quercetin. Unpaired parametric two-tailed t tests were performed on single-cell iAge, SenMayo, and imaging analyses for statistics. G-LISA, ELISA, Luminex, and DCFDA results were assessed by paired parametric two-tailed t test. However, given our existing transcriptomic and cytokine data showed decreased interferon coupled to increased IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 production in microgravity, for validation the flow cytometry results were assessed by one-tail paired parametric t test. In PBMCs bulk RNA-seq results, the difference in iAge and SenMayo scores of samples with or without compound treatment was evaluated by two-tailed paired parametric t test. R (version 4.2.0) and GraphPad Prism 9 were used to conduct the statistical analyses. Significance was set at 0.05. Outliers in datasets were assessed using Grubbs’ test (alpha = 0.01) and specified in figure legends if any were removed.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (21.4MB, pdf) Peer Review File (1.4MB, pdf) 41467_2023_42013_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (47.6KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (1.2MB, csv) Supplementary Data 2 (64KB, xls) Supplementary Data 3 (493.2KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 4 (1.2MB, csv) Supplementary Data 5 (67.5KB, xls) Supplementary Data 6 (1MB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 7 (3.2MB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 8 (2.3MB, csv) Supplementary Data 9 (807.6KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 10 (1.2MB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 11 (14.2KB, txt) Supplementary Data 12 (21.9MB, csv) Supplementary Data 13 (14.8KB, csv) Supplementary Data 14 (17.9KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 15 (2.5MB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 16 (83.5KB, xls) Supplementary Data 17 (555.2KB, csv) Supplementary Data 18 (83KB, xls) Supplementary Data 19 (14.5KB, xlsx) Reporting Summary (483.5KB, pdf) Source data Source Data (5.5MB, xlsx) Acknowledgements We would like to thank the crew members of I4, JAXA, and Twins study for contributing valuable samples to improve our understanding of the immune system in space.

    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts and poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space1–6. Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10–12, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.

    "methods": "Methods Institutional Review Board statement All participants consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX, and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board at Weill Cornell Medicine, under protocol 21-05023569. All crew members consented to data and sample sharing. I4 data compendium data generation Full methodology for sample preparation, nucleic acid/protein extraction, sequencing, mass spectrometry and analysis are reported in Supplementary Note 1. Sample collection has been previously reported12. I4 versus NASA Twins Study cytokine analysis Differential abundance analyses of cytokines and other analytes were conducted using a mixed-effects model. This model included fixed effects for time, treated as a categorical variable with levels corresponding to preflight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), immediate return (R+1) and recovery periods (R+45, R+82 and R+194). In addition, participant-specific effects were incorporated as random effects in the model. The P values for the coefficients obtained from this model were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. 10x Genomics snRNA-seq negative control data We acquired cryovials of PBMCs from a healthy man 22 years of age (AllCells) and stored them in vapour-phase liquid nitrogen cryotanks. Two cryovials from this donor were thawed and processed on two different days in the same week, at the same laboratory, using the 10x Genomics demonstrated protocol called Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000365). From each day’s nuclei suspension, ATAC and gene expression libraries were generated (in technical triplicates on the same chip) according to the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User Guide (CG000338) and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencer. The resulting single-nucleus GEX and single-nucleus ATAC files were aligned using the cellranger-arc pipeline (v2.0.2) from 10x Genomics against the human reference genome hg38. Quality control and cell annotation were performed on the snGEX gene-cell matrices using the R Seurat package (v4.2.0)36. Subpopulations were clustered and labelled using a publicly available Azimuth human PBMC reference37 in conjunction with Seurat’s supervised clustering functionality. DEG analysis for labelled subpopulations was performed using the FindMarkers functionality of Seurat, with a log fold change (logFC) cut-off point of 0.5. P values of resultant genes were measured using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and deemed significant for P < 0.05. Correlation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes in FP1 was characterized by summing up the accessibility in a promoter window consisting of the transcription start site ± 500 bp for every cell in a given cell type across every gene, normalizing it to counts per million, taking the log2 difference between the different timepoints and matching it to the log2FC from the differential RNA analysis. Recovery profile analysis DEGs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data were filtered for |logFC| > 0.5 and adjusted P < 0.05 for the FP1, RP1, RP2 and LP2 profiles. An UpSet plot of shared genes was generated using Intervene38. Overrepresented pathways were calculated using WebGestalt39 using the default parameters and the KEGG database. Pathways included in the analysis were within the top 40 lowest false discovery rate values or all pathways with a false discovery rate under 0.05. Transcription factor motif accessibility analysis chromVAR40 was used for the analysis of sparse chromatin accessibility from 10x Genomics single-cell data. The FindMarkers function of the Seurat package was used for differential analysis with setting mean.fxn as rowMeans and fc.name = “avg_diff”. The top five differentially accessible transcription factor motifs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data for the FP1, RP1 and RP2 were selected for visualization by heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated by the ComplexHeatmap R package. Calculation of individual variation To distinguish the analytes that varied with the greatest magnitude between individual crew members (C001, C002, C003 and C004), a coefficient of variation (CV) calculation was applied across measurements collected for each: metagenomic species, metatranscriptomic species, plasma protein abundance, EVP protein abundance, metabolite abundance, cytokine abundances (Alamar Bio) and gene expression values (Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq). CV calculations were performed using the formula ‘np.std(x, ddof = 0)/np.mean(x)’, where ‘x’ is the array of normalized analyte values and ‘np’ refers to the numpy scientific computing package (v = 1.26). CV calculations were split into pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), post-flight (R+1) and recovery (R+45 and R+82) intervals. The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data also include the in-flight (FD2 and FD3) interval. Before performing the CV calculation, data were first normalized. The ‘limma’ R package was applied to the plasma proteomic, EVP proteomic and metabolite data (v3.52). DESeq2 (v1.36.0) was applied to the Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq data. For microbiome data, to measure individual contributions per astronaut and for each tissue type (‘armpit’, ‘forearm’, ‘nasal’, ‘oral’, ‘post-auricular’, ‘T-zone’, among others), we averaged MetaPhlAn4, species-level, relative abundance values across our collected sample points. CVs were calculated for individual genes, proteins and microbial organisms. An abundance standardized CV calculation was also performed to correct for the mean/CV relationship in the assays. First, the normalized abundance values across all the analytes of a given dataset were split into approximately 100 mean-abundance quantiles (M_q where q is 1–100 or fewer, in case it resulted in less than 10 points per quantile group). For each quantile group, the mean and the standard deviation of CV values for the analytes belonging to M_q were calculated (CVmean_q and CVs.d._q, respectively) to prepare the mean/CV distribution reference set across all timepoints and samples. Then, for a given timepoint, the CV calculated for each analyte was matched to the corresponding CVmean_q and CVs.d._q based on cross-referencing to the M_q interval overlap. Finally, the abundance standardized CV was calculated as the z score of the CV as (CV − CVmean_q)/(CVs.d._q). Permutation testing of the post-flight versus pre-flight difference was performed by repeating this procedure 10,000 times on shuffled labels for samples, taking the difference. Rank and z score of the observed value were calculated against the random permutations to order the genes and used as input to fGSEA for pathway enrichment analysis. Gene Ontology analysis on abundance standardized CVs was performed with Enrichr41,42 using the default settings.

    "discussion": "Discussion Overall, these data represent a comprehensive clinical and multi-omic resource from commercial and non-commercial astronaut cohorts, creating, to our knowledge, the first-ever aerospace medicine biobank, while providing a platform for private citizens to contribute to future astronaut biomedical studies. In addition, we have demonstrated that short-duration, high-elevation (585 km) spaceflight results in broad-ranging molecular changes, in which some of these changes mirror what has been observed during longer-duration spaceflight, including elevated cytokines, telomere elongation and gene expression changes for immune activation, DNA damage response and oxidative stress. Although more than 95% of markers return to baseline in the months after the mission had ended, some proteins, genes and cytokines appear to be activated only in the recovery period after spaceflight and persist post-flight for at least 3 months. These results collectively indicate a dynamic recovery profile that substantially reverses the direction of differential gene expression in multiple key biological pathways from the post-flight timepoint (R+1) and afterward. This suggests that re-adaptation to Earth activates a range of restorative mechanisms that help to recover, at least in part, the physiological stress imposed by exposure to the space environment. The systematic analysis of the molecular and cellular changes observed post-flight afford us with a unique opportunity to capture naturally occurring health-restoring mechanisms, which can be used for therapeutic target discovery. Furthermore, we observed a nuanced regulatory landscape, in which enriched recovery pathways are both unique to individual cell types and span cell types in unique combinations. We have carefully indexed various profiles for flight, recovery and longitudinal analysis that are annotated in processed data files available in the NASA OSDR. The RP1 profile indicates that we need more frequent sampling in the 1–2 months directly after flight to untangle the gene and pathway responses during re-adaptation from spaceflight. This will be especially true during longer missions, in which re-adaptation will probably be more intense. Of note, these data are, to our knowledge, the first-ever joint single-nucleus chromatin profiles (RNA and ATAC) for astronauts, and they also leverage new methods that can track gene expression and epigenetic changes within the same cells. This single-cell, dual-measurement assay provides new data on the molecular changes and regulatory response to spaceflight (for example, chromatin and TFBS accessibility), and the data revealed distinct levels of stress and adaptation by each cell type. Specifically, the T cell and monocyte cell populations (CD14 and CD16) had the largest changes in expression and response of any cell type. The differences between PBMC subpopulations also suggest that single-cell sequencing can be helpful for delineating unique cell-type responses in future studies as well. Indeed, although the immune system and haematopoietic systems both show thousands of transient changes at the gene expression level, the chromatin architecture is distinctly disrupted, in both scale and duration, in these CD14+ and CD16+ monocyte populations. These cell types were also found to be disrupted in the NASA Twins Study7,23, and thus represent a key cell type to be studied for future missions. The cfRNA, dRNA and spatial RNA profiles revealed unique profiles that differed based on recovery and longitudinal analysis, suggesting that the multi-omic footprint of spaceflight is much wider than previously observed. Although some focused studies of cfRNA have shown that it can be used to detect mitochondrial increase in blood related to spaceflight7–9,24, to our knowledge, it had never been applied as a ‘full-body molecular scan’ to detect differential tissue and cell stress. Of note, the SOMA resource enables comparisons of the cfRNAs and cell-encapsulated RNAs, as well as the exosomal fractions, all within the same framework, which is essential for delineating and ranking the cells and tissues in the body that are the most disrupted by spaceflight. Similar to the utility of single-cell data23, the granularity of seeing cell lysis from all tissues across the body in one assay makes cfRNA profiling an ideal addition to some of the proposed standard measures for spaceflight monitoring. So far, cfRNA data indicate that each part of the body may show its own transcriptional response, shedding rate or RNA excretion rates, and thus each tissue should be examined on its own and then compared with other sites and assays. Similarly, in the microbiome data, the taxonomic classifications yielded differences in variation by body site, timepoint and crew member (Extended Data Fig. 8), indicating the need for multi-site and multi-omic sampling for ideal understanding of microbiome changes associated with spaceflight. However, this study is not without limitations. Although cell-specific comparisons could be made between the I4 mission and previous studies, the assays and collection protocols were slightly different (for example, column purification versus droplet-sorted cells), and thus comparisons will be imperfect. In addition, although the same tube types and methods were used whenever possible, cross-mission comparisons will inevitably include noise from various other types of technical variation, including batches of library preparation and extraction kits, slightly different collection intervals (L−3 versus L−10) and different sequencing or profiling technologies (for example, Illumina versus Ultima or liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry versus NULISASeq). Finally, as our comparisons to other NASA and JAXA datasets span, at most, 64 astronauts, these data are not sufficient to guide medical interventions or inference of mechanisms. As such, these SOMA data and resources should be viewed as preliminary molecular maps of the response of the human body to spaceflight. Future directions Nonetheless, the data from the I4 mission will be an invaluable resource for future studies. Deep analyses of secretome profiling25, single-nucleus multiome26, viral activation and ecological restructuring27, skin spatial transcriptomic profiling28, epitranscriptomic profiling22, and genome integrity and clonal haematopoiesis29 have already leveraged this resource. In future missions, additional biomedical profiling can help to delineate the short-term and long-term health effects of spaceflight, including changes in telomere length dynamics, DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, as well as additional sample types, such as hair follicles, tears, sperm and other biospecimens. Indeed, the remaining samples from the I4 mission have been biobanked for just this reason and to help the scientific community tackle future objectives12. In addition, aliquots of DNA, RNA, protein, serum, urine and stool from the protocols performed in this paper have acquired consent for release and are available (https://cambank.weill.cornell.edu/) for request, in which researchers can then append new results to this extensible SOMA repository. Differences between the biomedical and cellular responses of crew members may be caused by several factors, including inter-individual genetic differences (Fig. 5), the duration of the mission, the higher flight elevation (585 km), the unique environment of the SpaceX Dragon capsule, or a combination of these and other factors. To address these hypotheses, other molecular assays can be informative for future missions, including other epigenetics and chromatin conformation assays. For example, we have investigated using the method cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (Cut&Run) to profile histone modifications using 5,000 and 10,000 T cells as assay input (Supplementary Fig. 3a), down from the 10 million cells recommended in the original protocol30. T cells were collected from C002 during the R+194 recovery timepoint, but showed high variance at lower input. Nonetheless, the combination of current modifications profiled can be used to annotate active enhancer regions in the genome (Supplementary Fig. 3b), which is a novel profile for astronauts, and opens the door to better understanding of the gene-regulatory changes induced by spaceflight for each crew member. Molecular changes described here can also help to guide research and countermeasure development, but are only the start of the process of mitigating risks, especially as year-long and multi-year space habitat missions will represent greater biomedical challenges. To aid in this effort, the SOMA resource will continue to expand as further samples are sequenced from the I4 mission11,12 and samples are collected from future missions that travel farther into space, and then compared with other longitudinal, multi-omics cohorts31. Biospecimen samples have been collected and processed from Polaris and Axiom crews, and this Atlas also represents an open call for research participation for astronauts from any commercial or governmental programs. Finally, although the multi-omic data and resources from the I4 crew represent the largest release of data from astronauts to date, the I4 crew is still a small cohort, and represents only the first step towards resolving the many hazards and needs for long-term missions32, building towards enough statistical power and contextualization of normal human biological variation33,34. Fortunately, one of the crew members for I4 will continue to donate to the SOMA Biobank for multiple missions, including the Polaris Dawn mission, and data and samples from additional crews (for example, long-term Twins Study follow-up, Axiom Saudi, JAXA and Malta missions) are now being collected and integrated. These cross-mission datasets create a unique opportunity for long-term, in-depth analysis of the effect of spaceflight on the human body. Such data are especially important as missions travel farther away from Earth35 and for longer periods of time, in which the data and biomedical discoveries can help to prepare commercial and state-sponsored agencies for the lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.",

Copyright notice ID: 11357981 PMID: 38862028 Abstract Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts and poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space1–6. Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10–12, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions. Subject terms: Molecular biology, Medical research, Genetics An integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omics research from diverse spaceflight missions known as Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) is presented.Main With an exponential increase in launches since 2019, space is rapidly becoming more accessible1. Multiple commercial and state-sponsored groups are developing roadmaps to construct space stations, moon bases, Mars colonies and other permanent establishments beyond Earth1. Although innovation across the aerospace sector makes these ambitions technologically achievable, the biomedical challenges for crews in these extraplanetary habitats still need to be addressed, as humans did not evolve to survive in such extreme environments. The clinical consequences of this evolutionary mismatch of spaceflight exposure and adaptation have revealed a plethora of challenges to long-term space habitation, including a loss in bone density and muscle mass2, spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome3, perturbed immune function4 and spaceflight anaemia5. These physiological changes during spaceflight appear to imprint on the health status in humans; a chief example of this long-term effect is the increased risk of cardiovascular pathology observed in astronauts compared with age-matched controls6. Before long-term space habitation is feasible, these biomedical challenges must be understood and mitigated. However, the aetiologies driving them are not understood, with the low number of astronauts yielding limited opportunities for in-depth biomolecular characterization. For example, two of the largest multi-omic studies to date have been the NASA Twins Study, which has published an in-depth molecular and cognitive profile of a single astronaut7, and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) project, which has profiled cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cfRNA in six astronauts8,9. Thus, achieving statistical power requires integrating data from other cohorts, such as the MARROW study, and other missions5,10. Furthermore, these analyses are complicated by the substantial variation in physiological responses to spaceflight among astronauts. Therefore, there is a need for increasingly large, detailed multi-omic profiles of astronauts to characterize the diversity of physiological shifts as a function of spaceflight11. To achieve this end, we have leveraged the burgeoning commercial spaceflight industry. With the launch of SpaceX’s 2021 Inspiration4 (I4) mission, a cohort of all-civilian astronauts successfully completed a high elevation (585 km), 3-day orbital mission within a SpaceX Dragon capsule. Using recently developed protocols, the crew participated in a range of biospecimen collections before, during and after their mission12. We used the I4 biospecimens to deeply profile the effect of the stressors of spaceflight (for example, microgravity and space radiation) on crew physiology and health. We also compared these results with previous missions and control datasets, creating the largest-to-date molecular atlas of the effect of spaceflight on the human body, encompassing almost 3,000 samples and over 75 billion sequenced nucleic acids. Collectively, these resources are referred to as SOMA, and the samples are linked to a Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank (CAMbank) that stores viably frozen specimens for future, additional analyses. As with Earth-based cohorts13, these accessible data — when profiled and aggregated at scale — will enable the development of both personalized and general medical guidance for astronauts14. A large group of subject matter experts in artificial intelligence has recently released recommendations focused on the importance of generating and archiving space data into the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)15,16 to enable autonomous and intelligent precision space health systems, and to monitor, aggregate and assess biomedical statuses for future deep space missions17. In addition, the study of the parallels between the physiological effects of spaceflight and ageing, chronic disease and immune system disorders using omics data can pave the way for therapeutics applicable to conditions on Earth. Here we present a detailed guide to the SOMA resource, which includes the 2,911 samples collected during the I4 mission11,12, as well as spatial transcriptomics data, long-read profiles of astronaut RNA, microbiome data, exosome profiles and in-depth immune diversity maps. Additional spaceflight data were annotated and compiled into the SOMA portal to help contextualize gene, protein or metabolite dynamics, including data from the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA’s CFE mission8,9, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data after simulated microgravity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)18, and rat or mouse spaceflight data matched to human orthologues. In addition to rigorous dataset annotations, we detail (1) a comparison of conclusions on NASA Twins Study and flight dynamics comparing short-duration and long-duration missions, (2) cell-type-specific responses to spaceflight previously undocumented in astronauts, (3) cfRNA expression profiles showing haematological responses during recovery from spaceflight, and (4) additional analyses on individual responses to spaceflight from proteomic, transcriptomic and microbiome data. Data and samples generated in this study are available through SOMA (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu), NASA OSDR (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) and CAMbank (https://cambank.weill.cornell.edu/), which offer an unprecedented view of the multi-system omics changes before, during and after spaceflight.Comprehensive astronaut data resource To generate a comprehensive profile of the physiological changes of the I4 crew (29, 38, 42 and 51 years of age), 13 biospecimen sample types were collected and processed, including whole blood, serum, PBMCs, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) derived from plasma, dried blood spots, oral swabs, nasal swabs, skin biopsies, skin swabs, capsule (SpaceX Dragon) swabs, urine and stool specimens12. After collection, samples were subject to a battery of multi-omic assays, including clinical (CLIA) whole-genome sequencing, a clonal haematopoiesis panel, direct RNA-seq (dRNA-seq), single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq), single-cell B cell repertoire (BCR) and T cell repertoire (TCR) V(D)J sequencing, untargeted plasma proteomics (liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry), untargeted plasma metabolomics, cfDNA sequencing, cfRNA, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and spatially resolved transcriptomics. In addition, chemokine, cytokine and cardiovascular biomarkers were quantified, and a CLIA lab (Quest Diagnostics) was used to perform a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel (Fig. 1a). Datasets were generated across ten timepoints: three pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), three in-flight (flight day 1 (FD1), FD2 and FD3), one immediately post-flight (R+1) and three recovery (R+45, R+82 and R+194) spanning 289 days (Fig. 1b). Assays were performed on all crew members unless otherwise noted (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). Fig. 1. Compendium of astronaut omic data and time-series analysis paradigms. Open in a new tab a, Omics and biochemical assays were performed on blood (whole blood, serum, PBMCs, plasma, plasma-derived EVPs and dried blood spots), oral (microbiome swabs), nasal (microbiome swabs), skin (biopsy and microbiome swabs), environmental (env.; microbiome swabs) and excrement (excrem.; urine and stool) samples. b, The timepoints of this study are separated into four different categories: pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), in-flight (FD1, FD2 and FD3), post-flight (R+1) and recovery (R+45, R+82 and R+194). The coloured circles indicate which assay was performed at each timepoint. Assays were performed on all crew members, unless denoted with an asterisk. c, Indicator for which assay types have been previously performed in spaceflight studies, broken down by the NASA Twins Study, JAXA studies and anonymized NASA cohort studies. Anon., anonymized.A total of 2,911 samples were banked, with 1,194 samples processed for sequencing, imaging and biochemical analysis (Supplementary Table 1). These results and assays subsume and expand on work and protocols from previous missions, including the JAXA CFE study, the NASA Twins Study and some NASA astronauts (Fig. 1c). This latter category spans studies primarily from the International Space Station (ISS) that lack certain metadata, primarily duration spent in space and launch dates, to maintain astronaut anonymity. These studies include chemokine/cytokine biomarker panels (n = 46 astronauts), comprehensive metabolic panels, telomere length quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ISS-surface metagenomic profiling (Fig. 1c). The SOMA resources were first compared with the NASA OSDR database, which contains all publicly accessible human omics data from spaceflight and ground analogue studies. OSDR hosts 76 human omics studies, of which 11 are from human primary cells exposed to spaceflight. The other studies encompassed cell line and ground studies, including high-altitude studies (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2), which were all merged with the SOMA dataset. Once merged, the total number of sequenced nucleic acid molecules from this study represents a more than tenfold increase in the total amount of human omics data in the OSDR (Extended Data Fig. 1b), across all spaceflight studies, ground studies, cell line and primary cell experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Extended Data Fig. 1. Prior Work and Comparative Profiles. Open in a new tab (a) Prior human spaceflight omics study and sample counts with publicly available data, which is housed in OSDR. (b) Total number of sequence nucleic acid molecules in all prior studies (OSDR, blue) compared to this study (Inspiration4, red). (c) Visualization of the different analysis paradigms used when analyzing the time-series spaceflight data. The database identifier is provided as a shorthand to reference each comparison.The data from the missions were then divided into three analysis timeframes: (1) flight profiles, (2) recovery profiles and (3) longitudinal profiles (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Flight profiles reveal the most immediate effect of spaceflight, recovery profiles catalogue changes that occur after return to Earth, and the longitudinal profiles identify changes that have not returned to baseline after returning to Earth. We focused on several outputs for the resource, including first calculating differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for (1) PBMC snRNA-seq, (2) whole-blood dRNA-seq, (3) skin spatially resolved transcriptomics, and (4) cfRNA. We also mapped differentially methylated genes from whole-blood dRNA-seq, differentially accessible regions from PBMC snATAC-seq, isotype identification from TCR and BCR V(D)J sequencing, differentially abundant proteins from plasma and EVP proteomics, differential metabolites from liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry metabolomics, and microbial differentials from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assays (Extended Data Fig. 2), with all raw and processed data annotated in the OSDR (Supplementary Table 4).

The average telomere length in all I4 crew members increased during spaceflight (17–22% longer), and this trend was statistically significant (mixed-effects linear model P = 0.0048; Fig. 2a). This finding is particularly notable, given the shorter mission duration (3 days total) and higher elevation of the I4 mission than the ISS studies, indicating that telomere length dynamics respond much more rapidly to spaceflight than previously observed. Fig. 2. Telomere and cytokine Twins Study comparison. Open in a new tab a, Normalized average telomere lengths for I4 crew members, pre-flight, during flight and post-flight, determined by qPCR analyses of blood (DNA) collected on dried blood spot (DBS) cards (n = 32 samples for 4 independent participants across 8 timepoints). Two-sided P values were derived using a mixed-effects linear model that incorporated fixed effects for different timepoints (pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight and recovery) and random effects to account for variations among participants. The centre of the boxplots represents the median, the box hinges encompass the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values no further than 1.5 × the interquartile range (IQR) away from the hinges. b, Changes in downregulated (DN; purple) and upregulated (UP; orange) gene expression log2 fold-change directionality post-flight from the Twins Study versus I4 in CD19 B cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (statistical significance was determined by a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The number of genes is shown below the violin plots. The centre white dot represents the median, and the white line shows the range of the first and third quartiles. c, Relative cytokine/chemokine abundance pre-flight, post-flight and during recovery in the I4 crew versus the NASA Twins Study and anonymized NASA astronaut cohorts for CCL2, IL-10 and IL-6.

In panels c and d, the two-sided P values and adjusted q values were derived using a mixed-effects model that incorporated fixed effects for different timepoints (pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight and recovery) and random effects to account for variations among participants, except in the Twins Study, which had a single participant (n = 1). P values with an asterisk have a q > 0.05 after multiple correction testing.We then compared the DEGs and cytokine changes from the Twins Study with those observed in the snRNA-seq data from the I4 mission, as well as compared with the expected DEGs of the assay from replicate negative control donor PBMCs (see Methods). The cross-mission DEG comparison highlighted a consistent response between both types of T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ markers (552 and 608 DEGs, respectively, both <2.2 × 10−16), across both sorted T cells or single-cell annotated cells (Fig. 2b). Conversely, B cells were less responsive to spaceflight, as expected from previous work in the Twins Study7, which showed B cells as either not significant or less responsive to spaceflight. For the four overlapping cytokines measured in the Twins Study with our panel, we found significant increases in three: IL-6 (P = 0.014), IL-10 (P = 0.021) and CCL2 (P = 0.040) (Fig. 2c); these cytokines also showed changes and similar increases in other long-duration (more than 6 months) crews (Fig. 2c). However, we also ran a differential analysis of all cytokines detected on the I4 mission, to detect any differences from the Twins Study. Indeed, the levels of BDNF showed a statistically significant decrease (P = 0.00011, q = 0.0153), and IL-19 levels showed a statistically significant increase (P = 0.00015, q = 0.0153) during the post-flight (R+1) timepoint that returned to baseline during recovery (R+45 and R+82; Fig. 2d).Distinct RNA fingerprints of spaceflight Beyond recapitulating known biomarkers of spaceflight, the atlas integrated newer assays that were not available in previous missions, with a particular emphasis on RNA profiling. The first novel assay was spatially resolved transcriptomics on skin biopsies, which were obtained from all crew members during one pre-flight timepoint (L−44) and the day after landing back on Earth (R+1). The 4-mm biopsies were stained with markers for DNA, PanCK, FAP and α-SMA and then processed with the NanoString/Bruker GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, where regions of interest were selected based on the tissue structures identified by the fluorescence staining (Extended Data Fig. 3a). After filtering out outliers, the RNA counts were used for downstream data analysis, generating 95 regions of interest across four skin compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis and vasculature (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). This analysis revealed a distinct set of DEGs, including JAK–STAT signalling, and melanocyte signatures (Fig. 3). Extended Data Fig. 3. Transcriptomic Fingerprint of Short Duration Spaceflight.

NS, not significant; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001.A second RNA assay for spaceflight integrated into SOMA was cfRNA profiling, which has recently been established as a dynamic tool for mapping temporal alterations in cfRNA composition and cell lysis21. However, bulk cfRNA had not been utilized to measure the response of spaceflight until the JAXA CFE study8,9 and the I4 mission12. Using principal component analysis, we identified a distinct separation in cfRNA profiles pre-flight versus post-flight and recovery for I4, suggesting a systemic physiological shift probably induced by space travel (Extended Data Fig. 3d). This was further reflected in the differential abundance of cfRNA genes across various timepoints, revealing specific patterns of noncoding expression (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and RNA types (Extended Data Fig. 3f) that correspond with the spaceflight timeline. The cell-type proportions inferred from the cfRNA profiles also exhibited spaceflight-associated variation over time and showed variation distinct from a set of healthy blood donor controls (n = 35; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). Cell types that showed significant post-flight shifts in proportion included hepatocytes, kidney endothelial cells, haematopoietic stem cells and melanocytes (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 5). Of note, the melanocyte cell proportions that demonstrated significant changes post-flight (Fig. 3c) were also found in the spatial skin transcriptomics data, providing additional evidence of adaptive skin responses to the space environment. A third novel RNA method applied to these spaceflight samples focused on RNA isoforms and RNA modifications (epitranscriptome), through dRNA-seq on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION and deep RNA-seq (more than 400 million reads per sample) on the Ultima Genomics UG100. These data quantified genes that were differentially expressed and displayed differential N6-methyladenosine methylation (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b), or both, and were analysed for enriched Gene Ontology pathways. We identified a set of sites (set M-I; Extended Data Fig. 4b) that undergoes hypomethylation during recovery, another set (set M-II) that is detectably hypermethylated from spaceflight, and a set (set M-III) that exhibits novel hypermethylation during recovery and longitudinally as well. The common pathways in all three sets (Extended Data Fig. 4b) showed evidence of radiation and telomere response, including ‘TSAI response to radiation therapy’ and ‘Wiemann telomere shortening’22. In addition, the set of downregulated pathways after landing (recovery) was distinct, including genes associated with breathing regulation (for example, CO2 and O2 take-up and release by erythrocytes), which matches those pathways associated with crew response ranges (below, Fig. 5). Although further studies are needed to validate and delineate the potential mechanisms of these RNA dynamics (cfRNA, spatial and RNA modifications), these pathways suggest a potential relationship between RNA expression and methylation in regulating haematological and dermatological functions upon return to Earth.

We examined DEGs from immediately post-flight (FP1) through the recovery profiles (RP1 and RP2) to observe how gene expression profiles are re-established after spaceflight. The number of DEGs was used to quantify the severity and recovery of crew response, and we also compared identified DEGs from a negative control group, including two healthy donors and read-depth- and cell-count-matched permutation group (Extended Data Fig. 5), with an average of more than 700 cells per crew member, per timepoint, per cell type. The DEG count (adjusted P < 0.05, |log2 fold change (FC)| > 0.5) decreased from FP1 to RP1 in CD16+ monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, ‘other’ T cells (but not CD4+ or CD8+), uncategorized (‘other’) cells and in pseudobulk (calculated from additive counts across cell types to represent PBMCs). However, the DEG count increased in B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes (Fig. 4a); by RP2, all cell types had lower DEG counts than at FP1 and began to approach the expected noise range of single-cell DEGs (Fig. 4a). Extended Data Fig. 5. Single-Nuclei RNA-Sequencing Controls. Open in a new tab (a) The number of DEGs in I4 flight profiles (FP1: grouped crew or individual crew members), I4 longitudinal profiles (LP3: grouped crew or individual crew members), and negative control groups (mock control day 2 vs day 1, mock control same day technical replicate differences, and I4 inter-subject comparisons in preflight). All comparisons were done with downsampling to the same number of cells. Intra-timepoint subject comparisons are crew-to-crew comparison in the pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3), immediately post-flight (R + 1), and recovery (R + 45, R + 82) time intervals. The bars show the mean of the total number of DEGs, and error bars show the standard error for groups that have 3 or more comparisons summarized. (n = 4 independent subjects with 6 timepoints, and n = 1 control subject with 2 timepoints and 3 technical scRNAseq replicates for each timepoint.) (b) The number of total DEGs identified by DESeq2 and pseudobulk counts in I4 flight profiles (FP1), I4 longitudinal profiles (LP3), and negative control groups (mock control day 2 vs day 1). All comparisons were done with aggregation into a single sample for each crew and each cell type. The bars show the mean of the total number of DEGs. (c) DEG directionality heatmap represents the overlap of up-regulated (orange) and down-regulated (purple) DEGs across comparison groups (I4 timepoint comparisons, I4 individual variation, 10x negative controls).

Recovery profile dynamics in PBMCs. Open in a new tab a, Number of DEGs from PBMC snRNA-seq for each cell type during the flight, recovery and longitudinal profiles (adjusted two-sided P < 0.05, |log2FC| > 0.5). NK, natural killer. b, Fraction of DEGs shared with FP1 at RP1, RP2 and LP2 for each cell type. c, Directionality of log2FC between FP1 and RP1 and RP2 for DEGs present in both profiles. d, Bar chart of pathways of DEGs present in RP1 that were absent in FP1 in monocytes and T cells. Bars are shaded by the false discovery rate (FDR) value, and the enrichment ratio is on the x axis.As DEG counts were higher at RP1 than at FP1 for several cell types, we hypothesized the introduction of distinct DEGs after landing back on Earth. First, we calculated the percentage of DEGs unique to FP1 at both RP1 and RP2, focusing on cell-type-specific DEGs (Fig. 4b). By LP2 (L−92, L−44 and L−3 versus R+82), we observed that nearly all differential gene expression was driven by the same set of genes that were differentially expressed at FP1, with the exception of CD14+ monocytes, which had a unique longitudinal profile not strongly connected with the DEG responses in other cells. With the exception of CD14+ monocytes, the RP1 profile is distinct in the abundance of DEGs not present in FP1, but this perturbation almost entirely (more than 95% of genes) disappeared after flight (RP2 and LP2). From the DEGs shared with FP1, we observed that gene expression directionality reversed for nearly all DEGs between FP1 and each recovery profile (Fig. 4c), indicating a return to baseline for those DEGs. The exception to this were two genes from the CD14+ monocyte population — AHR (log2FC of 0.742 (FP1) and log2FC of 0.808 (RP1)) and PELI1 (log2FC of 0.539 (FP1) and log2FC of 0.560 (RP1); Fig. 4c) — in which there was a positive log2FC expression at both FP1 and RP1. From the DEGs that were unique to FP1, we next quantified the uniformity of the pathway enrichment between two PBMC lineages: T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and monocytes (CD14+ and CD16+; Supplementary Table 6). Of note, 211 (70.8%) genes were unique to individual cell types and 87 (29.2%) were shared between two or more cell types (Extended Data Fig. 6a). To identify enriched pathways among the gene set for each cell type, overrepresentation analysis was performed on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways (Supplementary Table 6). Even though 70.8% of genes were unique to each cell type, their response was more convergent; unique pathways only ranged from 4.2% (CD4+ T cells) to 42.5% (CD14+ monocytes; Extended Data Fig. 6b). Yet some pathways were cell-type specific, such as the circadian entrainment pathway in CD14+ monocytes, with genes GNG2, GNAS, PRKCB, CREB1 and CAMK2D driving the overrepresentation from the gene set for this pathway (Fig. 4d). In addition, our data suggest that overrepresented pathways are sometimes more associated with cell lineage (for example, all T cells) than with the individual cell type (for example, CD4). This is evident from the longevity-regulating pathway that shares the PRKACB, NFKB1 and PIK3CA genes between both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations (Fig. 4d). Extended Data Fig. 6. Recovery Profile Analysis. Open in a new tab (a) DEGs shared between the T cell and monocyte lineages for DEGs present in RP1, but not present in the FP1 profile. (b) Overrepresented KEGG pathways from DEG sets unique to the RP1 profile in the t-cell and monocyte lineages. The percent of pathways unique to each cell type are quantified along with the various configurations in which the pathway is shared between cell types and lineages.In addition, we found that certain pathways can be enriched across specific cell types belonging to different lineages. The inflammatory mediator regulation of the ‘TRP channel’ pathway, for example, was overrepresented in both CD8+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes, with each cell type contributing different gene sets associated with the pathway (Fig. 4d). Other pathways, such as the IL-17 signalling pathway, contain mixtures of shared genes and unique genes and are significantly overrepresented across all cell types (Fig. 4d). This also indicates that although cell types are distinct, they appear to have a set of core pathways in response to spaceflight, with 30–60% of overrepresented pathways shared both within and between lineages (Extended Data Fig. 6b). To examine the chromatin accessibility and regulatory landscape in each cell population, we then analysed the transcription factor-binding site (TFBS) motif accessibility changes from snATAC-seq data to identify the top motifs in flight and recovery profiles (Extended Data Fig. 7). We first observed that increased gene expression was correlated with more accessibility at the transcription start sites, and closed chromatin was associated with downregulated genes (all P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, for all cell types; Extended Data Fig. 7a). The motif accessibility changes associated with recovery profiles recapitulated the trend in gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, which showed lower accessibility in regions of the genome with closed chromatin and higher expression in regions of more accessibility (Extended Data Fig. 7b). In addition, we showed the top five upregulated and downregulated TFBS motifs per cell type in FP1, RP1 and RP2, which revealed both common and distinct motifs and their accessibility across cell types (Extended Data Fig. 7c–e). These data also provided further evidence of cell-type specificity in the differences of chromatin and transcription factor accessibility dynamics. Extended Data Fig. 7.

(d) Heatmap of accessibility z-score of top5 significantly increased and decreased TFs in each cell type in RP1. (e) Heatmap of accessibility z-score of top5 significantly increased and decreased TFs in each cell type in RP2.Intra-individual spaceflight responses To understand individual variation during spaceflight, the coefficient of variation was measured across microbial, proteomic, cytokine and gene expression normalized count data, calculated by time interval (pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight and recovery). Normalized coefficient of variation scores (see Methods) were calculated for each body area from the microbial swabs from both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. The oral and forearm microbial variation (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b) showed Rothia mucilaginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis as leading variable strains, but each body site has distinct higher coefficient of variation species (other body sites are shown in Extended Data Fig. 8c–j and Supplementary Table 7). Similarly, abundance standardized coefficient of variation scores were calculated for EVP proteomic, plasma proteomic, metabolomic, RNA-seq, dRNA-seq, and cytokine abundance normalized protein and gene counts (Extended Data Fig. 9a–f). To characterize the participant-to-participant variation and null distributions, we also calculated the differentials for FP1 along with label permutation testing on these calculations to confirm that post-flight coefficient of variation was not higher than other timepoints (see Methods; Supplementary Table 8).

The most variable analytes are labeled at the top of each violin plot. CV is calculated across n = 4 independent subjects in 6 to 7 timepoints for p = 16283, 8464, 527, 1765, 656, 203 analytes respectively from a to f. The center dot represents the median, and the black line shows the range of the first and third quartiles.We then utilized the data across missions (I4, Twins Study and JAXA), assays (scRNA-seq, cfRNA, bulk RNA-seq and proteomics) and cell types (CD4, CD8, CD14 and CD16) to find the most recurrent pathways associated with spaceflight. The most enriched pathways were antigen binding, haemoglobin, cytokine signalling and immune activation, which confirmed the DEG-related signatures and also validated the signatures from our I4 mission (Fig. 5). Moreover, the NASA Twins Study data and cfRNA profiles from the JAXA study confirmed many of the top-ranked pathways, while also showing differences between bulk blood RNA and protein markers and purified cell populations. These data indicate that leveraging both bulk and sorted cell populations can help to clarify signals coming from crew blood dynamics related to spaceflight.Access to datasets and crew samples This study introduces full accessibility of astronaut data to the scientific community. Datasets are accessible through an online web portal and scientific data repositories, as well as controlled access to more sensitive data (for example, genetic sequence data) and physical specimens. The online web portal splits the data into three data browsers: the SOMA browser, the I4 single-cell browser and the microbiome browser (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). The SOMA browser (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/SOMA_Browser/) enables visualization of gene expression (bulk RNA-seq, snRNA-seq, cfRNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomics), mass spectrometry (plasma proteomics, plasma metabolomics and plasma EVP proteomics) and microbial (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic) data. Gene expression and protein abundance are visualized for each astronaut by timepoint, with fold-change values, statistical significance (q value) and summary tables. Any selected gene is also then plotted across data for other missions, including the JAXA CFE study, the NASA Twins Study, mouse spaceflight datasets from NASA OSDR and Genelab, and control cohorts. For additional granularity, the single-cell browser (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Multiome/) provides visualizations specific to single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data, and includes quality metrics, cell-type annotations, gene co-expression and chromatin accessibility magnitude estimates. Finally, the microbiome browser contains metagenomic and metatranscriptomic boxplots (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Microbiome/) from each timepoint of the study, spanning eight skin locations, deltoid swabs collected pre-skin biopsy, swabs of the SpaceX Dragon capsule and stool samples. Extended Data Fig. 10. SOMA Web Portals. Open in a new tab (a) Three different web portals were created: SOMA Browser, Single-Cell Browser, and Microbial Browser. The SOMA Browser includes (b) gene expression and protein abundance measurements in line chart and volcano plot formats, (c) log fold change calculations, and (d) comparison of DEGs across different contrasts, assays, studies, and organisms (statistical tests dependent on comparison, please see website). (e) The Single-Cell Browser enables visualization of cell type specific information, including gene co-expression and ATAC-seq region peak visualization. (f) The Microbial Browser includes microbial abundances across timepoints from different annotation databases for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets (n = 4 independent subjects for 8 timepoints and 12 collection sites, or n = 9 environmental samples for 4 timepoints). The center of the boxplots represent the median, the box hinges encompass the first and third quartiles, and whiskers extend to the smallest and largest value no further than the 1.5x interquartile range (IQR) away from the hinges.The remaining biospecimens from this study have been preserved and catalogued for continued use by the scientific community (https://cambank.weill.cornell.edu/). These samples include venous blood plasma, venous blood serum, viably frozen PBMCs, vacutainer red blood cell pellets, urine (both crude and with nucleic acid preservative), extracted saliva nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), extracted whole-blood total RNA, extracted skin swab nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and extracted stool nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). A subset of these samples will be available for additional assays and hypothesis testing by other groups, and the remainder are allocated for long-term biobanking. These data and specimen resources for astronauts can help enable larger cohorts for increased statistical power and also for new biomedical technologies that will emerge in the future.Discussion Overall, these data represent a comprehensive clinical and multi-omic resource from commercial and non-commercial astronaut cohorts, creating, to our knowledge, the first-ever aerospace medicine biobank, while providing a platform for private citizens to contribute to future astronaut biomedical studies. In addition, we have demonstrated that short-duration, high-elevation (585 km) spaceflight results in broad-ranging molecular changes, in which some of these changes mirror what has been observed during longer-duration spaceflight, including elevated cytokines, telomere elongation and gene expression changes for immune activation, DNA damage response and oxidative stress. Although more than 95% of markers return to baseline in the months after the mission had ended, some proteins, genes and cytokines appear to be activated only in the recovery period after spaceflight and persist post-flight for at least 3 months. These results collectively indicate a dynamic recovery profile that substantially reverses the direction of differential gene expression in multiple key biological pathways from the post-flight timepoint (R+1) and afterward. This suggests that re-adaptation to Earth activates a range of restorative mechanisms that help to recover, at least in part, the physiological stress imposed by exposure to the space environment. The systematic analysis of the molecular and cellular changes observed post-flight afford us with a unique opportunity to capture naturally occurring health-restoring mechanisms, which can be used for therapeutic target discovery. Furthermore, we observed a nuanced regulatory landscape, in which enriched recovery pathways are both unique to individual cell types and span cell types in unique combinations. We have carefully indexed various profiles for flight, recovery and longitudinal analysis that are annotated in processed data files available in the NASA OSDR. The RP1 profile indicates that we need more frequent sampling in the 1–2 months directly after flight to untangle the gene and pathway responses during re-adaptation from spaceflight. This will be especially true during longer missions, in which re-adaptation will probably be more intense. Of note, these data are, to our knowledge, the first-ever joint single-nucleus chromatin profiles (RNA and ATAC) for astronauts, and they also leverage new methods that can track gene expression and epigenetic changes within the same cells. This single-cell, dual-measurement assay provides new data on the molecular changes and regulatory response to spaceflight (for example, chromatin and TFBS accessibility), and the data revealed distinct levels of stress and adaptation by each cell type. Specifically, the T cell and monocyte cell populations (CD14 and CD16) had the largest changes in expression and response of any cell type. The differences between PBMC subpopulations also suggest that single-cell sequencing can be helpful for delineating unique cell-type responses in future studies as well. Indeed, although the immune system and haematopoietic systems both show thousands of transient changes at the gene expression level, the chromatin architecture is distinctly disrupted, in both scale and duration, in these CD14+ and CD16+ monocyte populations. These cell types were also found to be disrupted in the NASA Twins Study7,23, and thus represent a key cell type to be studied for future missions. The cfRNA, dRNA and spatial RNA profiles revealed unique profiles that differed based on recovery and longitudinal analysis, suggesting that the multi-omic footprint of spaceflight is much wider than previously observed. Although some focused studies of cfRNA have shown that it can be used to detect mitochondrial increase in blood related to spaceflight7–9,24, to our knowledge, it had never been applied as a ‘full-body molecular scan’ to detect differential tissue and cell stress. Of note, the SOMA resource enables comparisons of the cfRNAs and cell-encapsulated RNAs, as well as the exosomal fractions, all within the same framework, which is essential for delineating and ranking the cells and tissues in the body that are the most disrupted by spaceflight. Similar to the utility of single-cell data23, the granularity of seeing cell lysis from all tissues across the body in one assay makes cfRNA profiling an ideal addition to some of the proposed standard measures for spaceflight monitoring. So far, cfRNA data indicate that each part of the body may show its own transcriptional response, shedding rate or RNA excretion rates, and thus each tissue should be examined on its own and then compared with other sites and assays. Similarly, in the microbiome data, the taxonomic classifications yielded differences in variation by body site, timepoint and crew member (Extended Data Fig. 8), indicating the need for multi-site and multi-omic sampling for ideal understanding of microbiome changes associated with spaceflight. However, this study is not without limitations. Although cell-specific comparisons could be made between the I4 mission and previous studies, the assays and collection protocols were slightly different (for example, column purification versus droplet-sorted cells), and thus comparisons will be imperfect. In addition, although the same tube types and methods were used whenever possible, cross-mission comparisons will inevitably include noise from various other types of technical variation, including batches of library preparation and extraction kits, slightly different collection intervals (L−3 versus L−10) and different sequencing or profiling technologies (for example, Illumina versus Ultima or liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry versus NULISASeq). Finally, as our comparisons to other NASA and JAXA datasets span, at most, 64 astronauts, these data are not sufficient to guide medical interventions or inference of mechanisms. As such, these SOMA data and resources should be viewed as preliminary molecular maps of the response of the human body to spaceflight. Future directions Nonetheless, the data from the I4 mission will be an invaluable resource for future studies. Deep analyses of secretome profiling25, single-nucleus multiome26, viral activation and ecological restructuring27, skin spatial transcriptomic profiling28, epitranscriptomic profiling22, and genome integrity and clonal haematopoiesis29 have already leveraged this resource. In future missions, additional biomedical profiling can help to delineate the short-term and long-term health effects of spaceflight, including changes in telomere length dynamics, DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, as well as additional sample types, such as hair follicles, tears, sperm and other biospecimens. Indeed, the remaining samples from the I4 mission have been biobanked for just this reason and to help the scientific community tackle future objectives12. In addition, aliquots of DNA, RNA, protein, serum, urine and stool from the protocols performed in this paper have acquired consent for release and are available (https://cambank.weill.cornell.edu/) for request, in which researchers can then append new results to this extensible SOMA repository. Differences between the biomedical and cellular responses of crew members may be caused by several factors, including inter-individual genetic differences (Fig. 5), the duration of the mission, the higher flight elevation (585 km), the unique environment of the SpaceX Dragon capsule, or a combination of these and other factors. To address these hypotheses, other molecular assays can be informative for future missions, including other epigenetics and chromatin conformation assays. For example, we have investigated using the method cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (Cut&Run) to profile histone modifications using 5,000 and 10,000 T cells as assay input (Supplementary Fig. 3a), down from the 10 million cells recommended in the original protocol30. T cells were collected from C002 during the R+194 recovery timepoint, but showed high variance at lower input. Nonetheless, the combination of current modifications profiled can be used to annotate active enhancer regions in the genome (Supplementary Fig. 3b), which is a novel profile for astronauts, and opens the door to better understanding of the gene-regulatory changes induced by spaceflight for each crew member. Molecular changes described here can also help to guide research and countermeasure development, but are only the start of the process of mitigating risks, especially as year-long and multi-year space habitat missions will represent greater biomedical challenges. To aid in this effort, the SOMA resource will continue to expand as further samples are sequenced from the I4 mission11,12 and samples are collected from future missions that travel farther into space, and then compared with other longitudinal, multi-omics cohorts31. Biospecimen samples have been collected and processed from Polaris and Axiom crews, and this Atlas also represents an open call for research participation for astronauts from any commercial or governmental programs. Finally, although the multi-omic data and resources from the I4 crew represent the largest release of data from astronauts to date, the I4 crew is still a small cohort, and represents only the first step towards resolving the many hazards and needs for long-term missions32, building towards enough statistical power and contextualization of normal human biological variation33,34. Fortunately, one of the crew members for I4 will continue to donate to the SOMA Biobank for multiple missions, including the Polaris Dawn mission, and data and samples from additional crews (for example, long-term Twins Study follow-up, Axiom Saudi, JAXA and Malta missions) are now being collected and integrated. These cross-mission datasets create a unique opportunity for long-term, in-depth analysis of the effect of spaceflight on the human body. Such data are especially important as missions travel farther away from Earth35 and for longer periods of time, in which the data and biomedical discoveries can help to prepare commercial and state-sponsored agencies for the lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.Methods Institutional Review Board statement All participants consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX, and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board at Weill Cornell Medicine, under protocol 21-05023569. All crew members consented to data and sample sharing.I4 data compendium data generation Full methodology for sample preparation, nucleic acid/protein extraction, sequencing, mass spectrometry and analysis are reported in Supplementary Note 1. Sample collection has been previously reported12.I4 versus NASA Twins Study cytokine analysis Differential abundance analyses of cytokines and other analytes were conducted using a mixed-effects model. This model included fixed effects for time, treated as a categorical variable with levels corresponding to preflight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), immediate return (R+1) and recovery periods (R+45, R+82 and R+194). In addition, participant-specific effects were incorporated as random effects in the model. The P values for the coefficients obtained from this model were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.10x Genomics snRNA-seq negative control data We acquired cryovials of PBMCs from a healthy man 22 years of age (AllCells) and stored them in vapour-phase liquid nitrogen cryotanks. Two cryovials from this donor were thawed and processed on two different days in the same week, at the same laboratory, using the 10x Genomics demonstrated protocol called Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000365). From each day’s nuclei suspension, ATAC and gene expression libraries were generated (in technical triplicates on the same chip) according to the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User Guide (CG000338) and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencer. The resulting single-nucleus GEX and single-nucleus ATAC files were aligned using the cellranger-arc pipeline (v2.0.2) from 10x Genomics against the human reference genome hg38. Quality control and cell annotation were performed on the snGEX gene-cell matrices using the R Seurat package (v4.2.0)36. Subpopulations were clustered and labelled using a publicly available Azimuth human PBMC reference37 in conjunction with Seurat’s supervised clustering functionality. DEG analysis for labelled subpopulations was performed using the FindMarkers functionality of Seurat, with a log fold change (logFC) cut-off point of 0.5. P values of resultant genes were measured using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and deemed significant for P < 0.05. Correlation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes in FP1 was characterized by summing up the accessibility in a promoter window consisting of the transcription start site ± 500 bp for every cell in a given cell type across every gene, normalizing it to counts per million, taking the log2 difference between the different timepoints and matching it to the log2FC from the differential RNA analysis.Recovery profile analysis DEGs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data were filtered for |logFC| > 0.5 and adjusted P < 0.05 for the FP1, RP1, RP2 and LP2 profiles. An UpSet plot of shared genes was generated using Intervene38. Overrepresented pathways were calculated using WebGestalt39 using the default parameters and the KEGG database. Pathways included in the analysis were within the top 40 lowest false discovery rate values or all pathways with a false discovery rate under 0.05.Transcription factor motif accessibility analysis chromVAR40 was used for the analysis of sparse chromatin accessibility from 10x Genomics single-cell data. The FindMarkers function of the Seurat package was used for differential analysis with setting mean.fxn as rowMeans and fc.name = “avg_diff”. The top five differentially accessible transcription factor motifs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data for the FP1, RP1 and RP2 were selected for visualization by heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated by the ComplexHeatmap R package.Calculation of individual variation To distinguish the analytes that varied with the greatest magnitude between individual crew members (C001, C002, C003 and C004), a coefficient of variation (CV) calculation was applied across measurements collected for each: metagenomic species, metatranscriptomic species, plasma protein abundance, EVP protein abundance, metabolite abundance, cytokine abundances (Alamar Bio) and gene expression values (Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq). CV calculations were performed using the formula ‘np.std(x, ddof = 0)/np.mean(x)’, where ‘x’ is the array of normalized analyte values and ‘np’ refers to the numpy scientific computing package (v = 1.26). CV calculations were split into pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), post-flight (R+1) and recovery (R+45 and R+82) intervals. The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data also include the in-flight (FD2 and FD3) interval. Before performing the CV calculation, data were first normalized. The ‘limma’ R package was applied to the plasma proteomic, EVP proteomic and metabolite data (v3.52). DESeq2 (v1.36.0) was applied to the Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq data. For microbiome data, to measure individual contributions per astronaut and for each tissue type (‘armpit’, ‘forearm’, ‘nasal’, ‘oral’, ‘post-auricular’, ‘T-zone’, among others), we averaged MetaPhlAn4, species-level, relative abundance values across our collected sample points. CVs were calculated for individual genes, proteins and microbial organisms. An abundance standardized CV calculation was also performed to correct for the mean/CV relationship in the assays. First, the normalized abundance values across all the analytes of a given dataset were split into approximately 100 mean-abundance quantiles (M_q where q is 1–100 or fewer, in case it resulted in less than 10 points per quantile group). For each quantile group, the mean and the standard deviation of CV values for the analytes belonging to M_q were calculated (CVmean_q and CVs.d._q, respectively) to prepare the mean/CV distribution reference set across all timepoints and samples. Then, for a given timepoint, the CV calculated for each analyte was matched to the corresponding CVmean_q and CVs.d._q based on cross-referencing to the M_q interval overlap. Finally, the abundance standardized CV was calculated as the z score of the CV as (CV − CVmean_q)/(CVs.d._q). Permutation testing of the post-flight versus pre-flight difference was performed by repeating this procedure 10,000 times on shuffled labels for samples, taking the difference. Rank and z score of the observed value were calculated against the random permutations to order the genes and used as input to fGSEA for pathway enrichment analysis. Gene Ontology analysis on abundance standardized CVs was performed with Enrichr41,42 using the default settings.Additional methods and details In-depth methods and protocol information for all assays in Fig. 1a is located in Supplementary Note 1.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Online content Any methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at 10.1038/s41586-024-07639-y.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (3.5MB, pdf) This file contains Supplementary Figures 1–3, Supplementary Tables 4 and 9, Supplementary Note 1 and additional references.

    "abstract": "Abstract As spaceflight becomes more common with commercial crews, blood-based measures of crew health can guide both astronaut biomedicine and countermeasures. By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development. Subject terms: Epigenomics, Metabolomics",
    "introduction": "Introduction As spaceflight and long-term human missions become more attainable, minimally invasive approaches to monitor physiological responses to spaceflight in diverse populations will be key to preventing acute and long-term complications1. The plasma proteome provides a catalog of proteins circulating in the blood, and thus it can paint an informative picture of the systemic physiological state of astronauts2, yet there are scant studies of astronaut plasma proteomics. Previous plasma proteomic studies of long-duration spaceflight reported changes in platelet function, coagulation, hemostasis, immune function, and metabolism3–5. In addition, various ground-based analog studies (i.e. head-down bed rest) have reported blood proteomic changes including complement activation, acute inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombosis6,7. Moreover, da Silveira et al. demonstrated that mitochondrial disruption and oxidative stress were the key hubs for increased health risks7, based on miRNA biomarkers in plasma. Plasma-circulating extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) and metabolites provide additional information regarding the cellular phenotype and state of distal organs and tissues8,9. EVPs are actively released into the peripheral circulation at concentrations of > 109 vesicles/mL, and are demonstrated biomarkers in cancer8, traumatic brain injury10, and autoimmune diseases11. Thus, EVP cargo analysis could be used to monitor health risks associated with space exploration, such as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)12 and thrombosis13,14, but studies of spaceflight-induced changes in EVP cargo have been limited15. Moreover, for metabolites, prior missions have focused on markers of bone metabolism and musculoskeletal deconditioning, including increased osteogenesis and resorption markers (e.g., osteocalcin, sclerostin, parathyroid hormone, osteoprotegerin, and RANKL) in the blood of crew members16–19, and could benefit from a wider profile. The decreased muscular activity associated with spaceflight leads to a loss of nitrogen and an inability to maintain whole-body protein synthesis rates, exacerbated by hypocaloric intake20, but this has not been examined in EVPs or metabolites in recent missions. Prior missions have also revealed spaceflight anemia, with circulating red blood cells and plasma volume decreases of 10–15%, leading to increased iron availability21, though the effect of these changes on EVP cargo is unknown. The NASA Twins study provided the first profile and multi-omic analysis of the plasma proteome, EVP proteome, and plasma metabolome, namely from a one-year, long-duration mission22. For that study, EVP protein cargo showed changes related to physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and the first indication of brain-derived proteins in plasma-circulating EVPs15. However, the NASA Twins study only used untargeted plasma proteomics (capturing 292 proteins) to discern an increased ratio of apolipoprotein B (APOB) to apolipoprotein A1 (APO1)22. Of the 60 plasma metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycolysis, amino acid, fatty acid, ketone body, and pyrimidine metabolism, no significant changes for in-flight levels were found22. However, it is necessary to expand the NASA Twins study findings to an increased number of samples, larger coverage of metabolomics, broader coverage of plasma proteomics, longitudinal data of EVP proteomics, and a systematic integration and meta-analysis of secretome changes with other multi-omic data7. The SpaceX inspiration4 (i4) mission provided the first opportunity for such an expanded study, and it also was notable as the first all-civilian space flight mission, featuring 2 male and 2 female astronauts aged 29 to 50 years, who traveled into space for 3 days in orbit at 590 km altitude. We profiled the spaceflight secretome (plasma proteome and metabolome, and EVP proteome) of the i4 astronauts at three pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and three post-flight timepoints (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82). We performed differential and pathway enrichment analysis of the proteome and metabolome to reveal the biological landscape of the secretome changes induced by 3-day spaceflight. Then, we delineated the contribution of blood and immune cells by comparing secretome and transcriptomic profiles obtained from the i4 single-nuclei PBMC and whole-blood RNA-seq. We performed thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS) measurement assays, EVP immune cell marker profiling, Western blots, and ELISA to validate findings. The unique insight of integrating these different modalities (proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) in our study provides the largest comprehensive assessment of the systemic physiologic and secreted changes resulting from spaceflight exposure to date.",
    "methods": "Methods Blood pre-processing and EVP (extracellular vesicle and particle) isolation Detailed descriptions of the methods pertaining to all proteomics/metabolomics/transcriptomics assays mentioned in this paper can be found in the “protocol” section of the GeneLab OSDR links found below92. Briefly, blood was collected in K2 EDTA tube(s) and shipped overnight on ice. Plasma was isolated by differential centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 minutes and 3000 x g for 20 min as previously described in refs. 24,93. The supernatant was collected and aliquoted for long-term storage at −80 °C and for EVP isolation. Plasma EVPs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation, as previously described in refs. 25. EVP protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Additional sample collection methods and data generation have been also detailed in the protocols paper24. Plasma proteomic profiling Detailed methods for proteomic, metabolic and transcriptomic profiling are described in Overbey et al. 2024. Briefly, plasma was isolated from cell preparation tubes (CPTs) and processed with Seer’s Proteograph Analysis Suite23. Seer’s standard 5-nanoparticle (5-NP) panel was used to enrich low abundance proteins followed by LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode. The list of differentially abundant proteins from the I4-FP1 and I4-FP4 plasma proteomics dataset in Overbey et al. 2024 was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 192. Extracellular vesicles and particle (EVP) proteomic profiling EVP proteomic profiling was described in Overbey et al. 202492. Briefly, plasma samples were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 20 minutes and then EVPs were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 70 min. EVPs were then washed in PBS and again collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 70 min. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS. Two micrograms of enriched EVPs were digested and analyzed with LC-MS/MS in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. The list of differentially abundant proteins from the I4-FP1 and I4-FP4 plasma proteomics dataset in Overbey et al. was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 192. Plasma metabolite profiling Plasma metabolite profiling was described in Overbey et al. 202493. Briefly, plasma metabolites were isolated using a combination of aqueous normal phase (ANP) and reverse phase (RP) chromatographic separations and analyzed by positive- and negative-ion MS. Metabolites were annotated using an in-house metabolite database comprising 865 metabolites for ANP chromatography and a 270 lipid metabolite RP database, curated from the Agilent plasma lipidomic database. All metabolites identified are level 1. Namely, to be identified, the feature’s mass, chromatographic retention time (RT) and MS/MS fragmentation pattern had to match to measurements acquired from the analysis of a pure chemical reference standard in our lab’s in-house metabolite database. The list of differentially abundant metabolites from the I4-FP1 and I4-FP4 plasma proteomics dataset in Overbey et al. 2024 was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 193. Western blot validation of EVP markers We validated DEPs in human plasma-derived EVPs by immunoblotting. For this, 5 µg of EVP protein were subjected to denaturing electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred onto a PVDF membrane and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against human Galectin 3 Binding Protein (LGALS3BP) (mouse monoclonal IgG, 1:1000 dilution, sc-374541, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Ficolin-3 (FCN3) (rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:500 dilution, 11867-AP, Proteintech). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled IgG goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse (1 h incubation, 1:5000 dilution, Jackson Laboratory). All antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The immunocomplexes were developed using the SuperSignal™ Western Blot Enhancer (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the membranes were imaged using a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad). ELISA validation of plasma markers PF4 concentration in EVP-rich plasma (post-3000 x g spin) and EVP-depleted plasma (CPT tubes, see proteomic mass spectrometry analysis) was assayed with a PF4 ELISA kit (R&D, cat #DPF40) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay To assess the lipid peroxidation in plasma, we measured the levels of TBARS as by-products of lipid peroxidation using the Lipid Peroxidation (MDA) Assay Kit (Abcam, ab118970), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For this assay, 10 µl of plasma were used for generating malondialdehyde (MDA) adducts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) which were further quantified fluorometrically (Ex/Em = 532/553) against a standard curve ranging between 0-0.5 nmol TBARS/well. Data were analyzed according to the manufacturer instructions taking into consideration the plasma volume used for the assay and results were reported as µM TBARS. Repeated measures one-way ANOVA was performed to assess significance. Multiplex bead-based characterization/profiling of plasma EVPs by flow cytometry The relative abundance of specific, immune-related plasma EVP proteins, plasma EVPs enriched by sequential ultracentrifugation (1 µg of EVP protein) were characterized using the MACSPlex Exosome Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-108-813) according to the manufacturer instructions for overnight protocol for 1.5 ml reagent tubes. Data was acquired on a Cytek Aurora-5 (Cytek Biosciences, USA) instrument and analyzed using the FlowJo™ v10.8 Software (BD Biosciences). The relative abundance (represented as MFI) for each EVP epitope was normalized against the mIgG and the average MFI of EV markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81), and the results were displayed as a heatmap. Welch’s two sample t-test were used to calculate P-value. Heatmaps were generated using the R (v4.1.2) package pheatmap (v1.0). Single-nuclei gene expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells Detailed methods for sample collection and data processing are described in refs. 93,94. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. We followed the analysis pipeline as previously reported95. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference. Gene expression values were used to generate heatmaps. Selected pathways were used for the ssGSEA analysis. Direct RNA-sequencing on Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION The list of differentially expressed genes from the I4-FP1 direct RNA-sequencing dataset in Overbey et al. 2023 (In review at Nature) was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 0.5. Briefly, these differentially expressed genes were identified using Oxford Nanopore Technologies package pipeline-transcriptome-de96. Intervene was used to identify overlaps between differentially expressed genes and differentially abundant proteins in EVP and plasma datasets and create the Venn diagram97. PBMC gene expression data was obtained from the i4 PBMC single cell data. Direct RNA-seq gene expression, proteomic abundances, and PBMC gene expression values were normalized by pre-flight values. Overrepresentation analysis was performed with WebGestalt98. Integration of metabolomics and proteomics For the correlation-based network analysis, we used protein/metabolite pairs that showed a significant Spearman correlation (FDR < 5%) across all time points. In this network, proteins are depicted by ellipses, while metabolites are represented by square nodes. Edges between them signify significant correlation: a solid edge indicates a positive correlation, and a dotted edge signifies a negative one. The analysis considered differentially abundant proteins and metabolites that changed immediately post-flight (R + 1) compared to pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) to compute these correlations. Furthermore, the color of each node reflects the log fold change of that node post-flight (R + 1). Spaceflight and Mouse Groups Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were launched in December 2021 to the international space station (ISS) on the rodent research-18 (RR-18) mission for 35 days. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C and humidity of 30–70% with a 12 h light/dark cycle during the flight. This hardware has a housing density that is within the guidelines recommended by the National Institutes of Health. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. Ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in the same flight hardware cages. Upon live return, mice were exsanguinated by closed-cardiac blood collection under deep Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia, followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary euthanasia method to ensure death. Their brains were removed and prepared for analysis. The left hemi-brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h, and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right hemi-brains were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. GC mice were euthanized three days later. Animal experiments were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) on October 14, 2021 (Protocol Number: RR-18), Roskamp Institute IACUC on October 7, 2021 (Protocol Number RR-18). Immunostaining assays for PECAM-1 Brain sections were immunofluorescence stained against PECAM-1, a biomarker related to BBB. Six µm sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and washed in PBS for 20 min. Vascular network was labeled with DyLight® 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (1:100, Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature followed by 10 min wash in PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit antibodies PECAM-1 (1:100, NB100-2284, Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO). After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1.5 h with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (1:1000 in antibody dilution buffer; Life Technologies). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI solution (Life Technologies) and coverslipped with Vectashield® HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Six to 10 field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) at 20X magnification spanning the entire brain sections. Mouse Tissue EVP isolation and proteomic analysis Tissues were isolated from 6 to 8 week-old naive female C57BL/6 mice and processed as previously described in ref. 25. EVPs were isolated and unbiased proteomic profiling of EVP cargo was performed as described above. Mouse studies were performed in accordance with institutional, IACUC and AAALAS guidelines, and according to Weill Cornell Medicine animal protocol #0709-666 A. Tissue of origin deconvolution analysis To perform tissue of origin deconvolution, a list of proteins “enriched” or “specific” to 36 different tissues compiled from the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/) was used as pathway input to fgsea (version 1.22) with a minimum size=5 and maximum size=500. The list of differentially abundant features was ranked based on the t-statistic and used as gene list input. We have added the script used for this analysis to the github repository. The file corresponding to the 36 tissues was generated from the data in the link below: https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue/tissue+specific which include 36 tissues.

    "results": "Results Changes in the proteomic profile of plasma and EVPs after 3-day spaceflight To gain insight into secretome changes after 3 days of spaceflight, we profiled the plasma EVP proteins and plasma metabolites of the four i4 mission crew members (Fig. 1a) at three pre-launch dates (L-92, L-44, and L-3) and three post-flight timepoints upon return to Earth (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82) (Fig. 1a). For plasma proteomics, plasma was isolated using Cell Preparation Tubes (CPT) and processed with Seer’s 5-nanoparticle Proteograph assay23, while plasma EVPs were isolated as previously described24,25, and proteins were analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS (Fig. 1a). Plasma metabolites were extracted using Aqueous Neutral Phase (ANP) hydrophilic and C18 hydrophobic liquid chromatography, and metabolites were identified and quantified by MS (Fig. 1a). We identified a total of 2,992 unique plasma proteins and 1,443 unique EVP proteins, with an overlap of 1,030 proteins shared by plasma and EVPs (Fig. 1b). These shared proteins are likely plasma EVP proteins as well as proteins that can be either soluble/free or EVP-associated. Plasma and EVP proteins were then filtered based on the number of not-detected (NAs) so that at least one condition has no missing data and coefficient of variation (<0.5), with 1,765 plasma circulating proteins remaining in plasma and 527 in EVPs (Fig. 1b).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To profile acute and long-term changes in the secretome after 3-days of spaceflight, we performed two comparisons: 1) immediately post-flight (R + 1) vs. all pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) timepoints, as a measure of acute changes (short-term postflight, or SP) and 2) all post-flight (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82) vs. all pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) timepoints, representing long-term changes (long-term postflight, or LP). Interestingly, even though fewer unique proteins were detected in EVPs, we identified more differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in EVPs compared to plasma (151 DAPs in EVPs vs. 40 DAPs in plasma) at R + 1 (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1). Importantly, the majority of EVP DAPs returned to pre-flight levels over time, with only 10 EVP DAPs (6.62%) remaining differentially abundant long-term post-flight (Fig. 1c). However, most plasma DAPs (72.5%) remained differentially abundant at the last timepoint (R + 82) (Fig. 1c), indicating a greater degree of recovery, and longer duration, than the EVP DAPs. In addition, the EVP and plasma proteomes provided distinct information about spaceflight-associated changes. Specifically, 9 DAPs were shared between EVPs (5.96%) and plasma (22.5%) immediately post-flight (Fig. 1c). The 9 overlapping DAPs were Platelet factor 4 (PF4), Latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), Platelet factor 4 variant 1 (PF4V1), Alpha-synuclein (SNCA), Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), Fibronectin 1 (FN1), Axin interactor, dorsalization associated (AIDA), Multimerin 1 (MMRN1), and Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM3) (Fig. 1d). Of these, PRDX2 and SNCA increased, while ICAM3 decreased in both EVPs and plasma. Since PRDX2 is an antioxidant enzyme26, its elevation in EVPs and plasma at R + 1 may indicate elevated oxidative stress. Increased SNCA level in the blood, including in EVPs, is a potential indicator of brain inflammation and stress27,28. Also of note, ICAM3 downregulation may reflect impairments in T cell-Dendritic cell (T-DC) interactions and immune function, as ICAM3 is crucial for the initial interaction between these two immune cells29. In addition, proteins associated with wound healing and coagulation, including PF4, PF4V1, and LTBP1, were increased in the plasma, but decreased in EVPs, potentially as a consequence of EVP capture in clots associated with spaceflight-induced thrombosis (Fig. 1d and Supplrmentary Fig. 1)14,15. However, PF4 and PF4V1 levels quickly returned to baseline, suggesting that the pro-thrombotic effect of spaceflight is temporary and reversible; these shifts of PF4 in plasma and EVPs were confirmed by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). To gain a functional understanding of plasma and EVP proteome changes after spaceflight, we performed biological pathway enrichment analysis for the R + 1 DAPs in both plasma and EVPs. Interestingly, though individual DAPs mostly differed in plasma relative to EVPs, pathways enriched in these DAPs showed a consistent profile in plasma and EVPs. DAPs involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, wound healing, coagulation, immune function, and hemostasis pathways were enriched in both plasma and EVP profiles (Fig. 1e, f). These findings indicate that the plasma secretome reflects the hematologic changes (hemostasis, wound healing, coagulation), immune response/inflammation changes, and molecular changes in ROS metabolism after the 3-day spaceflight. We also note the increased abundance of several proteins related to the complement pathway, such as FCN3 which remains upregulated even at R + 45. This was validated in EVPs by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Changes in the metabolic profile of plasma after 3-day spaceflight To capture spaceflight-related metabolic changes, we next profiled 1,135 metabolites in the plasma of the i4 crew using ANP hydrophilic and C18 hydrophobic liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry30. Differential analyses of the metabolomics data identified a variety of metabolic pathways affected by spaceflight, with 100 differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) identified when comparing the pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) to immediately post-flight (R + 1) timepoint (Fig. 2a, b). Notably, none of these DAMs remained differentially abundant at timepoints after R + 1, indicating that these metabolic changes are acute, and also that metabolic homeostasis is restored rapidly upon return to Earth. Fig. 2. Changes in plasma metabolites after 3-day spaceflight. Open in a new tab a Pie charts showing pathway annotations of differentially abundant metabolites (adjusted p-value < 0.05, |logFC | >1) at R + 1 vs. Preflight.

The dashed boxes indicate significant changes in some, but not all, chain lengths of the indicated lipid species. e Violin plots showing the results of Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay performed on astronaut plasma. Repeated measures one-way ANOVA was performed to assess significance. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Of the metabolites affected immediately post-flight, those involved in the purine metabolism pathway showed systematically increased abundance. Inosine, the metabolite with the largest positive fold-change (Fig. 2b), together with its precursor metabolite, purine, and its post-degradation metabolites, xanthine, and hypoxanthine, are all components of purine metabolism (Fig. 2c). We found that many of the most significantly altered metabolites belonged to the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway (Fig. 2a), likely driven by a decreased abundance of lysophospholipid (LysoPC) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) species such as methylcarbamoyl platelet-activating factor (PAF) C-16 and LysoPAF C-16 (Fig. 2b, c)31. Accompanying these changes, many metabolites involved in the sphingomyelin cycle were differentially abundant, including an increase in uridine diphosphate (UDP), some sphingomyelin and glucosylceramides (GlcCer) species, and a decrease in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (Fig. 2c, d). Since phosphatidylcholines (PCs) are the most abundant phospholipid species in cellular membranes, and membrane stability is disrupted by lipid peroxidation, we hypothesized that the decrease in PCs and LysoPCs (Fig. 2d) was indicative of lipid peroxidation secondary to spaceflight-induced production of free radicals32,33. The lipid peroxidation cascade generates a number of different intermediates depending on the target lipid species34. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is one of the major byproducts of lipid peroxidation and widely used as a biomarker of oxidative stress34. Therefore, to measure the overall lipid peroxidation in plasma, we quantified the levels of MDA adducts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS assay) (Fig. 2e), which revealed that lipid peroxidation was significantly increased (p-value = 0.0013) immediately post-flight (R + 1) and returned to baseline levels after several weeks (R + 45). Upregulation in production of antioxidants in the plasma and EVPs in response to spaceflight We next investigated the common signature of oxidative stress and cellular detoxification found in EVP and plasma DAPs35,36 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Specifically, ROS scavenging is dependent on ROOH and H2O2 detoxification via superoxide dismutase (SOD1, SOD2), catalase (CAT), and peroxiredoxins37,38. Compared to ground controls, plasma from post-flight astronauts displayed an upregulation of antioxidant proteins and a distinct metabolic profile retained at both the immediate and long post-flight timepoints (Fig. 3a). Antioxidant proteins were also significantly enriched in EVPs in the intermediate post-flight timepoint, along with metabolic proteins involved in anabolic metabolism and cell growth, which may improve donor cells’ antioxidant capacity and cell bioenergetics36,39–41. Our findings indicate the body upregulates the production of anabolic metabolism and antioxidants in the plasma and EVPs, especially in the immediate-post-flight timepoint, likely to compensate for increased ROS (Fig. 3a). At the longterm post-flight timepoint, these protein levels are abolished in the EVPs, but not in the plasma, which maintains an upregulation of antioxidant proteins and an altered metabolic profile. These data indicate that intracellular ROS levels and metabolic profiles can remain differentially abundant following spaceflight for at least 80 days after landing. Fig. 3. Integrated proteomic and metabolomic analyses reveal a common signature of antioxidant defense and immune dysfunction. Open in a new tab a The top (plasma) indicates significantly differentially abundant proteins in the plasma and EVPs from immediate or long-term post-flight or both immediate and long-term post-flight groups compared to ground controls.

Nodes are colored based on log2-fold changes immediately post-flight compared to pre-flight time points. c The antioxidant defense subnetwork is enriched in peroxidases, antioxidant enzymes, and antioxidant molecules, indicating activation of extensive antioxidant response. d The immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory response subnetwork is enriched in anti-inflammatory molecules and protein markers of immune cells that lower post-flight, indicating a deregulated immune response. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Integrating proteomics and metabolomics reveals a common signature of antioxidant defense and immune dysregulation To investigate the molecular processes at the interface of altered proteins and metabolites, we undertook a correlation-based, integrated approach. Specifically, we correlated the proteins and metabolites across all timepoints, using the annotated DAPs and DAMs altered immediately post-flight (R + 1) compared to pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3). As a result, we identified 26 significant (False Discovery Ratio (FDR) < 5%) correlations between plasma proteins and plasma metabolites. In contrast, 1,416 correlations were significant between EVP proteins and plasma metabolites (Fig. 3b). The significantly correlated molecules were visualized as a network with proteins and metabolites as nodes, and the correlation between them as edges. Among these changes, two of the most commonly observed molecular changes post-flight were oxidative stress and immune dysregulation, as discussed below1,22,42–47. First, we analyzed the interface between the ROS pathway and metabolites by correlating the proteins in the ROS pathway with metabolites. Exposure to radiation, microgravity, and hypoxia during spaceflight all induce the production of free radicals leading to oxidative stress, which can impact on cardiovascular, immune, neurological, and metabolic systems1. The ROS subnetwork from the i4 crew consisted of 26 nodes, including 6 proteins and 20 metabolites, with 38 correlation-based edges between the metabolites and proteins (Fig. 3c). All 6 proteins (100%) and 12 metabolites (60%) were lower post-flight, and 8 metabolites (40%) were higher post-flight. Within this subnetwork, three antioxidant enzymes from the peroxiredoxin family (PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX6) which scavenge peroxides within cells48, were increased immediately post-flight. In addition, three other enzymes that degrade ROS, namely SOD1, CAT and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), were also increased post-flight. SOD1 catalyzes the conversion of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide, which CAT can then degrade49. GCLC is a rate-limiting enzyme for the de novo synthesis of glutathione, a widely studied antioxidant that maintains the cellular redox balance50. Moreover, antioxidants, including inosine and taurine, were significantly increased immediately post-flight (q-value < 0.05). In addition to its antioxidant capacities, inosine dampens cytokine production, normally ameliorating inflammation51,52,6,53. Taurine is also an antioxidant that protects immune cells during oxidative stress54, and its upregulation suggests that immediate post-flight antioxidant production compensates for spaceflight-induced oxidative stress. We next analyzed the interface between the immune system and metabolism by correlating immune cell markers with specific metabolites. The immune subnetwork consisted of 56 nodes, including 10 proteins and 46 metabolites, with 95 correlation-based edges between the metabolites and proteins (Fig. 3d). All 10 proteins (100%) and 33 metabolites (71.7%) were lower immediately post-flight, and 13 metabolites (28.3%) were higher immediately post-flight. Within this subnetwork, all the protein markers of immune cells were decreased immediately post-flight. Moreover, our analysis indicated that anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecules, namely inosine, purines, and taurine, were increased immediately post-flight. While taurine and inosine are antioxidants51,54, purines (e.g., adenosine) modulate the immune system by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radicals51. In addition, 4-aminobutanoate (GABA), an immune-modulatory neurotransmitter, was also increased immediately post-flight, which can inhibit cytokine production55,56. This subnetwork may reflect widespread inflammation preceding the post-flight immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory responses, consistent with some of the NASA Twins Study results22 and studies of physiological stress, radiation, altered circadian rhythm42,43, and reactivation of latent herpes viruses44,57. Immune cells contribute to the observed secretome changes after spaceflight To delineate the contribution of immune cells to the secretome, we compared our proteomic data to single nuclei gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the i4 crew using the 10X Genomics single-cell multi-ome kits for epigenetic and gene expression profiling (see Methods). Of the ~30,000 genes detected in PBMCs, 273 genes were detected in both plasma and EVPs (Fig. 4a). In addition, 1131 genes were uniquely reflected in the plasma proteome while 163 genes were uniquely found in the EVP proteome (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. Immune cells contribute to the observed secretome changes after spaceflight.

Among the secretome-enriched pathways, immune function, oxidative stress, antioxidant, lipid metabolism, coagulation, and platelet activation pathways were selected. e MACSPlex analysis of immune marker expression in EVPs. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.When comparing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of PBMCs with the plasma DAPs and EVP DAPs (Fig. 4a), we found that 12 (30%) plasma DAPs and 27 (17.8%) EVP DAPs were also differentially expressed in the PBMCs. Of those overlapping DAPs, 6/12 were differentially abundant in the same direction in both plasma and PBMCs. Additionally, 14/27 of the overlapping EVP DAPs were differentially abundant in the same direction in both EVPs and PBMCs. This likely indicates that circulating and EVP proteins reflect gene expression changes in immune cells, while validating that secreted proteins can also originate from non-immune cells and distal organs. To further examine the connection between the EVP proteome and the PBMCs transcriptional states, we examined the overlap between EVP DAPs and PBMC DEGs. The crew EVP profiles showed a higher overlap with the DEGs among lymphoid cells (T cell, B cell, Natural Killer (NK) cell) than with myeloid cells (Fig. 4b), and the same trend was observed for plasma DAPs (Fig. 4b), indicating that lymphoid cells contributed more than myeloid cells to the observed changes in the secretome. Among the genes differentially abundant in EVPs and PBMCs, we noted several immune genes such as Integrin linked kinase (ILK), which was upregulated in EVPs and PBMCs, while carbonic anhydrase 8 (C8A) and complement C8 beta chain (C8B) were downregulated in EVPs and PBMCs (Fig. 4c). Among the antioxidant and oxidative stress-related proteins, PRDX2 was again upregulated in both plasma and EVPs, but was downregulated in DC cells, Monocytes, T cells and B cells, indicating that the upregulation of PRDX2 and EVPs seen in plasma does not originate from immune cells (Fig. 4c). To disentangle the relationship between immune cells and the pathways enriched based on the secretome DAPs, we calculated the fold changes of normalized enrichment score (NES) of immune cells at R + 1 versus pre-flight for the significantly enriched secretome DAPs pathways related to coagulation, immune function, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, platelet activation, and reactive oxygen stress (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 3). We found an enrichment in oxidative stress and ROS pathways in T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and DC at R + 1 compared to pre-flight timepoints. To gain insight into potential cellular sources of plasma EVPs, we used the MACSPlex Exosome profiler, which estimates the abundance of EVs expressing one of 37 markers specific for various immune cell types. We found significant increases in the pan-EVP marker CD958,59, integrin beta-1 (ITGB1, also CD29)60, and B/T activation marker (CD69)61 and significant decreases in Alveolar Type I/Brain (Receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor, ROR1)62–64, melanocytes (Melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, MCSP)65,66, T cells (CD3)67, additional pan-EVP markers (CD6368, CD81), B cell (CD24)69, and DC (CD1C)70 markers (Fig. 4e). The increase in CD9 at R + 1 correlates with an overall increase in EVP production post-flight15, while the decrease in CD63 and CD81 at R + 1 is consistent with the increase in CD9+ EVPs produced by platelets involved in coagulation. Of note, CD69 (a T and B cell activation marker) was increased at R + 1, consistent with inflammation revealed by the other omics analyses. The increase in ITGB1 (CD29), which complexes with integrin subunit alpha 5 (ITGA5, also CD49e)71, a heterodimer expressed on activated lymphocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), osteoblasts and which binds fibronectin and L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM, a central nervous system axonal protein), may be consistent with vascular permeability, and systemic inflammation. Several DC markers, CD24, CD1c, and CD209, were also decreased at R + 1, consistent with suppressed DC function. We hypothesized that the significantly changed immune markers in EVPs would overlap with the i4 immune cell DEGs (Supplementary Fig. 4). Indeed, we found that while DEGs in PBMCs were driven more by T and B cells, all cell types showed changes in vesicle regulation (Supplementary Fig. 5). CD3 delta, a pan-T cell marker, was downregulated in PBMCs, T cells, and their EVPs, whereas a different T cell marker (CD69) was downregulated in cells, but enriched in EVPs. This could indicate that CD69 is selectively shuttled into EVPs, or selectively enriched in EVPs derived from tissue-resident memory T cells. Moreover, CD63 was consistently downregulated in innate immune cells (DC, NK, macrophages) and EVPs immediately post-flight, indicating that cellular reduction was responsible for decreased EVP CD63 levels. Red blood cells do not contribute to secretome changes after spaceflight To delineate the contribution of blood cells to the secretome, we compared the gene expression profiles of whole blood direct RNA-seq data (Oxford Nanopore) from the i4 crew and identified 61 overlapping DEGs. We then compared the gene list with the plasma and EVP DAPs (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Interestingly, protein abundances in EVPs and gene expression in whole blood were inversely correlated (increased in EVPs and decreased in whole blood). The expression of these genes in PBMCs, however, was mostly aligned with the protein abundance, with at least one cell type showing a significant increase in PBMCs for SNCA. Of note, SNCA overlapped in whole blood DEGs, plasma DAPs, and EVP DAPs. Overall, 8 genes were shared between whole blood DEGs and EVP DAPs and one gene was shared between blood DEGs and plasma DAPs. To determine the contribution of whole blood and PBMC to the secretome, we then examined expression of these overlapping DAPs (AHSP, AK1, ANK1, BLVRB, EPB42, HBD, ENBP1, SNCA) before and after spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. 6c), and analyzed this list for enriched gene functions. Significant enrichment (q < 0.01) was observed in heme metabolism, anemia, hematologic disease, brain function (terminal button, axon part)-related pathways (Supplementary Fig. 6d). The gene SLC4A1 was present in nearly all overrepresented groups (excluding the cell cortex and axon part), indicating a brain-related phenotype that warranted further investigation. Brain-related signatures increased in the secretome after spaceflight Spaceflight exposes the human brain to several stressors, which have the potential to cause short-term and long-term neurological effects, including SANS, body fluid shift, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration12,72–74. In addition, an increasing body of evidence suggests that the spaceflight environment could induce blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption72,75–78. For example, EVP proteomic profiles of NASA Twins study obtained three years post-return from a year-long flight revealed brain-associated proteins in the plasma of the astronaut twin, but not the ground control twin15. Since EVPs are known to be released from distal organs such as the brain, and could be detected in plasma, we examined post-spaceflight EVPs for any enrichment of brain-specific or brain-associated proteins. Indeed, both EVPs and plasma DAPs were enriched for brain function and brain injury-related pathways (Fig. 5a), including neurodegeneration pathways, neuron death, and amyloid fibril formation. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis revealed that brain-associated proteins were increased in plasma at R + 1 (Fig. 5b), which matches orthogonal data from a JAXA cfRNA-seq study that also revealed an increase in brain-enriched proteins immediately post-flight (R + 3) (Fig. 5c) (study OSD-530 of 6 Japanese astronauts on the International Space Station, ISS). Of note, the spike in brain signatures for plasma, cfRNA, and exosome proteins was most pronounced in the days after landing back on Earth (R + 1 and R + 3) (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5. Brain-related proteins are enriched in the secretome after spaceflight.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. e Abundance of brain-enriched proteins in EVPs isolated from naive, ground control mice.To examine possible sources of spaceflight-associated brain signatures in plasma, two hypotheses were examined: (1) proteins are purposely packaged and shuttled from the brain into EVPs and released or (2) BBB integrity is disrupted, indicating “leakiness” of brain proteins. To address the first hypothesis, we examined EVP protein cargo data in 13 mouse tissues from a public EVP atlas25 (blood, thymus, lymph node (LN), brown adipose tissue (BAT), bone, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, white adipose tissue, and muscle). Of the 16 brain-annotated proteins, 3 were brain-exclusive (CNP, EP41, NRGN), 2 were highly enriched in the brain (Epb4L1 and PRKACA), and five others were highest in the liver. However, SNCA, semaphorin 7 A (SEMA7A), and small VCP-interacting protein (SVIP) were not detected in mouse brain EVPs, nor in other tissues (Fig. 5e), indicating that packaging of these proteins into EVPs is unlikely, given their absence in the murine brain tissue. To test the alternative hypothesis of BBB disruption, we examined the expression of biomarkers previously associated with BBB integrity, specifically S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B), Enolase 2 (ENO2) and Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (PECAM-1)79,80 (Fig. 6a, b). While the proteins ENO2 and S100B showed no significant difference for pre/post-flight, PECAM-1 showed an increase in the plasma protein abundance at R + 1 in C001, C003, and C004, and a postflight increase as well when measured at R + 45 and R + 82 (Wilcoxson rank sum, p = 0.07)(Fig. 6a). To further examine the in vivo changes in PECAM-1, we used brain tissue from rodents flown on the RR-18 mission, which spent 35 days on the ISS. After spaceflight, the RR-18 rodents were returned to Earth, wherein the flight samples (FLT) were dissected and fixed onto slides for straining at the same time as the ground controls (GC). Interestingly, significantly increased PECAM-1 immunoreactivity (n = 5 replicates, two-sided Student’s paired t-Test, p = 0.023) was detected in the FLT samples relative to the GC group (Fig. 6b), implicating PECAM-1 as a possible spaceflight-related marker for BBB integrity.

    "discussion": "Discussion Secretome profiling of the i4 crew after a 3-day spaceflight revealed significant changes in oxidative stress, brain homeostasis, and coagulation markers. These changes largely recovered post-spaceflight, although some proteins (particularly in plasma) still remained differentially abundant six months later. Although this study focuses on a short-term mission, our findings recapitulate several of the responses observed in the NASA Twins study including anemia, coagulation, and oxidative stress, as well as spaceflight-associated brain homeostasis alterations15,22, which indicate recurrent biological perturbations relevant for future crews and missions. Multiple studies have reported a higher risk of developing internal jugular vein thrombosis in the ISS crews than the general population, a condition that may lead to pulmonary embolism and long-term morbidity13,14,81. Fortunately, the overall risk of spaceflight-induced clotting returns to baseline upon landing, as indicated by normal levels of pro-thrombotic factors PF4 and PF4V1 in EVPs and plasma collected 82 days post-flight13,14. Most metabolic alterations induced by spaceflight were also temporary, with metabolic profiles rapidly returning to their pre-flight states upon return to Earth. Nonetheless, the 100 specific altered metabolites from spaceflight showed enrichment for oxidative stress, hemolysis, lipid peroxidation, and immune suppression pathways. These pathways included metabolites that have appeared in a previous study (the Soyuz-36-Salyut-6-Soyuz-35 mission), such as 1-methylinosine82. A 45-day head-down tilt study showed dynamic changes in taurine, glycine, betaine, creatine, and glutamine83, which also mirrored results in mice84, and taurine and inosine demonstrated correlations with several antioxidant enzymes. Indeed, in our proteomics data, we observed upregulation of several antioxidant proteins such as PRDX2, SOD2, CAT, and GPX1. PRDX2 increased in all crew members immediately post-flight (R + 1), while PRDX6 and SOD2 were decreased, and 2 proteoforms of catalase were increased in one crewmember after landing. A spaceflight mouse study also observed PRDX6 and catalase gene upregulation in skin samples85, while a tail suspension rat study observed upregulation of PRDX6 in the hippocampus86. Additional rodent studies have also shown changes in oxidative stress proteins (SOD1, SOD2, Xanthine oxidase, etc.) resulting from spaceflight factor exposure, both post-exposure and longterm86,87. Thus, we propose that the oxidative stress induced by spaceflight triggers the production of both proteins and metabolites with antioxidant functions. Signs of hemolysis were also evident, underscored by an increase in circulating protoporphyrin, a known marker of this process. The observed decrease in S1P plasma abundance could also signal a reduction in erythrocytes, cells responsible for maintaining S1P concentrations in the blood. Our data further indicated lipid peroxidation, a biochemical process known to disrupt cellular membrane stability and decrease cell viability. Complementing these findings, we found an enrichment in anemia-related genes in our whole blood transcriptomics data and signs of coagulation dysregulation, often associated with anemia, in both EVPs and plasma proteomics. Indeed, spaceflight anemia has been previously observed and reported, consistent with our observations87. Lastly, evidence of immune suppression was apparent. Aside from their roles as antioxidants, inosine and taurine possess immunoprotective properties. Along with the immunomodulatory metabolite GABA, these metabolites correlated with immune cell markers. Given that the abundance of these immune cell markers was low while immune modulatory metabolites were in high abundance, we hypothesize an activation of immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory responses after inflammation during the flight88. Our analysis of the i4 crew revealed a notable increase in several brain-associated proteins within both plasma and EVPs following spaceflight. Notably, SNCA was significantly increased in plasma, EVPs, and several immune cell types immediately after spaceflight, suggesting it represents a common protein marker of response to spaceflight. SNCA is associated with Parkinson’s disease, and elevated levels have been linked to brain dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s disease89. Therefore, understanding these protein changes can guide the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for managing neurodegenerative diseases in space and on Earth. However, further investigations are necessary to better understand the precise mechanisms and implications of changes in brain-associated proteins as well as means to modify their levels safely. Although these brain-associated proteins suggest some dysregulation of homeostasis in the brain, none of these proteins are unique to the brain, and thus it is possible that they may originate from other organs. Correlations between expression of these proteins in the brain and in the blood in response to spaceflight is required to confirm whether increased levels reflect dysregulation in the brain. However, a similar increase in brain-enriched transcripts/proteins was observed in JAXA Cell free epigenome (CFE) cfRNA (more than 120 days on the ISS), and the NASA Twins study EVP proteome, (1-year on the ISS) in-flight and immediately post-flight. We note that the amplitude and durability of changes in brain homeostasis and potential BBB disruption/neuroinflammation may be dictated by the length of time spent in space or distance from Earth. Previous reports of space flown mice on brain state have shown decreased brain derived neurotrophic factor, induced neuron atrophy in the cerebral cortex, and overall oxidative stress, regulated partially through c-Jun/c-Fos90. Moreover, a recent MRI-based study of astronaut brains found that spaceflight induced ventricular expansion in the brain91. Finally, increased hippocampal apoptosis and aquaporin-4 expression have been observed in other studies75, along with significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and decreases in the BBB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Given the murine and human data observed to date, as well as data from this paper, PECAM-1 is a strong candidate as a BBB biomarker that could be measured in upcoming missions. Overall, secretome profiling provides a minimally invasive, yet comprehensive approach to monitor crew health and physiology. Based on this work and follow-up studies, we propose to develop a liquid biopsy and biomarker panel to monitor space-associated health risk and link these to long-term work on countermeasures. Eventually such tools can generate reliable markers in response to spaceflight for more diverse populations (age, sex, health, background). Due to the limitation of the Dragon capsule equipment, we were unable to obtain in-flight secretome data for the i4 study, which would also be critical to study in the future. Additionally, creating more profiles from other crews and controls will help build a larger, more informative cohort, and further buttress and give context to the results seen in these data. Nonetheless, as human spaceflight becomes more prevalent, the necessity for deep secretome profiling can help establish baseline profiles for safer human space travel increases, and these tools can be part of the armamentarium of biomedical tools to help keep crews safe for upcoming, exploration-class missions, as well as continued health on Earth.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166969 PMID: 38862464 Abstract As spaceflight becomes more common with commercial crews, blood-based measures of crew health can guide both astronaut biomedicine and countermeasures. By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development. Subject terms: Epigenomics, Metabolomics Here the authors report spaceflight secretome profiles by integrating plasma proteome, metabolome, and extracellular vesicles/particles proteome from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, which showed differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins.Introduction As spaceflight and long-term human missions become more attainable, minimally invasive approaches to monitor physiological responses to spaceflight in diverse populations will be key to preventing acute and long-term complications1. The plasma proteome provides a catalog of proteins circulating in the blood, and thus it can paint an informative picture of the systemic physiological state of astronauts2, yet there are scant studies of astronaut plasma proteomics. Previous plasma proteomic studies of long-duration spaceflight reported changes in platelet function, coagulation, hemostasis, immune function, and metabolism3–5. In addition, various ground-based analog studies (i.e. head-down bed rest) have reported blood proteomic changes including complement activation, acute inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombosis6,7. Moreover, da Silveira et al. demonstrated that mitochondrial disruption and oxidative stress were the key hubs for increased health risks7, based on miRNA biomarkers in plasma. Plasma-circulating extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) and metabolites provide additional information regarding the cellular phenotype and state of distal organs and tissues8,9. EVPs are actively released into the peripheral circulation at concentrations of > 109 vesicles/mL, and are demonstrated biomarkers in cancer8, traumatic brain injury10, and autoimmune diseases11. Thus, EVP cargo analysis could be used to monitor health risks associated with space exploration, such as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)12 and thrombosis13,14, but studies of spaceflight-induced changes in EVP cargo have been limited15. Moreover, for metabolites, prior missions have focused on markers of bone metabolism and musculoskeletal deconditioning, including increased osteogenesis and resorption markers (e.g., osteocalcin, sclerostin, parathyroid hormone, osteoprotegerin, and RANKL) in the blood of crew members16–19, and could benefit from a wider profile. The decreased muscular activity associated with spaceflight leads to a loss of nitrogen and an inability to maintain whole-body protein synthesis rates, exacerbated by hypocaloric intake20, but this has not been examined in EVPs or metabolites in recent missions. Prior missions have also revealed spaceflight anemia, with circulating red blood cells and plasma volume decreases of 10–15%, leading to increased iron availability21, though the effect of these changes on EVP cargo is unknown. The NASA Twins study provided the first profile and multi-omic analysis of the plasma proteome, EVP proteome, and plasma metabolome, namely from a one-year, long-duration mission22. For that study, EVP protein cargo showed changes related to physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and the first indication of brain-derived proteins in plasma-circulating EVPs15. However, the NASA Twins study only used untargeted plasma proteomics (capturing 292 proteins) to discern an increased ratio of apolipoprotein B (APOB) to apolipoprotein A1 (APO1)22. Of the 60 plasma metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycolysis, amino acid, fatty acid, ketone body, and pyrimidine metabolism, no significant changes for in-flight levels were found22. However, it is necessary to expand the NASA Twins study findings to an increased number of samples, larger coverage of metabolomics, broader coverage of plasma proteomics, longitudinal data of EVP proteomics, and a systematic integration and meta-analysis of secretome changes with other multi-omic data7. The SpaceX inspiration4 (i4) mission provided the first opportunity for such an expanded study, and it also was notable as the first all-civilian space flight mission, featuring 2 male and 2 female astronauts aged 29 to 50 years, who traveled into space for 3 days in orbit at 590 km altitude. We profiled the spaceflight secretome (plasma proteome and metabolome, and EVP proteome) of the i4 astronauts at three pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and three post-flight timepoints (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82). We performed differential and pathway enrichment analysis of the proteome and metabolome to reveal the biological landscape of the secretome changes induced by 3-day spaceflight. Then, we delineated the contribution of blood and immune cells by comparing secretome and transcriptomic profiles obtained from the i4 single-nuclei PBMC and whole-blood RNA-seq. We performed thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS) measurement assays, EVP immune cell marker profiling, Western blots, and ELISA to validate findings. The unique insight of integrating these different modalities (proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) in our study provides the largest comprehensive assessment of the systemic physiologic and secreted changes resulting from spaceflight exposure to date.Results Changes in the proteomic profile of plasma and EVPs after 3-day spaceflight To gain insight into secretome changes after 3 days of spaceflight, we profiled the plasma EVP proteins and plasma metabolites of the four i4 mission crew members (Fig. 1a) at three pre-launch dates (L-92, L-44, and L-3) and three post-flight timepoints upon return to Earth (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82) (Fig. 1a). For plasma proteomics, plasma was isolated using Cell Preparation Tubes (CPT) and processed with Seer’s 5-nanoparticle Proteograph assay23, while plasma EVPs were isolated as previously described24,25, and proteins were analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS (Fig. 1a). Plasma metabolites were extracted using Aqueous Neutral Phase (ANP) hydrophilic and C18 hydrophobic liquid chromatography, and metabolites were identified and quantified by MS (Fig. 1a). We identified a total of 2,992 unique plasma proteins and 1,443 unique EVP proteins, with an overlap of 1,030 proteins shared by plasma and EVPs (Fig. 1b). These shared proteins are likely plasma EVP proteins as well as proteins that can be either soluble/free or EVP-associated. Plasma and EVP proteins were then filtered based on the number of not-detected (NAs) so that at least one condition has no missing data and coefficient of variation (<0.5), with 1,765 plasma circulating proteins remaining in plasma and 527 in EVPs (Fig. 1b).

Biological processes (BP) were selected, and treeplot was used to organize significant pathways (adjusted p-value < 0.05) into biologically relevant clusters. f Gene Ontology enrichment was performed using clusterProfiler::enrichGO() on differentially abundant proteins in the EVPs (adjusted p-value < 0.05, |logFC | >1) at R + 1 vs. Preflight. Biological processes were selected, and treeplot was used to organize and cluster the significant pathways (adjusted p-value < 0.05) into biologically relevant clusters. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To profile acute and long-term changes in the secretome after 3-days of spaceflight, we performed two comparisons: 1) immediately post-flight (R + 1) vs. all pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) timepoints, as a measure of acute changes (short-term postflight, or SP) and 2) all post-flight (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82) vs. all pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) timepoints, representing long-term changes (long-term postflight, or LP). Interestingly, even though fewer unique proteins were detected in EVPs, we identified more differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in EVPs compared to plasma (151 DAPs in EVPs vs. 40 DAPs in plasma) at R + 1 (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1). Importantly, the majority of EVP DAPs returned to pre-flight levels over time, with only 10 EVP DAPs (6.62%) remaining differentially abundant long-term post-flight (Fig. 1c). However, most plasma DAPs (72.5%) remained differentially abundant at the last timepoint (R + 82) (Fig. 1c), indicating a greater degree of recovery, and longer duration, than the EVP DAPs. In addition, the EVP and plasma proteomes provided distinct information about spaceflight-associated changes. Specifically, 9 DAPs were shared between EVPs (5.96%) and plasma (22.5%) immediately post-flight (Fig. 1c). The 9 overlapping DAPs were Platelet factor 4 (PF4), Latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), Platelet factor 4 variant 1 (PF4V1), Alpha-synuclein (SNCA), Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), Fibronectin 1 (FN1), Axin interactor, dorsalization associated (AIDA), Multimerin 1 (MMRN1), and Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM3) (Fig. 1d). Of these, PRDX2 and SNCA increased, while ICAM3 decreased in both EVPs and plasma. Since PRDX2 is an antioxidant enzyme26, its elevation in EVPs and plasma at R + 1 may indicate elevated oxidative stress. Increased SNCA level in the blood, including in EVPs, is a potential indicator of brain inflammation and stress27,28. Also of note, ICAM3 downregulation may reflect impairments in T cell-Dendritic cell (T-DC) interactions and immune function, as ICAM3 is crucial for the initial interaction between these two immune cells29. In addition, proteins associated with wound healing and coagulation, including PF4, PF4V1, and LTBP1, were increased in the plasma, but decreased in EVPs, potentially as a consequence of EVP capture in clots associated with spaceflight-induced thrombosis (Fig. 1d and Supplrmentary Fig. 1)14,15. However, PF4 and PF4V1 levels quickly returned to baseline, suggesting that the pro-thrombotic effect of spaceflight is temporary and reversible; these shifts of PF4 in plasma and EVPs were confirmed by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). To gain a functional understanding of plasma and EVP proteome changes after spaceflight, we performed biological pathway enrichment analysis for the R + 1 DAPs in both plasma and EVPs. Interestingly, though individual DAPs mostly differed in plasma relative to EVPs, pathways enriched in these DAPs showed a consistent profile in plasma and EVPs. DAPs involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, wound healing, coagulation, immune function, and hemostasis pathways were enriched in both plasma and EVP profiles (Fig. 1e, f). These findings indicate that the plasma secretome reflects the hematologic changes (hemostasis, wound healing, coagulation), immune response/inflammation changes, and molecular changes in ROS metabolism after the 3-day spaceflight. We also note the increased abundance of several proteins related to the complement pathway, such as FCN3 which remains upregulated even at R + 45. This was validated in EVPs by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 2c).Changes in the metabolic profile of plasma after 3-day spaceflight To capture spaceflight-related metabolic changes, we next profiled 1,135 metabolites in the plasma of the i4 crew using ANP hydrophilic and C18 hydrophobic liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry30. Differential analyses of the metabolomics data identified a variety of metabolic pathways affected by spaceflight, with 100 differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) identified when comparing the pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) to immediately post-flight (R + 1) timepoint (Fig. 2a, b). Notably, none of these DAMs remained differentially abundant at timepoints after R + 1, indicating that these metabolic changes are acute, and also that metabolic homeostasis is restored rapidly upon return to Earth.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Of the metabolites affected immediately post-flight, those involved in the purine metabolism pathway showed systematically increased abundance. Inosine, the metabolite with the largest positive fold-change (Fig. 2b), together with its precursor metabolite, purine, and its post-degradation metabolites, xanthine, and hypoxanthine, are all components of purine metabolism (Fig. 2c). We found that many of the most significantly altered metabolites belonged to the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway (Fig. 2a), likely driven by a decreased abundance of lysophospholipid (LysoPC) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) species such as methylcarbamoyl platelet-activating factor (PAF) C-16 and LysoPAF C-16 (Fig. 2b, c)31. Accompanying these changes, many metabolites involved in the sphingomyelin cycle were differentially abundant, including an increase in uridine diphosphate (UDP), some sphingomyelin and glucosylceramides (GlcCer) species, and a decrease in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (Fig. 2c, d). Since phosphatidylcholines (PCs) are the most abundant phospholipid species in cellular membranes, and membrane stability is disrupted by lipid peroxidation, we hypothesized that the decrease in PCs and LysoPCs (Fig. 2d) was indicative of lipid peroxidation secondary to spaceflight-induced production of free radicals32,33. The lipid peroxidation cascade generates a number of different intermediates depending on the target lipid species34. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is one of the major byproducts of lipid peroxidation and widely used as a biomarker of oxidative stress34. Therefore, to measure the overall lipid peroxidation in plasma, we quantified the levels of MDA adducts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS assay) (Fig. 2e), which revealed that lipid peroxidation was significantly increased (p-value = 0.0013) immediately post-flight (R + 1) and returned to baseline levels after several weeks (R + 45).Upregulation in production of antioxidants in the plasma and EVPs in response to spaceflight We next investigated the common signature of oxidative stress and cellular detoxification found in EVP and plasma DAPs35,36 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Specifically, ROS scavenging is dependent on ROOH and H2O2 detoxification via superoxide dismutase (SOD1, SOD2), catalase (CAT), and peroxiredoxins37,38. Compared to ground controls, plasma from post-flight astronauts displayed an upregulation of antioxidant proteins and a distinct metabolic profile retained at both the immediate and long post-flight timepoints (Fig. 3a). Antioxidant proteins were also significantly enriched in EVPs in the intermediate post-flight timepoint, along with metabolic proteins involved in anabolic metabolism and cell growth, which may improve donor cells’ antioxidant capacity and cell bioenergetics36,39–41. Our findings indicate the body upregulates the production of anabolic metabolism and antioxidants in the plasma and EVPs, especially in the immediate-post-flight timepoint, likely to compensate for increased ROS (Fig. 3a). At the longterm post-flight timepoint, these protein levels are abolished in the EVPs, but not in the plasma, which maintains an upregulation of antioxidant proteins and an altered metabolic profile. These data indicate that intracellular ROS levels and metabolic profiles can remain differentially abundant following spaceflight for at least 80 days after landing. Fig. 3. Integrated proteomic and metabolomic analyses reveal a common signature of antioxidant defense and immune dysfunction. Open in a new tab a The top (plasma) indicates significantly differentially abundant proteins in the plasma and EVPs from immediate or long-term post-flight or both immediate and long-term post-flight groups compared to ground controls. Antioxidant proteins are white-colored, and proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism are orange. The purple edges represent upregulated proteins, and the green edges represent downregulated proteins. The lower panel (inside the cell) shows the antioxidant and mitochondrial metabolism protein functions within the cell. b Overview of the bipartite correlation network with proteins and metabolites as nodes. Ellipses depict proteins, and metabolites are represented by square nodes. The edges indicate significant correlations between the nodes. A solid line indicates a positive correlation, while a dotted line indicates a negative correlation. Nodes are colored based on log2-fold changes immediately post-flight compared to pre-flight time points. c The antioxidant defense subnetwork is enriched in peroxidases, antioxidant enzymes, and antioxidant molecules, indicating activation of extensive antioxidant response. d The immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory response subnetwork is enriched in anti-inflammatory molecules and protein markers of immune cells that lower post-flight, indicating a deregulated immune response. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Integrating proteomics and metabolomics reveals a common signature of antioxidant defense and immune dysregulation To investigate the molecular processes at the interface of altered proteins and metabolites, we undertook a correlation-based, integrated approach. Specifically, we correlated the proteins and metabolites across all timepoints, using the annotated DAPs and DAMs altered immediately post-flight (R + 1) compared to pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3). As a result, we identified 26 significant (False Discovery Ratio (FDR) < 5%) correlations between plasma proteins and plasma metabolites. In contrast, 1,416 correlations were significant between EVP proteins and plasma metabolites (Fig. 3b). The significantly correlated molecules were visualized as a network with proteins and metabolites as nodes, and the correlation between them as edges. Among these changes, two of the most commonly observed molecular changes post-flight were oxidative stress and immune dysregulation, as discussed below1,22,42–47. First, we analyzed the interface between the ROS pathway and metabolites by correlating the proteins in the ROS pathway with metabolites. Exposure to radiation, microgravity, and hypoxia during spaceflight all induce the production of free radicals leading to oxidative stress, which can impact on cardiovascular, immune, neurological, and metabolic systems1. The ROS subnetwork from the i4 crew consisted of 26 nodes, including 6 proteins and 20 metabolites, with 38 correlation-based edges between the metabolites and proteins (Fig. 3c). All 6 proteins (100%) and 12 metabolites (60%) were lower post-flight, and 8 metabolites (40%) were higher post-flight. Within this subnetwork, three antioxidant enzymes from the peroxiredoxin family (PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX6) which scavenge peroxides within cells48, were increased immediately post-flight. In addition, three other enzymes that degrade ROS, namely SOD1, CAT and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), were also increased post-flight. SOD1 catalyzes the conversion of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide, which CAT can then degrade49. GCLC is a rate-limiting enzyme for the de novo synthesis of glutathione, a widely studied antioxidant that maintains the cellular redox balance50. Moreover, antioxidants, including inosine and taurine, were significantly increased immediately post-flight (q-value < 0.05). In addition to its antioxidant capacities, inosine dampens cytokine production, normally ameliorating inflammation51,52,6,53. Taurine is also an antioxidant that protects immune cells during oxidative stress54, and its upregulation suggests that immediate post-flight antioxidant production compensates for spaceflight-induced oxidative stress. We next analyzed the interface between the immune system and metabolism by correlating immune cell markers with specific metabolites. The immune subnetwork consisted of 56 nodes, including 10 proteins and 46 metabolites, with 95 correlation-based edges between the metabolites and proteins (Fig. 3d). All 10 proteins (100%) and 33 metabolites (71.7%) were lower immediately post-flight, and 13 metabolites (28.3%) were higher immediately post-flight. Within this subnetwork, all the protein markers of immune cells were decreased immediately post-flight. Moreover, our analysis indicated that anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecules, namely inosine, purines, and taurine, were increased immediately post-flight. While taurine and inosine are antioxidants51,54, purines (e.g., adenosine) modulate the immune system by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radicals51. In addition, 4-aminobutanoate (GABA), an immune-modulatory neurotransmitter, was also increased immediately post-flight, which can inhibit cytokine production55,56. This subnetwork may reflect widespread inflammation preceding the post-flight immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory responses, consistent with some of the NASA Twins Study results22 and studies of physiological stress, radiation, altered circadian rhythm42,43, and reactivation of latent herpes viruses44,57.Immune cells contribute to the observed secretome changes after spaceflight To delineate the contribution of immune cells to the secretome, we compared our proteomic data to single nuclei gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the i4 crew using the 10X Genomics single-cell multi-ome kits for epigenetic and gene expression profiling (see Methods). Of the ~30,000 genes detected in PBMCs, 273 genes were detected in both plasma and EVPs (Fig. 4a). In addition, 1131 genes were uniquely reflected in the plasma proteome while 163 genes were uniquely found in the EVP proteome (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. Immune cells contribute to the observed secretome changes after spaceflight. Open in a new tab a Upset plot of identified genes in PBMC and identified proteins in EVPs and plasma. b Overlap of immune cell DEGs, plasma DAPs, and EVP daps.

Among the secretome-enriched pathways, immune function, oxidative stress, antioxidant, lipid metabolism, coagulation, and platelet activation pathways were selected. e MACSPlex analysis of immune marker expression in EVPs. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.When comparing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of PBMCs with the plasma DAPs and EVP DAPs (Fig. 4a), we found that 12 (30%) plasma DAPs and 27 (17.8%) EVP DAPs were also differentially expressed in the PBMCs. Of those overlapping DAPs, 6/12 were differentially abundant in the same direction in both plasma and PBMCs. Additionally, 14/27 of the overlapping EVP DAPs were differentially abundant in the same direction in both EVPs and PBMCs. This likely indicates that circulating and EVP proteins reflect gene expression changes in immune cells, while validating that secreted proteins can also originate from non-immune cells and distal organs. To further examine the connection between the EVP proteome and the PBMCs transcriptional states, we examined the overlap between EVP DAPs and PBMC DEGs. The crew EVP profiles showed a higher overlap with the DEGs among lymphoid cells (T cell, B cell, Natural Killer (NK) cell) than with myeloid cells (Fig. 4b), and the same trend was observed for plasma DAPs (Fig. 4b), indicating that lymphoid cells contributed more than myeloid cells to the observed changes in the secretome. Among the genes differentially abundant in EVPs and PBMCs, we noted several immune genes such as Integrin linked kinase (ILK), which was upregulated in EVPs and PBMCs, while carbonic anhydrase 8 (C8A) and complement C8 beta chain (C8B) were downregulated in EVPs and PBMCs (Fig. 4c). Among the antioxidant and oxidative stress-related proteins, PRDX2 was again upregulated in both plasma and EVPs, but was downregulated in DC cells, Monocytes, T cells and B cells, indicating that the upregulation of PRDX2 and EVPs seen in plasma does not originate from immune cells (Fig. 4c). To disentangle the relationship between immune cells and the pathways enriched based on the secretome DAPs, we calculated the fold changes of normalized enrichment score (NES) of immune cells at R + 1 versus pre-flight for the significantly enriched secretome DAPs pathways related to coagulation, immune function, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, platelet activation, and reactive oxygen stress (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 3). We found an enrichment in oxidative stress and ROS pathways in T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and DC at R + 1 compared to pre-flight timepoints. To gain insight into potential cellular sources of plasma EVPs, we used the MACSPlex Exosome profiler, which estimates the abundance of EVs expressing one of 37 markers specific for various immune cell types. We found significant increases in the pan-EVP marker CD958,59, integrin beta-1 (ITGB1, also CD29)60, and B/T activation marker (CD69)61 and significant decreases in Alveolar Type I/Brain (Receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor, ROR1)62–64, melanocytes (Melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, MCSP)65,66, T cells (CD3)67, additional pan-EVP markers (CD6368, CD81), B cell (CD24)69, and DC (CD1C)70 markers (Fig. 4e). The increase in CD9 at R + 1 correlates with an overall increase in EVP production post-flight15, while the decrease in CD63 and CD81 at R + 1 is consistent with the increase in CD9+ EVPs produced by platelets involved in coagulation. Of note, CD69 (a T and B cell activation marker) was increased at R + 1, consistent with inflammation revealed by the other omics analyses. The increase in ITGB1 (CD29), which complexes with integrin subunit alpha 5 (ITGA5, also CD49e)71, a heterodimer expressed on activated lymphocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), osteoblasts and which binds fibronectin and L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM, a central nervous system axonal protein), may be consistent with vascular permeability, and systemic inflammation. Several DC markers, CD24, CD1c, and CD209, were also decreased at R + 1, consistent with suppressed DC function. We hypothesized that the significantly changed immune markers in EVPs would overlap with the i4 immune cell DEGs (Supplementary Fig. 4). Indeed, we found that while DEGs in PBMCs were driven more by T and B cells, all cell types showed changes in vesicle regulation (Supplementary Fig. 5). CD3 delta, a pan-T cell marker, was downregulated in PBMCs, T cells, and their EVPs, whereas a different T cell marker (CD69) was downregulated in cells, but enriched in EVPs. This could indicate that CD69 is selectively shuttled into EVPs, or selectively enriched in EVPs derived from tissue-resident memory T cells. Moreover, CD63 was consistently downregulated in innate immune cells (DC, NK, macrophages) and EVPs immediately post-flight, indicating that cellular reduction was responsible for decreased EVP CD63 levels.Red blood cells do not contribute to secretome changes after spaceflight To delineate the contribution of blood cells to the secretome, we compared the gene expression profiles of whole blood direct RNA-seq data (Oxford Nanopore) from the i4 crew and identified 61 overlapping DEGs. We then compared the gene list with the plasma and EVP DAPs (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Interestingly, protein abundances in EVPs and gene expression in whole blood were inversely correlated (increased in EVPs and decreased in whole blood). The expression of these genes in PBMCs, however, was mostly aligned with the protein abundance, with at least one cell type showing a significant increase in PBMCs for SNCA. Of note, SNCA overlapped in whole blood DEGs, plasma DAPs, and EVP DAPs. Overall, 8 genes were shared between whole blood DEGs and EVP DAPs and one gene was shared between blood DEGs and plasma DAPs. To determine the contribution of whole blood and PBMC to the secretome, we then examined expression of these overlapping DAPs (AHSP, AK1, ANK1, BLVRB, EPB42, HBD, ENBP1, SNCA) before and after spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. 6c), and analyzed this list for enriched gene functions. Significant enrichment (q < 0.01) was observed in heme metabolism, anemia, hematologic disease, brain function (terminal button, axon part)-related pathways (Supplementary Fig. 6d). The gene SLC4A1 was present in nearly all overrepresented groups (excluding the cell cortex and axon part), indicating a brain-related phenotype that warranted further investigation.Brain-related signatures increased in the secretome after spaceflight Spaceflight exposes the human brain to several stressors, which have the potential to cause short-term and long-term neurological effects, including SANS, body fluid shift, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration12,72–74. In addition, an increasing body of evidence suggests that the spaceflight environment could induce blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption72,75–78. For example, EVP proteomic profiles of NASA Twins study obtained three years post-return from a year-long flight revealed brain-associated proteins in the plasma of the astronaut twin, but not the ground control twin15. Since EVPs are known to be released from distal organs such as the brain, and could be detected in plasma, we examined post-spaceflight EVPs for any enrichment of brain-specific or brain-associated proteins. Indeed, both EVPs and plasma DAPs were enriched for brain function and brain injury-related pathways (Fig. 5a), including neurodegeneration pathways, neuron death, and amyloid fibril formation. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis revealed that brain-associated proteins were increased in plasma at R + 1 (Fig. 5b), which matches orthogonal data from a JAXA cfRNA-seq study that also revealed an increase in brain-enriched proteins immediately post-flight (R + 3) (Fig. 5c) (study OSD-530 of 6 Japanese astronauts on the International Space Station, ISS). Of note, the spike in brain signatures for plasma, cfRNA, and exosome proteins was most pronounced in the days after landing back on Earth (R + 1 and R + 3) (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5. Brain-related proteins are enriched in the secretome after spaceflight.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. e Abundance of brain-enriched proteins in EVPs isolated from naive, ground control mice.To examine possible sources of spaceflight-associated brain signatures in plasma, two hypotheses were examined: (1) proteins are purposely packaged and shuttled from the brain into EVPs and released or (2) BBB integrity is disrupted, indicating “leakiness” of brain proteins. To address the first hypothesis, we examined EVP protein cargo data in 13 mouse tissues from a public EVP atlas25 (blood, thymus, lymph node (LN), brown adipose tissue (BAT), bone, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, white adipose tissue, and muscle). Of the 16 brain-annotated proteins, 3 were brain-exclusive (CNP, EP41, NRGN), 2 were highly enriched in the brain (Epb4L1 and PRKACA), and five others were highest in the liver. However, SNCA, semaphorin 7 A (SEMA7A), and small VCP-interacting protein (SVIP) were not detected in mouse brain EVPs, nor in other tissues (Fig. 5e), indicating that packaging of these proteins into EVPs is unlikely, given their absence in the murine brain tissue. To test the alternative hypothesis of BBB disruption, we examined the expression of biomarkers previously associated with BBB integrity, specifically S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B), Enolase 2 (ENO2) and Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (PECAM-1)79,80 (Fig. 6a, b). While the proteins ENO2 and S100B showed no significant difference for pre/post-flight, PECAM-1 showed an increase in the plasma protein abundance at R + 1 in C001, C003, and C004, and a postflight increase as well when measured at R + 45 and R + 82 (Wilcoxson rank sum, p = 0.07)(Fig. 6a). To further examine the in vivo changes in PECAM-1, we used brain tissue from rodents flown on the RR-18 mission, which spent 35 days on the ISS. After spaceflight, the RR-18 rodents were returned to Earth, wherein the flight samples (FLT) were dissected and fixed onto slides for straining at the same time as the ground controls (GC). Interestingly, significantly increased PECAM-1 immunoreactivity (n = 5 replicates, two-sided Student’s paired t-Test, p = 0.023) was detected in the FLT samples relative to the GC group (Fig. 6b), implicating PECAM-1 as a possible spaceflight-related marker for BBB integrity.

In the control hippocampal region, few positive cells were found. In the hippocampal region of FLT mice, enhanced PECAM expression could be detected.

Scale bar = 50 mm.Discussion Secretome profiling of the i4 crew after a 3-day spaceflight revealed significant changes in oxidative stress, brain homeostasis, and coagulation markers. These changes largely recovered post-spaceflight, although some proteins (particularly in plasma) still remained differentially abundant six months later. Although this study focuses on a short-term mission, our findings recapitulate several of the responses observed in the NASA Twins study including anemia, coagulation, and oxidative stress, as well as spaceflight-associated brain homeostasis alterations15,22, which indicate recurrent biological perturbations relevant for future crews and missions. Multiple studies have reported a higher risk of developing internal jugular vein thrombosis in the ISS crews than the general population, a condition that may lead to pulmonary embolism and long-term morbidity13,14,81. Fortunately, the overall risk of spaceflight-induced clotting returns to baseline upon landing, as indicated by normal levels of pro-thrombotic factors PF4 and PF4V1 in EVPs and plasma collected 82 days post-flight13,14. Most metabolic alterations induced by spaceflight were also temporary, with metabolic profiles rapidly returning to their pre-flight states upon return to Earth. Nonetheless, the 100 specific altered metabolites from spaceflight showed enrichment for oxidative stress, hemolysis, lipid peroxidation, and immune suppression pathways. These pathways included metabolites that have appeared in a previous study (the Soyuz-36-Salyut-6-Soyuz-35 mission), such as 1-methylinosine82. A 45-day head-down tilt study showed dynamic changes in taurine, glycine, betaine, creatine, and glutamine83, which also mirrored results in mice84, and taurine and inosine demonstrated correlations with several antioxidant enzymes. Indeed, in our proteomics data, we observed upregulation of several antioxidant proteins such as PRDX2, SOD2, CAT, and GPX1. PRDX2 increased in all crew members immediately post-flight (R + 1), while PRDX6 and SOD2 were decreased, and 2 proteoforms of catalase were increased in one crewmember after landing. A spaceflight mouse study also observed PRDX6 and catalase gene upregulation in skin samples85, while a tail suspension rat study observed upregulation of PRDX6 in the hippocampus86. Additional rodent studies have also shown changes in oxidative stress proteins (SOD1, SOD2, Xanthine oxidase, etc.) resulting from spaceflight factor exposure, both post-exposure and longterm86,87. Thus, we propose that the oxidative stress induced by spaceflight triggers the production of both proteins and metabolites with antioxidant functions. Signs of hemolysis were also evident, underscored by an increase in circulating protoporphyrin, a known marker of this process. The observed decrease in S1P plasma abundance could also signal a reduction in erythrocytes, cells responsible for maintaining S1P concentrations in the blood. Our data further indicated lipid peroxidation, a biochemical process known to disrupt cellular membrane stability and decrease cell viability. Complementing these findings, we found an enrichment in anemia-related genes in our whole blood transcriptomics data and signs of coagulation dysregulation, often associated with anemia, in both EVPs and plasma proteomics. Indeed, spaceflight anemia has been previously observed and reported, consistent with our observations87. Lastly, evidence of immune suppression was apparent. Aside from their roles as antioxidants, inosine and taurine possess immunoprotective properties. Along with the immunomodulatory metabolite GABA, these metabolites correlated with immune cell markers. Given that the abundance of these immune cell markers was low while immune modulatory metabolites were in high abundance, we hypothesize an activation of immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory responses after inflammation during the flight88. Our analysis of the i4 crew revealed a notable increase in several brain-associated proteins within both plasma and EVPs following spaceflight. Notably, SNCA was significantly increased in plasma, EVPs, and several immune cell types immediately after spaceflight, suggesting it represents a common protein marker of response to spaceflight. SNCA is associated with Parkinson’s disease, and elevated levels have been linked to brain dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s disease89. Therefore, understanding these protein changes can guide the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for managing neurodegenerative diseases in space and on Earth. However, further investigations are necessary to better understand the precise mechanisms and implications of changes in brain-associated proteins as well as means to modify their levels safely. Although these brain-associated proteins suggest some dysregulation of homeostasis in the brain, none of these proteins are unique to the brain, and thus it is possible that they may originate from other organs. Correlations between expression of these proteins in the brain and in the blood in response to spaceflight is required to confirm whether increased levels reflect dysregulation in the brain. However, a similar increase in brain-enriched transcripts/proteins was observed in JAXA Cell free epigenome (CFE) cfRNA (more than 120 days on the ISS), and the NASA Twins study EVP proteome, (1-year on the ISS) in-flight and immediately post-flight. We note that the amplitude and durability of changes in brain homeostasis and potential BBB disruption/neuroinflammation may be dictated by the length of time spent in space or distance from Earth. Previous reports of space flown mice on brain state have shown decreased brain derived neurotrophic factor, induced neuron atrophy in the cerebral cortex, and overall oxidative stress, regulated partially through c-Jun/c-Fos90. Moreover, a recent MRI-based study of astronaut brains found that spaceflight induced ventricular expansion in the brain91. Finally, increased hippocampal apoptosis and aquaporin-4 expression have been observed in other studies75, along with significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and decreases in the BBB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Given the murine and human data observed to date, as well as data from this paper, PECAM-1 is a strong candidate as a BBB biomarker that could be measured in upcoming missions. Overall, secretome profiling provides a minimally invasive, yet comprehensive approach to monitor crew health and physiology. Based on this work and follow-up studies, we propose to develop a liquid biopsy and biomarker panel to monitor space-associated health risk and link these to long-term work on countermeasures. Eventually such tools can generate reliable markers in response to spaceflight for more diverse populations (age, sex, health, background). Due to the limitation of the Dragon capsule equipment, we were unable to obtain in-flight secretome data for the i4 study, which would also be critical to study in the future. Additionally, creating more profiles from other crews and controls will help build a larger, more informative cohort, and further buttress and give context to the results seen in these data. Nonetheless, as human spaceflight becomes more prevalent, the necessity for deep secretome profiling can help establish baseline profiles for safer human space travel increases, and these tools can be part of the armamentarium of biomedical tools to help keep crews safe for upcoming, exploration-class missions, as well as continued health on Earth.Methods Blood pre-processing and EVP (extracellular vesicle and particle) isolation Detailed descriptions of the methods pertaining to all proteomics/metabolomics/transcriptomics assays mentioned in this paper can be found in the “protocol” section of the GeneLab OSDR links found below92. Briefly, blood was collected in K2 EDTA tube(s) and shipped overnight on ice. Plasma was isolated by differential centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 minutes and 3000 x g for 20 min as previously described in refs. 24,93. The supernatant was collected and aliquoted for long-term storage at −80 °C and for EVP isolation. Plasma EVPs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation, as previously described in refs. 25. EVP protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Additional sample collection methods and data generation have been also detailed in the protocols paper24.Plasma proteomic profiling Detailed methods for proteomic, metabolic and transcriptomic profiling are described in Overbey et al. 2024. Briefly, plasma was isolated from cell preparation tubes (CPTs) and processed with Seer’s Proteograph Analysis Suite23. Seer’s standard 5-nanoparticle (5-NP) panel was used to enrich low abundance proteins followed by LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode. The list of differentially abundant proteins from the I4-FP1 and I4-FP4 plasma proteomics dataset in Overbey et al. 2024 was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 192.Extracellular vesicles and particle (EVP) proteomic profiling EVP proteomic profiling was described in Overbey et al. 202492. Briefly, plasma samples were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 20 minutes and then EVPs were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 70 min. EVPs were then washed in PBS and again collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 70 min. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS. Two micrograms of enriched EVPs were digested and analyzed with LC-MS/MS in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. The list of differentially abundant proteins from the I4-FP1 and I4-FP4 plasma proteomics dataset in Overbey et al. was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 192.Plasma metabolite profiling Plasma metabolite profiling was described in Overbey et al. 202493. Briefly, plasma metabolites were isolated using a combination of aqueous normal phase (ANP) and reverse phase (RP) chromatographic separations and analyzed by positive- and negative-ion MS. Metabolites were annotated using an in-house metabolite database comprising 865 metabolites for ANP chromatography and a 270 lipid metabolite RP database, curated from the Agilent plasma lipidomic database. All metabolites identified are level 1. Namely, to be identified, the feature’s mass, chromatographic retention time (RT) and MS/MS fragmentation pattern had to match to measurements acquired from the analysis of a pure chemical reference standard in our lab’s in-house metabolite database. The list of differentially abundant metabolites from the I4-FP1 and I4-FP4 plasma proteomics dataset in Overbey et al. 2024 was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 193.Western blot validation of EVP markers We validated DEPs in human plasma-derived EVPs by immunoblotting. For this, 5 µg of EVP protein were subjected to denaturing electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred onto a PVDF membrane and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against human Galectin 3 Binding Protein (LGALS3BP) (mouse monoclonal IgG, 1:1000 dilution, sc-374541, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Ficolin-3 (FCN3) (rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:500 dilution, 11867-AP, Proteintech). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled IgG goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse (1 h incubation, 1:5000 dilution, Jackson Laboratory). All antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The immunocomplexes were developed using the SuperSignal™ Western Blot Enhancer (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the membranes were imaged using a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad).ELISA validation of plasma markers PF4 concentration in EVP-rich plasma (post-3000 x g spin) and EVP-depleted plasma (CPT tubes, see proteomic mass spectrometry analysis) was assayed with a PF4 ELISA kit (R&D, cat #DPF40) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay To assess the lipid peroxidation in plasma, we measured the levels of TBARS as by-products of lipid peroxidation using the Lipid Peroxidation (MDA) Assay Kit (Abcam, ab118970), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For this assay, 10 µl of plasma were used for generating malondialdehyde (MDA) adducts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) which were further quantified fluorometrically (Ex/Em = 532/553) against a standard curve ranging between 0-0.5 nmol TBARS/well. Data were analyzed according to the manufacturer instructions taking into consideration the plasma volume used for the assay and results were reported as µM TBARS. Repeated measures one-way ANOVA was performed to assess significance.Multiplex bead-based characterization/profiling of plasma EVPs by flow cytometry The relative abundance of specific, immune-related plasma EVP proteins, plasma EVPs enriched by sequential ultracentrifugation (1 µg of EVP protein) were characterized using the MACSPlex Exosome Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-108-813) according to the manufacturer instructions for overnight protocol for 1.5 ml reagent tubes. Data was acquired on a Cytek Aurora-5 (Cytek Biosciences, USA) instrument and analyzed using the FlowJo™ v10.8 Software (BD Biosciences). The relative abundance (represented as MFI) for each EVP epitope was normalized against the mIgG and the average MFI of EV markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81), and the results were displayed as a heatmap. Welch’s two sample t-test were used to calculate P-value. Heatmaps were generated using the R (v4.1.2) package pheatmap (v1.0).Single-nuclei gene expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells Detailed methods for sample collection and data processing are described in refs. 93,94. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. We followed the analysis pipeline as previously reported95. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference. Gene expression values were used to generate heatmaps. Selected pathways were used for the ssGSEA analysis.Direct RNA-sequencing on Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION The list of differentially expressed genes from the I4-FP1 direct RNA-sequencing dataset in Overbey et al. 2023 (In review at Nature) was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |logFC | > 0.5. Briefly, these differentially expressed genes were identified using Oxford Nanopore Technologies package pipeline-transcriptome-de96. Intervene was used to identify overlaps between differentially expressed genes and differentially abundant proteins in EVP and plasma datasets and create the Venn diagram97. PBMC gene expression data was obtained from the i4 PBMC single cell data. Direct RNA-seq gene expression, proteomic abundances, and PBMC gene expression values were normalized by pre-flight values. Overrepresentation analysis was performed with WebGestalt98.Integration of metabolomics and proteomics For the correlation-based network analysis, we used protein/metabolite pairs that showed a significant Spearman correlation (FDR < 5%) across all time points. In this network, proteins are depicted by ellipses, while metabolites are represented by square nodes. Edges between them signify significant correlation: a solid edge indicates a positive correlation, and a dotted edge signifies a negative one. The analysis considered differentially abundant proteins and metabolites that changed immediately post-flight (R + 1) compared to pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) to compute these correlations. Furthermore, the color of each node reflects the log fold change of that node post-flight (R + 1).Spaceflight and Mouse Groups Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were launched in December 2021 to the international space station (ISS) on the rodent research-18 (RR-18) mission for 35 days. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C and humidity of 30–70% with a 12 h light/dark cycle during the flight. This hardware has a housing density that is within the guidelines recommended by the National Institutes of Health. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. Ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in the same flight hardware cages. Upon live return, mice were exsanguinated by closed-cardiac blood collection under deep Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia, followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary euthanasia method to ensure death. Their brains were removed and prepared for analysis. The left hemi-brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h, and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right hemi-brains were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. GC mice were euthanized three days later. Animal experiments were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) on October 14, 2021 (Protocol Number: RR-18), Roskamp Institute IACUC on October 7, 2021 (Protocol Number RR-18).Immunostaining assays for PECAM-1 Brain sections were immunofluorescence stained against PECAM-1, a biomarker related to BBB. Six µm sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and washed in PBS for 20 min. Vascular network was labeled with DyLight® 488 Lycopersicon Esculentum (Tomato) Lectin (1:100, Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature followed by 10 min wash in PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit antibodies PECAM-1 (1:100, NB100-2284, Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO). After 3 washes in PBS, sections were incubated for 1.5 h with secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (1:1000 in antibody dilution buffer; Life Technologies). The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI solution (Life Technologies) and coverslipped with Vectashield® HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Six to 10 field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp.) at 20X magnification spanning the entire brain sections.Mouse Tissue EVP isolation and proteomic analysis Tissues were isolated from 6 to 8 week-old naive female C57BL/6 mice and processed as previously described in ref. 25. EVPs were isolated and unbiased proteomic profiling of EVP cargo was performed as described above. Mouse studies were performed in accordance with institutional, IACUC and AAALAS guidelines, and according to Weill Cornell Medicine animal protocol #0709-666 A.Tissue of origin deconvolution analysis To perform tissue of origin deconvolution, a list of proteins “enriched” or “specific” to 36 different tissues compiled from the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/) was used as pathway input to fgsea (version 1.22) with a minimum size=5 and maximum size=500. The list of differentially abundant features was ranked based on the t-statistic and used as gene list input. We have added the script used for this analysis to the github repository. The file corresponding to the 36 tissues was generated from the data in the link below: https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue/tissue+specific which include 36 tissues.IRB statement human subjects research All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569.

On Earth, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to spatially map all cell types in the human body. Here, we propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research.

    "introduction": "Introduction Humanity may be on the brink of establishing a new era of interplanetary space exploration that would witness crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) and a growing commercial spaceflight sector that would prompt a wider health range of individuals entering space compared to the selective cohorts of distinctively fit professional astronauts from previous generations. Numerous space organizations across the globe openly aspire toward landing humans on Mars in the coming decades, underscoring an overall international interest in what may be the next stage of human space exploration. Prominent examples include the SpaceX Mars program striving to initiate the first crewed Mars spaceflights in the late 2020s; the state-owned China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology announcing the country’s goals to place humans on Mars in 2033; NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United States space agency) issuing the Authorization Act of 2017, which declares objectives to send humanity to Mars in the early 2030s; Roscosmos (the Russian space agency) publishing aims to send humans to Mars in the early 2040s; and the United Arab Emirates publishing the Mars 2117 Project, which outlines a one-hundred-year plan to construct habitable communities for humans on Mars. Thus, there is a motive for scientists across the world to study how the human body responds to spaceflight and to develop countermeasures that improve the health and safety of crewed interplanetary missions. Since the inception of human spaceflight, the duration that astronauts spend in space each mission has increased over time (Fig. 1A). Despite this, to date, only eleven individuals have resided in space for more than 300 consecutive days. Pioneering crewed missions to Mars would see humans embarking through space for even longer consecutive periods of time and in radiation environments for which there is limited knowledge about the impact on human physiology, warranting improvements in the autonomous space telehealth field. The risk of an emergency medical occurrence during space missions has previously been estimated at approximately 0.06 per person-year, which roughly equates to one event every 2.4 years for a crew of seven1. Multiyear planetary missions would prevent resupply and medical evacuation options and hence would require fully autonomous telehealth and triage protocols. Fig. 1. Space Missions. Open in a new tab A Violin plots showing the average time a given astronaut spends in space per mission (calculated as total time in space divided by number of missions) compared to the decade the astronaut first went into space. Astronauts are colored by the number of missions they have been on, and shapes represent astronaut sex (females are triangles and males are circles). The average time spent in space ranged from minutes to one month in the 1960s, and from one day to under six months in the 1970s. In the 1980s through 2000s, the majority of astronauts spent an average of between one week and one month in space per mission, but many astronauts spent more than three months in space. Subsequently, in the 2010s, the majority of astronauts spent an average of over three months in space per mission, whereas in the early 2020 s, there was the widest distribution of average time in space, ranging from ten minutes to six months. B The number of astronauts who have been in space by nationality. Bar plot shows the number of astronauts by the year of their first mission whereas the pie chart shows the percentage of each nation’s contribution. Nations with only one astronaut to ever go to space are colored green (4%), nations with only between two and five astronauts to go to space are colored lime green (3%), and astronauts with multiple nationalities are colored yellow (1%). Data was scraped from supercluster.com on September 20th, 2021. Only astronauts who spent time in space and crossed the Kármán line are displayed. Various applications of artificial intelligence and molecular omics could likely advance the spaceflight telehealth field. Omics technologies allow for the quantification of large pools of biomolecules that influence the integrity and function of biology. Exploratory and untargeted omics techniques can measure analytes that are not predetermined. These studies can identify patterns of variance, which can generate new hypotheses. Additionally, integrating omics with metadata, including environmental and phenotypic measures, enhances the ability to establish robust links between environmental influences, omic variations, and phenotypic outcomes2. The NASA Twins Study integrated various omics platforms, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, and highlighted omics as a potential biomedical research platform that may one day translate into the development of precision spaceflight healthcare3. The ambitious project discovered more than 8600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between an astronaut who resided for almost one year on the International Space Station (ISS) and their identical twin who resided on Earth; it is possible that any permutation of the DEG list could uncover biochemical pathways that hold keys to the development of therapeutic supplements and lifestyle recommendations that better protect health in space3,4. In this paper, we will consider how the dawn of diversified human exploration of deeper space may benefit from sophisticated advances in spaceflight nutrition and health that may be met in part with the addition of routine standardized omics. Space omics efforts are now underway in multiple regions. In Japan, the “Living in Space” Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) program uncovers biological responses to the space environment at various levels, ranging from environmental microbiomes to stress responses in humans, using omics technologies. In Europe, the Space Omics Topical Team (TT) supports and generates omics approaches to space biology5, and there are visible efforts to promote further development of space omics research among ESA and ESA state members6. In the United States, examples of space omics-related campaigns include the Precision Health Initiative and Systems Biology Translational Project through the NASA Human Research Program (HRP) and the Complement of Integrated Protocols for Human Exploration Research (CIPHER) project (“Human Research Program Update”, WH Paloski, Committee on Biological and Physical Sciences in Space (CBPSS) Virtual Fall Committee Meeting). The NASA GeneLab initiative provides an open access, collaborative analysis platform for space omics data collected across the world and unites international efforts through analysis working groups7. Canada operates terrestrial platforms to analyze human omics linked with biomedical data8, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has announced plans for national space omics research, in addition to already participating in international space omics projects. China and Russia are also publishing human space omics research9,10. Humans in spaceflight historically represented nations like the United Socialist Soviet Republic and the United States to a large degree (Fig. 1B). After the first couple of decades of human spaceflight, nations like Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Russia have also been represented to a moderate degree (Fig. 1B). Individuals who have entered space now represent, even if in smaller numbers, more than thirty other nations: Afghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, Hungary, India, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and Vietnam. The Artemis program plans to soon reestablish a human presence on the Moon, for the first time in five decades, and construct a permanent lunar base to facilitate the future of human missions to Mars. Led by NASA and partner agencies JAXA, ESA, and CSA, the Artemis program includes signatories from about thirty countries and territories, reflecting on the theme of a more global human presence in space. Indeed, crewed missions to Mars would motivate philosophical thinking about humanity’s place in the universe, common to all humans. Many people believe such missions will only be enabled by worldwide collaboration due to the involvement of multiple countries and international organizations, the implications for many people across Earth, the sheer engineering demands, and the increasing global representation of space explorers11. Upcoming planetary missions will likely be multinational efforts, underscoring the need for global collaboration in regard to the science, culture, and ethics behind space exploration. A new age of human space omics may likewise require international input due to both the various cultural aspects and the added technological, ethical, and philosophical complexities of working with human subjects. International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP) represents an international consortium of space omics scientists who formed after recognizing the need for standard guidelines in the emerging spaceflight omics discipline. ISSOP includes scientists with expertise across the full range of omics approaches who receive funding from academia, industry, and government agencies across a wide array of regions, including Japan, India, the Middle East, Canada, Europe, Russia, and the United States. By promoting communication exchange in the space omics discipline, ISSOP may be uniquely positioned to support the development of an informed framework early on that can help maximize scientific discovery and minimize ethical problems for an upcoming era of human space omics. In this paper, we consider how a future of precision space healthcare could improve the safety of human health during long-term spaceflight. We then discuss how careful standardization of space omics data is one component that may help implement this goal. To this end, we propose the development of a human cell atlas under spaceflight environmental conditions that could assist as an openly available, global resource for foundational space life science research. We then consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the general discipline of human space omics, and how philosophical frameworks would likely need to be established with perspectives from international ethicists. Precision healthcare in space In the coming years, the spaceflight field will likely observe diversification of the flying population, extended mission durations, and exposure to harsher radiation beyond LEO. These factors motivate an upgraded space healthcare model where nutritional, supplemental, and pharmaceutical decisions could be tailored to multiple characteristics12,13. On Earth, there are already applications of precision health, where healthcare is informed based on omics, environmental, and lifestyle factors14. It seems probable that as connections between omics and spaceflight health ailments are slowly elucidated, similar approaches could be implemented in space. The purpose of customizing spaceflight healthcare would not be to reduce spaceflight participation, but to promote the health of increasingly diverse participation that better reflects the sustained presence of the full inclusive range of humanity in space one day13. Countermeasure protocols for space missions can consist of evidence-based nutritional supplements, exercise regimes, stress-relieving techniques, and pharmacological interventions15. Moving forward, crew profiles could potentially improve medical risk assessment and countermeasures; optimize medical and nutritional payloads; increase crew safety and efficiency; and maximize the likelihood of mission success. In the next section, we will explore examples of how astronaut health and performance can be impacted by omic differences related to the metabolism of drugs, micronutrients, and macronutrients. We focus on metabolism because changes in mitochondria, the key hub of metabolism, are a fundamental biological feature of spaceflight16. We note that the provocative nature of the spaceflight environment may induce a large number of physiological and molecular changes on rapid time scales that may not necessarily be of health-related importance. As a result, scientists must cautiously avoid overassociating spaceflight omics changes with clinical meanings. Indeed, most human gene association studies on Earth are associative with many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) providing initial results that failed to hold up upon further testing. The risk of overinterpretation is particularly relevant in the field of human space omics given the small sample sizes and the small number of studies3; the difficulty of securing suitable ground controls, both in omics and environment3,17; and the long number of years required to replicate findings. These problems are further amplified when studying the long-term effects of spaceflight outside of LEO. We emphasize that the following section mostly presents early evidence and even contradictions due to the current limitations of the human space omics field, and that much more work would be needed in the coming decades to assess the validity of the below preliminary findings and interpretations. Drug metabolism in space Medical kits onboard the ISS contain pharmaceuticals to cover various medical events and emergencies, including injuries, illnesses, infections, sleep disruptions, motion sickness, and cognitive and behavioral health conditions18. Documentation of medication usage has not been consistent, but studies suggest about 94% of crew members used medications at least once during space shuttle missions19. Despite the common use of medications to manage health concerns on orbit, few studies have explored how to refine pharmaceutical applications in the unique environment of space. Preliminary evidence suggests that spaceflight may introduce impurity products, alter the physical appearance, and quicken the degradation of certain drugs before their expiration dates20,21. Although these investigations have been severely limited without adequate ground controls, they have underlined the need to verify if any spaceflight factors may affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters that determine the pharmaceutical safety and efficacy, and the mechanisms responsible for these effects22,23. These factors might include the space environment itself (such as chronic low-dose radiation) and/or confounding extraneous factors (such as temperature, humidity, and dosage repackaging commonly used to meet the limited volume constraints on space vehicles)18,22,24. Thorough metadata tabulation could eventually help unravel not only how to preserve drugs in space, but also how to better understand precision responses to such drugs. A recent pharmacogenetics study by the ESA demonstrated that allelic variation may influence the safety and effectiveness of how individual crew members metabolize drugs on the ISS. Researchers examined the 78 standard drugs permanently available on the ISS and found that the metabolism of 24 of them was significantly affected by individual variants in genetic polymorphism enzymes25. This discovery suggested that almost one-third of drugs on the ISS may warrant personal dose adjustments or alternative therapies for crew members who have allelic predispositions that can render them anywhere from poor metabolizers (with decreased drug clearance, increased plasma drug levels, and potential adverse drug response) to ultra-rapid metabolizers (with increased drug clearance, decreased plasma drug levels, and potential ineffective drug response). Populations throughout the world can have different frequencies of genetic polymorphism enzymes that affect drug metabolisms26; thus, pharmacogenetic screening of consenting astronauts from diverse backgrounds could better ensure equal representation27. Personal astronaut drug-metabolism profiles could be generated based on the two reaction phases of drug biotransformation. The first drug biotransformation reaction produces a more water-soluble and less active metabolite usually through the hydroxylating enzyme superfamily known as Cytochrome P450 (CYP450). This enzyme superfamily is believed to account for 75% of total drug metabolism28. Indeed, CYPs have recently been suggested to be altered in flight due to alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling29. Several CYP450 genes are highly polymorphic, producing enzyme variants that cause variability in drug-metabolizing effects between groups. During mission planning, CYP450 genetic variant profiles for consenting astronauts could be generated and cross-referenced with mission drug lists to prevent scenarios in which crew members would otherwise metabolize drugs in harmful or inefficient ways13. The second drug biotransformation is usually a conjugation reaction wherein a small molecule binds to the drug metabolite and increases its solubility for excretion. For this situation, consenting astronauts could assess their pre-mission status of all nutrient cofactors and conjugation agents (such as glutathione, glycine, cysteine, arginine, and taurine) to inform their optimum conditions13. One concrete example of how CYP allelic variants could inform treatments during space exploration relates to acute radiation sickness (ARS)30. ARS is an accepted risk on orbit, and common medications to treat its primary symptoms of nausea and vomiting include ondansetron and granisetron, which are both metabolized differently in the liver based on individual CYP genetic polymorphisms. Specifically, the CYP2D6 enzyme metabolizes ondansetron, and, hence, groups who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of the CYP2D6 pathway have a higher risk of still vomiting within one day of radiotherapy with ondansetron31. These groups may benefit from treating ARS with granisetron, which is instead metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme31. Another example of how CYP allelic variants could inform spaceflight therapies based on personal predispositions relates to sleep drugs, which are commonly used by crew. In fact, 78% of shuttle crew reported taking zolpidem and zaleplon, powerful sleep pills, for more than half of the nights of their missions32. CYP3A polymorphisms are known to affect zolpidem metabolism33, but not zaleplon metabolism25, and astronauts could use this knowledge to more safely tailor their sleep-related treatments. It may also be meaningful to investigate optimal doses of medications that are more tailored to the demanding lifestyles of astronauts. For example, unlike many individuals on Earth, astronauts on the ISS are occasionally awakened by alarms during scheduled sleeping shifts in order to perform emergency tasks that require effective cognitive and psychomotor capabilities34. A study at NASA Johnson Space Center found that subjects who consumed a higher dose of zolpidem before sleep experienced significantly reduced cognitive and psychomotor performance during emergency awakenings; however, they found no similar impairments in subjects who consumed the lower dose of zolpidem, the dose of zaleplon, or the placebo before sleep onset34. Hence, even though the approved doses of zolpidem and zaleplon may be fit for most terrestrial applications, the unique duties during spaceflight may warrant adjusted recommended dosages of these, and possibly other, approved medications. Even the metabolism of medications may be altered in spaceflight compared to on Earth. The kidneys, which play a major role in drug excretion, may reduce urine output during weightlessness35. The liver, which is the main organ that metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics, may also behave differently between terrestrial and spaceflight conditions, although results have been conflicting: While some studies have reported an increase in hepatic blood flow and size during spaceflight36, other studies have suggested a decrease in hepatic metabolism in space, which may roughly correspond to a decrease in hepatic blood flow due to the hypovolemia that occurs on orbit37. Clear elucidation of potential differences between drug metabolism in terrestrial versus orbital conditions will require further investigation, and any reliable findings could eventually be integrated for improved aerospace healthcare recommendations27. Micronutrient metabolism in space Recent studies are elucidating tentative relationships between omics and micronutrient intake that may link to adverse health events in space. One key example of this is one-carbon metabolism, which involves the transfer of methyl groups from donors (such as folate, B12, choline, and betaine). We note that many of the donors are essential inputs that must be obtained from the diet. The enzymes that regulate one-carbon metabolism are produced from highly polymorphic methyltransferase genes; any possible ramifications for human spaceflight are only recently unfolding13. As an example, spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) is a unique and distinctive clinical manifestation. It includes optic disk edema (swelling), choroidal folds, and focal areas of ischemic retina (cotton wool spots). This disease is believed to present in over 20% of astronauts both during and after short and long duration spaceflight38. With no known terrestrial analogue, evidence-based countermeasures are only recently emerging; these include lower body negative pressure and nutritional supplementation39, the latter of which could be further refined through omics studies. Indeed, one research group examined 49 astronauts and discovered that common variations in one-carbon metabolism genes, combined with lower levels of vitamins B2, B6, and B9, appeared to be associated with SANS40,41. In addition to poor neuro-ocular health, disordered one-carbon metabolism may play a role in bone fragility (with increased osteoclast activation and decreased osteoblast activity)13, hypertension (with increased intraocular pressure)42, and chromosome instability (with concurring folate deficiency increasing defective DNA repair)43. It is indicative that this single metabolic property may have wide-ranging impacts on some of the more perplexing health complications known to occur during spaceflight13. For these reasons, one-carbon metabolism is an example candidate for deeper research into a future precision space medicine approach. There is likewise preliminary evidence that prolonged radiation exposure may interact with genetic polymorphisms that alter micronutrient metabolism, predisposing to disease in space. For example, there is precursory evidence suggesting that the space environment partially contributes to altered iron metabolism in astronauts44. Iron overload is believed to occur more often in individuals with allelic variants for hemochromatosis (HFE)45. Simultaneously, urinary magnesium (Mg) levels are reported to decrease during space missions, with a slight majority of post-spaceflight astronauts presenting with levels below minimum clinical guidelines46. Taken together, these provisional observations suggest that astronauts with HFE allelic variants may develop unusually high levels of iron when exposed to the space environment, which may induce oxidative stress and unstable DNA47. Given that Mg repairs DNA damage48, further research may be justified to examine whether convergent Mg deficiencies could complete a dangerous aggregation of risk events in a subset of astronauts who are susceptible to this array of environment, omics, and dietary intake parameters13. DNA stability is a leading human safety concern in space and hence it seems meaningful to investigate whether consenting individuals can benefit from optimizing any essential dietary inputs with relevance to DNA repair before, during, and after spaceflight based on precision risk profiles. The supplementation of Vitamin D, another important micronutrient, is regularly integrated into spaceflight nutrition programs49. While Vitamin D is well-known for its influence on bone production, it impacts several more biological processes, including immune system modulation. Its effect on immunity seems to be mediated by the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), expressed by antigen-presenting cells and activated T cells50. Conversely, Vitamin D and VDR are necessary to maintain a healthy number of regulatory T cells51. Allelic variants of the VDR gene appear to be associated with better response to Vitamin D supplementation52, and allelic variants of genes (such as 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), a gene related to sterol metabolism) are believed to be related to improved Vitamin D metabolism and insulin resistance53. Therefore, poor Vitamin D status and metabolism of individuals during space missions, which already have inherent stressful elements, might negatively affect the immune systems of astronauts, and this could potentially be mitigated through precision omics profiles. Macronutrient metabolism in space Differences in macronutrient consumption needs have been linked to variants in genes, such as the Retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB) gene, the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1) gene, and the Fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene54,55. Altogether, these variants appear to be associated with body composition, fat distribution, and obesity risk in relation to carbohydrate, lipid, and protein intake54,55. Initial studies have suggested that endocrine changes linked to spaceflight modify metabolism and strengthen its association with alterations in astronaut body composition and nutritional intake needs56. It may be possible that long-duration space voyages could exacerbate dietary deficits. The nutritional condition of astronauts appears to be affected by metabolic stress, changing gut flora, altered feeding behavior, vitamin insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalance57. Maintaining energy balance in space missions will likely be critical for maintaining body fat muscle homeostasis58. These early findings imply a possibility that prolonged space exposure and dietary deficits may interact with genetic polymorphisms in a subset of astronauts to promote unusual pathologies that could be prevented by better nutritional information and health plans based on thorough research in the spaceflight omics discipline. It may hence be valuable to properly investigate and characterize any relationships between micronutrients, macronutrients, pharmaceuticals, omics, and various spaceflight environmental factors. These relationships are complex and underline the critical usefulness for rigorous standardization of space omics data and metadata so that meta-analyses may one day disentangle more confidently which factors are linked to preventable diseases at both the group and individual levels during spaceflight. Standardized space omics collection Standardization of space omics data and metadata would be an important component of a successful human space omics discipline. JAXA is currently conducting human liquid biopsy studies on the ISS. The main purpose of the studies is to investigate how the space environment affects humans at the tissue level. Besides fat and skin samples, which can be risky, whole-body solid tissue biopsies cannot typically be conducted in humans in space. As a result, the project proposes to perform minimally invasive liquid biopsies in astronauts. Liquid biopsies can detect cell-free components (microRNA, RNA, DNA, and extracellular vesicles) in the blood and scientists can estimate which tissues the cell components are derived from, allowing for full-body monitoring of omics responses. While solid biopsies only reflect a single time point of a single site on a single tissue, liquid biopsies can allow for a less invasive assessment of extracellular DNA and RNA in the plasma, which can represent molecular responses of the internal tissues in the body and can be obtained at repeated timepoints. The project proposes to collect astronaut blood samples at multiple time points before, during, and after living on the ISS. Murine and human plasma samples may be processed using the same processing protocol, thereby allowing for direct comparison of human and veterinary patients in a minimally invasive fashion for both species. These unique data collections are expected to enable cross-species integrative data analysis of space environment effects on mammals in a manner that is less technically and ethically complex than previous methods. Moving forward, the majority of sampling on astronauts would likely consist of liquid biopsy approaches and other non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures. Traditional tissue biopsies carry a risk of infection and localized pain which could compromise astronaut health and performance in physical tasks such as spacewalks. Furthermore, less invasive sampling methods are often quick to perform and do not require significant recovery periods between samples, which can allow for more frequent sampling and thus greater temporal resolution of omic changes throughout missions. The feasibility of orbital sampling and readout can be explored for various biological sources, such as saliva, sweat, tears, urine, and nasal discharge, some of which have been reviewed in the context of human spaceflight elsewhere59. An increase in capabilities for inflight omic processing and readout could also enable inflight interventions to maintain health, such as nutritional supplements based on gene regulatory changes related to metabolism of specific vitamins. New metadata normalization is another example of a rising standardization challenge that comes with the arrival of human space omics projects. Some key metadata parameters that should be collected from humans include environment, diet, nutrition, psychosocial dynamics, lifestyle, medical history, anthropometrics, and phenotypes13. Many of these metadata parameters have not been necessarily collected in space and hence have no standardization methods. For instance, wearable technology could be implemented to provide metadata of astronaut health, similar to fitness trackers that have been successfully used on Earth to measure various medical parameters, including increased insulin resistance, which has also been observed in spaceflight60,61. At the same time, metadata can be misused to identify individual astronauts, an ethical problem that, unlike in model organism studies, has to be addressed. With a mission to continuously improve recommended metadata normalization protocols for space omics data, ISSOP may help spark discussions needed to resolve some of these challenges. In addition to best efforts to standardize space omics studies62, increased resolution may help interpret allelic variants associated with disease risks by more precisely pinpointing cell types and states involved in biology. Achieving this goal relates back to our project exploring an example set of alleles that are putatively linked to protective mechanisms, and their implications for therapeutic compound discovery and improved spaceflight nutrition and lifestyle recommendations63. As described next, extending standardized approaches toward space omics data that is higher in resolution could enable the generation of cell space atlases, which could further push forward a developing field of precision space healthcare. Human cell space atlas To date, bulk transcriptomic technologies, such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays, have mostly been used to understand how spaceflight impacts physiology. These approaches have characterized physiology at the tissue level, composed of billions of diverse cells, rather than at the individual cell level. However, to obtain a thorough understanding of the complex dynamics that spaceflight causes in humans, there is a need to increase the analysis resolution level. In the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), researchers recently collected high-resolution omics data from commercial astronauts during the Inspiration4 mission; the project included multi-omics spatial mapping, single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq). Civilian missions may greatly contribute to advancing the spaceflight omics field, given that many commercial spaceflight participants have expressed voluntary interest in participating in space biomedical research and sharing data for biobanks and scientific publication64,65. These technological advances have created an unprecedented opportunity for in-depth molecular studies in space biology in the short- and middle-term future. In recent years, researchers on Earth have used high-resolution omics to create a plant cell atlas (PCA)66, mouse cell atlas (MCA)67, and human cell atlas (HCA)68. These initiatives aim to construct thorough spatial maps of all cells in organisms as references for research, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of disease69, and assist in the development of better therapies. Contemporary routine blood tests that provide rough counts of white and red blood cells could become acutely more informative if cell types and states can be discerned with finer granularity. This could lead to improved diagnostic tests that detect infections before clinical symptoms are present, representing a shift from reactionary treatment of health issues towards a preventative approach69. As society becomes increasingly spacefaring, one can envision the development of parallel initiatives to the PCA, MCA, and HCA that are specific to the space environment (Fig. 2). A plant, mouse, and human cell space atlas (PCSA, MCSA, and HCSA) could improve our understanding of how each system responds to spaceflight and hence enhance health monitoring capabilities during prolonged space missions. Having access to the different changes occurring at the spatial cell type level in key organs between ground control and flight conditions would allow researchers to better understand how cell-cell interactions are altered by spaceflight70,71,72. Fig. 2. Cell space atlas. Open in a new tab Multi-omic experiments, whether on Earth or in space, have a number of complexities when designing and comparing results to other published work. Namely, there are numerous models which could be leveraged to investigate the molecular (omic) changes in different organ systems using different technologies, which can then be processed and analyzed in numerous ways. Further, experiments conducted in space may be more influenced by environmental factors that are either regulated within the craft (such as oxygen) or not (such as radiation). These environmental factors are crucial to understanding results and can drastically vary by experiment. Given these complexities, understanding the environmental factors during a mission and the exact experimental design (including acquiring and analyzing the data), and standardizing them across agencies will be crucial to the development of aerospace multi omic analyses. Further, given the overall cost of these experiments as well as the limited resources to conduct them, this centralized and normalized database, which is accessible to other scientists, can assist our understanding of spaceflight risks, their counter measurements, and monitoring.These insights could therefore lead to a more detailed comprehension of how various botanical organisms, veterinarian patients, and human patients respond to spaceflight in order to design new and substantially more precise treatments as countermeasures for health in space. The cell space atlases could serve as openly available international resources developed at the start of the human space omics era that span multiple generations to come, not only to characterize cellular responses to spaceflight but also to investigate how cell cross-talk is altered when the system is exposed to extreme environmental conditions like space. Human and model organism cell space atlases could be constructed in a minimally invasive manner, using in vitro and ex vivo technologies. For example, tissue chips (organs on chips) could be viable options for high-resolution space omics studies73. In the past several years, a series of experiments have tested tissue chips on the ISS through the Tissue Chips in Space initiative, which is a partnership between the ISS National Lab and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes for Health ()74. Tissue chips are composed of human cells grown on artificial 3D scaffolds to model the structure and function of human tissues, allowing researchers to assess how major organs and systems in the human body respond to the extreme environment of space. Real human tissues can also be studied in spaceflight following protocols similar to the Suture in Space initiative, where living tissue from biopsies are extracted and sutured together to serve as models to better understand physiological mechanisms in space, including wound repair and regeneration27. Engineers have already developed miniaturized equipment and automation procedures for tissue chips to be employed in low capacity during flight missions. ESA plans to develop a 3D bioprinter for the ISS that could generate human tissue constructs in microgravity to study the complexity of cellular component responses to the space environment27. In addition to their role in potentially developing cell space atlases, personalized chips and tissues could also be exposed to extreme environments before missions to assess individual risks, and then could be placed on spaceflight to monitor health changes and test prospective countermeasures. We note that the omics methods used to construct cell space atlases may depend on whether sample processing occurs during spaceflight and/or back in terrestrial labs. For example, scRNA-seq approaches require fresh material, whereas snRNA-seq approaches can use frozen samples75. Spaceflight restrictions may also limit omics approaches: For instance, methods may initially be proteomics-based on orbit to successfully accommodate compact equipment that can operate at low power13. This could potentially lead to the generation of a human protein space atlas that integrates spatial mapping of human proteomics into atlas efforts, paralleling the Human Protein Atlas project already initiated in terrestrial healthcare76. Overcoming these technical boundaries and optimizing the quality of these technically novel datasets would require input from experienced omics scientists with extensive knowledge about spaceflight biology. ISSOP is composed of members with stated missions to routinely update recommended sample processing guidelines for space omics datasets to allow for better harmonization of data and increased gain of knowledge77. Members have expertise related to the processing of multi-omics data samples, and several ISSOP members are prime contributors to the previously mentioned JAXA and NASA projects utilizing cutting-edge and high-resolution omics techniques. As a result, ISSOP could serve as a community that is integral for propelling the space omics field into the next stage of innovation with projects related to themes such as the construction of cell space atlases. Alongside the technical challenges of constructing a human cell atlas for spaceflight, the generation and usage of human space omics data poses considerable ethical, cultural, and legal challenges that would need to be carefully resolved through policy development. Indeed, one motivation of the current perspective paper is to provide examples of the upcoming ethical and legal complexities inherent to the nascent human space omics discipline in order to encourage earlier discussions amongst international ethicists, philosophers, scientists, and the public community. Ethical and policy considerations As a consequence of the increasing adoption of human omics research in space, it has become crucial to increase standardization of policies for regulating the collection, storage, access, and usage of astronauts’ (sometimes called spaceflight participants, or SFPs) omics data. Based on recommendations from a 2014 report by the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine)78, NASA instituted a policy (NPD 7170.1) regarding the collection and usage of genomic data for human research. However, we are not currently aware of other prominent space agencies - or commercial spaceflight companies - publishing public policies regarding astronaut or crew omics data. Notably, the United Nations recently formed a working group on “Space and Global Health”. In their draft resolution (A/AC.105/C.1/L.402), they encourage Member States to “establish a policy-enabled environment and governance mechanisms, with due consideration of legal and ethical issues, for removing barriers to the effective use of space-based technologies, including telemedicine solutions”. The current rarity of human omics collection and curation can be viewed as a barrier to the development and deployment of emerging space-based health technologies, including precision healthcare. Thus, in the following section, we consider legal and ethical challenges pertaining to policymaking in this context, concluding with some thoughts on how best to achieve balanced policies which support space omics research while protecting the rights of the participants (Fig. 3). Ethical considerations of human omics research is an emerging area for spaceflight79,80,59, this is just part of the bigger picture of space ethics81, and human omics research on Earth82. Fig. 3. Ethics. Open in a new tab Policies pertaining to the collection, storage, and usage of omics data from consenting astronauts and spaceflight participants would need to be carefully balanced. Thorough discussion amongst international ethicists could ensure that such policies are designed such that they are not so restrictive that they significantly limit the potential for scientific progress and improved occupational healthcare in space, and not so permissible that they expose participants to ethical harms. Dangers of restrictive policies: scientific potential unused As mentioned throughout this manuscript, standardized collection and curation of human space omics data has great potential to accelerate scientific research into human health in space and enable the deployment of precision medicine technologies to improve occupational healthcare during spaceflight missions. Therefore, underutilization of the scientific and healthcare potential for human space omics data is the primary danger of overly restrictive policies. Firstly, if policies restrict the operational usage of human space omics data in occupational health processes, such as countermeasure design and long-term health monitoring, the full potential for reducing health risks might not be realized. Consequently, this could endanger crew members, reduce likelihood of mission success, and potentially infringe upon the duty of care space agencies have for their astronaut employees. This duty of care includes not just the immediate health and safety of astronauts during missions, but also their long-term health due to occupational exposures such as cosmic radiation78. Secondly, if policies do not allow for sufficient data to be collected and processed from humans in space for research purposes, the pace of space life sciences research will be slower, with increased dependency on ground-based analogs. Similarly, restrictive policies for data accessibility/sharing would also slow the pace of research. When investigators contribute data to the scientific community through open-science initiatives, it can be analyzed via varied approaches, including comparatively to other datasets to yield novel insights. In the context of spaceflight omics data, the value of open-science has recently been demonstrated through a large-scale multi-omics analysis comparing datasets from the NASA GeneLab biorepository, to uncover mitochondrial dysregulation as a key hub of the biological response to spaceflight83. Biorepositories can be leveraged with “Big data” approaches, where patterns such as radiation sensitivity, can be learned via the application of machine learning methods to collections of multi-omics datasets84. With increased collection of omics data from humans in space, these kinds of approaches could be applied to human spaceflight, such as to predict susceptibility to radiation-based health issues in individual crewmembers85. Limiting accessibility to human space omics data creates a barrier to analysis efforts, thus every decrement from complete open access reduces the scientific utility of the data. A final consequence of restrictive policies is reductions in the scope and precision of the data provided to the wider scientific community. For the NASA Twins study, authors of one follow-up paper that accessed and reanalyzed the original study data indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels, copy number variations (CNVs), and structural genomic elements could not be included in the publication for confidentiality purposes86, thus limiting the scope of their public facing analysis. Regarding precision, efforts to anonymize and sanitize the data prior to data sharing - including data aggregation approaches and withholding metadata - could reduce the scientific utility, particularly as individual differences, such as gene variants associated with susceptibility to health issues, are essential information for unlocking precision healthcare approaches63. Dangers of permissible policies: exposure to ethical harms On the other hand, while scientific utilization of human space omics data could reduce health risks for crews, if policies are overly permissible, omics research could also lead to harm by exposing human subjects to ethical issues. In the case of space agencies, this would also infringe on their duty of care to their astronaut employees. Due to the familial nature of genomics, these issues may also affect family members. Notably, compared to typical terrestrial cohorts, many of these ethical challenges are amplified by the unique nature of the spacefaring population; astronauts are easily identifiable due to their current rarity and status as public figures79. One ethical issue that is particularly amplified by the standing of astronauts is that of privacy. The term “genetic privacy” is used ubiquitously, yet privacy breaches could apply to any identifiable omic-based personal data. Privacy breaches would involve disclosure of this data against the will of the participants, which could lead to psychological harm. Specifically, policies may be considered overly permissible if they fail to account for the risks of identifiability from the full range of omic data types and data formats. It is well understood that individuals can be identified using genomics data, such as SNPs87. However, identification via other omic data types, such as transcriptomics88, proteomics89,90, microbiomics91, and combinations of omic types (multi-omics)92, is a developing area of the literature. Identifying specific participants becomes possible through “linkage attacks” when phenotypic information is available in addition to the omics data88. Due to the nature of astronauts as public figures, phenotypic information such as ethnicity, age, and biological sex is readily available to the public. The small population size also means that the number of possible matches is limited, increasing the likelihood of successful linkage attacks. Aside from linkage attacks, privacy may also be violated via attacks on the data storage system. Thus, policies may be considered overly permissible if they do not ensure appropriate security and safeguarding mechanisms against data breaches. Relating to the issue of privacy is the ethical issue of genetic discrimination, which refers to individuals receiving differential or unfair treatment based on their genetic data. Policies permitting space agencies to use omics data predictive of health issues, such as genetic variants, in astronaut selection or during processes such as flight assignment, could be seen as discriminatory. Indeed, many countries worldwide have enacted laws to prevent the use of genetic information in employment decisions93. It is worth noting that this is somewhat of a controversial and complex topic; for example, in the United States, the military can use routine genetic screening results to inform assignment decisions, such as to withhold deploying troops with G6PD deficiency to locations which would require them to take antimalarial drugs, since doing so can cause life-threatening hemolytic reactions94. While the United States Space Force could present an interesting exception, NASA is not a branch of the military, so it is subject to the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 2008 (GINA), and therefore it would seem that it cannot use omic information in assignment and employment decisions79, which is also aligned with the current NASA policy (NPD 7170.1). However, even with precision medicine approaches, sending an individual with a genetic predisposition to spaceflight-associated risks, such as radiation susceptibility, on a long-duration mission to Mars may still increase the likelihood of a serious medical incident. Thus, it has been suggested that omic information would be useful for spaceflight selection and assignment processes95. This presents an ethical dilemma, where on the one hand, using omic information for flight assignment without the individual’s consent could be seen as discriminatory, and on the other hand, not doing so could potentially endanger the crew and reduce likelihood of mission safety and success. An additional consideration here is that some spaceflight-relevant genetic mutations may be linked to certain populations on Earth, which raises further issues of equity63. Using omics for precision healthcare does appear to be supported under the current NASA policy and GINA80, and this could hopefully decrease health risks associated with individual differences during spaceflight missions to an acceptable level, while refraining from using omics information for employment selection and flight assignment. Altogether, this balance may align with what is perhaps the current consensus for an appropriate compromise, based on regulations in many regions worldwide. One further ethical issue that will be faced by space agencies and commercial spaceflight companies collecting astronaut omics is the risk of incidental findings80. For example, collection and analysis of astronaut omics data could reveal unexpected findings, such as predisposition to late onset Alzheimer’s disease. In some cases, these findings may not be medically actionable. Disclosing these findings to the astronaut could cause them and their family members psychological harm. Policies would be seen as overly permissible if they do not factor in the risk of incidental findings and fail to implement appropriate and clear procedures for disclosure and genetic counseling. Keys to developing balanced policies Ultimately, policymaking for human space omics should be considered as a balancing act between developing policies that are not so overly restrictive that they limit the scientific potential of the data, and not so overly permissible that they invoke risk and expose participants and their families to harm. Standardization of policies could ensure that an appropriate balance is struck, safeguarding against ethical risks, while enabling appropriate accessibility for scientific and healthcare utilization of the data. This need for balance is embedded into the mixed role of space agencies, as research institutions and clinical care providers for astronaut employees80. While each dataset may still need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, such as for assessing identifiability of the data, clear policy frameworks could reduce bias and help to prevent unwarranted delays associated with unstandardized policy. As the number of humans and enterprises in space increases, and the understanding of omics increases in the context of ethical issues including privacy and discrimination, standards will need to be continually reassessed and updated. It is worth noting that while ethical challenges such as privacy are certainly amplified at present by the relatively unique standing of astronauts as a small cohort of figures in the public spotlight, to some extent, these issues are also shared by rare disease cohorts and elite athlete cohorts on Earth, and so existing policies in areas including handling incidental findings and data sharing appear to present an apt starting point for discussion96. It is essential that standardization of policymaking for human space omics be considered with an international perspective, as space agencies and commercial companies are subject to different laws based on geographical region, and may also be influenced by cultural differences81,97. For example, laws surrounding genetic discrimination and handling of incidental findings vary internationally93,98. Where appropriate, policies should aim to find harmonious solutions within the framework of internationally established legislation, such as the Declaration of Helsinki99, respecting the rights of the human data subjects while giving careful consideration to the specific challenges of the astronaut or crew population and the societal role of human spaceflight. On the ISS, the IGA (intergovernmental agreement) extends the jurisdiction of countries to their registered elements and personnel; for example, European law applies to European astronauts and the Columbus laboratory module on the ISS, with the existence of member state national laws adding further complexity59. Conversely, the Human Research Multilateral Review Board (HRMRB) is a review board between international partners to ensure that all human subject research onboard the ISS is conducted ethically according to internationally agreed principles. It is likely that future missions, including commercial missions involving multi-national participants, will require similar navigation of international laws to create policies. This need to design harmonious international policy raises concerns over fairness; for example, if a country has more restrictive laws in areas such as data protection, it may become challenging for citizens of that country to participate in international space missions, omic studies, and omic-based technologies such as precision healthcare. Similarly, given the role of international collaboration in human spaceflight research, establishing clear and harmonious policies for lawful sharing and processing of human space omics data will be crucial100. Where human space omics data is deemed to be identifiable, databases should adhere to high standards of security, and access levels or other technical solutions for reducing ethical harm risks should be considered101. For example, data sanitization methods can manipulate the data to reduce the risk of identification88, but should be balanced against the potential loss of scientific utility. Additionally, federated approaches102, such as federating learning for training AI models without moving the data across jurisdictions, could prove useful103,104. In adherence to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles105, human space omics data should be as “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”, in order to maximize scientific utility while protecting the rights of the participants. Furthermore, an important aspect of developing appropriate policies will be striving for meaningful informed consent from participants, both in terms of consenting to venture into space, and consenting to the collection, usage, and sharing of their omics data. To the former point, omics technologies, such as predicted risk based on individual differences, could help to provide participants with additional data, enabling greater decision autonomy to improve the informed consent process for space travel. Broad consent has been proposed as a potential solution to gain consent in the context of omics research, where it may be hard to define future uses of the data at a granular level, and the identifiability risks of different omics data types may be challenging to accurately quantify106. When carefully implemented, it has been argued that broad consent may be an appropriate choice for obtaining consent in the context of space omics studies and has been used in the recent commercial spaceflight health data repository established by the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank and the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH)65. Discussions regarding the development of appropriate policies need to commence early, so that anticipatory policies are ready as the science is ready80. With deep molecular profiling of astronauts now at the forefront of space biology research, and a key part of the climate of commercial spaceflight and ambitious missions outside of LEO, now would seem the opportune time to kick-start discussions into appropriate policy design. ISSOP, with its international membership and links to NASA GeneLab and the ESA Space Omics Topical Team, is well positioned to help guide standardization of policy-making regarding astronaut or commercial crews’ omics data, particularly from a scientific perspective. ISSOP can work closely with groups such as the Global Alliance for Genomic Health (GA4GH) to merge expertise in spaceflight omics research and terrestrial omics policymaking, which could help to ensure that policies maximize scientific utility while protecting the rights of the astronauts and crews.",

    "conclusion": "Conclusions In the coming years, humans may venture into space for unprecedented durations and distances outside of the Earth’s radioprotective magnetosphere. Resupply and evacuation would be precluded in some cases, calling for a modernized spaceflight nutrition, wellness, and telehealth field that would likely incorporate molecular omics. Precision healthcare is becoming more commonplace for populations on Earth, where international consortiums are using high-resolution omics to construct the Human Cell Atlas. It seems probable that as increasingly large and diverse populations enter space, the purposeful implementation of routine standardized omics with consenting participants during spaceflight could similarly permit precision space healthcare and a Human Cell Space Atlas. The cell space atlas could serve as an open access, global reference for basic space life science research. While human space omics could catalyze critical improvement of safety measures for future space travelers, numerous ethical, cultural, and legal challenges would need to be carefully surmounted from global viewpoints. This manuscript provided examples of both the potential healthcare benefits and the ethical complexities that will likely be inherent to the human space omics discipline as a means to encourage anticipatory discussions amongst international ethicists, philosophers, scientists, and the public community.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166943 PMID: 38862505 Abstract Future multi-year crewed planetary missions will motivate advances in aerospace nutrition and telehealth. On Earth, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to spatially map all cell types in the human body. Here, we propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research. As humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, high-resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceflight healthcare. Alongside the scientific potential, we consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the human space omics discipline, and how philosophical frameworks may benefit from international perspectives. Subject terms: Gene expression, Medical genomics, Molecular medicine High-resolution omics data have facilitated the ongoing Human Cell Atlas project. In this Perspective, Rutter and colleagues propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas initiative would provide a platform for spaceflight-associated research and healthcare.Introduction Humanity may be on the brink of establishing a new era of interplanetary space exploration that would witness crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) and a growing commercial spaceflight sector that would prompt a wider health range of individuals entering space compared to the selective cohorts of distinctively fit professional astronauts from previous generations. Numerous space organizations across the globe openly aspire toward landing humans on Mars in the coming decades, underscoring an overall international interest in what may be the next stage of human space exploration. Prominent examples include the SpaceX Mars program striving to initiate the first crewed Mars spaceflights in the late 2020s; the state-owned China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology announcing the country’s goals to place humans on Mars in 2033; NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United States space agency) issuing the Authorization Act of 2017, which declares objectives to send humanity to Mars in the early 2030s; Roscosmos (the Russian space agency) publishing aims to send humans to Mars in the early 2040s; and the United Arab Emirates publishing the Mars 2117 Project, which outlines a one-hundred-year plan to construct habitable communities for humans on Mars. Thus, there is a motive for scientists across the world to study how the human body responds to spaceflight and to develop countermeasures that improve the health and safety of crewed interplanetary missions. Since the inception of human spaceflight, the duration that astronauts spend in space each mission has increased over time (Fig. 1A). Despite this, to date, only eleven individuals have resided in space for more than 300 consecutive days. Pioneering crewed missions to Mars would see humans embarking through space for even longer consecutive periods of time and in radiation environments for which there is limited knowledge about the impact on human physiology, warranting improvements in the autonomous space telehealth field. The risk of an emergency medical occurrence during space missions has previously been estimated at approximately 0.06 per person-year, which roughly equates to one event every 2.4 years for a crew of seven1. Multiyear planetary missions would prevent resupply and medical evacuation options and hence would require fully autonomous telehealth and triage protocols. Fig. 1. Space Missions. Open in a new tab A Violin plots showing the average time a given astronaut spends in space per mission (calculated as total time in space divided by number of missions) compared to the decade the astronaut first went into space. Astronauts are colored by the number of missions they have been on, and shapes represent astronaut sex (females are triangles and males are circles). The average time spent in space ranged from minutes to one month in the 1960s, and from one day to under six months in the 1970s. In the 1980s through 2000s, the majority of astronauts spent an average of between one week and one month in space per mission, but many astronauts spent more than three months in space. Subsequently, in the 2010s, the majority of astronauts spent an average of over three months in space per mission, whereas in the early 2020 s, there was the widest distribution of average time in space, ranging from ten minutes to six months. B The number of astronauts who have been in space by nationality. Bar plot shows the number of astronauts by the year of their first mission whereas the pie chart shows the percentage of each nation’s contribution. Nations with only one astronaut to ever go to space are colored green (4%), nations with only between two and five astronauts to go to space are colored lime green (3%), and astronauts with multiple nationalities are colored yellow (1%). Data was scraped from supercluster.com on September 20th, 2021. Only astronauts who spent time in space and crossed the Kármán line are displayed.Various applications of artificial intelligence and molecular omics could likely advance the spaceflight telehealth field. Omics technologies allow for the quantification of large pools of biomolecules that influence the integrity and function of biology. Exploratory and untargeted omics techniques can measure analytes that are not predetermined. These studies can identify patterns of variance, which can generate new hypotheses. Additionally, integrating omics with metadata, including environmental and phenotypic measures, enhances the ability to establish robust links between environmental influences, omic variations, and phenotypic outcomes2. The NASA Twins Study integrated various omics platforms, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, and highlighted omics as a potential biomedical research platform that may one day translate into the development of precision spaceflight healthcare3. The ambitious project discovered more than 8600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between an astronaut who resided for almost one year on the International Space Station (ISS) and their identical twin who resided on Earth; it is possible that any permutation of the DEG list could uncover biochemical pathways that hold keys to the development of therapeutic supplements and lifestyle recommendations that better protect health in space3,4. In this paper, we will consider how the dawn of diversified human exploration of deeper space may benefit from sophisticated advances in spaceflight nutrition and health that may be met in part with the addition of routine standardized omics. Space omics efforts are now underway in multiple regions. In Japan, the “Living in Space” Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) program uncovers biological responses to the space environment at various levels, ranging from environmental microbiomes to stress responses in humans, using omics technologies. In Europe, the Space Omics Topical Team (TT) supports and generates omics approaches to space biology5, and there are visible efforts to promote further development of space omics research among ESA and ESA state members6. In the United States, examples of space omics-related campaigns include the Precision Health Initiative and Systems Biology Translational Project through the NASA Human Research Program (HRP) and the Complement of Integrated Protocols for Human Exploration Research (CIPHER) project (“Human Research Program Update”, WH Paloski, Committee on Biological and Physical Sciences in Space (CBPSS) Virtual Fall Committee Meeting). The NASA GeneLab initiative provides an open access, collaborative analysis platform for space omics data collected across the world and unites international efforts through analysis working groups7. Canada operates terrestrial platforms to analyze human omics linked with biomedical data8, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has announced plans for national space omics research, in addition to already participating in international space omics projects. China and Russia are also publishing human space omics research9,10. Humans in spaceflight historically represented nations like the United Socialist Soviet Republic and the United States to a large degree (Fig. 1B). After the first couple of decades of human spaceflight, nations like Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Russia have also been represented to a moderate degree (Fig. 1B). Individuals who have entered space now represent, even if in smaller numbers, more than thirty other nations: Afghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, Hungary, India, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and Vietnam. The Artemis program plans to soon reestablish a human presence on the Moon, for the first time in five decades, and construct a permanent lunar base to facilitate the future of human missions to Mars. Led by NASA and partner agencies JAXA, ESA, and CSA, the Artemis program includes signatories from about thirty countries and territories, reflecting on the theme of a more global human presence in space. Indeed, crewed missions to Mars would motivate philosophical thinking about humanity’s place in the universe, common to all humans. Many people believe such missions will only be enabled by worldwide collaboration due to the involvement of multiple countries and international organizations, the implications for many people across Earth, the sheer engineering demands, and the increasing global representation of space explorers11. Upcoming planetary missions will likely be multinational efforts, underscoring the need for global collaboration in regard to the science, culture, and ethics behind space exploration. A new age of human space omics may likewise require international input due to both the various cultural aspects and the added technological, ethical, and philosophical complexities of working with human subjects. International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP) represents an international consortium of space omics scientists who formed after recognizing the need for standard guidelines in the emerging spaceflight omics discipline. ISSOP includes scientists with expertise across the full range of omics approaches who receive funding from academia, industry, and government agencies across a wide array of regions, including Japan, India, the Middle East, Canada, Europe, Russia, and the United States. By promoting communication exchange in the space omics discipline, ISSOP may be uniquely positioned to support the development of an informed framework early on that can help maximize scientific discovery and minimize ethical problems for an upcoming era of human space omics. In this paper, we consider how a future of precision space healthcare could improve the safety of human health during long-term spaceflight. We then discuss how careful standardization of space omics data is one component that may help implement this goal. To this end, we propose the development of a human cell atlas under spaceflight environmental conditions that could assist as an openly available, global resource for foundational space life science research. We then consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the general discipline of human space omics, and how philosophical frameworks would likely need to be established with perspectives from international ethicists. Precision healthcare in space In the coming years, the spaceflight field will likely observe diversification of the flying population, extended mission durations, and exposure to harsher radiation beyond LEO. These factors motivate an upgraded space healthcare model where nutritional, supplemental, and pharmaceutical decisions could be tailored to multiple characteristics12,13. On Earth, there are already applications of precision health, where healthcare is informed based on omics, environmental, and lifestyle factors14. It seems probable that as connections between omics and spaceflight health ailments are slowly elucidated, similar approaches could be implemented in space. The purpose of customizing spaceflight healthcare would not be to reduce spaceflight participation, but to promote the health of increasingly diverse participation that better reflects the sustained presence of the full inclusive range of humanity in space one day13. Countermeasure protocols for space missions can consist of evidence-based nutritional supplements, exercise regimes, stress-relieving techniques, and pharmacological interventions15. Moving forward, crew profiles could potentially improve medical risk assessment and countermeasures; optimize medical and nutritional payloads; increase crew safety and efficiency; and maximize the likelihood of mission success. In the next section, we will explore examples of how astronaut health and performance can be impacted by omic differences related to the metabolism of drugs, micronutrients, and macronutrients. We focus on metabolism because changes in mitochondria, the key hub of metabolism, are a fundamental biological feature of spaceflight16. We note that the provocative nature of the spaceflight environment may induce a large number of physiological and molecular changes on rapid time scales that may not necessarily be of health-related importance. As a result, scientists must cautiously avoid overassociating spaceflight omics changes with clinical meanings. Indeed, most human gene association studies on Earth are associative with many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) providing initial results that failed to hold up upon further testing. The risk of overinterpretation is particularly relevant in the field of human space omics given the small sample sizes and the small number of studies3; the difficulty of securing suitable ground controls, both in omics and environment3,17; and the long number of years required to replicate findings. These problems are further amplified when studying the long-term effects of spaceflight outside of LEO. We emphasize that the following section mostly presents early evidence and even contradictions due to the current limitations of the human space omics field, and that much more work would be needed in the coming decades to assess the validity of the below preliminary findings and interpretations.Drug metabolism in space Medical kits onboard the ISS contain pharmaceuticals to cover various medical events and emergencies, including injuries, illnesses, infections, sleep disruptions, motion sickness, and cognitive and behavioral health conditions18. Documentation of medication usage has not been consistent, but studies suggest about 94% of crew members used medications at least once during space shuttle missions19. Despite the common use of medications to manage health concerns on orbit, few studies have explored how to refine pharmaceutical applications in the unique environment of space. Preliminary evidence suggests that spaceflight may introduce impurity products, alter the physical appearance, and quicken the degradation of certain drugs before their expiration dates20,21. Although these investigations have been severely limited without adequate ground controls, they have underlined the need to verify if any spaceflight factors may affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters that determine the pharmaceutical safety and efficacy, and the mechanisms responsible for these effects22,23. These factors might include the space environment itself (such as chronic low-dose radiation) and/or confounding extraneous factors (such as temperature, humidity, and dosage repackaging commonly used to meet the limited volume constraints on space vehicles)18,22,24. Thorough metadata tabulation could eventually help unravel not only how to preserve drugs in space, but also how to better understand precision responses to such drugs. A recent pharmacogenetics study by the ESA demonstrated that allelic variation may influence the safety and effectiveness of how individual crew members metabolize drugs on the ISS. Researchers examined the 78 standard drugs permanently available on the ISS and found that the metabolism of 24 of them was significantly affected by individual variants in genetic polymorphism enzymes25. This discovery suggested that almost one-third of drugs on the ISS may warrant personal dose adjustments or alternative therapies for crew members who have allelic predispositions that can render them anywhere from poor metabolizers (with decreased drug clearance, increased plasma drug levels, and potential adverse drug response) to ultra-rapid metabolizers (with increased drug clearance, decreased plasma drug levels, and potential ineffective drug response). Populations throughout the world can have different frequencies of genetic polymorphism enzymes that affect drug metabolisms26; thus, pharmacogenetic screening of consenting astronauts from diverse backgrounds could better ensure equal representation27. Personal astronaut drug-metabolism profiles could be generated based on the two reaction phases of drug biotransformation. The first drug biotransformation reaction produces a more water-soluble and less active metabolite usually through the hydroxylating enzyme superfamily known as Cytochrome P450 (CYP450). This enzyme superfamily is believed to account for 75% of total drug metabolism28. Indeed, CYPs have recently been suggested to be altered in flight due to alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling29. Several CYP450 genes are highly polymorphic, producing enzyme variants that cause variability in drug-metabolizing effects between groups. During mission planning, CYP450 genetic variant profiles for consenting astronauts could be generated and cross-referenced with mission drug lists to prevent scenarios in which crew members would otherwise metabolize drugs in harmful or inefficient ways13. The second drug biotransformation is usually a conjugation reaction wherein a small molecule binds to the drug metabolite and increases its solubility for excretion. For this situation, consenting astronauts could assess their pre-mission status of all nutrient cofactors and conjugation agents (such as glutathione, glycine, cysteine, arginine, and taurine) to inform their optimum conditions13. One concrete example of how CYP allelic variants could inform treatments during space exploration relates to acute radiation sickness (ARS)30. ARS is an accepted risk on orbit, and common medications to treat its primary symptoms of nausea and vomiting include ondansetron and granisetron, which are both metabolized differently in the liver based on individual CYP genetic polymorphisms. Specifically, the CYP2D6 enzyme metabolizes ondansetron, and, hence, groups who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of the CYP2D6 pathway have a higher risk of still vomiting within one day of radiotherapy with ondansetron31. These groups may benefit from treating ARS with granisetron, which is instead metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme31. Another example of how CYP allelic variants could inform spaceflight therapies based on personal predispositions relates to sleep drugs, which are commonly used by crew. In fact, 78% of shuttle crew reported taking zolpidem and zaleplon, powerful sleep pills, for more than half of the nights of their missions32. CYP3A polymorphisms are known to affect zolpidem metabolism33, but not zaleplon metabolism25, and astronauts could use this knowledge to more safely tailor their sleep-related treatments. It may also be meaningful to investigate optimal doses of medications that are more tailored to the demanding lifestyles of astronauts. For example, unlike many individuals on Earth, astronauts on the ISS are occasionally awakened by alarms during scheduled sleeping shifts in order to perform emergency tasks that require effective cognitive and psychomotor capabilities34. A study at NASA Johnson Space Center found that subjects who consumed a higher dose of zolpidem before sleep experienced significantly reduced cognitive and psychomotor performance during emergency awakenings; however, they found no similar impairments in subjects who consumed the lower dose of zolpidem, the dose of zaleplon, or the placebo before sleep onset34. Hence, even though the approved doses of zolpidem and zaleplon may be fit for most terrestrial applications, the unique duties during spaceflight may warrant adjusted recommended dosages of these, and possibly other, approved medications. Even the metabolism of medications may be altered in spaceflight compared to on Earth. The kidneys, which play a major role in drug excretion, may reduce urine output during weightlessness35. The liver, which is the main organ that metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics, may also behave differently between terrestrial and spaceflight conditions, although results have been conflicting: While some studies have reported an increase in hepatic blood flow and size during spaceflight36, other studies have suggested a decrease in hepatic metabolism in space, which may roughly correspond to a decrease in hepatic blood flow due to the hypovolemia that occurs on orbit37. Clear elucidation of potential differences between drug metabolism in terrestrial versus orbital conditions will require further investigation, and any reliable findings could eventually be integrated for improved aerospace healthcare recommendations27.Micronutrient metabolism in space Recent studies are elucidating tentative relationships between omics and micronutrient intake that may link to adverse health events in space. One key example of this is one-carbon metabolism, which involves the transfer of methyl groups from donors (such as folate, B12, choline, and betaine). We note that many of the donors are essential inputs that must be obtained from the diet. The enzymes that regulate one-carbon metabolism are produced from highly polymorphic methyltransferase genes; any possible ramifications for human spaceflight are only recently unfolding13. As an example, spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) is a unique and distinctive clinical manifestation. It includes optic disk edema (swelling), choroidal folds, and focal areas of ischemic retina (cotton wool spots). This disease is believed to present in over 20% of astronauts both during and after short and long duration spaceflight38. With no known terrestrial analogue, evidence-based countermeasures are only recently emerging; these include lower body negative pressure and nutritional supplementation39, the latter of which could be further refined through omics studies. Indeed, one research group examined 49 astronauts and discovered that common variations in one-carbon metabolism genes, combined with lower levels of vitamins B2, B6, and B9, appeared to be associated with SANS40,41. In addition to poor neuro-ocular health, disordered one-carbon metabolism may play a role in bone fragility (with increased osteoclast activation and decreased osteoblast activity)13, hypertension (with increased intraocular pressure)42, and chromosome instability (with concurring folate deficiency increasing defective DNA repair)43. It is indicative that this single metabolic property may have wide-ranging impacts on some of the more perplexing health complications known to occur during spaceflight13. For these reasons, one-carbon metabolism is an example candidate for deeper research into a future precision space medicine approach. There is likewise preliminary evidence that prolonged radiation exposure may interact with genetic polymorphisms that alter micronutrient metabolism, predisposing to disease in space. For example, there is precursory evidence suggesting that the space environment partially contributes to altered iron metabolism in astronauts44. Iron overload is believed to occur more often in individuals with allelic variants for hemochromatosis (HFE)45. Simultaneously, urinary magnesium (Mg) levels are reported to decrease during space missions, with a slight majority of post-spaceflight astronauts presenting with levels below minimum clinical guidelines46. Taken together, these provisional observations suggest that astronauts with HFE allelic variants may develop unusually high levels of iron when exposed to the space environment, which may induce oxidative stress and unstable DNA47. Given that Mg repairs DNA damage48, further research may be justified to examine whether convergent Mg deficiencies could complete a dangerous aggregation of risk events in a subset of astronauts who are susceptible to this array of environment, omics, and dietary intake parameters13. DNA stability is a leading human safety concern in space and hence it seems meaningful to investigate whether consenting individuals can benefit from optimizing any essential dietary inputs with relevance to DNA repair before, during, and after spaceflight based on precision risk profiles. The supplementation of Vitamin D, another important micronutrient, is regularly integrated into spaceflight nutrition programs49. While Vitamin D is well-known for its influence on bone production, it impacts several more biological processes, including immune system modulation. Its effect on immunity seems to be mediated by the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), expressed by antigen-presenting cells and activated T cells50. Conversely, Vitamin D and VDR are necessary to maintain a healthy number of regulatory T cells51. Allelic variants of the VDR gene appear to be associated with better response to Vitamin D supplementation52, and allelic variants of genes (such as 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), a gene related to sterol metabolism) are believed to be related to improved Vitamin D metabolism and insulin resistance53. Therefore, poor Vitamin D status and metabolism of individuals during space missions, which already have inherent stressful elements, might negatively affect the immune systems of astronauts, and this could potentially be mitigated through precision omics profiles.Macronutrient metabolism in space Differences in macronutrient consumption needs have been linked to variants in genes, such as the Retinoic acid receptor beta (RARB) gene, the DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1) gene, and the Fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene54,55. Altogether, these variants appear to be associated with body composition, fat distribution, and obesity risk in relation to carbohydrate, lipid, and protein intake54,55. Initial studies have suggested that endocrine changes linked to spaceflight modify metabolism and strengthen its association with alterations in astronaut body composition and nutritional intake needs56. It may be possible that long-duration space voyages could exacerbate dietary deficits. The nutritional condition of astronauts appears to be affected by metabolic stress, changing gut flora, altered feeding behavior, vitamin insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalance57. Maintaining energy balance in space missions will likely be critical for maintaining body fat muscle homeostasis58. These early findings imply a possibility that prolonged space exposure and dietary deficits may interact with genetic polymorphisms in a subset of astronauts to promote unusual pathologies that could be prevented by better nutritional information and health plans based on thorough research in the spaceflight omics discipline. It may hence be valuable to properly investigate and characterize any relationships between micronutrients, macronutrients, pharmaceuticals, omics, and various spaceflight environmental factors. These relationships are complex and underline the critical usefulness for rigorous standardization of space omics data and metadata so that meta-analyses may one day disentangle more confidently which factors are linked to preventable diseases at both the group and individual levels during spaceflight.Standardized space omics collection Standardization of space omics data and metadata would be an important component of a successful human space omics discipline. JAXA is currently conducting human liquid biopsy studies on the ISS. The main purpose of the studies is to investigate how the space environment affects humans at the tissue level. Besides fat and skin samples, which can be risky, whole-body solid tissue biopsies cannot typically be conducted in humans in space. As a result, the project proposes to perform minimally invasive liquid biopsies in astronauts. Liquid biopsies can detect cell-free components (microRNA, RNA, DNA, and extracellular vesicles) in the blood and scientists can estimate which tissues the cell components are derived from, allowing for full-body monitoring of omics responses. While solid biopsies only reflect a single time point of a single site on a single tissue, liquid biopsies can allow for a less invasive assessment of extracellular DNA and RNA in the plasma, which can represent molecular responses of the internal tissues in the body and can be obtained at repeated timepoints. The project proposes to collect astronaut blood samples at multiple time points before, during, and after living on the ISS. Murine and human plasma samples may be processed using the same processing protocol, thereby allowing for direct comparison of human and veterinary patients in a minimally invasive fashion for both species. These unique data collections are expected to enable cross-species integrative data analysis of space environment effects on mammals in a manner that is less technically and ethically complex than previous methods. Moving forward, the majority of sampling on astronauts would likely consist of liquid biopsy approaches and other non-invasive and minimally invasive procedures. Traditional tissue biopsies carry a risk of infection and localized pain which could compromise astronaut health and performance in physical tasks such as spacewalks. Furthermore, less invasive sampling methods are often quick to perform and do not require significant recovery periods between samples, which can allow for more frequent sampling and thus greater temporal resolution of omic changes throughout missions. The feasibility of orbital sampling and readout can be explored for various biological sources, such as saliva, sweat, tears, urine, and nasal discharge, some of which have been reviewed in the context of human spaceflight elsewhere59. An increase in capabilities for inflight omic processing and readout could also enable inflight interventions to maintain health, such as nutritional supplements based on gene regulatory changes related to metabolism of specific vitamins. New metadata normalization is another example of a rising standardization challenge that comes with the arrival of human space omics projects. Some key metadata parameters that should be collected from humans include environment, diet, nutrition, psychosocial dynamics, lifestyle, medical history, anthropometrics, and phenotypes13. Many of these metadata parameters have not been necessarily collected in space and hence have no standardization methods. For instance, wearable technology could be implemented to provide metadata of astronaut health, similar to fitness trackers that have been successfully used on Earth to measure various medical parameters, including increased insulin resistance, which has also been observed in spaceflight60,61. At the same time, metadata can be misused to identify individual astronauts, an ethical problem that, unlike in model organism studies, has to be addressed. With a mission to continuously improve recommended metadata normalization protocols for space omics data, ISSOP may help spark discussions needed to resolve some of these challenges. In addition to best efforts to standardize space omics studies62, increased resolution may help interpret allelic variants associated with disease risks by more precisely pinpointing cell types and states involved in biology. Achieving this goal relates back to our project exploring an example set of alleles that are putatively linked to protective mechanisms, and their implications for therapeutic compound discovery and improved spaceflight nutrition and lifestyle recommendations63. As described next, extending standardized approaches toward space omics data that is higher in resolution could enable the generation of cell space atlases, which could further push forward a developing field of precision space healthcare.Human cell space atlas To date, bulk transcriptomic technologies, such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays, have mostly been used to understand how spaceflight impacts physiology. These approaches have characterized physiology at the tissue level, composed of billions of diverse cells, rather than at the individual cell level. However, to obtain a thorough understanding of the complex dynamics that spaceflight causes in humans, there is a need to increase the analysis resolution level. In the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), researchers recently collected high-resolution omics data from commercial astronauts during the Inspiration4 mission; the project included multi-omics spatial mapping, single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq). Civilian missions may greatly contribute to advancing the spaceflight omics field, given that many commercial spaceflight participants have expressed voluntary interest in participating in space biomedical research and sharing data for biobanks and scientific publication64,65. These technological advances have created an unprecedented opportunity for in-depth molecular studies in space biology in the short- and middle-term future. In recent years, researchers on Earth have used high-resolution omics to create a plant cell atlas (PCA)66, mouse cell atlas (MCA)67, and human cell atlas (HCA)68. These initiatives aim to construct thorough spatial maps of all cells in organisms as references for research, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of disease69, and assist in the development of better therapies. Contemporary routine blood tests that provide rough counts of white and red blood cells could become acutely more informative if cell types and states can be discerned with finer granularity. This could lead to improved diagnostic tests that detect infections before clinical symptoms are present, representing a shift from reactionary treatment of health issues towards a preventative approach69. As society becomes increasingly spacefaring, one can envision the development of parallel initiatives to the PCA, MCA, and HCA that are specific to the space environment (Fig. 2). A plant, mouse, and human cell space atlas (PCSA, MCSA, and HCSA) could improve our understanding of how each system responds to spaceflight and hence enhance health monitoring capabilities during prolonged space missions. Having access to the different changes occurring at the spatial cell type level in key organs between ground control and flight conditions would allow researchers to better understand how cell-cell interactions are altered by spaceflight70,71,72. Fig. 2. Cell space atlas. Open in a new tab Multi-omic experiments, whether on Earth or in space, have a number of complexities when designing and comparing results to other published work. Namely, there are numerous models which could be leveraged to investigate the molecular (omic) changes in different organ systems using different technologies, which can then be processed and analyzed in numerous ways. Further, experiments conducted in space may be more influenced by environmental factors that are either regulated within the craft (such as oxygen) or not (such as radiation). These environmental factors are crucial to understanding results and can drastically vary by experiment. Given these complexities, understanding the environmental factors during a mission and the exact experimental design (including acquiring and analyzing the data), and standardizing them across agencies will be crucial to the development of aerospace multi omic analyses. Further, given the overall cost of these experiments as well as the limited resources to conduct them, this centralized and normalized database, which is accessible to other scientists, can assist our understanding of spaceflight risks, their counter measurements, and monitoring.These insights could therefore lead to a more detailed comprehension of how various botanical organisms, veterinarian patients, and human patients respond to spaceflight in order to design new and substantially more precise treatments as countermeasures for health in space. The cell space atlases could serve as openly available international resources developed at the start of the human space omics era that span multiple generations to come, not only to characterize cellular responses to spaceflight but also to investigate how cell cross-talk is altered when the system is exposed to extreme environmental conditions like space. Human and model organism cell space atlases could be constructed in a minimally invasive manner, using in vitro and ex vivo technologies. For example, tissue chips (organs on chips) could be viable options for high-resolution space omics studies73. In the past several years, a series of experiments have tested tissue chips on the ISS through the Tissue Chips in Space initiative, which is a partnership between the ISS National Lab and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes for Health ()74. Tissue chips are composed of human cells grown on artificial 3D scaffolds to model the structure and function of human tissues, allowing researchers to assess how major organs and systems in the human body respond to the extreme environment of space. Real human tissues can also be studied in spaceflight following protocols similar to the Suture in Space initiative, where living tissue from biopsies are extracted and sutured together to serve as models to better understand physiological mechanisms in space, including wound repair and regeneration27. Engineers have already developed miniaturized equipment and automation procedures for tissue chips to be employed in low capacity during flight missions. ESA plans to develop a 3D bioprinter for the ISS that could generate human tissue constructs in microgravity to study the complexity of cellular component responses to the space environment27. In addition to their role in potentially developing cell space atlases, personalized chips and tissues could also be exposed to extreme environments before missions to assess individual risks, and then could be placed on spaceflight to monitor health changes and test prospective countermeasures. We note that the omics methods used to construct cell space atlases may depend on whether sample processing occurs during spaceflight and/or back in terrestrial labs. For example, scRNA-seq approaches require fresh material, whereas snRNA-seq approaches can use frozen samples75. Spaceflight restrictions may also limit omics approaches: For instance, methods may initially be proteomics-based on orbit to successfully accommodate compact equipment that can operate at low power13. This could potentially lead to the generation of a human protein space atlas that integrates spatial mapping of human proteomics into atlas efforts, paralleling the Human Protein Atlas project already initiated in terrestrial healthcare76. Overcoming these technical boundaries and optimizing the quality of these technically novel datasets would require input from experienced omics scientists with extensive knowledge about spaceflight biology. ISSOP is composed of members with stated missions to routinely update recommended sample processing guidelines for space omics datasets to allow for better harmonization of data and increased gain of knowledge77. Members have expertise related to the processing of multi-omics data samples, and several ISSOP members are prime contributors to the previously mentioned JAXA and NASA projects utilizing cutting-edge and high-resolution omics techniques. As a result, ISSOP could serve as a community that is integral for propelling the space omics field into the next stage of innovation with projects related to themes such as the construction of cell space atlases. Alongside the technical challenges of constructing a human cell atlas for spaceflight, the generation and usage of human space omics data poses considerable ethical, cultural, and legal challenges that would need to be carefully resolved through policy development. Indeed, one motivation of the current perspective paper is to provide examples of the upcoming ethical and legal complexities inherent to the nascent human space omics discipline in order to encourage earlier discussions amongst international ethicists, philosophers, scientists, and the public community.Ethical and policy considerations As a consequence of the increasing adoption of human omics research in space, it has become crucial to increase standardization of policies for regulating the collection, storage, access, and usage of astronauts’ (sometimes called spaceflight participants, or SFPs) omics data. Based on recommendations from a 2014 report by the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine)78, NASA instituted a policy (NPD 7170.1) regarding the collection and usage of genomic data for human research. However, we are not currently aware of other prominent space agencies - or commercial spaceflight companies - publishing public policies regarding astronaut or crew omics data. Notably, the United Nations recently formed a working group on “Space and Global Health”. In their draft resolution (A/AC.105/C.1/L.402), they encourage Member States to “establish a policy-enabled environment and governance mechanisms, with due consideration of legal and ethical issues, for removing barriers to the effective use of space-based technologies, including telemedicine solutions”. The current rarity of human omics collection and curation can be viewed as a barrier to the development and deployment of emerging space-based health technologies, including precision healthcare. Thus, in the following section, we consider legal and ethical challenges pertaining to policymaking in this context, concluding with some thoughts on how best to achieve balanced policies which support space omics research while protecting the rights of the participants (Fig. 3). Ethical considerations of human omics research is an emerging area for spaceflight79,80,59, this is just part of the bigger picture of space ethics81, and human omics research on Earth82. Fig. 3. Ethics. Open in a new tab Policies pertaining to the collection, storage, and usage of omics data from consenting astronauts and spaceflight participants would need to be carefully balanced. Thorough discussion amongst international ethicists could ensure that such policies are designed such that they are not so restrictive that they significantly limit the potential for scientific progress and improved occupational healthcare in space, and not so permissible that they expose participants to ethical harms.Dangers of restrictive policies: scientific potential unused As mentioned throughout this manuscript, standardized collection and curation of human space omics data has great potential to accelerate scientific research into human health in space and enable the deployment of precision medicine technologies to improve occupational healthcare during spaceflight missions. Therefore, underutilization of the scientific and healthcare potential for human space omics data is the primary danger of overly restrictive policies. Firstly, if policies restrict the operational usage of human space omics data in occupational health processes, such as countermeasure design and long-term health monitoring, the full potential for reducing health risks might not be realized. Consequently, this could endanger crew members, reduce likelihood of mission success, and potentially infringe upon the duty of care space agencies have for their astronaut employees. This duty of care includes not just the immediate health and safety of astronauts during missions, but also their long-term health due to occupational exposures such as cosmic radiation78. Secondly, if policies do not allow for sufficient data to be collected and processed from humans in space for research purposes, the pace of space life sciences research will be slower, with increased dependency on ground-based analogs. Similarly, restrictive policies for data accessibility/sharing would also slow the pace of research. When investigators contribute data to the scientific community through open-science initiatives, it can be analyzed via varied approaches, including comparatively to other datasets to yield novel insights. In the context of spaceflight omics data, the value of open-science has recently been demonstrated through a large-scale multi-omics analysis comparing datasets from the NASA GeneLab biorepository, to uncover mitochondrial dysregulation as a key hub of the biological response to spaceflight83. Biorepositories can be leveraged with “Big data” approaches, where patterns such as radiation sensitivity, can be learned via the application of machine learning methods to collections of multi-omics datasets84. With increased collection of omics data from humans in space, these kinds of approaches could be applied to human spaceflight, such as to predict susceptibility to radiation-based health issues in individual crewmembers85. Limiting accessibility to human space omics data creates a barrier to analysis efforts, thus every decrement from complete open access reduces the scientific utility of the data. A final consequence of restrictive policies is reductions in the scope and precision of the data provided to the wider scientific community. For the NASA Twins study, authors of one follow-up paper that accessed and reanalyzed the original study data indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels, copy number variations (CNVs), and structural genomic elements could not be included in the publication for confidentiality purposes86, thus limiting the scope of their public facing analysis. Regarding precision, efforts to anonymize and sanitize the data prior to data sharing - including data aggregation approaches and withholding metadata - could reduce the scientific utility, particularly as individual differences, such as gene variants associated with susceptibility to health issues, are essential information for unlocking precision healthcare approaches63.Dangers of permissible policies: exposure to ethical harms On the other hand, while scientific utilization of human space omics data could reduce health risks for crews, if policies are overly permissible, omics research could also lead to harm by exposing human subjects to ethical issues. In the case of space agencies, this would also infringe on their duty of care to their astronaut employees. Due to the familial nature of genomics, these issues may also affect family members. Notably, compared to typical terrestrial cohorts, many of these ethical challenges are amplified by the unique nature of the spacefaring population; astronauts are easily identifiable due to their current rarity and status as public figures79. One ethical issue that is particularly amplified by the standing of astronauts is that of privacy. The term “genetic privacy” is used ubiquitously, yet privacy breaches could apply to any identifiable omic-based personal data. Privacy breaches would involve disclosure of this data against the will of the participants, which could lead to psychological harm. Specifically, policies may be considered overly permissible if they fail to account for the risks of identifiability from the full range of omic data types and data formats. It is well understood that individuals can be identified using genomics data, such as SNPs87. However, identification via other omic data types, such as transcriptomics88, proteomics89,90, microbiomics91, and combinations of omic types (multi-omics)92, is a developing area of the literature. Identifying specific participants becomes possible through “linkage attacks” when phenotypic information is available in addition to the omics data88. Due to the nature of astronauts as public figures, phenotypic information such as ethnicity, age, and biological sex is readily available to the public. The small population size also means that the number of possible matches is limited, increasing the likelihood of successful linkage attacks. Aside from linkage attacks, privacy may also be violated via attacks on the data storage system. Thus, policies may be considered overly permissible if they do not ensure appropriate security and safeguarding mechanisms against data breaches. Relating to the issue of privacy is the ethical issue of genetic discrimination, which refers to individuals receiving differential or unfair treatment based on their genetic data. Policies permitting space agencies to use omics data predictive of health issues, such as genetic variants, in astronaut selection or during processes such as flight assignment, could be seen as discriminatory. Indeed, many countries worldwide have enacted laws to prevent the use of genetic information in employment decisions93. It is worth noting that this is somewhat of a controversial and complex topic; for example, in the United States, the military can use routine genetic screening results to inform assignment decisions, such as to withhold deploying troops with G6PD deficiency to locations which would require them to take antimalarial drugs, since doing so can cause life-threatening hemolytic reactions94. While the United States Space Force could present an interesting exception, NASA is not a branch of the military, so it is subject to the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 2008 (GINA), and therefore it would seem that it cannot use omic information in assignment and employment decisions79, which is also aligned with the current NASA policy (NPD 7170.1). However, even with precision medicine approaches, sending an individual with a genetic predisposition to spaceflight-associated risks, such as radiation susceptibility, on a long-duration mission to Mars may still increase the likelihood of a serious medical incident. Thus, it has been suggested that omic information would be useful for spaceflight selection and assignment processes95. This presents an ethical dilemma, where on the one hand, using omic information for flight assignment without the individual’s consent could be seen as discriminatory, and on the other hand, not doing so could potentially endanger the crew and reduce likelihood of mission safety and success. An additional consideration here is that some spaceflight-relevant genetic mutations may be linked to certain populations on Earth, which raises further issues of equity63. Using omics for precision healthcare does appear to be supported under the current NASA policy and GINA80, and this could hopefully decrease health risks associated with individual differences during spaceflight missions to an acceptable level, while refraining from using omics information for employment selection and flight assignment. Altogether, this balance may align with what is perhaps the current consensus for an appropriate compromise, based on regulations in many regions worldwide. One further ethical issue that will be faced by space agencies and commercial spaceflight companies collecting astronaut omics is the risk of incidental findings80. For example, collection and analysis of astronaut omics data could reveal unexpected findings, such as predisposition to late onset Alzheimer’s disease. In some cases, these findings may not be medically actionable. Disclosing these findings to the astronaut could cause them and their family members psychological harm. Policies would be seen as overly permissible if they do not factor in the risk of incidental findings and fail to implement appropriate and clear procedures for disclosure and genetic counseling.Keys to developing balanced policies Ultimately, policymaking for human space omics should be considered as a balancing act between developing policies that are not so overly restrictive that they limit the scientific potential of the data, and not so overly permissible that they invoke risk and expose participants and their families to harm. Standardization of policies could ensure that an appropriate balance is struck, safeguarding against ethical risks, while enabling appropriate accessibility for scientific and healthcare utilization of the data. This need for balance is embedded into the mixed role of space agencies, as research institutions and clinical care providers for astronaut employees80. While each dataset may still need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, such as for assessing identifiability of the data, clear policy frameworks could reduce bias and help to prevent unwarranted delays associated with unstandardized policy. As the number of humans and enterprises in space increases, and the understanding of omics increases in the context of ethical issues including privacy and discrimination, standards will need to be continually reassessed and updated. It is worth noting that while ethical challenges such as privacy are certainly amplified at present by the relatively unique standing of astronauts as a small cohort of figures in the public spotlight, to some extent, these issues are also shared by rare disease cohorts and elite athlete cohorts on Earth, and so existing policies in areas including handling incidental findings and data sharing appear to present an apt starting point for discussion96. It is essential that standardization of policymaking for human space omics be considered with an international perspective, as space agencies and commercial companies are subject to different laws based on geographical region, and may also be influenced by cultural differences81,97. For example, laws surrounding genetic discrimination and handling of incidental findings vary internationally93,98. Where appropriate, policies should aim to find harmonious solutions within the framework of internationally established legislation, such as the Declaration of Helsinki99, respecting the rights of the human data subjects while giving careful consideration to the specific challenges of the astronaut or crew population and the societal role of human spaceflight. On the ISS, the IGA (intergovernmental agreement) extends the jurisdiction of countries to their registered elements and personnel; for example, European law applies to European astronauts and the Columbus laboratory module on the ISS, with the existence of member state national laws adding further complexity59. Conversely, the Human Research Multilateral Review Board (HRMRB) is a review board between international partners to ensure that all human subject research onboard the ISS is conducted ethically according to internationally agreed principles. It is likely that future missions, including commercial missions involving multi-national participants, will require similar navigation of international laws to create policies. This need to design harmonious international policy raises concerns over fairness; for example, if a country has more restrictive laws in areas such as data protection, it may become challenging for citizens of that country to participate in international space missions, omic studies, and omic-based technologies such as precision healthcare. Similarly, given the role of international collaboration in human spaceflight research, establishing clear and harmonious policies for lawful sharing and processing of human space omics data will be crucial100. Where human space omics data is deemed to be identifiable, databases should adhere to high standards of security, and access levels or other technical solutions for reducing ethical harm risks should be considered101. For example, data sanitization methods can manipulate the data to reduce the risk of identification88, but should be balanced against the potential loss of scientific utility. Additionally, federated approaches102, such as federating learning for training AI models without moving the data across jurisdictions, could prove useful103,104. In adherence to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles105, human space omics data should be as “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”, in order to maximize scientific utility while protecting the rights of the participants. Furthermore, an important aspect of developing appropriate policies will be striving for meaningful informed consent from participants, both in terms of consenting to venture into space, and consenting to the collection, usage, and sharing of their omics data. To the former point, omics technologies, such as predicted risk based on individual differences, could help to provide participants with additional data, enabling greater decision autonomy to improve the informed consent process for space travel. Broad consent has been proposed as a potential solution to gain consent in the context of omics research, where it may be hard to define future uses of the data at a granular level, and the identifiability risks of different omics data types may be challenging to accurately quantify106. When carefully implemented, it has been argued that broad consent may be an appropriate choice for obtaining consent in the context of space omics studies and has been used in the recent commercial spaceflight health data repository established by the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank and the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH)65. Discussions regarding the development of appropriate policies need to commence early, so that anticipatory policies are ready as the science is ready80. With deep molecular profiling of astronauts now at the forefront of space biology research, and a key part of the climate of commercial spaceflight and ambitious missions outside of LEO, now would seem the opportune time to kick-start discussions into appropriate policy design. ISSOP, with its international membership and links to NASA GeneLab and the ESA Space Omics Topical Team, is well positioned to help guide standardization of policy-making regarding astronaut or commercial crews’ omics data, particularly from a scientific perspective. ISSOP can work closely with groups such as the Global Alliance for Genomic Health (GA4GH) to merge expertise in spaceflight omics research and terrestrial omics policymaking, which could help to ensure that policies maximize scientific utility while protecting the rights of the astronauts and crews.Conclusions In the coming years, humans may venture into space for unprecedented durations and distances outside of the Earth’s radioprotective magnetosphere. Resupply and evacuation would be precluded in some cases, calling for a modernized spaceflight nutrition, wellness, and telehealth field that would likely incorporate molecular omics. Precision healthcare is becoming more commonplace for populations on Earth, where international consortiums are using high-resolution omics to construct the Human Cell Atlas. It seems probable that as increasingly large and diverse populations enter space, the purposeful implementation of routine standardized omics with consenting participants during spaceflight could similarly permit precision space healthcare and a Human Cell Space Atlas. The cell space atlas could serve as an open access, global reference for basic space life science research. While human space omics could catalyze critical improvement of safety measures for future space travelers, numerous ethical, cultural, and legal challenges would need to be carefully surmounted from global viewpoints. This manuscript provided examples of both the potential healthcare benefits and the ethical complexities that will likely be inherent to the human space omics discipline as a means to encourage anticipatory discussions amongst international ethicists, philosophers, scientists, and the public community.Acknowledgements The authors thank Jimin Guo (National Research Council Canada), S.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood.Methods To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4.Results Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression.Conclusion Our findings can guide future research on developing countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight-associated skin damage.Subject terms: Systems biology, Skin diseases",
    "introduction": "Introduction Throughout the course of a spaceflight mission, the astronaut exposome includes altered gravity, elevated radiation, and confinement within a closed environment with unique hygiene procedures, light cycles, and ventilation1. These stressors perturb biological systems, inducing gene regulatory changes, mitochondrial dysregulation, microbiome shifts, and DNA damage1. Dermatological issues are not typically regarded as a key risk to astronaut health and mission success, yet they are amongst the most common in-flight health issues reported by astronauts. During regular International Space Station (ISS) missions averaging 6-months, skin rashes have been identified as the most frequently reported in-flight clinical symptom, with 1.1 cases per flight year, accounting for 40% of all notable medical events and a 25-fold increase compared to the United States’ general population2. An additional 0.3 cases per flight year include skin manifestations accompanied by symptoms of infection; skin lesions associated with viral reactivation were also reported and have been studied in-flight2–4. Notably, an in-flight skin rash was reported to have occurred during a 6-month ISS mission, worsening immediately after extravehicular activity (EVA)5, and a post-flight skin rash was reported following the 1-year-long NASA Twins spaceflight study6. These events arouse particular concern for future Moon and Mars missions, which will be longer, include high-levels of EVA, and also include risk of exposure to irritant dust, reported previously to induce skin issues in Apollo astronauts7. Elucidating the biological response of skin in space could aid development of new countermeasures to manage dermatological issues and optimize astronaut performance during these future missions. As the human body’s largest organ, the skin plays a crucial role in numerous essential health functions. These include facilitating fluid diffusion, promoting wound healing, regulating body temperature, and enabling tactile sensation. Skin is also the first line of defense against chemicals, allergens, infectious agents, and - importantly for spaceflight - radiation. Studies of the astronaut skin microbiome have identified microbial interchange between the skin and the ISS interior8, and have also hypothesized that abnormal proliferation of certain types of opportunistic microorganisms on astronaut skin may stem from the unusual hygiene procedures on the ISS, where wipes are used as opposed to showering9,10. While these microbiome shifts and their associated health effects require further studies, investigations into the molecular response of skin tissue in space are lacking. In murine skin, the 13-day STS-135 study and the 91-day Mouse Drawer System (MDS) study reported significant spaceflight-induced modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes11,12; the set of genes did not overlap, which could be due to significant differences in study design (e.g. duration). The MDS study also reported a 42% increase in synthesized procollagen coupled with a 15% reduction in dermal thickness likely indicative of increased collagen turnover, and an increase in hair follicles growing in the anagen stage accompanied by dysregulation of hair follicle genes12. Corroborating gene regulatory changes associated with hair cycle were also reported in an analysis of hair follicle samples from 10 astronauts in a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) study13, yet reports of skin physiological changes in astronauts, including dermal atrophy, have been mixed14,15. In a recent analysis of astronaut skin punch biopsies taken before and after the 3-day commercial Inspiration4 (i4) mission16, gene expression changes within different layers of the skin were explored alongside microbiome changes, revealing signatures of increased inflammation and mitochondrial dysregulation across skin compartments, and gene regulatory changes associated with activation of DNA damage response (DDR) processes, T cell immunity, and increased barrier disruption in the outer epidermal layer of the skin17. In this study, we perform an analysis of five previously unreported murine skin RNA-Seq datasets from the JAXA Mouse Habitat Unit 2 (MHU-2)18, NASA Rodent Research 5 (RR-5) and 7 (RR-7) experiments, to identify global gene expression signatures in spaceflight-exposed skin and to investigate the effect of study design on biological signatures relating to skin health and common spaceflight themes including DNA damage and repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation1. In addition to examining gene regulatory patterns, we use an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) modeling approach to construct interpretable machine learning models to identify synergistic effects between pairs of genes, which we interpret as possible biological interactions, that reveal putative disequilibria of dependent processes. We then investigate gene regulatory changes observed in the rodent skin data in astronaut data, including JAXA hair follicle data13, skin data from the i4 mission, and blood gene expression data from the NASA Twins19, JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE), and i4 studies. We conclude by suggesting how these molecular signatures may eventually lead to follow-up studies and pharmaceutical interventions.",
    "methods": "Methods Ethics and inclusion statement This manuscript has included authors from all backgrounds from the scientific international community and the results are held at the highest ethical standards. All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs and according to the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. The Inspiration4 (I4) mission was performed at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after informed consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). All crewmembers consented to data and sample sharing. The NASA Twin Study subjects signed informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki and 14 CFR Part 1230 for collection and use of sample materials and data in research protocols at NASA and the collaborating institutions. Study protocols were approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Review Board (protocol number Pro1245) and all participating institutions. Also the data is hosted at the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Informed consent was provided by all participants in the NASA Twin Study. The JAXA astronaut data was obtained from NASA’s GeneLab Platform and this study used only published aggregated quantification values. No ethical approval for this manuscript was required to use the JAXA astronaut data since this was publicly available data on the GeneLab platform. In addition the data made available on GeneLab was only provided as anonymized aggregate data. GeneLab spaceflight murine datasets Five RNA-Seq datasets (OSD-238, OSD-239, OSD-240, OSD-241, OSD-254) were downloaded from the NASA OSDR via the API, and full dataset descriptions can be found on the dataset pages. These datasets are derived from whole murine skin samples from the MHU-2, RR-5, and RR-7 spaceflight experiments. For MHU-2, singly-housed male C57BL/6J mice were 9 weeks of age when flown on the ISS for 30 days; they were euthanized less than 1 day after return to Earth. Dorsal and femoral skin samples were extracted from MHU-2 mice, and 6 replicates in spaceflight microgravity and the matching 6 replicates in the 1G ground control were split into 2 sets of 3, with half fed a JAXA chow diet and the other half fed JAXA chow with supplemental FOS18. For RR-5, 30 week old BALB/c mice in shared housing were flown on the ISS for 30 days; following return to Earth, mice were given 30 days to recover before euthanasia and extraction of dorsal and femoral skin tissue. Finally, for RR-7, 11 week old C57BL/6J mice and C3H/HeJ mice were flown on the ISS for either 25 or 75 days before being euthanized on-orbit. RNA-Seq analysis of rodent datasets Raw counts data, derived via a previously reported pipeline20, were downloaded from the NASA OSDR and loaded with tximport (v1.28.0). ERCC genes were filtered out, as were genes with zero counts in the minimum number of samples corresponding to a single condition. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis using the Wald significance test was performed on spaceflight microgravity and ground control samples using the R package DESeq221 (v1.40.2). For each data subset, microgravity spaceflight samples were contrasted with ground control samples and cook’s cut off and independent filtering were not used. Mapping of mouse ENSEMBL gene IDs to gene symbols and human orthologs was done using the R Package biomaRt (v2.56.1) and ENSEMBL 105. For human orthologs, one-to-many mapping was supported. All heatmaps were generated using the R package ComplexHeatmap (v2.16.0). All DGE statistics for the rodent data, including the list of cross-mission genes, can be found in Supplementary Data 1. Pathway analysis of rodent datasets For Over Representation Analysis (ORA), the R package clusterProfiler (v4.8.3) was used on vectors of genes and bar plots were made via ggplot2 (v3.4.4). For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), the R package FGSEA (v1.26.0) was used. GSEA was performed on all DEGs for all data subsets, with rank vectors consisting of HGNC symbols and corresponding sorted t-scores in the data subset. MSigDB human collections H, C2, and C5 were used (v7.4) and set sizes >15 were permitted. For the mitochondrial pathway analysis, human pathways from MitoPathways (v3.0), with some additional custom curated pathways (Supplementary Table 1), were used and set sizes >1 were permitted. All heatmaps were generated using the R package ComplexHeatmap (v2.16.0). All GSEA results, including mitochondrial results, can be found in Supplementary Data 2. RNA-Seq data analysis on Twin Study samples Longitudinal samples were collected from a male astronaut aboard the ISS and his identical twin on Earth during a 340 day mission including 6 months preflight and 6 months postflight follow-up, for a total of 19 time points for the flight subject and 13 time points for the ground subject. Blood was collected using CPT vacutainers (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. For full details of sample separation and processing see ref. 19. Briefly, samples collected on ISS were either frozen in −80 °C after separation of mononuclear cells by centrifugation (referred to as CPT), or returned to Earth in 4 °C in a Soyuz capsule and sorted into CD4, CD8, CD19 populations and a lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction. Samples collected on Earth were either frozen for mononuclear cells or processed when fresh for sorted cell populations. To correct for the effects of ambient temperature exposure on RNA (approximately 36 h including landing and repatriation) control samples were created by simulating similar conditions to those that may occur during the ambient return and were compared to fresh blood collections from the same individual. RNA extraction, library prep and sequencing were completed per19 using both ribodepletion or polyA selection kits. As previously reported19, generated sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! (v0.4.1) and quantified to genes using kallisto22 on ENSEMBL transcripts. Differentially expressed genes were called using DESeq221 on each cell type separately by comparing preflight, inflight and postflight groups, controlling for the normal biological variance within the 24 months using the longitudinal data of the ground twin and using the simulated ambient control samples as another covariate for sorted cells20,23. Reads were mapped onto an updated reference genome (GRCh38)24. JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through the NASA OSDR with accession number: OSD-53025. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. In total 2-3 pre-flight samples (L-168 ± 14 days, L-112 ± 14 days, L-56 ± 14 days), 4 in-flight samples (L + 5 ± 1 day, L + 30 ± 7 days, L + 60 ± 14 days, L + 120 ± 14d or R-8 (−14d/+0d day)), and 3-4 post-flight samples (R + 3 ± 1 day, R + 30 ± 7 days, R + 60 ± 14 days, R + 120 ± 14 days) were collected per astronaut. As provided by OSDR, data points for all subjects were pooled into one group per mission phase. JAXA astronaut hair follicle data Gene expression data from 10 JAXA astronauts’ hair follicles13 was downloaded from the NASA OSDR (OSD-174). Raw data for 60 total samples was processed using LIMMA with R/bioconductor26. Briefly, duplicate sample single-color Agilent microarray data was background corrected, filtered for low expression probes, and quantile normalized. Differential gene expression was measured between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight data points using p-values adjusted for False Discovery Rates (FDR) with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. As previously described13 hair follicle samples were collected from each astronaut on 6-month ISS missions at two pre-flight time points (firstly between L-180 and L-90, and secondly between L-60 and L-14), two in-flight time points (firstly between L + 20 and L + 37, and secondly between R-20 and R-7), and two post-flight time points (firstly between R + 2 and R + 7, and secondly between R + 30 and R + 90). Inspiration4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) at 585 km above Earth. The mission launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on September 15th, 2021 and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral on September 18th, 2021. All biological data derived from the Inspiration4 mission were collected pre- and post-flight, and will be accessible via the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)27. For this study, only data from blood samples and skin biopsies were used. Pre-flight samples were collected at L-92, L-44, and L-3 days prior to launch to space. Upon return, post-flight samples were collected at R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 days. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference28. Reads were mapped onto a recent reference genome (GRCh38)24. We followed the analysis pipeline as previously reported [Ref. 29]. For skin spatial transcriptomics data, 4 mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before flight and as soon as possible after return (L-44 and R + 1). As previously described in detail17, these biopsies were flash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. Based on staining images using fluorescent antibodies, a total of 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) were profiled across outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. The IE and OE regions represented stratum basale, and stratum spinosum with stratum granulosum, respectively. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, and read quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform DGE analysis. Records of vitamin D supplement consumption were not available for the i4 crew. All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). Astronaut physiological data Data are reported from three human subject experiments conducted on the International Space Station: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006-2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013–2018). All protocols were reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent. These missions were 4–6 months in length, and these studies included blood and urine collections before, during, and after flight, with analysis of an array of nutritional and biochemical markers. Blood and urine samples were collected 2 or 3 times before flight: approximately Launch minus (L-) 180 days and L-45 days. In some cases, a third blood sample was collected (typically along with the L-45 collection), and these tubes were centrifuged and frozen for aliquoting after flight batched with the samples collected inflight. Blood samples were collected inflight, at approximately Flight Day (FD) 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180. Postflight samples were collected in the first 24-h after landing (designated return + 0, R + 0) and again 30-d later (R + 30). The R + 0 samples were not necessarily fasting, given the time of day and nature of return from flight. Of the 59 crewmembers reported herein: 8 returned on the Space Shuttle, with blood collection 2–4 h after landing; 51 landed in Kazakhstan, with 7 of them returning to Star City, Russia, with blood collection 8–10 h after landing; 44 were transported directly back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, with blood collection approximately 24-h after landing. Pre- and postflight collections included two 24-h urine collections, and inflight collections included one 24-h urine collection. These collection techniques have been previously described30. We report here vitamins and metabolites, oxidative stress and damage markers, inflammatory markers and cytokines, liver enzymes and endocrine indices. These were analyzed using standard techniques as previously reported31. As of this writing, data were available for 59 crewmembers (47 male, 12 female). Age at launch was 47.0 ± 5.6 y, body mass at launch was 79.2 ± 11.8 kg (M: 83.3 ± 9.3; F: 63.0 ± 4.5). Body mass index was 25.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2 (M: 26.4 ± 2.6; F: 22.3 ± 1.5). All available data are reported here, although the reported n for any given test or session varies for a number of reasons, including: not all experiments had all analytes included, mission length differences for some crewmembers, schedule or other issues occasionally precluded sample collection, and methods changes over time. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p < 0.001 are reported. The data was plotted using R package ggplot2 (v3.3.5). QLattice symbolic regression modeling We used symbolic regression (QLattice v3.0.132) to construct models involving combinations of synergistic genes which map from the gene expressions to spaceflight status. For these models, we only distinguish between mice that went to space and mice that did not. Conventional statistical methods typically allow for calculating the effect of a single gene at a time through metrics such as p-values and false discovery rates. In contrast, symbolic regression models can reveal combinations of genes and modules that best predict spaceflight status. These could be linear combinations involving two or more genes that have previously also been shown to be statistically significant, or it could be non-linear combinations that reveal features that on their own were non-significant but in synergy with a second feature become highly predictive. In addition, known biological functions of genes included in models, as well as the resultant mathematical relationship between them, can potentially be interpreted to reveal regulations or interactions that are affected by spaceflight. In biological pathway analysis, it is well-known that up- or down-regulation of one gene can have cascading effects, such that the function of one gene becomes sensitive to that of another33. It has previously been demonstrated that parsimonious machine learning models are able to provide accurate outcome prediction in omics data, while preserving interpretability34,35. The interpretability often results from the fact that models might demonstrate otherwise opaque relations, which become clear when combined effects are considered. An example could be an interaction where the regulation of a single gene is itself unimportant for functional changes, unless another gene is simultaneously regulated. This would indicate a synergistic compound effect, which naturally can expand to a 3-, 4- or 5-gene synergy and beyond. The combined effect of two or more individually insignificant gene expression levels may thus theoretically be more powerful than the effect of a single gene with low p-value. Thus, traditional statistical analysis masks such effects by the use of metrics related to the individual gene. UMAP dimensional reduction and gene clustering For the clustering of genes shown in Fig. 1b, we performed a uniqueness filtering by first dropping all genes where more than a quarter of the samples had identical expression levels. Subsequently, we filtered out all genes with a variance of less than 1.7, resulting in 2184 filtered genes with high variability. Fig. 1. Global data overview. Open in a new tab a Breakdown of the rodent datasets used in this study. b Clustering of the most variable genes within the rodent datasets with functional annotation.A dimensional reduction was performed subsequent to filtering by uniformly distributing the filtered data on a Riemannian manifold, using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP). UMAP is a general purpose manifold learning and dimension reduction algorithm which is similar to t-SNE in that it predominantly preserves local structure. Yet, UMAP preserves more global structure, which makes it a more suited algorithm when the objective of the dimensional reduction is more than simple visualization (in this case the objective is clustering). Genes were then clustered using the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)36. A primary advantage of HDBSCAN is that it is always deterministic for the same hyperparameters, and will thus always return the same clustering, all else being equal. In addition, comparable clustering algorithms such as k-means do not perform well unless clusters are of equal size and density with few outliers. With biological data such as gene expressions, we expect large variation in cluster size and density, making HDBSCAN the ideal choice. Once genes were clustered, the gene sets belonging to each cluster were extracted and analyzed using three ontology databases in the Python implementation, GSEAPY, of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis37 tool Enrichr38. We used the Elsevier Pathway Collection, the 2021 WikiPathway Collection, and the 2021 MGI Mammalian Phenotype Level 4 Collection. These enrichment analyses were used to provide context to each cluster by appending an annotation if a notable amount of hits showed up for a particular association. Regulatory network analysis We used the differential gene expression data from all cross-mission genes across each comparison to perform an upstream regulator analysis using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (version 01-22-0139). We identified the biological or chemical drugs in the QIAGEN IPA library of regulators, defined as having a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value < 0.05 and an absolute Z-score >1. Drugs from the dataset that met these criteria and were associated with similar log2 fold-change patterns in the QIAGEN Knowledge Base were visualized by hierarchical clustering of the unstandardized Z-scores using Euclidean distance as the similarity metric, and complete-linkage method for agglomeration. Statistics on the full list of drug targets can be found in Supplementary Data 3. Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.",
    "results": "Results Spaceflight transcriptome global changes in rodent skin reflect common biological hallmarks of spaceflight To explore whether transcriptomic changes in the skin would occur during spaceflight, we analyzed five RNA-Seq datasets from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)40, all representing skin tissue from space flown mice and matching ground control replicates. These datasets are derived from three different spaceflight missions (Fig. 1a). The most variable genes across the datasets cluster into functional groups related to established physiological risks of spaceflight (Fig. 1b). For example, spaceflight is known to induce immune dysfunction1 and Cluster 1 involves highly-correlated genes associated with immune response, including genes linked to modulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. Microgravity is also well established to cause degradation of muscle1, and Cluster 9 contains a significant number of genes related to muscular morphology and muscle disorders. Ionizing radiation is known to cause renal and pulmonary fibrosis41,42 and profibrosis-like alterations were previously observed in lung tissue of mice returned from Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-118)43. Renal and lung fibrosis associated genes found in Cluster 7, and genes encoding proteins involved in sclerotic diseases grouped in Cluster 8, further supports these reports. Upon subsetting each dataset based on experimental groups (i.e. diet, strain, skin site) and performing differential gene expression (DGE) analysis for spaceflight samples versus ground control samples, we end up with 10 data subsets (Fig. 2a). In total 476 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are significant (False Discovery Rate (FDR) ≤ 0.1) in at least 2 out of the 10 data subsets. One significant DEG shared across data subsets from the RR-7 study is GLYCAM1 which is shared between both data subsets for the C57BL/6 J strain. GLYCAM1, a ligand for L-selectin that has been proposed to modulate leukocyte transendothelial migration from blood44, is strongly upregulated (Log2 Fold Change (LFC) ≈ 18.81, FDR < 10−6) at the 25 day time point and strongly downregulated (LFC ≈ −15.66, FDR < 0.002) at the 75 day time point, which could indicate a relationship between spaceflight duration and immune alterations for the C57BL/6J mice. Over representation analysis (ORA) reveals that a large proportion of the 244 significant DEGs shared between MHU-2 data subsets are associated with the organization of collagen and the ECM (Fig. 2b). Significant modulation of genes associated with ECM homeostasis was previously reported in analyses of the skin of space flown mice11,12. The MHU-2 subset from the dorsal skin of mice fed a standard JAXA chow diet with supplemental prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) contains the highest quantity of significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) DEGs by a substantial margin (Fig. 2a). In ground-based rodent studies, FOS has been shown to improve gut microbiome balance, increase bone density, and affect the immune system through increased short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production (modifying interleukin production and natural killer cell activity), and modification of the immune system via gut-associated lymphoid tissue18,45. Due to the disparity between the number of significant DEGs in the data subsets, and the variety of conditions between data subsets, care must be taken when combining these data subsets to infer shared responses of rodent skin to spaceflight. Fig. 2. Differentially expressed genes shared between datasets. Open in a new tab a An upset plot showing the number of significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight versus ground data subsets and the number of overlapping significant DEGs between these data subsets. The colored annotation bar on the left of the plot shows how the original datasets divide into 10 data subsets based on all unique conditions including diet, biological sex and strain. The bar plot on the right of the upset plot shows the number of significant DEGs in each of the 10 data subsets. The bar plot on the top shows the number of intersecting DEGs between combinations of the data subsets, as indicated by the connected dots within the body of the upset plot. Black connecting lines indicate combinations spanning across multiple missions, and other connecting lines are colored according to the annotation bar, based on their shared mission. b A bar plot of significant Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) pathways from significant DEGs shared by any subsets within the MHU-2 mission (i.e., DEGs from the blue bars in panel a). Genes significantly altered in rodent skin spaceflight response across multiple missions are associated with cell cycle processes To address the previously mentioned bias in the MHU-2 dorsal skin data subset with a FOS-supplemented diet, and to delineate the common response of murine skin to spaceflight across multiple datasets, a list of 189 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) is generated exhibiting significance (False Discovery Rate ≤0.1) in data subsets from at least two distinct missions. For the majority of the significant DEGs, there is a trend of downregulation in the MHU-2 dorsal skin dataset with the FOS-supplemented diet, and in the RR-7 mission C57BL/6J mice after 75 days of flight (Supplementary Fig. 1). A smaller cluster of genes (e.g., LAMA1, S1PR1, HMGCS2, TXNIP, IGFBP3, ADGRF5, CAR4, HSD17B11, C1QTNF9, KLF11) are also significant in those same data subsets, but are significantly upregulated (Fig. 3a).

Open in a new tab a A heatmap showing regulatory changes of select cross-mission genes (genes that are significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) differentially expressed between flight and ground control across multiple missions) within each rodent data subset. b A bar plot showing the GOBP pathways that the full list of cross-mission genes are involved in. c A decision boundary plot of the strongest cross-mission QLattice model using only the expression of two genes as input features to predict the spaceflight status of the all mice in the data. d A decision boundary plot of the second-strongest model across all missions.To go beyond single-gene significance, we use QLattice modeling32 to construct models that predict the spaceflight status of all samples in the data (i.e. from all data subsets). These models use the expression of two genes at most to arrive at maximally relevant and minimally redundant models. In Fig. 3c, d, we show the decision boundaries of the two strongest models found, with Area Under Curve (AUC) scores of 0.86 and 0.85, respectively. Both models show that the spaceflight status is well separated using only the expression of two genes as input, while also having plausible biological interpretations, which we discuss in the following sections. The 189 cross-mission DEGs are primarily involved in cell-cycle pathways (Fig. 3b), with several of the genes (e.g. LAMA1, C1QTNF9, HMGCS2, TXNIP, KLF11) clustering with average trends of upregulation across the datasets (Fig. 3a). Spaceflight is well-documented to perturb the cell-cycle1. These genes tend also to be involved in metabolic pathways, particularly those associated with diabetes; HMGCS2 has been shown to regulate mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation46, while LAMA1 and KLF11 variations have been shown to be risk factors in type 2 diabetes47,48. Aside from being a protector against oxidative stress, TXNIP is similarly implicated in metabolic diseases, and is typically upregulated in diabetic and prediabetic muscle tissue49. C1QTNF9 (also known as CTRP9) has also emerged as a potentially important component of pathways involving lipid metabolism and adipose tissue, exemplified by the fact that C1QTNF9 transgenic mice have been shown to resist weight gain and metabolic dysfunction50. It is interesting to note that upregulation of these metabolic pathway genes appears generally weaker for female mice. This might be linked to the same mechanisms offering higher protection for females against diet-induced obesity compared to male mice, as has been noted in other studies51. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) axis have been implicated in pathogenesis of both inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases and also plays a role in skin’s immune response to viral infection52. In both MHU-2 and RR-7 missions S1PR1 is enriched, while this effect is reversed in RR-5 after 30-day recovery (Fig. 3a). On the contrary FLG (Filaggrin), CASP14, KRT2, genes involved in cornified envelope and skin barrier formation36–38,53–55, generally showed an opposite trend in gene expression patterns (Fig. 3a). CASP14 is also the main driver of the second-most predictive 2-gene QLattice model obtained from the cross-mission key gene list, which involved a combined model of CASP14 and S1PR1 (Fig. 3d). OXTR, identified as a key driver in the most predictive 2-gene QLattice model derived from the cross-mission key gene list, along with SLC6A18 (Fig. 3c), is predominantly localized in the basal layer of the epidermis. Its primary expression is attributed to keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts56. OXTR together with oxytocin has been shown to mediate oxidative stress response in the skin56. Our analysis revealed an increase in gene expression of OXTR across all missions and experimental conditions except for C3H/Hej mice in the RR-7 mission at the 25-day time point (Fig. 3a). Both estrogens and androgens play an important role in skin and hair physiology. HSD17B11, which has a stronger expression in steroidogenic cells such as sebaceous glands, has been predicted to be involved in androgen metabolism during steroidogenesis, and conversion 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol to androsterone57. Similar to the pattern observed in OXTR, HSD17B11 expression was increased in all murine datasets except for RR-5 dorsal skin group (Fig. 3a). Astronaut data correlates with select gene expression changes occurring across missions in the murine skin models Having investigated a set of cross-mission genes regulated by spaceflight in rodent skin, we then decided to investigate the expression of human orthologs of these genes in astronaut studies. Firstly, we use post-flight vs pre-flight gene expression data from skin samples collected during the i4 mission. Similar to the patterns observed in murine models (Fig. 3a), FLG and CASP14, which play significant roles in skin barrier formation, are also downregulated in the epidermis of i4 astronauts (Fig. 4a), where they are primarily expressed. In the literature, FLG is reported to mainly be expressed in stratum granulosum58, with mutations associated with dry skin, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis as well as ichthyosis vulgaris54,59,60. CASP14 on the other hand is known to be primarily expressed in differentiating and cornifying layers44 and decreased levels were detected in lesional skin biopsies of patients with atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis61,62. Likewise, KRT2 which was downregulated across all subgroups in the MHU-2 and RR-7 missions (Fig. 3a), was also downregulated in the skin of i4 astronauts, with strongest downregulation in outer epidermis where it is primarily expressed but also in inner epidermis and outer dermis (Fig. 4a). Additionally, similarly to the trend of upregulation in the rodent data (Fig. 3a), OXTR is upregulated across all compartments studied in the i4 skin (Fig. 4a) and HSD17B11 is upregulated in both compartments of the epidermis and in the outer dermis (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. The profile of the cross-mission genes in astronauts. Open in a new tab a Heatmap showing log2 fold-change in orthologs of the rodent skin cross-mission genes in astronaut skin data from the Inspiration4 mission, for different skin layers. b Heatmap showing t-score in orthologs of the rodent skin cross-mission genes in hair follicle samples at different time points from the JAXA HAIR astronaut study.In some astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight, decrease in melanin content has been previously reported63. In the inner epidermis of the i4 skin data, where melanin synthesis takes place, we found downregulation of two genes associated with melanin biosynthesis, TYRP1 and DCT64 (Fig. 4a). However, TYR which synthesizes tyrosinase, the rate limiting enzyme of melanin synthesis was upregulated in the same compartment65 (Fig. 4a). TYR, DCT, and TYRP1 clustered in the rodent data, with an average trend of downregulation, particularly in the MHU-2 dorsal skin dataset with the FOS-supplemented diet, and in the RR-7 mission C57BL/6J mice after 75 days of flight (Fig. 3a). We also analyze gene expression data from the blood of astronauts from the NASA Twins, JAXA CFE studies, and i4 studies (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the NASA Twins Study, the most noteworthy results are in CD4 cell type in-flight vs pre-flight samples with significant downregulation in a group of genes (e.g. DSC2, TMEM252, CEBPD, CA4, and PTGS2, and OTX1) persisting post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 2a). These genes display no significant changes in CD8 cells, which may indicate that their downregulation is a response to immune system stressors affecting the helper function and signaling of CD4 cells. DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), STIL and TOP2A cell-cycle associated genes are amongst the most strongly upregulated genes in-flight compared to pre-flight in the CD8 cells, and exhibit downregulation post-flight to trend towards pre-flight levels (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In the CFE study, several genes were strongly upregulated in-flight and then downregulated post-flight (e.g., OXTR, PRR9, ERCC6L) in the blood samples from JAXA astronauts (Supplementary Fig. 2b). In the i4 mission blood samples the majority of genes show a pronounced suppression in the time point immediately before flight, which could be indicative of increased stress prior to launch. Several genes then show strong upregulation at the first post-flight time point (e.g., BARD1, BRCA1, RAD54B, EXO1, OXTR, and HSD17B11) (Supplementary Fig. 2c), suggesting upregulation due to spaceflight or landing stressors, followed by post-flight recovery towards baseline expression levels from second post-flight time point and beyond. However, some other genes appear to show a delayed upregulation following spaceflight, as they are upregulated in the second post-flight time point, two months after flight (e.g. KLF11, CA4, OXT1, TM4SF4) and return towards baseline at the third post-flight time point (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The gene expression alterations in these sets of genes are potentially due to a re-adaptation response. Specific pathways and genes related to skin health are altered in spaceflight To determine direct relevance of spaceflight to skin health, we conduct targeted analysis with a curated list of key pathways involved in skin health from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and identify which of these pathways and associated genes are significantly modulated in the murine skin datasets. A collagen biosynthesis pathway and a set of collagen genes (e.g., COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, and COL5A1) were significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) suppressed/downregulated across all dataset subsets for the MHU-2 mission, while showing a trend of weak enrichment/upregulation across the two other missions (Fig. 5a). Additionally, several collagen and/or ECM related genes (e.g., MMP3, COL5A2, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL15A1, COL6A3, SPARC, PCOLCE, and PYCR1) were significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) downregulated in all of the MHU-2 data subsets except femoral skin with the standard diet, and a few collagen related genes were significantly downregulated only in the dorsal subsets from the MHU-2 mission (e.g., P3H1, CRTAP, COL14A1, and FKBP14) (Fig. 5a). Overall, the distinct collagen/ECM downregulation signature (Fig. 5a) suggests that a study design difference in the MHU-2 mission (compared to the RR-5 and RR-7 missions), where the use of young single-housed male mice or dissection shortly after the hypergravity event of Live Animal Return (LAR) may have suppressed collagen biosynthesis. Similarly, we find an overall trend of enrichment of pathways relating to thin skin and dermal atrophy in the RR-5 and RR-7 mice, with suppression occurring in the MHU-2 mice (Fig. 5a), likely driven by regulatory patterns in the collagen-associated genes. While there is a general trend of upregulation, the RR-5 mission generally lacks any significant results for genes relating to skin health, which could be due to the 30 days of recovery post-flight. In addition to being reported as cross-mission genes in the previous section, CASP14, FLG and KRT2 were also identified as key skin health genes (Fig. 5). Fig. 5. Behavior of the specific genes associated with skin health in astronauts and rodents. Open in a new tab a The orange (suppressed) and green (enriched) heatmap shows the normalized enrichment score (NES) of curated skin health pathways (full list Supplementary Table 1) that are significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) in at least one rodent subset. The red (upregulated) and blue (downregulated) heatmap shows the t-score for leading edge genes from the significant pathways that are significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) in at least two data subsets. b Heatmap showing log2 fold-change in orthologs of the genes from Panel a in astronaut skin data from the Inspiration4 mission, for different skin layers. c Heatmap showing t-score in orthologs of the genes from Panel a in hair follicle samples at different time points from the JAXA HAIR astronaut study.In post-flight vs pre-flight skin samples from the i4 mission, several collagen/ECM genes (e.g., SPARC, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) were downregulated across the whole dermis, whereas COL5A1 was only downregulated in the vascular compartment of the dermis (Fig. 5b). MMP3, which induces accelerated loss of skin collagen when there is inflammation, was upregulated across the whole dermal layer65 (Fig. 5b). Likewise, several genes (e.g., P3H1, COL14A1, COL15A1, and COLA12A1) were upregulated in both compartments of the dermis (Fig. 5b). KRT24, involved in terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, is reported to be mainly confined to stratum spinosum with slight overexpression in senescent keratinocytes49 and has been shown to induce apoptosis of keratinocytes66. In the post-flight vs pre-flight i4 skin data KRT24 is upregulated in all compartments of the skin with a more prominent increase in outer epidermis and vascular layers66 (Fig. 5b). Late cornified envelope genes (LCE) are located in the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1 and in the skin their expression is known to be mainly confined to the epidermis, specifically to upper stratum granulosum and premature cornified envelopes67,68. In both the inner epidermis and outer dermis of the i4 skin data, LCE2A, LCE2B, LCE2C, LCE2D, genes that respond to UV and calcium67 and LCE5A were upregulated post-flight vs pre-flight (Fig. 5b). In the NASA Twins study blood samples, COL6A2 was upregulated in-flight and then downregulated post-flight in CD8 cells, with PYCR1 following the same pattern in CD4 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In the CFE study, blood samples from JAXA astronauts had strong in-flight upregulation of RPTN and COL3A1, and in particular LCE2B, where upregulation increased further post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 3b). On the other hand, PYCR1 and GJB6 showed the opposite trend in gene expression, with strong downregulation in-flight and almost complete reversal upon return (Supplementary Fig. 3b). PYCR1, which was upregulated post-flight vs pre-flight in all skin layers of i4 astronauts (Fig. 5b) encodes pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1, an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in proline synthesis via utilization of NADH or NADPH. Proline plays an important role in collagen synthesis and PYCR1 deficiency results in collagen and elastin abnormalities69. Conversely, COL3A1 encodes alpha 1 chain of type III collagen, which is an EMP synthesized in cells as pre-collagen and its accumulation was shown to cause fibrosis in various organs70,71. In case of LCE2C and KRT33A, weak in-flight downregulation was followed by strong post-flight upregulation (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Although less apparent, this trend for KRT33A was also observed in the JAXA HAIR data (Fig. 5c). KRT33A, one of the type 1 hair keratin genes, is known to be highly expressed in the cortex of hair follicles, and its expression is reported to decrease with age72. Lastly, genes such as COL6A2 and FKBP14, a collagen/ECM related gene associated with diseases such as kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that is characterized by joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, hearing impairment, muscle hypotonia and occasional vascular fragility like aortic rupture73, were downregulated in-flight and their average expression persisted post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Radiosensitivity of mouse strains impacts DNA damage response in the skin following spaceflight As part of our targeted analysis, we also opted to investigate the modulation of DNA damage and repair pathways in rodent skin. DNA damage and repair is a well-established response to space radiation19,74 and little research is reported on the consequences this will have on the skin during spaceflight. When ionizing radiation hits DNA molecules, single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, with DDR mechanisms activated to repair these breaks74. For the majority of DNA damage and repair pathways, both the dorsal and femoral skin RR-5 mission data subsets and the 25-day time point from the C3H/HeJ mice in the RR-7 mission show an opposing pattern compared to the other data subsets (Fig. 6). In these three data subsets, pathways relating to DNA damage and repair are generally enriched, while being suppressed in other data subsets. BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice, as used in these data subsets, have been shown to be more radiosensitive compared to C57BL/6J mice75–77, so repair mechanisms may be activated to mitigate increased radiation-induced DNA damage. In the C3H/HeJ mice there is a trend of decreasing activity for the DDR pathways from the 25-day to 75-day time points which could indicate either adaptation of the DNA repair pathways over time in space or dysregulation following extended-duration spaceflight (Fig. 6). The enrichment of DDR pathways in RR-5 also follows 30-days of spaceflight and a post-flight recovery period of 30-days (Fig. 6). However, DNA repair genes were reported to still be enriched compared to pre-flight levels when evaluated at 6-months post-flight during the NASA Twins study19, so persistent DDR activation during post-flight recovery in the mice could be indicative of a similar mechanism. Fig. 6. DNA damage and repair pathways being regulated in rodents flown to space. Open in a new tab Heatmap of pathways relating to DNA damage response and repair mechanisms (full list Supplementary Table 1), significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) in at least one data subset. Mitochondrial dysregulation increased in the skin during spaceflight Mitochondrial stress has been identified as a key hub for spaceflight response in multi-tissue analysis, yet skin was not included78. Skin is a tissue with high turnover and energy requirements79, so we decided to investigate spaceflight changes relating to mitochondrial stress in murine skin. We find that spaceflight alters mitochondrial pathways in the skin (Fig. 7a), as previously observed in other tissues and across species78. Enrichment of an integrated stress response (ISR) pathway in all but two of the dataset subsets (Fig. 7a) is consistent with a previous report of potentially activated ISR due to mitochondrial dysfunction in space flown mice78. Interestingly, the two data subsets where ISR appeared to instead be suppressed were the 25 day time points for both strains from the RR-7 mission (Fig. 7a), implicating spaceflight duration as an important factor for modulating ISR. Additionally, we ran the QLattice machine learning model on the full gene set to obtain a set of models that were unbiased by feature selection due to e.g. variance filtering and the selection of cross-mission genes. One of the 10 strongest 2-feature models involved the expression of the genes D2HGDH (D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase)80 and RPLP0-PS1 (a gene coding for the ribosomal protein RPLP0). The model’s decision boundary (Fig. 7b) demonstrates how the simultaneous upregulation of D2HGDH and downregulation of RPLP0-PS1 characterizes the space-flown mice, with a resulting AUC score of 0.8280. The upregulation of D2HGDH generally indicates an increased ability to break down the toxic D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2H) compound in the mitochondria. In our case, this could be a compensatory mechanism due to larger build-up of the compound, and the model suggests that this is further dependent on the abundance of the RPLP0 protein. Fig. 7. Mitochondrial specific analysis on rodent spaceflight skin tissue. Open in a new tab a Heatmap of pathways relating to the mitochondria, significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) in at least 1 data subset. b Decision boundary for the 2-gene model related to mitochondrial changes. The model indicates an increased removal of the toxic D2H compound in mitochondria through upregulation of D2HGDH, which is less pronounced when PPP1R3B expression is suppressed. Circulating physiological markers from astronauts indicate that exercise countermeasures may have improved skin health We investigate standard physiological biomarkers collected from astronaut urine and blood81,82 to see whether average trends in these biomarkers connect to spaceflight gene regulatory changes occurring in the skin (Fig. 8). In-flight increases in IGF-1, leptin and white blood cell levels may indicate altered stress response due to spaceflight. Following a hypothesis that improved countermeasures may improve skin physiological parameters in astronauts on the ISS14,15, we split the data into astronauts that used the older Interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED), and astronauts that used the newer Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). Notably, overlapping data to that shown in Fig. 8 have been used as evidence of improvements in parameters relating to bone mineral density81. Indeed, while vitamin D decreased in-flight and normalized upon return to Earth for both exercise devices, ARED appeared to reduce this drop. Vitamin D is well-established to be an important mediator of skin health83. Notably, this decrease in vitamin D is observed despite consistent programmatic vitamin D supplementation since the collection of blood samples81. Fig. 8.

Spaceflight-induced gene regulatory changes in the skin correlate with relevant drug responses Having established a list of genes that changed in the rodent skin across multiple missions, we then investigate potential drug targets and mechanisms for these genes via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Fig. 9). As with the DDR pathways (Fig. 6), both the dorsal and femoral skin RR-5 mission data subsets and the 25-day time point from the C3H/HeJ mice in the RR-7 mission show an opposing pattern compared to the other data subsets for the predicted upstream regulators (Fig. 9). Fig. 9. Predicted drug signatures associated with spaceflight response in the skin. Open in a new tab Predicted drug signatures using the cross-mission genes across each dataset represented by a hierarchically clustered heat map. A positive (red) activation state implies cross-mission gene expression changes are consistent with expression changes observed with the indicated drug from curated causal gene expression relationship studies. A negative (blue) activation state implies the cross-mission gene expression changes are opposite to changes observed with the indicated drug.Several drugs were predicted to exhibit significant positive correlation with gene expression changes seen in the space flown mice, with the exception of dorsal skin tissues obtained from C3H/HeJ mice that spent 25 days in flight for the RR-7 mission, and dorsal and femoral skin from the RR-5 mice (30-day recovery) (Fig. 9). For example, calcitriol is the active form of Vitamin D, and has been observed to affect skin barrier formation and epidermal differentiation84 it is used clinically to treat plaque psoriasis85. Calcitriol is also associated with immune system alterations in the skin, and topical application in mice has been shown to exacerbate atopic dermatitis86. On the other hand, in a murine model, epidermal permeability and antimicrobial skin barrier impaired by corticosteroid, was shown to be reduced via calcitriol87. Alteration of gene regulatory patterns associated with calcitriol, in the mouse data subsets (Fig. 9) could indicate activation of compensatory mechanisms for spaceflight-induced skin barrier dysfunction, epidermal differentiation, and immune system alterations. L-asparaginase showed the strongest correlation with gene regulatory changes in these spaceflight-exposed mice (Fig. 9). L-asparaginase is used in treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma and exerts its action by depriving leukemic cells of circulating asparagine, resulting in DNA breaks, cell cycle arrest and cell death87,88. It is also an immunogenic protein and leads to skin rash, dry skin, and hypersensitivity reactions89. Similarly, there was strong positive correlation between gene regulatory changes in these spaceflight-exposed mice associated with use of the Vitamin A derivative tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid)90, and two selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen91–94. On the contrary, estrogen and diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic form of estrogen, showed a reversed pattern compared to the aforementioned drug targets (Fig. 9). These drugs showed positive correlation with the expression changes in the RR-5 datasets, and the RR-7 25-day C3H/Hej data subset, and negative correlation in the other data subsets (Fig. 9).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Skin is well-established as an essential organ for health on Earth, yet despite the frequency of dermatological issues in astronauts2, the molecular response of skin to spaceflight is understudied. Here, we have performed a comprehensive study on the molecular impact of spaceflight on skin, with the aim of addressing gaps in the understanding of spaceflight associated skin health risks. Our analysis indicated intriguing gene regulatory changes occurring in the skin of spaceflight vs ground control mice during the MHU-2, RR-5, and RR-7 spaceflight experiments, that also show some overlaps with molecular alterations observed in astronauts. The genes exhibiting the highest variability across the datasets formed clusters associated with well-established physiological risks of spaceflight, notably immune dysfunction and muscle degradation (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the majority of genes showing significant differential expression across multiple missions in murine data were linked to cell cycle processes, particularly chromosome segregation (Fig. 3a, b). This suggests that skin mirrors common spaceflight signatures observed in other tissues, including dysregulation of cell cycle processes1,19. Further to that point, we see an enrichment of DDR pathways in some data subsets from radiosensitive BALB/c and C3H/HeJ strains75–77 (Fig. 6), which is also a well-established spaceflight response19,74. These repair mechanisms may be activated to mitigate radiation-induced DNA damage and appear to remain active during the post-flight recovery process, as seen in the RR-5 mission where samples were collected 30 days after flight. This finding is consistent with reports of sustained post-flight DDR activation from the NASA Twins study19. Notably, DNA damage in the skin has important implications for skin cancers including melanoma, of which astronauts carry a higher risk, although the direct correlation between spaceflight and melanoma is still under investigation95,96. Similarly, mitochondrial dysregulation is established as a key molecular signature of spaceflight78, and we see enrichment of an ISR pathway in all but two of the murine skin data subsets (Fig. 7a), which may be driven by increased oxidative stress or DNA damage. ISR activation appears to be impacted by spaceflight duration, as the 25 day time points for RR-7 show a suppression of the ISR pathway1,78. Using an explainable machine learning approach32, we also observed the counteractive mechanism played by D2HGDH, which was generally upregulated in space flown mice (Fig. 7b) indicating an increased need for breakdown of toxic D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2H) molecules in mitochondria. In this model, the partner gene RPLP0-PS1 codes for the ribosomal protein RPLP0 and is down-regulated in space flown mice. RPLP0 has previously been implicated in the top significant network for the mitochondria-mediated cycle of Alzheimer’s disease97. Low or absent levels of RPLP0 seem to limit the compensatory mechanism in the model (Fig. 7b). If this occurs, build-up of D2H and suppression of certain enzyme functions can result, causing DNA and histones to enter hypermethylated states and activate oncogenes and inhibit tumor suppressors98. Build-up of D2H in the mitochondria may thus be related to cell changes induced by DNA damage from space radiation. Notably, gene regulatory changes associated with mitochondrial dysregulation and DDR were also reported in the skin data from the i4 mission17, corroborating these changes as key molecular hallmarks of spaceflight in the skin. The downregulation of collagen/ECM genes and the suppression of collagen/ECM-related pathways in the MHU-2 mouse mission, where spaceflight samples were collected shortly after landing (Figs. 2b and 5a), mirror findings from previous studies where a reduction in collagen synthesis occurred under hypergravity conditions in cultured human fibroblasts99. In contrast, RR-7 mice (frozen in space) generally exhibited an upregulation of the same collagen/ECM genes (Fig. 5a), consistent with results from the aforementioned human fibroblast study, which reported a 143% increase in collagen synthesis during microgravity99. Similar to RR-7, RR-5 also showed a trend of upregulation in collagen/ECM genes (Fig. 5a). The opposing patterns between the MHU-2 mission and RR-5/RR-7 may arise from diverse factors owing to experimental design differences. Notably, the timing of sample collection introduces a critical variable, as seen in the MHU-2 mission where samples were collected less than one day post-flight, in contrast to RR-5, where collection occurred after a 30-day post-flight recovery, and RR-7, where samples were obtained directly in space. This temporal distinction implies that collagen suppression observed in MHU-2 mice may be influenced, at least in part, by the acute hypergravity response, a known factor in decreasing collagen synthesis99, and the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids100–102, rather than being solely attributed to the spaceflight environment. Moreover, differences in sex and housing arrangements further complicate the comparison; MHU-2 mice are singly-housed males, while RR-5 and RR-7 mice are multi-housed females, introducing additional variables that may contribute to the observed disparities100–103. Skin has an anatomically heterogeneous gene expression profile104. For instance, fibroblasts exhibit distinct gene expression patterns based on their positional identity in relation to the major anatomical axis105. This phenomenon in part explains the predisposition of different sites to different skin conditions104. Although several genes related to collagen synthesis and ECM were downregulated across all four MHU-2 experimental groups, some of these genes showed statistical significance in the dorsal group but not in the femoral group (Fig. 5a). Likewise in the RR-5 mission, during terrestrial recovery, skin biopsies obtained from dorsal skin generally showed a higher reversal of gene expression pattern compared to those obtained from the femoral skin (Figs. 3a and 5a). These changes may be indicative of the variations in gene expression profile, their adaptation response to space flight and re-adaptation to terrestrial environment, at different anatomical sites. Skin biopsies collected from i4 astronauts one day post-flight exhibited a marked downregulation of various collagen/ECM-associated genes in the dermal layer compared to pre-flight conditions (e.g., SPARC, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL6A1) (Fig. 5b). However, certain genes, such as SPARC and COL3A1, showed an upregulation in one or both compartments of the epidermis (Fig. 5b). Moreover, several other collagen/ECM associated genes (e.g. COL14A1, COL15A1, MMP3) were upregulated in both epidermis and the dermis (Fig. 5b). As with the MHU-2 mice, the i4 astronauts’ skin biopsies were obtained one-day post-flight, so some of these effects may have been induced by hypergravity. Nevertheless, blood data obtained from the same i4 astronauts at 1-, 45-, and 82-days post-flight suggests that most gene alterations observed upon landing revert back to normal levels within 82 days following flight, so we may expect a similar response in the skin tissue (Supplementary Figs. 2c and 3c). Previously reported findings from the NASA Twins showed in-flight activation of collagen formation pathways and an increase in COL1A1 and COL3A1 proteins detected in the urine, indicative of structural remodeling19. These changes, as with the majority of spaceflight-induced changes, were also reported to revert to baseline post-flight19. Some of the changes reported by astronauts during and after spaceflight, such as dryness and contact dermatitis, point to an impaired barrier function17,95 our results support this hypothesis. FLG is a gene expressed in the stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis, during the epidermal differentiation process41. It encodes profilaggrin, a major component of keratohyalin granules found in the keratinocytes that is dephosphorylated and cleaved into filaggrin106,107. During conversion of keratinocyte cell membrane to cornified cell envelope, filaggrin aggregates and aligns intermediate filaments such as keratin 1 and keratin 10, within the cytoskeleton of keratinocytes, and subsequently a cross-linking process is initiated by proteins such as involucrin and locicrin108,109. This results in compactization and flattening of the corneocytes, one of the constituents of the skin barrier110. We identified FLG as one of the cross-mission genes in the spaceflight vs ground control mice data with downregulation across the majority of data subsets (all except RR-5 dorsal skin) (Fig. 3a). Additionally, we observed post-flight vs pre-flight downregulation of FLG in the epidermis of i4 astronauts (Fig. 5b). Caspase-14, an enzyme encoded by the CASP14 gene, cleaves filaggrin, breaking it down into free amino acids. These amino acids serve as integral components of natural moisturizing factors, contributing to the preservation of skin hydration and pH111. Additionally, they play a crucial role in antimicrobial defense, further contributing to the multifaceted functions of the skin barrier61,112,113. Similar to FLG, CASP14 demonstrated downregulation in the majority of murine skin subsets (excluding RR-5 dorsal skin) (Fig. 3a), the epidermal layer of i4 astronaut skin tissue (Fig. 5b), and JAXA hair follicles (Fig. 5c). This observation is important considering the crucial role CASP14 plays in skin barrier formation and its involvement in skin conditions such as contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis53,61,62,114. The link between filaggrin deficiency and dry skin, altered pH, atopic and contact dermatitis, and ichthyosis vulgaris is also well-known54,60,112,115–117. CASP14 was also the driver of one of the two main QLattice models we found to be maximally relevant and minimally redundant among the cross-mission genes, resulting in a very simple model involving only CASP14 and S1PR1 with an AUC of 0.85 (Fig. 3d). S1PR1 was upregulated in most murine skin subsets (Fig. 3a), the in-flight vs pre-flight samples from the JAXA hair follicle study (Fig. 4b), and in all compartments for the post-flight vs pre-flight i4 astronauts’ skin samples (Fig. 4a). In the RR-5 mission, after a 30-day recovery, in-flight effects may have been reversed as S1PR1 expression was downregulated (Fig. 3a), which is also consistent with downregulation in the post-flight vs pre-flight samples from the JAXA hair follicle study (Fig. 4b). Downregulation of S1PR1 has been reported to be necessary for activation of resident memory CD8 + T cells in skin35 and has previously been observed in CD8 + T cells from murine skin during response to Herpes Simplex Virus Infection118. While the S1P-S1PR axis has inhibitory roles in keratinocyte proliferation, it was also shown to contribute to the process of chemotaxis119. For instance, in Staphylococcus-aureus-stimulated keratinocytes; TNF alpha, IL-8 and IL-36γ release was induced via involvement of S1PR1 and S1PR2120. Higher expression levels of S1PR1 and S1PR2 observed in the skin of impetigo patients and changes in the distribution patterns of these receptors were also aligned with these findings120. Herpes Simplex Virus reactivation3,4,95 and Staphylococcus colonization in the skin10,17,121 (which could also be influenced by breakdown of filaggrin altering pH levels122) have been widely reported in astronauts, therefore alterations in S1PR1, CASP14, and FLG, are of importance. At present, there is a lack of widely accepted countermeasures to effectively mitigate the damage caused to the skin induced by exposure to the space environment. Our analysis has identified drugs capable of altering similar molecular changes that manifest in the skin during spaceflight (Fig. 9). Several drugs, including calcitriol, tretinoin, and tamoxifen showed significant positive correlation with regulatory changes in all data subsets from the MHU-2 and RR-7 missions except for the C3H/HeJ mice samples collected at the 25-day time point (Fig. 9). Tretinoin, a vitamin A derivative is a retinoid known for its applications in treating acne and leukemia, exerts its effects through the activation of retinoic acid receptors, influencing various skin processes such as increased proliferation and inhibited differentiation of epidermal cells, increased keratinocyte turnover, increased collagen synthesis, inhibited UV radiation induced metalloproteinase activity, and melanin reduction23,123,124. Tretinoin treatment on reconstructed human epidermis was shown to induce loss of keratohyalin granules and reduce filaggrin and Keratin 10 expression125. Retinoids have also been observed to downregulate caspase-14 expression in in-vitro reconstructed skin models126. Dry skin and exfoliation are common side effects during its use123. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been shown to exhibit both agoniztic and antagonistic effects depending on the tissue94. Its use in breast cancer patients is linked to cutaneous adverse events, including dry skin, itching, and occasionally radiation recall dermatitis and baboon syndrome (a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction)126–129. Furthermore, tamoxifen induces androgen receptor expression in hair follicles, leading to tamoxifen-induced alopecia in some cases130, and abnormal hair follicles, epidermal atrophy and dermal fibrosis have been observed in rat models131. On the other hand, only olaparib, estrogen, and diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic form of estrogen) showed an opposing pattern, with significant negative correlation in all data subsets except for those from the RR-5 mission and the C3H/HeJ mice samples collected at the 25-day time point of the RR-7 mission (Fig. 9). Estrogen plays a crucial role in skin health, influencing keratinocyte function, collagen production, moisture retention and telogen-anagen follicle transition132–135. In an explant model of fetal rat skin development, estrogen was shown to increase filaggrin expression136. Conversely, estrogen deficiency during menopause is associated with adverse skin changes such as loss of collagen, skin dryness and atrophy137,138. Overall, molecular alterations observed in the space flown mice and astronaut skin data show similarities with molecular effects associated with drugs like tretinoin and tamoxifen123, such as FLG and CASP14 downregulation, while symptoms reported in astronauts including dry skin and dermatitis also resemble side effects associated with drugs like tretinoin and tamoxifen106 (Fig. 9). Topical moisturizers and emollients, as commonly used by astronauts15,95, may help to counteract the physiological consequences of disrupted barrier function genes, and may also help to explain why results on impact of spaceflight on skin physiological parameters in astronauts have been mixed14,15, despite physiological evidence of skin damage in space flown rodents12. In conclusion, we have provided a comprehensive study on the impact of spaceflight on skin health. Currently, there is a gap in knowledge for how space radiation and microgravity affects skin biology, yet many of the common themes of spaceflight dysfunction emerged in our analysis, suggesting that skin could be an easily-accessible candidate for studying the biological impact of spaceflight. Our systems biology analysis revealed some genes of interest and potential mechanisms to investigate in the context of countermeasures that can be utilized in future studies. We believe with our study we have started to address the current gaps and provided some clues on how to potentially mitigate the adverse effects of the space environment to the skin. The rodent datasets used come from three different spaceflight experiments with a variety of confounding variables associated with differences in study design. This means that direct comparison between the experiments is challenging, but indeed this also presents an opportunity to hypothesize how these factors may influence biology, as done in this manuscript. A lack of physiological data, such as dermal thickness, and lack of individual skin layer data from the rodent datasets means that generated hypotheses relating to mouse physiology cannot be confirmed without follow-up investigations, but the comparison to astronaut data helps translate the results to human relevance. Lastly, gene expression levels differ between skin compartments so an identical fold-change value in a layer where the specific gene expression is generally low may not represent the same magnitude in a layer where the same gene’s expression is relatively greater. As such, for the i4 skin data we focused on changes in the compartments where the gene is established to be predominantly expressed.",

Copyright notice ID: 11166967 PMID: 38862781 Previous version available: This article is based on a previously available preprint posted on Research Square on February 10, 2023: \"More than a Feeling: Dermatological Changes Impacted by Spaceflight\". Abstract Background Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood.Methods To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4.Results Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression.Conclusion Our findings can guide future research on developing countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight-associated skin damage.Subject terms: Systems biology, Skin diseasesPlain language summary Spaceflight is a hostile environment which can lead to health problems in astronauts, including in the skin. It is not currently well understood why these skin problems occur. Here, we analyzed data from the skin of space flown mice and astronauts to try and identify possible explanations for these skin problems. It appears that changes in the activation of genes related to damage to DNA, skin barrier health, and mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of cells) may play a role in these skin problems. Further research will be needed to confirm exactly how these changes influence skin health, which could lead to solutions for preventing and managing such issues in astronauts. Cope, Elsborg et al. analyzed transcriptomic data from mice and astronauts flown to space and identified molecular signatures of DNA damage and repair, mitochondrial dysregulation, and skin barrier disruption. These changes may underpin dermatological issues in astronauts.Introduction Throughout the course of a spaceflight mission, the astronaut exposome includes altered gravity, elevated radiation, and confinement within a closed environment with unique hygiene procedures, light cycles, and ventilation1. These stressors perturb biological systems, inducing gene regulatory changes, mitochondrial dysregulation, microbiome shifts, and DNA damage1. Dermatological issues are not typically regarded as a key risk to astronaut health and mission success, yet they are amongst the most common in-flight health issues reported by astronauts. During regular International Space Station (ISS) missions averaging 6-months, skin rashes have been identified as the most frequently reported in-flight clinical symptom, with 1.1 cases per flight year, accounting for 40% of all notable medical events and a 25-fold increase compared to the United States’ general population2. An additional 0.3 cases per flight year include skin manifestations accompanied by symptoms of infection; skin lesions associated with viral reactivation were also reported and have been studied in-flight2–4. Notably, an in-flight skin rash was reported to have occurred during a 6-month ISS mission, worsening immediately after extravehicular activity (EVA)5, and a post-flight skin rash was reported following the 1-year-long NASA Twins spaceflight study6. These events arouse particular concern for future Moon and Mars missions, which will be longer, include high-levels of EVA, and also include risk of exposure to irritant dust, reported previously to induce skin issues in Apollo astronauts7. Elucidating the biological response of skin in space could aid development of new countermeasures to manage dermatological issues and optimize astronaut performance during these future missions. As the human body’s largest organ, the skin plays a crucial role in numerous essential health functions. These include facilitating fluid diffusion, promoting wound healing, regulating body temperature, and enabling tactile sensation. Skin is also the first line of defense against chemicals, allergens, infectious agents, and - importantly for spaceflight - radiation. Studies of the astronaut skin microbiome have identified microbial interchange between the skin and the ISS interior8, and have also hypothesized that abnormal proliferation of certain types of opportunistic microorganisms on astronaut skin may stem from the unusual hygiene procedures on the ISS, where wipes are used as opposed to showering9,10. While these microbiome shifts and their associated health effects require further studies, investigations into the molecular response of skin tissue in space are lacking. In murine skin, the 13-day STS-135 study and the 91-day Mouse Drawer System (MDS) study reported significant spaceflight-induced modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes11,12; the set of genes did not overlap, which could be due to significant differences in study design (e.g. duration). The MDS study also reported a 42% increase in synthesized procollagen coupled with a 15% reduction in dermal thickness likely indicative of increased collagen turnover, and an increase in hair follicles growing in the anagen stage accompanied by dysregulation of hair follicle genes12. Corroborating gene regulatory changes associated with hair cycle were also reported in an analysis of hair follicle samples from 10 astronauts in a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) study13, yet reports of skin physiological changes in astronauts, including dermal atrophy, have been mixed14,15. In a recent analysis of astronaut skin punch biopsies taken before and after the 3-day commercial Inspiration4 (i4) mission16, gene expression changes within different layers of the skin were explored alongside microbiome changes, revealing signatures of increased inflammation and mitochondrial dysregulation across skin compartments, and gene regulatory changes associated with activation of DNA damage response (DDR) processes, T cell immunity, and increased barrier disruption in the outer epidermal layer of the skin17. In this study, we perform an analysis of five previously unreported murine skin RNA-Seq datasets from the JAXA Mouse Habitat Unit 2 (MHU-2)18, NASA Rodent Research 5 (RR-5) and 7 (RR-7) experiments, to identify global gene expression signatures in spaceflight-exposed skin and to investigate the effect of study design on biological signatures relating to skin health and common spaceflight themes including DNA damage and repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation1. In addition to examining gene regulatory patterns, we use an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) modeling approach to construct interpretable machine learning models to identify synergistic effects between pairs of genes, which we interpret as possible biological interactions, that reveal putative disequilibria of dependent processes. We then investigate gene regulatory changes observed in the rodent skin data in astronaut data, including JAXA hair follicle data13, skin data from the i4 mission, and blood gene expression data from the NASA Twins19, JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE), and i4 studies. We conclude by suggesting how these molecular signatures may eventually lead to follow-up studies and pharmaceutical interventions.Methods Ethics and inclusion statement This manuscript has included authors from all backgrounds from the scientific international community and the results are held at the highest ethical standards. All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs and according to the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. The Inspiration4 (I4) mission was performed at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after informed consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). All crewmembers consented to data and sample sharing. The NASA Twin Study subjects signed informed consent according to the declaration of Helsinki and 14 CFR Part 1230 for collection and use of sample materials and data in research protocols at NASA and the collaborating institutions. Study protocols were approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Review Board (protocol number Pro1245) and all participating institutions. Also the data is hosted at the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Informed consent was provided by all participants in the NASA Twin Study. The JAXA astronaut data was obtained from NASA’s GeneLab Platform and this study used only published aggregated quantification values. No ethical approval for this manuscript was required to use the JAXA astronaut data since this was publicly available data on the GeneLab platform. In addition the data made available on GeneLab was only provided as anonymized aggregate data.GeneLab spaceflight murine datasets Five RNA-Seq datasets (OSD-238, OSD-239, OSD-240, OSD-241, OSD-254) were downloaded from the NASA OSDR via the API, and full dataset descriptions can be found on the dataset pages. These datasets are derived from whole murine skin samples from the MHU-2, RR-5, and RR-7 spaceflight experiments. For MHU-2, singly-housed male C57BL/6J mice were 9 weeks of age when flown on the ISS for 30 days; they were euthanized less than 1 day after return to Earth. Dorsal and femoral skin samples were extracted from MHU-2 mice, and 6 replicates in spaceflight microgravity and the matching 6 replicates in the 1G ground control were split into 2 sets of 3, with half fed a JAXA chow diet and the other half fed JAXA chow with supplemental FOS18. For RR-5, 30 week old BALB/c mice in shared housing were flown on the ISS for 30 days; following return to Earth, mice were given 30 days to recover before euthanasia and extraction of dorsal and femoral skin tissue. Finally, for RR-7, 11 week old C57BL/6J mice and C3H/HeJ mice were flown on the ISS for either 25 or 75 days before being euthanized on-orbit.RNA-Seq analysis of rodent datasets Raw counts data, derived via a previously reported pipeline20, were downloaded from the NASA OSDR and loaded with tximport (v1.28.0). ERCC genes were filtered out, as were genes with zero counts in the minimum number of samples corresponding to a single condition. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis using the Wald significance test was performed on spaceflight microgravity and ground control samples using the R package DESeq221 (v1.40.2). For each data subset, microgravity spaceflight samples were contrasted with ground control samples and cook’s cut off and independent filtering were not used. Mapping of mouse ENSEMBL gene IDs to gene symbols and human orthologs was done using the R Package biomaRt (v2.56.1) and ENSEMBL 105. For human orthologs, one-to-many mapping was supported. All heatmaps were generated using the R package ComplexHeatmap (v2.16.0). All DGE statistics for the rodent data, including the list of cross-mission genes, can be found in Supplementary Data 1.Pathway analysis of rodent datasets For Over Representation Analysis (ORA), the R package clusterProfiler (v4.8.3) was used on vectors of genes and bar plots were made via ggplot2 (v3.4.4). For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), the R package FGSEA (v1.26.0) was used. GSEA was performed on all DEGs for all data subsets, with rank vectors consisting of HGNC symbols and corresponding sorted t-scores in the data subset. MSigDB human collections H, C2, and C5 were used (v7.4) and set sizes >15 were permitted. For the mitochondrial pathway analysis, human pathways from MitoPathways (v3.0), with some additional custom curated pathways (Supplementary Table 1), were used and set sizes >1 were permitted. All heatmaps were generated using the R package ComplexHeatmap (v2.16.0). All GSEA results, including mitochondrial results, can be found in Supplementary Data 2.RNA-Seq data analysis on Twin Study samples Longitudinal samples were collected from a male astronaut aboard the ISS and his identical twin on Earth during a 340 day mission including 6 months preflight and 6 months postflight follow-up, for a total of 19 time points for the flight subject and 13 time points for the ground subject. Blood was collected using CPT vacutainers (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. For full details of sample separation and processing see ref. 19. Briefly, samples collected on ISS were either frozen in −80 °C after separation of mononuclear cells by centrifugation (referred to as CPT), or returned to Earth in 4 °C in a Soyuz capsule and sorted into CD4, CD8, CD19 populations and a lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction. Samples collected on Earth were either frozen for mononuclear cells or processed when fresh for sorted cell populations. To correct for the effects of ambient temperature exposure on RNA (approximately 36 h including landing and repatriation) control samples were created by simulating similar conditions to those that may occur during the ambient return and were compared to fresh blood collections from the same individual. RNA extraction, library prep and sequencing were completed per19 using both ribodepletion or polyA selection kits. As previously reported19, generated sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! (v0.4.1) and quantified to genes using kallisto22 on ENSEMBL transcripts. Differentially expressed genes were called using DESeq221 on each cell type separately by comparing preflight, inflight and postflight groups, controlling for the normal biological variance within the 24 months using the longitudinal data of the ground twin and using the simulated ambient control samples as another covariate for sorted cells20,23. Reads were mapped onto an updated reference genome (GRCh38)24.JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through the NASA OSDR with accession number: OSD-53025. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. In total 2-3 pre-flight samples (L-168 ± 14 days, L-112 ± 14 days, L-56 ± 14 days), 4 in-flight samples (L + 5 ± 1 day, L + 30 ± 7 days, L + 60 ± 14 days, L + 120 ± 14d or R-8 (−14d/+0d day)), and 3-4 post-flight samples (R + 3 ± 1 day, R + 30 ± 7 days, R + 60 ± 14 days, R + 120 ± 14 days) were collected per astronaut. As provided by OSDR, data points for all subjects were pooled into one group per mission phase.JAXA astronaut hair follicle data Gene expression data from 10 JAXA astronauts’ hair follicles13 was downloaded from the NASA OSDR (OSD-174). Raw data for 60 total samples was processed using LIMMA with R/bioconductor26. Briefly, duplicate sample single-color Agilent microarray data was background corrected, filtered for low expression probes, and quantile normalized. Differential gene expression was measured between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight data points using p-values adjusted for False Discovery Rates (FDR) with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. As previously described13 hair follicle samples were collected from each astronaut on 6-month ISS missions at two pre-flight time points (firstly between L-180 and L-90, and secondly between L-60 and L-14), two in-flight time points (firstly between L + 20 and L + 37, and secondly between R-20 and R-7), and two post-flight time points (firstly between R + 2 and R + 7, and secondly between R + 30 and R + 90).Inspiration4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) at 585 km above Earth. The mission launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on September 15th, 2021 and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral on September 18th, 2021. All biological data derived from the Inspiration4 mission were collected pre- and post-flight, and will be accessible via the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)27. For this study, only data from blood samples and skin biopsies were used. Pre-flight samples were collected at L-92, L-44, and L-3 days prior to launch to space. Upon return, post-flight samples were collected at R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 days. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: L-92, L-44, and L-3) and after (Return; R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82) the spaceflight. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference28. Reads were mapped onto a recent reference genome (GRCh38)24. We followed the analysis pipeline as previously reported [Ref. 29]. For skin spatial transcriptomics data, 4 mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before flight and as soon as possible after return (L-44 and R + 1). As previously described in detail17, these biopsies were flash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. Based on staining images using fluorescent antibodies, a total of 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) were profiled across outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. The IE and OE regions represented stratum basale, and stratum spinosum with stratum granulosum, respectively. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, and read quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform DGE analysis. Records of vitamin D supplement consumption were not available for the i4 crew. All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569).Astronaut physiological data Data are reported from three human subject experiments conducted on the International Space Station: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006-2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013–2018). All protocols were reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent. These missions were 4–6 months in length, and these studies included blood and urine collections before, during, and after flight, with analysis of an array of nutritional and biochemical markers. Blood and urine samples were collected 2 or 3 times before flight: approximately Launch minus (L-) 180 days and L-45 days. In some cases, a third blood sample was collected (typically along with the L-45 collection), and these tubes were centrifuged and frozen for aliquoting after flight batched with the samples collected inflight. Blood samples were collected inflight, at approximately Flight Day (FD) 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180. Postflight samples were collected in the first 24-h after landing (designated return + 0, R + 0) and again 30-d later (R + 30). The R + 0 samples were not necessarily fasting, given the time of day and nature of return from flight. Of the 59 crewmembers reported herein: 8 returned on the Space Shuttle, with blood collection 2–4 h after landing; 51 landed in Kazakhstan, with 7 of them returning to Star City, Russia, with blood collection 8–10 h after landing; 44 were transported directly back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, with blood collection approximately 24-h after landing. Pre- and postflight collections included two 24-h urine collections, and inflight collections included one 24-h urine collection. These collection techniques have been previously described30. We report here vitamins and metabolites, oxidative stress and damage markers, inflammatory markers and cytokines, liver enzymes and endocrine indices. These were analyzed using standard techniques as previously reported31. As of this writing, data were available for 59 crewmembers (47 male, 12 female). Age at launch was 47.0 ± 5.6 y, body mass at launch was 79.2 ± 11.8 kg (M: 83.3 ± 9.3; F: 63.0 ± 4.5). Body mass index was 25.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2 (M: 26.4 ± 2.6; F: 22.3 ± 1.5). All available data are reported here, although the reported n for any given test or session varies for a number of reasons, including: not all experiments had all analytes included, mission length differences for some crewmembers, schedule or other issues occasionally precluded sample collection, and methods changes over time. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p < 0.001 are reported. The data was plotted using R package ggplot2 (v3.3.5).QLattice symbolic regression modeling We used symbolic regression (QLattice v3.0.132) to construct models involving combinations of synergistic genes which map from the gene expressions to spaceflight status. For these models, we only distinguish between mice that went to space and mice that did not. Conventional statistical methods typically allow for calculating the effect of a single gene at a time through metrics such as p-values and false discovery rates. In contrast, symbolic regression models can reveal combinations of genes and modules that best predict spaceflight status. These could be linear combinations involving two or more genes that have previously also been shown to be statistically significant, or it could be non-linear combinations that reveal features that on their own were non-significant but in synergy with a second feature become highly predictive. In addition, known biological functions of genes included in models, as well as the resultant mathematical relationship between them, can potentially be interpreted to reveal regulations or interactions that are affected by spaceflight. In biological pathway analysis, it is well-known that up- or down-regulation of one gene can have cascading effects, such that the function of one gene becomes sensitive to that of another33. It has previously been demonstrated that parsimonious machine learning models are able to provide accurate outcome prediction in omics data, while preserving interpretability34,35. The interpretability often results from the fact that models might demonstrate otherwise opaque relations, which become clear when combined effects are considered. An example could be an interaction where the regulation of a single gene is itself unimportant for functional changes, unless another gene is simultaneously regulated. This would indicate a synergistic compound effect, which naturally can expand to a 3-, 4- or 5-gene synergy and beyond. The combined effect of two or more individually insignificant gene expression levels may thus theoretically be more powerful than the effect of a single gene with low p-value. Thus, traditional statistical analysis masks such effects by the use of metrics related to the individual gene.UMAP dimensional reduction and gene clustering For the clustering of genes shown in Fig. 1b, we performed a uniqueness filtering by first dropping all genes where more than a quarter of the samples had identical expression levels. Subsequently, we filtered out all genes with a variance of less than 1.7, resulting in 2184 filtered genes with high variability. Fig. 1. Global data overview. Open in a new tab a Breakdown of the rodent datasets used in this study. b Clustering of the most variable genes within the rodent datasets with functional annotation.A dimensional reduction was performed subsequent to filtering by uniformly distributing the filtered data on a Riemannian manifold, using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP). UMAP is a general purpose manifold learning and dimension reduction algorithm which is similar to t-SNE in that it predominantly preserves local structure. Yet, UMAP preserves more global structure, which makes it a more suited algorithm when the objective of the dimensional reduction is more than simple visualization (in this case the objective is clustering). Genes were then clustered using the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)36. A primary advantage of HDBSCAN is that it is always deterministic for the same hyperparameters, and will thus always return the same clustering, all else being equal. In addition, comparable clustering algorithms such as k-means do not perform well unless clusters are of equal size and density with few outliers. With biological data such as gene expressions, we expect large variation in cluster size and density, making HDBSCAN the ideal choice. Once genes were clustered, the gene sets belonging to each cluster were extracted and analyzed using three ontology databases in the Python implementation, GSEAPY, of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis37 tool Enrichr38. We used the Elsevier Pathway Collection, the 2021 WikiPathway Collection, and the 2021 MGI Mammalian Phenotype Level 4 Collection. These enrichment analyses were used to provide context to each cluster by appending an annotation if a notable amount of hits showed up for a particular association.Regulatory network analysis We used the differential gene expression data from all cross-mission genes across each comparison to perform an upstream regulator analysis using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (version 01-22-0139). We identified the biological or chemical drugs in the QIAGEN IPA library of regulators, defined as having a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value < 0.05 and an absolute Z-score >1. Drugs from the dataset that met these criteria and were associated with similar log2 fold-change patterns in the QIAGEN Knowledge Base were visualized by hierarchical clustering of the unstandardized Z-scores using Euclidean distance as the similarity metric, and complete-linkage method for agglomeration. Statistics on the full list of drug targets can be found in Supplementary Data 3.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Results Spaceflight transcriptome global changes in rodent skin reflect common biological hallmarks of spaceflight To explore whether transcriptomic changes in the skin would occur during spaceflight, we analyzed five RNA-Seq datasets from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)40, all representing skin tissue from space flown mice and matching ground control replicates. These datasets are derived from three different spaceflight missions (Fig. 1a). The most variable genes across the datasets cluster into functional groups related to established physiological risks of spaceflight (Fig. 1b). For example, spaceflight is known to induce immune dysfunction1 and Cluster 1 involves highly-correlated genes associated with immune response, including genes linked to modulation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. Microgravity is also well established to cause degradation of muscle1, and Cluster 9 contains a significant number of genes related to muscular morphology and muscle disorders. Ionizing radiation is known to cause renal and pulmonary fibrosis41,42 and profibrosis-like alterations were previously observed in lung tissue of mice returned from Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-118)43. Renal and lung fibrosis associated genes found in Cluster 7, and genes encoding proteins involved in sclerotic diseases grouped in Cluster 8, further supports these reports. Upon subsetting each dataset based on experimental groups (i.e. diet, strain, skin site) and performing differential gene expression (DGE) analysis for spaceflight samples versus ground control samples, we end up with 10 data subsets (Fig. 2a). In total 476 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are significant (False Discovery Rate (FDR) ≤ 0.1) in at least 2 out of the 10 data subsets. One significant DEG shared across data subsets from the RR-7 study is GLYCAM1 which is shared between both data subsets for the C57BL/6 J strain. GLYCAM1, a ligand for L-selectin that has been proposed to modulate leukocyte transendothelial migration from blood44, is strongly upregulated (Log2 Fold Change (LFC) ≈ 18.81, FDR < 10−6) at the 25 day time point and strongly downregulated (LFC ≈ −15.66, FDR < 0.002) at the 75 day time point, which could indicate a relationship between spaceflight duration and immune alterations for the C57BL/6J mice. Over representation analysis (ORA) reveals that a large proportion of the 244 significant DEGs shared between MHU-2 data subsets are associated with the organization of collagen and the ECM (Fig. 2b). Significant modulation of genes associated with ECM homeostasis was previously reported in analyses of the skin of space flown mice11,12. The MHU-2 subset from the dorsal skin of mice fed a standard JAXA chow diet with supplemental prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) contains the highest quantity of significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) DEGs by a substantial margin (Fig. 2a). In ground-based rodent studies, FOS has been shown to improve gut microbiome balance, increase bone density, and affect the immune system through increased short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production (modifying interleukin production and natural killer cell activity), and modification of the immune system via gut-associated lymphoid tissue18,45. Due to the disparity between the number of significant DEGs in the data subsets, and the variety of conditions between data subsets, care must be taken when combining these data subsets to infer shared responses of rodent skin to spaceflight. Fig. 2. Differentially expressed genes shared between datasets. Open in a new tab a An upset plot showing the number of significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight versus ground data subsets and the number of overlapping significant DEGs between these data subsets. The colored annotation bar on the left of the plot shows how the original datasets divide into 10 data subsets based on all unique conditions including diet, biological sex and strain. The bar plot on the right of the upset plot shows the number of significant DEGs in each of the 10 data subsets. The bar plot on the top shows the number of intersecting DEGs between combinations of the data subsets, as indicated by the connected dots within the body of the upset plot. Black connecting lines indicate combinations spanning across multiple missions, and other connecting lines are colored according to the annotation bar, based on their shared mission. b A bar plot of significant Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) pathways from significant DEGs shared by any subsets within the MHU-2 mission (i.e., DEGs from the blue bars in panel a).Genes significantly altered in rodent skin spaceflight response across multiple missions are associated with cell cycle processes To address the previously mentioned bias in the MHU-2 dorsal skin data subset with a FOS-supplemented diet, and to delineate the common response of murine skin to spaceflight across multiple datasets, a list of 189 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) is generated exhibiting significance (False Discovery Rate ≤0.1) in data subsets from at least two distinct missions. For the majority of the significant DEGs, there is a trend of downregulation in the MHU-2 dorsal skin dataset with the FOS-supplemented diet, and in the RR-7 mission C57BL/6J mice after 75 days of flight (Supplementary Fig. 1). A smaller cluster of genes (e.g., LAMA1, S1PR1, HMGCS2, TXNIP, IGFBP3, ADGRF5, CAR4, HSD17B11, C1QTNF9, KLF11) are also significant in those same data subsets, but are significantly upregulated (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3. Cross-mission genes involved in rodent skin spaceflight response. Open in a new tab a A heatmap showing regulatory changes of select cross-mission genes (genes that are significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) differentially expressed between flight and ground control across multiple missions) within each rodent data subset. b A bar plot showing the GOBP pathways that the full list of cross-mission genes are involved in. c A decision boundary plot of the strongest cross-mission QLattice model using only the expression of two genes as input features to predict the spaceflight status of the all mice in the data. d A decision boundary plot of the second-strongest model across all missions.To go beyond single-gene significance, we use QLattice modeling32 to construct models that predict the spaceflight status of all samples in the data (i.e. from all data subsets). These models use the expression of two genes at most to arrive at maximally relevant and minimally redundant models. In Fig. 3c, d, we show the decision boundaries of the two strongest models found, with Area Under Curve (AUC) scores of 0.86 and 0.85, respectively. Both models show that the spaceflight status is well separated using only the expression of two genes as input, while also having plausible biological interpretations, which we discuss in the following sections. The 189 cross-mission DEGs are primarily involved in cell-cycle pathways (Fig. 3b), with several of the genes (e.g. LAMA1, C1QTNF9, HMGCS2, TXNIP, KLF11) clustering with average trends of upregulation across the datasets (Fig. 3a). Spaceflight is well-documented to perturb the cell-cycle1. These genes tend also to be involved in metabolic pathways, particularly those associated with diabetes; HMGCS2 has been shown to regulate mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation46, while LAMA1 and KLF11 variations have been shown to be risk factors in type 2 diabetes47,48. Aside from being a protector against oxidative stress, TXNIP is similarly implicated in metabolic diseases, and is typically upregulated in diabetic and prediabetic muscle tissue49. C1QTNF9 (also known as CTRP9) has also emerged as a potentially important component of pathways involving lipid metabolism and adipose tissue, exemplified by the fact that C1QTNF9 transgenic mice have been shown to resist weight gain and metabolic dysfunction50. It is interesting to note that upregulation of these metabolic pathway genes appears generally weaker for female mice. This might be linked to the same mechanisms offering higher protection for females against diet-induced obesity compared to male mice, as has been noted in other studies51. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) axis have been implicated in pathogenesis of both inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases and also plays a role in skin’s immune response to viral infection52. In both MHU-2 and RR-7 missions S1PR1 is enriched, while this effect is reversed in RR-5 after 30-day recovery (Fig. 3a). On the contrary FLG (Filaggrin), CASP14, KRT2, genes involved in cornified envelope and skin barrier formation36–38,53–55, generally showed an opposite trend in gene expression patterns (Fig. 3a). CASP14 is also the main driver of the second-most predictive 2-gene QLattice model obtained from the cross-mission key gene list, which involved a combined model of CASP14 and S1PR1 (Fig. 3d). OXTR, identified as a key driver in the most predictive 2-gene QLattice model derived from the cross-mission key gene list, along with SLC6A18 (Fig. 3c), is predominantly localized in the basal layer of the epidermis. Its primary expression is attributed to keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts56. OXTR together with oxytocin has been shown to mediate oxidative stress response in the skin56. Our analysis revealed an increase in gene expression of OXTR across all missions and experimental conditions except for C3H/Hej mice in the RR-7 mission at the 25-day time point (Fig. 3a). Both estrogens and androgens play an important role in skin and hair physiology. HSD17B11, which has a stronger expression in steroidogenic cells such as sebaceous glands, has been predicted to be involved in androgen metabolism during steroidogenesis, and conversion 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol to androsterone57. Similar to the pattern observed in OXTR, HSD17B11 expression was increased in all murine datasets except for RR-5 dorsal skin group (Fig. 3a).Astronaut data correlates with select gene expression changes occurring across missions in the murine skin models Having investigated a set of cross-mission genes regulated by spaceflight in rodent skin, we then decided to investigate the expression of human orthologs of these genes in astronaut studies. Firstly, we use post-flight vs pre-flight gene expression data from skin samples collected during the i4 mission. Similar to the patterns observed in murine models (Fig. 3a), FLG and CASP14, which play significant roles in skin barrier formation, are also downregulated in the epidermis of i4 astronauts (Fig. 4a), where they are primarily expressed. In the literature, FLG is reported to mainly be expressed in stratum granulosum58, with mutations associated with dry skin, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis as well as ichthyosis vulgaris54,59,60. CASP14 on the other hand is known to be primarily expressed in differentiating and cornifying layers44 and decreased levels were detected in lesional skin biopsies of patients with atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis61,62. Likewise, KRT2 which was downregulated across all subgroups in the MHU-2 and RR-7 missions (Fig. 3a), was also downregulated in the skin of i4 astronauts, with strongest downregulation in outer epidermis where it is primarily expressed but also in inner epidermis and outer dermis (Fig. 4a). Additionally, similarly to the trend of upregulation in the rodent data (Fig. 3a), OXTR is upregulated across all compartments studied in the i4 skin (Fig. 4a) and HSD17B11 is upregulated in both compartments of the epidermis and in the outer dermis (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. The profile of the cross-mission genes in astronauts. Open in a new tab a Heatmap showing log2 fold-change in orthologs of the rodent skin cross-mission genes in astronaut skin data from the Inspiration4 mission, for different skin layers. b Heatmap showing t-score in orthologs of the rodent skin cross-mission genes in hair follicle samples at different time points from the JAXA HAIR astronaut study.In some astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight, decrease in melanin content has been previously reported63. In the inner epidermis of the i4 skin data, where melanin synthesis takes place, we found downregulation of two genes associated with melanin biosynthesis, TYRP1 and DCT64 (Fig. 4a). However, TYR which synthesizes tyrosinase, the rate limiting enzyme of melanin synthesis was upregulated in the same compartment65 (Fig. 4a). TYR, DCT, and TYRP1 clustered in the rodent data, with an average trend of downregulation, particularly in the MHU-2 dorsal skin dataset with the FOS-supplemented diet, and in the RR-7 mission C57BL/6J mice after 75 days of flight (Fig. 3a). We also analyze gene expression data from the blood of astronauts from the NASA Twins, JAXA CFE studies, and i4 studies (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the NASA Twins Study, the most noteworthy results are in CD4 cell type in-flight vs pre-flight samples with significant downregulation in a group of genes (e.g. DSC2, TMEM252, CEBPD, CA4, and PTGS2, and OTX1) persisting post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 2a). These genes display no significant changes in CD8 cells, which may indicate that their downregulation is a response to immune system stressors affecting the helper function and signaling of CD4 cells. DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4), STIL and TOP2A cell-cycle associated genes are amongst the most strongly upregulated genes in-flight compared to pre-flight in the CD8 cells, and exhibit downregulation post-flight to trend towards pre-flight levels (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In the CFE study, several genes were strongly upregulated in-flight and then downregulated post-flight (e.g., OXTR, PRR9, ERCC6L) in the blood samples from JAXA astronauts (Supplementary Fig. 2b). In the i4 mission blood samples the majority of genes show a pronounced suppression in the time point immediately before flight, which could be indicative of increased stress prior to launch. Several genes then show strong upregulation at the first post-flight time point (e.g., BARD1, BRCA1, RAD54B, EXO1, OXTR, and HSD17B11) (Supplementary Fig. 2c), suggesting upregulation due to spaceflight or landing stressors, followed by post-flight recovery towards baseline expression levels from second post-flight time point and beyond. However, some other genes appear to show a delayed upregulation following spaceflight, as they are upregulated in the second post-flight time point, two months after flight (e.g. KLF11, CA4, OXT1, TM4SF4) and return towards baseline at the third post-flight time point (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The gene expression alterations in these sets of genes are potentially due to a re-adaptation response.Specific pathways and genes related to skin health are altered in spaceflight To determine direct relevance of spaceflight to skin health, we conduct targeted analysis with a curated list of key pathways involved in skin health from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and identify which of these pathways and associated genes are significantly modulated in the murine skin datasets. A collagen biosynthesis pathway and a set of collagen genes (e.g., COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, and COL5A1) were significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) suppressed/downregulated across all dataset subsets for the MHU-2 mission, while showing a trend of weak enrichment/upregulation across the two other missions (Fig. 5a). Additionally, several collagen and/or ECM related genes (e.g., MMP3, COL5A2, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL15A1, COL6A3, SPARC, PCOLCE, and PYCR1) were significantly (FDR ≤ 0.1) downregulated in all of the MHU-2 data subsets except femoral skin with the standard diet, and a few collagen related genes were significantly downregulated only in the dorsal subsets from the MHU-2 mission (e.g., P3H1, CRTAP, COL14A1, and FKBP14) (Fig. 5a). Overall, the distinct collagen/ECM downregulation signature (Fig. 5a) suggests that a study design difference in the MHU-2 mission (compared to the RR-5 and RR-7 missions), where the use of young single-housed male mice or dissection shortly after the hypergravity event of Live Animal Return (LAR) may have suppressed collagen biosynthesis. Similarly, we find an overall trend of enrichment of pathways relating to thin skin and dermal atrophy in the RR-5 and RR-7 mice, with suppression occurring in the MHU-2 mice (Fig. 5a), likely driven by regulatory patterns in the collagen-associated genes. While there is a general trend of upregulation, the RR-5 mission generally lacks any significant results for genes relating to skin health, which could be due to the 30 days of recovery post-flight. In addition to being reported as cross-mission genes in the previous section, CASP14, FLG and KRT2 were also identified as key skin health genes (Fig. 5). Fig. 5. Behavior of the specific genes associated with skin health in astronauts and rodents. Open in a new tab a The orange (suppressed) and green (enriched) heatmap shows the normalized enrichment score (NES) of curated skin health pathways (full list Supplementary Table 1) that are significant (FDR ≤ 0.05) in at least one rodent subset. The red (upregulated) and blue (downregulated) heatmap shows the t-score for leading edge genes from the significant pathways that are significant (FDR ≤ 0.1) in at least two data subsets. b Heatmap showing log2 fold-change in orthologs of the genes from Panel a in astronaut skin data from the Inspiration4 mission, for different skin layers. c Heatmap showing t-score in orthologs of the genes from Panel a in hair follicle samples at different time points from the JAXA HAIR astronaut study.In post-flight vs pre-flight skin samples from the i4 mission, several collagen/ECM genes (e.g., SPARC, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) were downregulated across the whole dermis, whereas COL5A1 was only downregulated in the vascular compartment of the dermis (Fig. 5b). MMP3, which induces accelerated loss of skin collagen when there is inflammation, was upregulated across the whole dermal layer65 (Fig. 5b). Likewise, several genes (e.g., P3H1, COL14A1, COL15A1, and COLA12A1) were upregulated in both compartments of the dermis (Fig. 5b). KRT24, involved in terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, is reported to be mainly confined to stratum spinosum with slight overexpression in senescent keratinocytes49 and has been shown to induce apoptosis of keratinocytes66. In the post-flight vs pre-flight i4 skin data KRT24 is upregulated in all compartments of the skin with a more prominent increase in outer epidermis and vascular layers66 (Fig. 5b). Late cornified envelope genes (LCE) are located in the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1 and in the skin their expression is known to be mainly confined to the epidermis, specifically to upper stratum granulosum and premature cornified envelopes67,68. In both the inner epidermis and outer dermis of the i4 skin data, LCE2A, LCE2B, LCE2C, LCE2D, genes that respond to UV and calcium67 and LCE5A were upregulated post-flight vs pre-flight (Fig. 5b). In the NASA Twins study blood samples, COL6A2 was upregulated in-flight and then downregulated post-flight in CD8 cells, with PYCR1 following the same pattern in CD4 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In the CFE study, blood samples from JAXA astronauts had strong in-flight upregulation of RPTN and COL3A1, and in particular LCE2B, where upregulation increased further post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 3b). On the other hand, PYCR1 and GJB6 showed the opposite trend in gene expression, with strong downregulation in-flight and almost complete reversal upon return (Supplementary Fig. 3b). PYCR1, which was upregulated post-flight vs pre-flight in all skin layers of i4 astronauts (Fig. 5b) encodes pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1, an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in proline synthesis via utilization of NADH or NADPH. Proline plays an important role in collagen synthesis and PYCR1 deficiency results in collagen and elastin abnormalities69. Conversely, COL3A1 encodes alpha 1 chain of type III collagen, which is an EMP synthesized in cells as pre-collagen and its accumulation was shown to cause fibrosis in various organs70,71. In case of LCE2C and KRT33A, weak in-flight downregulation was followed by strong post-flight upregulation (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Although less apparent, this trend for KRT33A was also observed in the JAXA HAIR data (Fig. 5c). KRT33A, one of the type 1 hair keratin genes, is known to be highly expressed in the cortex of hair follicles, and its expression is reported to decrease with age72. Lastly, genes such as COL6A2 and FKBP14, a collagen/ECM related gene associated with diseases such as kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that is characterized by joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, hearing impairment, muscle hypotonia and occasional vascular fragility like aortic rupture73, were downregulated in-flight and their average expression persisted post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 3b).Radiosensitivity of mouse strains impacts DNA damage response in the skin following spaceflight As part of our targeted analysis, we also opted to investigate the modulation of DNA damage and repair pathways in rodent skin. DNA damage and repair is a well-established response to space radiation19,74 and little research is reported on the consequences this will have on the skin during spaceflight. When ionizing radiation hits DNA molecules, single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, with DDR mechanisms activated to repair these breaks74. For the majority of DNA damage and repair pathways, both the dorsal and femoral skin RR-5 mission data subsets and the 25-day time point from the C3H/HeJ mice in the RR-7 mission show an opposing pattern compared to the other data subsets (Fig. 6). In these three data subsets, pathways relating to DNA damage and repair are generally enriched, while being suppressed in other data subsets. BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice, as used in these data subsets, have been shown to be more radiosensitive compared to C57BL/6J mice75–77, so repair mechanisms may be activated to mitigate increased radiation-induced DNA damage. In the C3H/HeJ mice there is a trend of decreasing activity for the DDR pathways from the 25-day to 75-day time points which could indicate either adaptation of the DNA repair pathways over time in space or dysregulation following extended-duration spaceflight (Fig. 6). The enrichment of DDR pathways in RR-5 also follows 30-days of spaceflight and a post-flight recovery period of 30-days (Fig. 6). However, DNA repair genes were reported to still be enriched compared to pre-flight levels when evaluated at 6-months post-flight during the NASA Twins study19, so persistent DDR activation during post-flight recovery in the mice could be indicative of a similar mechanism.

Skin is a tissue with high turnover and energy requirements79, so we decided to investigate spaceflight changes relating to mitochondrial stress in murine skin. We find that spaceflight alters mitochondrial pathways in the skin (Fig. 7a), as previously observed in other tissues and across species78. Enrichment of an integrated stress response (ISR) pathway in all but two of the dataset subsets (Fig. 7a) is consistent with a previous report of potentially activated ISR due to mitochondrial dysfunction in space flown mice78. Interestingly, the two data subsets where ISR appeared to instead be suppressed were the 25 day time points for both strains from the RR-7 mission (Fig. 7a), implicating spaceflight duration as an important factor for modulating ISR. Additionally, we ran the QLattice machine learning model on the full gene set to obtain a set of models that were unbiased by feature selection due to e.g. variance filtering and the selection of cross-mission genes. One of the 10 strongest 2-feature models involved the expression of the genes D2HGDH (D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase)80 and RPLP0-PS1 (a gene coding for the ribosomal protein RPLP0). The model’s decision boundary (Fig. 7b) demonstrates how the simultaneous upregulation of D2HGDH and downregulation of RPLP0-PS1 characterizes the space-flown mice, with a resulting AUC score of 0.8280. The upregulation of D2HGDH generally indicates an increased ability to break down the toxic D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2H) compound in the mitochondria. In our case, this could be a compensatory mechanism due to larger build-up of the compound, and the model suggests that this is further dependent on the abundance of the RPLP0 protein. Fig. 7.

The model indicates an increased removal of the toxic D2H compound in mitochondria through upregulation of D2HGDH, which is less pronounced when PPP1R3B expression is suppressed.Circulating physiological markers from astronauts indicate that exercise countermeasures may have improved skin health We investigate standard physiological biomarkers collected from astronaut urine and blood81,82 to see whether average trends in these biomarkers connect to spaceflight gene regulatory changes occurring in the skin (Fig. 8). In-flight increases in IGF-1, leptin and white blood cell levels may indicate altered stress response due to spaceflight. Following a hypothesis that improved countermeasures may improve skin physiological parameters in astronauts on the ISS14,15, we split the data into astronauts that used the older Interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED), and astronauts that used the newer Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED). Notably, overlapping data to that shown in Fig. 8 have been used as evidence of improvements in parameters relating to bone mineral density81. Indeed, while vitamin D decreased in-flight and normalized upon return to Earth for both exercise devices, ARED appeared to reduce this drop. Vitamin D is well-established to be an important mediator of skin health83. Notably, this decrease in vitamin D is observed despite consistent programmatic vitamin D supplementation since the collection of blood samples81. Fig. 8.

As with the DDR pathways (Fig. 6), both the dorsal and femoral skin RR-5 mission data subsets and the 25-day time point from the C3H/HeJ mice in the RR-7 mission show an opposing pattern compared to the other data subsets for the predicted upstream regulators (Fig. 9). Fig. 9. Predicted drug signatures associated with spaceflight response in the skin. Open in a new tab Predicted drug signatures using the cross-mission genes across each dataset represented by a hierarchically clustered heat map. A positive (red) activation state implies cross-mission gene expression changes are consistent with expression changes observed with the indicated drug from curated causal gene expression relationship studies. A negative (blue) activation state implies the cross-mission gene expression changes are opposite to changes observed with the indicated drug.Several drugs were predicted to exhibit significant positive correlation with gene expression changes seen in the space flown mice, with the exception of dorsal skin tissues obtained from C3H/HeJ mice that spent 25 days in flight for the RR-7 mission, and dorsal and femoral skin from the RR-5 mice (30-day recovery) (Fig. 9). For example, calcitriol is the active form of Vitamin D, and has been observed to affect skin barrier formation and epidermal differentiation84 it is used clinically to treat plaque psoriasis85. Calcitriol is also associated with immune system alterations in the skin, and topical application in mice has been shown to exacerbate atopic dermatitis86. On the other hand, in a murine model, epidermal permeability and antimicrobial skin barrier impaired by corticosteroid, was shown to be reduced via calcitriol87. Alteration of gene regulatory patterns associated with calcitriol, in the mouse data subsets (Fig. 9) could indicate activation of compensatory mechanisms for spaceflight-induced skin barrier dysfunction, epidermal differentiation, and immune system alterations. L-asparaginase showed the strongest correlation with gene regulatory changes in these spaceflight-exposed mice (Fig. 9). L-asparaginase is used in treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma and exerts its action by depriving leukemic cells of circulating asparagine, resulting in DNA breaks, cell cycle arrest and cell death87,88. It is also an immunogenic protein and leads to skin rash, dry skin, and hypersensitivity reactions89. Similarly, there was strong positive correlation between gene regulatory changes in these spaceflight-exposed mice associated with use of the Vitamin A derivative tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid)90, and two selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen91–94. On the contrary, estrogen and diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic form of estrogen, showed a reversed pattern compared to the aforementioned drug targets (Fig. 9). These drugs showed positive correlation with the expression changes in the RR-5 datasets, and the RR-7 25-day C3H/Hej data subset, and negative correlation in the other data subsets (Fig. 9).Discussion Skin is well-established as an essential organ for health on Earth, yet despite the frequency of dermatological issues in astronauts2, the molecular response of skin to spaceflight is understudied. Here, we have performed a comprehensive study on the molecular impact of spaceflight on skin, with the aim of addressing gaps in the understanding of spaceflight associated skin health risks. Our analysis indicated intriguing gene regulatory changes occurring in the skin of spaceflight vs ground control mice during the MHU-2, RR-5, and RR-7 spaceflight experiments, that also show some overlaps with molecular alterations observed in astronauts. The genes exhibiting the highest variability across the datasets formed clusters associated with well-established physiological risks of spaceflight, notably immune dysfunction and muscle degradation (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the majority of genes showing significant differential expression across multiple missions in murine data were linked to cell cycle processes, particularly chromosome segregation (Fig. 3a, b). This suggests that skin mirrors common spaceflight signatures observed in other tissues, including dysregulation of cell cycle processes1,19. Further to that point, we see an enrichment of DDR pathways in some data subsets from radiosensitive BALB/c and C3H/HeJ strains75–77 (Fig. 6), which is also a well-established spaceflight response19,74. These repair mechanisms may be activated to mitigate radiation-induced DNA damage and appear to remain active during the post-flight recovery process, as seen in the RR-5 mission where samples were collected 30 days after flight. This finding is consistent with reports of sustained post-flight DDR activation from the NASA Twins study19. Notably, DNA damage in the skin has important implications for skin cancers including melanoma, of which astronauts carry a higher risk, although the direct correlation between spaceflight and melanoma is still under investigation95,96. Similarly, mitochondrial dysregulation is established as a key molecular signature of spaceflight78, and we see enrichment of an ISR pathway in all but two of the murine skin data subsets (Fig. 7a), which may be driven by increased oxidative stress or DNA damage. ISR activation appears to be impacted by spaceflight duration, as the 25 day time points for RR-7 show a suppression of the ISR pathway1,78. Using an explainable machine learning approach32, we also observed the counteractive mechanism played by D2HGDH, which was generally upregulated in space flown mice (Fig. 7b) indicating an increased need for breakdown of toxic D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2H) molecules in mitochondria. In this model, the partner gene RPLP0-PS1 codes for the ribosomal protein RPLP0 and is down-regulated in space flown mice. RPLP0 has previously been implicated in the top significant network for the mitochondria-mediated cycle of Alzheimer’s disease97. Low or absent levels of RPLP0 seem to limit the compensatory mechanism in the model (Fig. 7b). If this occurs, build-up of D2H and suppression of certain enzyme functions can result, causing DNA and histones to enter hypermethylated states and activate oncogenes and inhibit tumor suppressors98. Build-up of D2H in the mitochondria may thus be related to cell changes induced by DNA damage from space radiation. Notably, gene regulatory changes associated with mitochondrial dysregulation and DDR were also reported in the skin data from the i4 mission17, corroborating these changes as key molecular hallmarks of spaceflight in the skin. The downregulation of collagen/ECM genes and the suppression of collagen/ECM-related pathways in the MHU-2 mouse mission, where spaceflight samples were collected shortly after landing (Figs. 2b and 5a), mirror findings from previous studies where a reduction in collagen synthesis occurred under hypergravity conditions in cultured human fibroblasts99. In contrast, RR-7 mice (frozen in space) generally exhibited an upregulation of the same collagen/ECM genes (Fig. 5a), consistent with results from the aforementioned human fibroblast study, which reported a 143% increase in collagen synthesis during microgravity99. Similar to RR-7, RR-5 also showed a trend of upregulation in collagen/ECM genes (Fig. 5a). The opposing patterns between the MHU-2 mission and RR-5/RR-7 may arise from diverse factors owing to experimental design differences. Notably, the timing of sample collection introduces a critical variable, as seen in the MHU-2 mission where samples were collected less than one day post-flight, in contrast to RR-5, where collection occurred after a 30-day post-flight recovery, and RR-7, where samples were obtained directly in space. This temporal distinction implies that collagen suppression observed in MHU-2 mice may be influenced, at least in part, by the acute hypergravity response, a known factor in decreasing collagen synthesis99, and the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids100–102, rather than being solely attributed to the spaceflight environment. Moreover, differences in sex and housing arrangements further complicate the comparison; MHU-2 mice are singly-housed males, while RR-5 and RR-7 mice are multi-housed females, introducing additional variables that may contribute to the observed disparities100–103. Skin has an anatomically heterogeneous gene expression profile104. For instance, fibroblasts exhibit distinct gene expression patterns based on their positional identity in relation to the major anatomical axis105. This phenomenon in part explains the predisposition of different sites to different skin conditions104. Although several genes related to collagen synthesis and ECM were downregulated across all four MHU-2 experimental groups, some of these genes showed statistical significance in the dorsal group but not in the femoral group (Fig. 5a). Likewise in the RR-5 mission, during terrestrial recovery, skin biopsies obtained from dorsal skin generally showed a higher reversal of gene expression pattern compared to those obtained from the femoral skin (Figs. 3a and 5a). These changes may be indicative of the variations in gene expression profile, their adaptation response to space flight and re-adaptation to terrestrial environment, at different anatomical sites. Skin biopsies collected from i4 astronauts one day post-flight exhibited a marked downregulation of various collagen/ECM-associated genes in the dermal layer compared to pre-flight conditions (e.g., SPARC, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL6A1) (Fig. 5b). However, certain genes, such as SPARC and COL3A1, showed an upregulation in one or both compartments of the epidermis (Fig. 5b). Moreover, several other collagen/ECM associated genes (e.g. COL14A1, COL15A1, MMP3) were upregulated in both epidermis and the dermis (Fig. 5b). As with the MHU-2 mice, the i4 astronauts’ skin biopsies were obtained one-day post-flight, so some of these effects may have been induced by hypergravity. Nevertheless, blood data obtained from the same i4 astronauts at 1-, 45-, and 82-days post-flight suggests that most gene alterations observed upon landing revert back to normal levels within 82 days following flight, so we may expect a similar response in the skin tissue (Supplementary Figs. 2c and 3c). Previously reported findings from the NASA Twins showed in-flight activation of collagen formation pathways and an increase in COL1A1 and COL3A1 proteins detected in the urine, indicative of structural remodeling19. These changes, as with the majority of spaceflight-induced changes, were also reported to revert to baseline post-flight19. Some of the changes reported by astronauts during and after spaceflight, such as dryness and contact dermatitis, point to an impaired barrier function17,95 our results support this hypothesis. FLG is a gene expressed in the stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis, during the epidermal differentiation process41. It encodes profilaggrin, a major component of keratohyalin granules found in the keratinocytes that is dephosphorylated and cleaved into filaggrin106,107. During conversion of keratinocyte cell membrane to cornified cell envelope, filaggrin aggregates and aligns intermediate filaments such as keratin 1 and keratin 10, within the cytoskeleton of keratinocytes, and subsequently a cross-linking process is initiated by proteins such as involucrin and locicrin108,109. This results in compactization and flattening of the corneocytes, one of the constituents of the skin barrier110. We identified FLG as one of the cross-mission genes in the spaceflight vs ground control mice data with downregulation across the majority of data subsets (all except RR-5 dorsal skin) (Fig. 3a). Additionally, we observed post-flight vs pre-flight downregulation of FLG in the epidermis of i4 astronauts (Fig. 5b). Caspase-14, an enzyme encoded by the CASP14 gene, cleaves filaggrin, breaking it down into free amino acids. These amino acids serve as integral components of natural moisturizing factors, contributing to the preservation of skin hydration and pH111. Additionally, they play a crucial role in antimicrobial defense, further contributing to the multifaceted functions of the skin barrier61,112,113. Similar to FLG, CASP14 demonstrated downregulation in the majority of murine skin subsets (excluding RR-5 dorsal skin) (Fig. 3a), the epidermal layer of i4 astronaut skin tissue (Fig. 5b), and JAXA hair follicles (Fig. 5c). This observation is important considering the crucial role CASP14 plays in skin barrier formation and its involvement in skin conditions such as contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis53,61,62,114. The link between filaggrin deficiency and dry skin, altered pH, atopic and contact dermatitis, and ichthyosis vulgaris is also well-known54,60,112,115–117. CASP14 was also the driver of one of the two main QLattice models we found to be maximally relevant and minimally redundant among the cross-mission genes, resulting in a very simple model involving only CASP14 and S1PR1 with an AUC of 0.85 (Fig. 3d). S1PR1 was upregulated in most murine skin subsets (Fig. 3a), the in-flight vs pre-flight samples from the JAXA hair follicle study (Fig. 4b), and in all compartments for the post-flight vs pre-flight i4 astronauts’ skin samples (Fig. 4a). In the RR-5 mission, after a 30-day recovery, in-flight effects may have been reversed as S1PR1 expression was downregulated (Fig. 3a), which is also consistent with downregulation in the post-flight vs pre-flight samples from the JAXA hair follicle study (Fig. 4b). Downregulation of S1PR1 has been reported to be necessary for activation of resident memory CD8 + T cells in skin35 and has previously been observed in CD8 + T cells from murine skin during response to Herpes Simplex Virus Infection118. While the S1P-S1PR axis has inhibitory roles in keratinocyte proliferation, it was also shown to contribute to the process of chemotaxis119. For instance, in Staphylococcus-aureus-stimulated keratinocytes; TNF alpha, IL-8 and IL-36γ release was induced via involvement of S1PR1 and S1PR2120. Higher expression levels of S1PR1 and S1PR2 observed in the skin of impetigo patients and changes in the distribution patterns of these receptors were also aligned with these findings120. Herpes Simplex Virus reactivation3,4,95 and Staphylococcus colonization in the skin10,17,121 (which could also be influenced by breakdown of filaggrin altering pH levels122) have been widely reported in astronauts, therefore alterations in S1PR1, CASP14, and FLG, are of importance. At present, there is a lack of widely accepted countermeasures to effectively mitigate the damage caused to the skin induced by exposure to the space environment. Our analysis has identified drugs capable of altering similar molecular changes that manifest in the skin during spaceflight (Fig. 9). Several drugs, including calcitriol, tretinoin, and tamoxifen showed significant positive correlation with regulatory changes in all data subsets from the MHU-2 and RR-7 missions except for the C3H/HeJ mice samples collected at the 25-day time point (Fig. 9). Tretinoin, a vitamin A derivative is a retinoid known for its applications in treating acne and leukemia, exerts its effects through the activation of retinoic acid receptors, influencing various skin processes such as increased proliferation and inhibited differentiation of epidermal cells, increased keratinocyte turnover, increased collagen synthesis, inhibited UV radiation induced metalloproteinase activity, and melanin reduction23,123,124. Tretinoin treatment on reconstructed human epidermis was shown to induce loss of keratohyalin granules and reduce filaggrin and Keratin 10 expression125. Retinoids have also been observed to downregulate caspase-14 expression in in-vitro reconstructed skin models126. Dry skin and exfoliation are common side effects during its use123. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been shown to exhibit both agoniztic and antagonistic effects depending on the tissue94. Its use in breast cancer patients is linked to cutaneous adverse events, including dry skin, itching, and occasionally radiation recall dermatitis and baboon syndrome (a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction)126–129. Furthermore, tamoxifen induces androgen receptor expression in hair follicles, leading to tamoxifen-induced alopecia in some cases130, and abnormal hair follicles, epidermal atrophy and dermal fibrosis have been observed in rat models131. On the other hand, only olaparib, estrogen, and diethylstilbestrol (a synthetic form of estrogen) showed an opposing pattern, with significant negative correlation in all data subsets except for those from the RR-5 mission and the C3H/HeJ mice samples collected at the 25-day time point of the RR-7 mission (Fig. 9). Estrogen plays a crucial role in skin health, influencing keratinocyte function, collagen production, moisture retention and telogen-anagen follicle transition132–135. In an explant model of fetal rat skin development, estrogen was shown to increase filaggrin expression136. Conversely, estrogen deficiency during menopause is associated with adverse skin changes such as loss of collagen, skin dryness and atrophy137,138. Overall, molecular alterations observed in the space flown mice and astronaut skin data show similarities with molecular effects associated with drugs like tretinoin and tamoxifen123, such as FLG and CASP14 downregulation, while symptoms reported in astronauts including dry skin and dermatitis also resemble side effects associated with drugs like tretinoin and tamoxifen106 (Fig. 9). Topical moisturizers and emollients, as commonly used by astronauts15,95, may help to counteract the physiological consequences of disrupted barrier function genes, and may also help to explain why results on impact of spaceflight on skin physiological parameters in astronauts have been mixed14,15, despite physiological evidence of skin damage in space flown rodents12. In conclusion, we have provided a comprehensive study on the impact of spaceflight on skin health. Currently, there is a gap in knowledge for how space radiation and microgravity affects skin biology, yet many of the common themes of spaceflight dysfunction emerged in our analysis, suggesting that skin could be an easily-accessible candidate for studying the biological impact of spaceflight. Our systems biology analysis revealed some genes of interest and potential mechanisms to investigate in the context of countermeasures that can be utilized in future studies. We believe with our study we have started to address the current gaps and provided some clues on how to potentially mitigate the adverse effects of the space environment to the skin. The rodent datasets used come from three different spaceflight experiments with a variety of confounding variables associated with differences in study design. This means that direct comparison between the experiments is challenging, but indeed this also presents an opportunity to hypothesize how these factors may influence biology, as done in this manuscript. A lack of physiological data, such as dermal thickness, and lack of individual skin layer data from the rodent datasets means that generated hypotheses relating to mouse physiology cannot be confirmed without follow-up investigations, but the comparison to astronaut data helps translate the results to human relevance. Lastly, gene expression levels differ between skin compartments so an identical fold-change value in a layer where the specific gene expression is generally low may not represent the same magnitude in a layer where the same gene’s expression is relatively greater. As such, for the i4 skin data we focused on changes in the compartments where the gene is established to be predominantly expressed.Supplementary information Peer Review File (3.6MB, pdf) Supplementary information (888.6KB, pdf) 43856_2024_532_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (7.9KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (34.4MB, csv) Supplementary Data 2 (20.6MB, xls) Supplementary Data 3 (65.1KB, csv) Supplementary Data 4 (1.3MB, docx) Reporting Summary (1.8MB, pdf) Acknowledgements H.C. is supported by the Horizon Center for Doctoral Training at the University of Nottingham (UKRI grant no.

    "abstract": "Abstract Missions into Deep Space are planned this decade. Yet the health consequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceflight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts’ increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR.

    "introduction": "Introduction The renewed zeitgeist for space travel, ushered in by the advent of commercial spaceflight and tourism, has spurred on state-funded agencies to embark on even more ambitious exploratory ‘Deep Space’ missions. The first of these, namely the Artemis Program, Lunar Gateway space station and later the Deep Space Transport/Mars Missions, will for the first-time place humans outside of Earth’s protective magnetic field exposed to significant quantities of unmitigated space radiation and weightlessness for many months to years at a time. The health effects of low Earth orbit (LEO) spaceflight (e.g. the International Space Station) are multiple, with much of the research communities’ intense focus centred on the musculoskeletal, neurological, ocular and cardiovascular degeneration that can manifest as early as a few weeks into a mission. Notably, the effects of LEO spaceflight on many other organ systems are less clear, with indispensable organs such as the kidneys receiving relatively little attention in the absence of overt symptoms. However, in the face of extended periods of deep space travel health issues may only present with late onset due to cloaked subclinical pathophysiology and chronic damage eating into the extensive functional reserves of such organs. The kidneys are critical in regulating blood pressure, by controlling both the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system (RAAS) and the reabsorption of sodium chloride and water from the urine. In microgravity, the cephalad redistribution of blood volume with the concomitant decrease in the pressure gradient should reduce kidney perfusion. In turn, a lower perfusion pressure within the renal artery should lead to a greater release of renin and activation of the RAAS. However, studies show a marked reduction of diuresis and natriuresis in space with the RAAS, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increasing through unknown mechanisms1–3. These unexplained effects, be they mediated through known homeostatic mechanisms, or more theoretical ones, such as tensegrity4, are germane to kidney stone formation (i.e. nephrolithiasis). Astronauts have an unusually high rate of kidney stone formation, with 1-year post-flight astronauts experiencing incidence rates of 2–7 times that of pre-flight estimates, and in-flight risk estimated to be double that again5. This is of mission critical significance, one Soviet in-flight renal stone episode nearly caused a mission termination due to the severe symptoms, but was relieved by spontaneous stone passage by the cosmonaut just before an urgent deorbit was initiated6. It has been demonstrated that spaceflight associated changes in urinary biochemistry favour kidney stone formation7–9. Microgravity may have a direct effect on the crystallisation and nucleation of nascent kidney stones10, but this is dwarfed by the net biochemical urinary changes historically attributed to the microgravity-induced bone demineralisation observed in spaceflight. A school of thought that has led to a paucity of research into other pathophysiological phenomena that may be contributing to the unusually high incidence of nephrolithiasis. The kidney is a plastic organ, and is capable of dynamically remodelling the architecture of the nephron in response to changes in blood pressure or dietary potassium. An 18 day potassium-free diet resulted in a 31% increase in rat kidney weight, which was mainly seen in the medullary collecting duct11. Changes in the size of nephron segments in wild type mice have been observed using advanced imaging techniques in a period as short as three days12. So, it is plausible that spaceflight-induced shifts in fluid and electrolyte handling could precipitate maladaptive remodelling events that contribute to the underlying pathophysiology. In addition to the well-studied environmental stressor of microgravity, deep space missions beyond the protection of the geomagnetosphere (the Van Allen belts) are exposed to space radiation. Space radiation comprises both intermittent events (e.g. Solar Particle Events or Solar Proton Events) with the most energetic being a Coronal Mass Ejection and Solar Wind and Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), with GCR having the most significant health impacts. There is concern regarding the carcinogenic effect of GCR exposure in the planned Mars Missions. However, the kidney is an exquisitely radiation sensitive organ; it is the dose limiting organ in abdominal radiotherapy13. Chronic kidney dysfunction can occur with acute low linear energy transfer (LET) γ-radiation doses as low as <0.5 Gy14, the LET dose expected on a Mars Mission. However, GCR comprises low-LET x- and γ-rays with protons and high energy ‘HZE’ ions of heavier elements (e.g. silicon, titanium, iron). It has been established that exposure to HZE ions results in mitochondrial damage15,16. The renal proximal tubule is heavily dependent on mitochondrial respiration17 and is one of the main tubular segments in which damage is associated with kidney failure18. Indeed, proximal tubular injury is a prominent histological feature in medical (low-LET) radiation nephropathy19. Due to their dependence on mitochondrial aerobic respiration, proximal tubular cells are extremely vulnerable to mitochondrial damage that we would expect from HZE exposure in addition to low-LET radiation damage. We hypothesised that the biochemical urinary changes seen in spaceflight might reflect functional and morphological changes detectable in the kidney secondary to microgravity, possibly due to abnormal renal perfusion. Further, we hypothesised that GCR exposure will cause mitochondrial and therefore proximal tubular dysfunction, leading to tissue damage and potentially irreversible loss of renal function, in addition to the known micro and macrovascular damage caused by GCR. In order to explore these questions, we took a pan-omics approach incorporating anatomical and physiological parameters from 20 independent human and rodent spaceflight missions/simulations that had extant data and/or samples from which we could generate novel data (Fig. 1).

    "methods": "Methods Human studies ethical approval All crews from the Inspiration4, NASA, JAXA spaceflights provided informed written consent prior to their participation. Inspiration4 subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. Tissue samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use of the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials. The procedure followed guidelines set by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). NASA IRB (CSA defers to NASA’s IRB), ESA IRB, JAXA IRB for their respective crewmembers from Biochemical Profile (NASA IRB Pro0797) and Nutritional Status Assessment: SMO 016E (pro0326) projects. All crews provided informed written consent prior to participation. The JAXA human spaceflight study was proposed to and supported by the 2014 International Life Sciences Research Announcements, JAXA, and NASA. Ethics committee approvals were obtained at the University of Tsukuba (No. 251, Nov. 27, 2015), JAXA (JX-IRBA-20-071, Aug. 30, 2016), NASA (Pro1995, Feb. 28, 2017), ESA (2017_04_09, Apr. 20, 2017). Informed consent was obtained by the personal information manager of the study, and de-identified samples were made available to researchers who performed sample processing and data analysis. Cosmonaut data were obtained from previously published data [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10517-013-2310-2]. Animal Studies ethical approval For all animal data coming from NASA Genelab Open Science Data Repository (see detailed citations for all missions in the supplementary methods section) the ethical oversight information and protocol number can be found in the Protocol section (e.g. https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-102).

Cosmonaut and JAXA data is all male. SpaceX data involves both sexes, but this cannot be disaggregated for ethical reasons of anonymity. For the animal studies: The findings apply mostly female animals (roughly two thirds of animal missions were female). As we were collecting data from previously conducted experiments, we did not have the ability to alter this sex disparity. Only one study had both males and females, which enabled us to perform sex difference analyses for parameters such as blood and urine electrolytes. Sample sizes Due to the nature of our study we used samples from animals that had been in spaceflight (usually as part of the ‘Rodent Research’ missions to the International Space Station) or had been taken from costly experiments using the Galactic Cosmic Radiation Simulator at Brookhaven national laboratories. We also used samples and/or data from humans who had undergone spaceflight (in historical NASA missions, Roscosmos missions, and JAXA missions to the ISS or modern commercial missions with SpaceX such as inspiration4). Our sample numbers were therefore limited to the number of samples made available to us in the original experimental designs or mission parameter limitations (restricted by practical considerations of weight to launch, available space and resource consumption). In all cases, we endeavoured to use the maximum number of biological replicates available to us to maximise experimental power. Statistics and reproducibility Omics studies This study encompassed 2 epigenomic (Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing), 9 transcriptomic (8 Bulk RNA sequencing, 1 Bulk small RNA sequencing), 7 proteomic (3 Quantitative fractionated TMT-labelled DDA LC-MS/MS, 2 Quantitative label-free SEER DIA LC-MS/MS, 1 Plasma Slow Off-Rate Modified Aptamers, 1 Shotgun LC-MS/MS), 1 epiproteomic (Quantitative fractionated TMT-labelled DDA LC-MS/MS of phospho-enriched peptides), 3 metabolomic (Quantitative label-free UHPLC-MS/MS) and 6 metagenomic (4 Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, 2 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) studies on both humans and animals. Full details of the experimental, processing and analytical methodologies and locations of publicly available raw data are given in the supplementary methods.Physiology Sample collection and processing NSRL-22A Urine collection was performed in awake mice to obtain spontaneous and uncontaminated samples. Mice were gently handled over a sheet of Saran® wrap or Parafilm® to facilitate micturition. Upon collection, each urine sample was carefully divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was immediately acidified with HNO3 to achieve a final concentration of 1% v/v, preventing precipitation of electrolytes and maintaining sample integrity. Both aliquots were then promptly stored at − 80 °C to preserve their biochemical constituents until further analysis. For blood collection, mice were subjected to terminal anaesthesia to minimise distress and ensure compliance with ethical guidelines. Blood samples were drawn from the vena cava using a fine needle and syringe. Plasma was separated by transferring the blood into Microvette® CB 300 LH (Sarstedt) tubes and centrifuging at 2000 g for 5 min. The resulting plasma supernatant was carefully aspirated and stored at − 80 °C for future analysis. Both plasma and non-acidified urine samples were analysed for creatinine levels by employing either the standard Jaffe reaction or the enzymatic method, depending on the investigator’s preference and laboratory resources. Electrolyte levels, biochemistries and biomarkers were assessed using the Siemens Dimension RxL Max Integrated Chemistry System, at the Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK. Inspiration4 Plasma samples collected from astronauts at timepoints L-92d, L-44d and L-3d were grouped and averaged into “pre-flight” for comparison against individual post-flight timepoints R + 1d, R + 45d, R + 82d and R + 194d. These samples were analysed by Quest Diagnostics using the Comprehensive metabolic panel [CMP; CPT code 80053]. NASA A historical collection of archived astronaut frozen plasma and urine aliquots were collected and stored at − 80 °C over many years. Clinical chemistries, endocrine profiles and biomarkers were obtained at the Nutritional Biochemistry Laboratory at NASA Johnson Space Center. Timepoints L-180d and L-45d were grouped and averaged as “pre-flight” for comparison to individual timepoints L + 15d, L + 30d, L + 60d, L + 120d, L + 180d, R + 0d and R + 30d.Functional calculations Functional calculations used in the data analysis are fully detailed in the supplementary methods.Imaging Sample fixation and processing Mouse kidney samples were harvested and fixed through immersion in freshly prepared 4% (w/v) formaldehyde-PBS solution (pH 6.9) for 16 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the samples were washed three times with PBS with 0.02% Na-Azide and stored at 4 °C until they were embedded in paraffin.Histopathology and Brightfield WSI 2-3 µm FFPE sections from NSRL-22A kidneys were prepared, deparaffinised using Histoclear (National Diagnostics), and rehydrated through a series of graded methanol steps. These were then stained for either Haematoxylin and Eosin (#ab245880, Abcam) or Masson’s Trichrome (#ab150686, Abcam) according to the manufacturers guidelines. Sections underwent brightfield whole slide imaging with 20X objective tiled and stitched focus stacks taken for each section on a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner. The resultant images were viewed in QuPath (v0.4.3) and semi-quantitatively scored for any histopathological findings.Immunostaining and confocal WSI 5 µm FFPE sections from RR-10 kidneys were prepared, deparaffinised using Histoclear (National Diagnostics), and rehydrated through a series of graded methanol steps. Antigen retrieval was performed using [1X] R-Universal buffer (AP0530) in a 2100 antigen retriever for a single heat-pressure cycle (Aptum Biologics). Sections were then permeabilized with 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100-PBS solution for 20 minutes and incubated with Section Block ‘ready-to-use’ (AP0471; Aptum Biologics) for 30 mins at RT. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C for 16 hours at specified concentrations (see supplementary methods), diluted in Antibody Diluent ‘FF/PE Sections’ (AP0472; Aptum Biologics). For phospho-specific antibodies, 10 μg/ml of the non-phospho peptide used to raise the antibody was added per 2 μg/ml of the antibody used. Negative control samples omitted the primary antibody and were processed simultaneously. Following incubation, slides were washed by dipping slides 50x times in 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100-PBS for 3 rounds, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at RT. Pre-absorbed fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies were utilised at specified concentrations (concentrations (see supplementary methods), diluted in Antibody Diluent ‘FF/PE Sections’ (AP0472; Aptum Biologics). After washing, slides were mounted using Prolong Gold antifade (#P36930, Life Technologies), permitted to cure for 48-72hrs, sealed with CoverGrip Coverslip Sealant (#23005; Biotium) and protected from light exposure. Immunofluorescent images were captured using either a Zeiss LSM700 LED laser-scanning confocal microscope or Leica SP8 white-light laser-scanning confocal microscope using 488-nm, 555-nm and 639-nm laser lines, employing a 10X/0.3NA (Zeiss) or 10X/0.5NA (Leica) objective. Zeiss acquisition parameters included single field of view, 8-bit resolution, 1844 x 1844 pixels, 1x digital zoom, 3.85µs pixel dwell time, 4-line Kalman filtering, sequential (by line) channel imaging, and a 4-slice z-stack with a 6 µm thickness to account for chromatic aberration. Leica acquisition parameters included tile scanning with a 10% overlap, 8-bit resolution, 1024 × 1024 pixels, 0.75x digital zoom, 600 Hz scan speed, 6-line Kalman filtering, sequential (by line) channel imaging, and a 3-slice z-stack with a 5 µm thickness to account for chromatic aberration. Images were processed using FIJI image analysis software (v.1.53p). Fluorescent z-stacks underwent background subtraction (200 px radius rolling ball) and maximum intensity z-projection. Brightness and contrast adjustments were made using linear histogram stretching to enhance visibility.miRNA in situ hybridisation and brightfield WSI FFPE blocks for BNL-3 kidneys were trimmed to remove tissue exposed to air, and fresh 5 µm sections were taken. These were not baked onto the slide and stored with desiccant instead. Samples were then processed using the miRNAscope™ HD RED assay (#324531 and #324500, ACD-Biotechne) with the FFPE tissue section workflow according to the manufacturers guidelines. miRNAscope™ Probes against the following were used: mmu-miR-125b-5p (#1082311-S1), mmu-let-7a-5p (#727761-S1) and mmu-miR-16-5p (729031-S1). Sections underwent brightfield whole slide imaging with 20X objective tiled and stitched focus stacks (with extended depth of focus) taken for each section on a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner. Using QuPath (v0.4.3) the cortex, outer stripe of the outer medulla, inner stripe of the outer medulla and inner medulla were manually annotated with the aid of a Wacom cintiq pro 32 to create a segmentation mask of the anatomical regions for area calculation. Ilastik (v1.4.0)65 automated (supervised) pixel-level classification was then trained to identify positive miRNAscope probe staining. A custom in-house python script was then used to count all positive staining and calculate the area of all anatomical regions, so that the density of each miRNA per unit area of each region could be determined for each kidney section.Optical clearing and 3D imaging Tissue transformation, delipidation and refractive index matching Quartered formaldehyde-fixed kidneys from RR-10 mice were tissue transformed using the SHIELD protocol66 and reagents from Lifecanvas technologies (MA, USA) based on (10.1038/nbt.4281). SHIELD-transformed kidneys were delipidated (Lifecanvas Technologies; Full Passive Pipeline Protocol v4.06) for approximately 10–14 days at 37 °C in 40 mL of passive delipidation buffer with gentle agitation in EasyClear device. Following delipidation, tissues were washed in several rounds of PBS at 37˚C overnight to remove any delipidation buffer. Before imaging tissues were immersed in Incubated in EasyIndex RI 1.53 refractive index matching solution as per protocol. Tissues were then embedded in 2% w/v ultra-low melting point agarose (Sigma A5030) blocks made up with EasyIndex solution to immobilise the samples. These were then stored in EasyIndex in airtight containers shielded from light prior to imaging. MesoSPIM imaging Samples were mounted in quartz cuvettes and immersion oil with refractive indices matching that of EasyIndex, and then suspended and aligned for light-sheet fluorescence imaging with a MesoSPIM67. Images were captured at 16-bit for 1-channel dual laser lightsheet illumination (488 nm excitations) to obtain autofluorescence emissions at 2048 x 2048 pixels in the XY, with a Z depth range of 700-1200 pixels, giving a pixel resolution of 3.26 μm (XY) and 4.0 μm (Z). Image analysis To evaluate any qualitative changes in gross morphology images were imported into Syglass68 (v.1.7.2-79; https://www.syglass.io/; RRID: SCR_017961) for visual investigation by nephrologists and histopathologists in 3D virtual space using Meta Quest 2 VR headsets. Images were also imported into Imaris69(v10.0) for visualisation on a Wacom cintiq pro 32” 4 K touchscreen monitor. 3D video renders were later generated with Syglass (v.2.0.0) and Z-slice video created with FIJI (ImageJ; v.1.54 h).Morphometry Normalised kidney weights PI and NASA GeneLab records for all animals included in the study were examined for bodyweight and kidney wet weight measurements. Only BNL-1, BNL-2, BNL-3 and RR-23 missions had complete kidney and body weight information available. Where available, the weights of both left and right kidneys were averaged, and the kidney weights were normalised against bodyweight for the same animal and expressed as a percentage. All ground control and sham animals that received no exposure treatment were grouped into control for pairwise comparisons against GCR (animals that only received either full or simplified galactic cosmic radiation simulations) or MG (animals that only underwent hindlimb unloading microgravity simulation) or GCR + MG (animals that underwent a combination of GCR and MG or were exposed to spaceflight).Histomorphometry Whole slide images of tiled immunofluorescent confocal images taken from RR-10 were used for analysis. Using QuPath (v0.4.3) the cortex was manually annotated with the aid of a Wacom cintiq pro 32 to create a segmentation mask of the anatomical region for area calculation. Similarly distal convoluted tubules (DCT) labelled with antibodies against total NCC / phospho-NCC (see supplementary methods for details), the canonical DCT marker, were annotated. Initially, only a handful of tubules were annotated from each slide, and these were then used to train Ilastik (v1.4.0)65 for automated (supervised) pixel-level classification of DCTs. These were then further manually refined to remove/include any false-positive/negatives. A custom in-house python script was then used to compute the number of discrete tubules positive for DCT markers, the corresponding area of each of these as well as the total cortex area, such that average tubule area and DCT density per area of cortex could be determined for each kidney section.

    "results": "Results Primary changes in kidney function increase the risk of spaceflight-induced nephrolithiasis We analysed urinary and plasma parameters of interest for nephrolithiasis in 66 astronauts that stayed on the International Space Station (ISS) for up to 180 days. Values were analysed across time, including before, during and after flight. Our data showed an increased urinary excretion of metabolites and electrolytes that are considered risk factors for nephrolithiasis (Fig. 2). In the figure, urinary excretion of calcium is expressed as fractional excretion (FECa). In the absence of plasma calcium abnormalities FECa should be < 1%; in astronauts, FECa increases significantly during flight. This urinary abnormality normalises on return to Earth (Fig. 2). A less significant increase was seen in oxalate, phosphate, uric acid urinary excretion during spaceflight, all rapidly decreasing at return with some parameters transiently overcorrecting. Urinary citrate did not significantly change and remained within the normal range. There was also a decrease in urinary volume during spaceflight and an increase in urinary osmolality (Fig. 2). Urinary electrolytes (chloride, sodium and potassium) remained stable during spaceflight compared to pre-flight with the exception of magnesium that, although within the normal range, significantly increased (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 1A). Calculated values including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), aldosterone:renin ratio, FE for urinary electrolytes and water, transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) and the ratio of tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate (TmP) to GFR can be found in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1A, B. In addition, Supplementary Fig. 1C shows plasma values from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. Although these astronauts only spent 3 days in space, there was a degree of eGFR instability detected several months after returning to Earth. Fig. 2.

FGF-23 fibroblast growth factor-23.Although, most of the metabolite changes support the emergence of pro-lithogenic profile during spaceflight, they do not entirely explain the increased risk of nephrolithiasis in astronauts, suggesting that there might be other previously unidentified mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon. To investigate this, we initially explored RR-10 spaceflight mouse kidney tissue epiproteomic data to infer functional changes. Post-translational modifications of channels, transporters and pumps can alter their activity, and chief among these is phosphorylation status for which we noted several thousand significantly altered phosphosites (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Data 1), suggesting a general increase in phosphatase and decrease in kinase activities (Fig. 3b). In particular, two of the most dramatically dephosphorylated proteins were the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), encoded by SLC12A3, expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (and validated by phospho-specific antibody staining in Fig. 3c) and furosemide-sensitive Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2), encoded by SLC12A1, expressed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (Fig. 3a). These transporters requires phosphorylation of key residues at their N-terminus for activation20, and NKCC2 is regulated by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and genetic (i.e., Bartter syndrome) or pharmacological (e.g., furosemide) impairment of NKCC2 leads to hypercalciuria, and is associated with nephrolithiasis. Whereas changes in NCC activity can lead to alterations in calcium handling and bone mineral density. Fig. 3. Spaceflight-induced changes in the kidney phosphoproteome. Open in a new tab a Volcano plot of differentially phosphorylated amino acid residues detected in phosphopeptide-enriched kidney protein extract from RR-10 spaceflight-exposed mice (28 days). Regulatory phosphosites in transporters and channels related to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule are highlighted. Green indicates a statistically significant increase in peptide phosphorylation, magenta indicates a decrease, and grey represents no significant change. An unadjusted two-tailed -Log10(Adjusted P-value) of 1.3 was considered statistically significant (indicated by the dashed line intersecting the x-axis).

Bars in blue represent downregulated activity and those in red represent upregulated activity. An adjusted P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are mean SEM. An FDR of 5% was used as a cutoff. N = 10 biologically independent animals per group (flight vs ground control). 4257 single-site phosphopeptides (Ser/Thr/Tyr) were used as initial input, 495 of which were matched to known kinase/phosphatase targets, that were then used to calculate respective predicted kinase/phosphatase activities. Input and results files for this can be found at OSD 466.c Representative confocal images of RR-10 spaceflight-exposed mice (28 days) kidney sections [n = 7 spaceflight / n = 10 ground control) stained with an anti-NCC pT44, pT48 & pT53 antibody (green; pNCC) and a total NCC antibody (magenta; tNCC) to visualise NCC phosphorylation-dependent activation (green and magenta overlap will appear as white); 50 µm scale bar.To look for corroborating evidence of primary changes in renal function, we analysed plasma and kidney tissue multi-omic data from human and mouse samples (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 2) for disease ontologies related to kidney stone formation. The nephrolithiasis and related ontologies were heavily represented across different datasets, providing orthogonal confirmation of real changes in the gene products comprising this ontology for spaceflight conditions vs controls. For example, α-tubulin (TUB1A1) is known to protect against cell-crystal adhesion21 but is decreased across multiple kidney datasets in our study (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 3). In contrast, hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria ontologies were scantily represented, implying that standard terrestrial causes of dysregulated urinary calcium and oxalate were not particularly enriched and therefore not strongly implicated in kidney stone formation.

Open in a new tab a Multi-omic over-representation analysis of DisGeNET gene-disease associations related to nephrolithiasis. To integrate datasets from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules (e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites, isoforms, CpG sites).

Open in a new tab Categorical heatmap of a, upregulated and b, downregulated gene products in exposure groups (e.g. spaceflight, GCRsim) compared to control groups (e.g. ground control, sham). To integrate datasets from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules (e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites, isoforms, CpG sites). These differentially regulated gene products (DRGP) were ranked and represented in descending order using the following rules: (1) only DRGPs with a P-value < 0.05 by Wald test were counted as significant and plotted; (2) Each DRGP was assigned a score of +1 each time it was upregulated or −1 each time it was downregulated; (3) only DRGPs observed in proteome and transcriptome kidney-specific datasets were used for the calculation of the ranking score to avoid confounders, although additional datasets (epiproteome, epigenome and those from plasma/exosomes sources) were plotted for visualisation comparison purposes; (4) The resulting sum of scores for each DRGP was then calculated and multiplied by the number of times the DRGP was observed in the kidney-specific proteome and transcriptome datasets; (5) To increase confidence only DRGPs with a product score of absolute value 9 or higher (but excluding a score of 12) were plotted as these will have a directionality consensus of at least 3 datasets above the number of disagreeing datasets.The directional changes in nephrolithiasis-related faecal microbiome abundances between spaceflight and ground controls are illustrated in (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Data 4). Overall, these microbiota changes paint a mixed picture with some changes expected to confer a protective profile against nephrolithiasis and others tending to contribute to increased risk, implying that the increased urinary oxalate excretion is unlikely to be primarily diet or microbiota-dependent. Nevertheless, whole faecal microbiome KEGG analysis shows some enrichment of glyoxalate (a precursor to oxalate) and arginine metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 3). Pathway analysis of novel plasma metabolomic data from humans and rodents under spaceflight conditions (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Data 5) shows a striking over-representation of Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis metabolic pathways. Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis is the ubiquitous housekeeping process of charging amino acids to their cognate tRNAs and providing the substrates for global protein synthesis. In addition to this canonical function, it has become clear that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes including angiogenesis, inflammation, translational control and post translational modification22–24. Arginine metabolism has been implicated in toxic nephrolithiasis25 and glycerophospholipids are the main lipid component of cell membranes and pathway enrichment is compatible with remodelling events (reviewed by Han26). Citric Acid Cycle pathway is common to many metabolomic analyses of oxalosis. Structural remodelling of the nephron occurs within a month of spaceflight exposure To investigate whether renal remodelling was occurring in spaceflight, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis across 24 datasets obtained from 2 human and 13 rodent spaceflight missions and 2 rodent GCR simulation experiments. The datasets were epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic. GO pathways (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Data 6) that are repeatedly significantly enriched across the datasets are compatible with remodelling events occurring in the kidney, these include regulation of cell adhesion, actin filament organisation, epithelial tube morphogenesis and renal system development pathways.

Proteomic analysis of urine from the Russian Roscosmos human spaceflight mission (Fig. 6c) shows extracellular matrix (ECM) and lipid-turnover related proteins that were enriched 7 days after spaceflight compared to baseline. These include Fibronectin (FN1; involved in the organisation of the ECM), Cathepsin B (CTSB; maintains turnover of glomerular basement membrane27), Apolipoprotein H (APOH; which binds to cell surface phospholipids) and Proactivator Polypeptide (PSAP; involved in the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids). Notable among these are Nidogen-1 (NID1; a key part of the nephron basement membrane) and Podocalyxin (PODXL; a major constituent of the glycocalyx of podocytes in the glomerulus) which are two of the most frequently downregulated gene products across kidney datasets in our study (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 3). To determine the extent of any potential structural remodelling, we looked for macroscopic changes in GCR and/or microgravity exposed rodent kidneys. Much like Elger and co-workers11, who found an increase in kidney weight of 30% in chronically potassium depleted animals, we found that microgravity (simulated) and microgravity+GCR (real and simulated) exposed animals had significantly greater kidney weights (relative to bodyweight) than control animals (Fig. 7a). Fig. 7. Anatomical evidence for spaceflight-induced nephron remodelling. Open in a new tab a Morphometry of kidney mass was assessed by wet weights in 1 G, the weight of both left and right kidneys were averaged, and the kidney weights were normalised against bodyweight (BW) for the same animal and expressed as a percentage. All ground control and sham animals that received no exposure treatment were grouped into control. Animals that only received either full or simplified galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) simulations were grouped into GCR. Animals that only underwent hindlimb unloading microgravity simulation were grouped into microgravity (MG). Animals that underwent a combination of GCR and MG, or were exposed to spaceflight, were grouped into GCR + MG. Data are presented as mean ± SD.

Data are mean ± SD. P-value of 0.05 by students t-test was considered significant. N = 10 biologically independent animals per group. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To establish that these changes weren’t merely due to alterations in extracellular fluid content, quantitative and qualitative histomorphometry was performed on mouse kidneys from the RR-10 spaceflight mission. Samples were stained for the canonical distal convoluted tubule marker Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC; encoded by SLC12A3), as this segment is known to be the most plastic in the nephron. Our data suggest that RR-10 mice have chronic dephosphorylation of NCC in addition to potentially altered basolateral potassium handling via Kir4.1/5.1 and KCC4, both of which are known to induce distal convoluted tubule remodelling12,28 (Fig. 3a, c; Supplementary Data 1). Qualitative assessment of 3D images of optically cleared tissues revealed no obvious lesions or anatomical abnormalities (See videos in Supplementary Movie 1 & 2). However, quantitative analysis of distal convoluted tubules revealed that spaceflight led to a reduction in tubule density, but that these retained tubules had a larger average size, demonstrating tubular segment remodelling (Fig. 7b, c). Multi-omic analyses reveal convergent disease pathways induced by spaceflight To understand the common processes occurring across the multiple human and rodent, spaceflight and GCR exposed missions, omics data were analysed against DisGeNET, KEGG and GO databases. Significantly enriched kidney-relevant disease ontologies that were reproduced in our diverse cohort of datasets were plotted in Fig. 8 for DisGeNET (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 2). Fig. 8. Biomolecular evidence for spaceflight-induced kidney damage. Open in a new tab A curated list of enriched gene-disease associations are presented for DisGeNET ontological terms relevant to kidney health. These were ranked and represented in descending order using the following rules: 1) No. of mission datasets it replicated in; 2) most significant P-value; 3) greatest enrichment. To integrate datasets from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules (e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites, isoforms, CpG sites). An unadjusted, two-tailed Log10(P-value) of 2 was considered significant for ontological term enrichment. Enrichment ratio; the number of differentially regulated hits in a dataset that belong to a given ontological term, normalised to the total number of statistically significant hits in the respective dataset.Many of the same ontologies are represented in both the spaceflight and simulated GCR experiments. Ontologies that are particularly enriched include amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous glomerulonephritis, reflecting the presence of acute phase and inflammatory gene products in addition to the profibrotic and cell death gene products represented in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, renal fibrosis and renal insufficiency ontologies. The heavily enriched peripheral vascular disease and endothelial damage ontologies reflect the known endothelial and microvascular damage marker gene products enriched across the multiple GCR and spaceflight datasets. Mitochondrial diseases are enriched in the proteomics datasets of kidney tissues (Fig. 8) and is further supported by the enrichment of ontologies relating to mitochondrial suborganellular structures, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, cellular senescence, HIF-1 and TNFα signalling in GO (Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Data 6) and KEGG (Supplementary Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 7) over-representation analyses. Mitochondria may also be showing signs of stress-induced fusion (Supplementary Fig. 6), although future studies would be needed to specifically address changes in mitochondria morphology. As a final step we used the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE)29 knowledge graph tool which is capable of integrating heterogeneous datasets from various biological levels, assay modalities, tissue types, organisms and experimental conditions to validate our findings (Supplementary Fig. 7). A GCR exposure with a dose-equivalent to a Mars roundtrip induces renal damage and dysfunction LEO spaceflight mission participants are exposed to comparatively low doses of GCR due to the protection provided by Earth’s magnetic field. Therefore, to disentangle the impacts of GCR from microgravity and evaluate the consequence of unmitigated GCR exposure, we examined tissues that had only been exposed to simulated GCR. To do this we utilised NASA’s ground-based GCR simulator at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where animals either had an acute exposure to a ~ 1.5-year dose-equivalent (0.5 Gy) in the simplified 6-beam/5-ion GCR simulator followed by rapid 24 h sacrifice (BNL experiments) or were given an acute exposure to a ~ 2.5-year dose-equivalent (0.75 Gy) in the full 33-beam/7-ion GCR simulator with sacrifice at 6 months post-exposure (NSRL-22A experiment). Pathogenic serum miRNA species have been previously implicated to mediate tissue damage in spaceflight30, and GCR is a plausible pathogenic factor. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of plasma miRNAs revealed three clusters that generally trended downward in BNL-1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, investigation of miRNA predicted mRNA targets and DisGeNET analysis of these targets suggested that these circulating miRNAs would be minor players in the context of renal damage in the acute setting (Supplementary Data 8). Retaining biomolecular information within the gross and micro-anatomical context is important, especially when highly heterogenous tissues like the kidney (Fig. 9a). So, we next performed in situ hybridisation (RNAScope) and quantitative whole slide imaging to ascertain the presence and density of these pathogenic miRNAs in kidney tissues of BNL-3 mice. miR-125b was significantly increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) (Fig. 9b), particularly in the vascular compartment (arrows) which corresponds to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the thin descending limb of the loop and the medullary collecting duct. miR-16 has a similar pattern of distribution and differential expression but fails to reach significance (Supplementary Fig. 9). These miRNA species are implicated in vascular damage and the ISOM is also the site of the vascular bundle31, a complex structure which is the bottleneck of all blood flow to and from the inner medulla. Additionally, mRNA target prediction, KEGG and DisGeNET analysis of miR-125b and miR-16 suggest that these may mediate cell senescence, apoptosis, TGFβ signalling and oncogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 9).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further understand the effect of simulated GCR on the segment-specific cell types of the kidney’s nephron (Fig. 9a), we performed 2D spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq32) on BNL-1 GCR-exposed renal tissue. Cell types were inferred using a published renal cell atlas33, which were mapped onto individual data points which accurately reproduced anatomy (Fig. 9c). Individual significant transcriptional changes in specific cell types were then examined and top hits were analysed by KEGG and DisGeNET (Fig. 9d; Supplementary Data 10). Interestingly, immunoglobulin components were among the hits overexpressed by loop of Henle cells, presumably reflecting increased B-cell activity in the interstitium as supported by enrichment of the KEGG pathway for “leukocyte transendothelial migration” (Supplementary Data 10). SGK1 transcriptional activity was decreased in proximal convoluted and straight tubule cells (Fig. 9d). SGK1 is a master regulator of multiple epithelial membrane transporters, including canonical segment specific transporters. The data also support disruption of circadian rhythm in several tubule segments via Cytochrome-1 and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 (also known as Rev-Erbɑ; encoded by NR1D1)34 (Fig. 9d), and hits on KEGG and DisGeNET (Supplementary Data 10). When it comes to damage markers, again the proximal straight tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle appear to be the most impacted, with decrease in ALAS1, and increases in ANGPT2 and KRT18 all prognostically poor for renal outcomes35–37 (Fig. 9d). From a radiobiological perspective, the kidney is considered a late-responding tissue, and studies spanning at least 1-2 years may be required to appreciate the full impact of chronic GCR exposure on kidney health38. Although, some features of radiation-induced nephropathy and sub-clinical manifestations can emerge in < 6 months post-irradiation. To investigate this, serial tissue sections from NSRL-22A mice were histochemically stained for routine examination of potential kidney damage (haematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome stain, Martius Scarlet Blue) were examined by a blinded expert histopathologist (Fig. 10a).

To confirm this, we quantitated the fractional interstitial area in the PAS stains which showed no difference between groups (mean 6.10% ± 2.10 vs 6.16% ± 2.27. p = 0.9623). As previously reported, first signs of fibrosis or calcifications may not present until after 6 months38, and therefore NSRL-22A may be too short a period to observe these disease features, despite significant enrichment of fibrosis-related DisGeNET ontologies in the kidney proteomics from the same animals (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 2). However, consistent with radiation-induced nephropathy, overt thrombotic microangiopathy was detected in GCR exposed tissues from 27% (3/11) female animals, and 0% (0/12) male animals. None was seen in tissue from sham exposed animals (Fig. 10a). Given the biomolecular and histopathological signs of renal injury, we then looked for functional evidence of glomerular, proximal tubular and distal tubular dysfunction. Urinary and plasma biochemical analyses (Fig. 10b; Supplementary Fig. 10) showed significantly greater urinary protein excretion in GCR vs sham animals, consistent with a glomerular lesion or proximal tubule dysfunction, the latter supported by the reduction in the endocytic receptor megalin (LRP2) which normally reabsorbs proteins that escape into the ultrafiltrate (Fig. 5). There was a slight increase in urinary glucose, which is a highly specific, but not very sensitive marker of proximal tubular dysfunction in non-diabetic animals. While this did not reach significance (p = 0.1198), there was significant downregulation of sodium-glucose linked transporter, SGLT1 (SLC5A1) (Fig. 5), that would be consistent with proximal tubule dysfunction. Finally, there was significantly greater magnesiuria in GCR exposed animals, consistent with downregulated magnesium reabsorption in the loop of Henle or the distal convoluted tubule.",
    "discussion": "Discussion We have presented a large volume of data encompassing both human and rodent data, extant and novel multi-omics datasets, historical and extant clinical chemistry and novel imaging data from 16 spaceflight missions and 4 GCR exposures to examine the effect of spaceflight on kidney function. Tubular remodelling, by which we mean structural and functional adaptation of the tubular nephron to environmental stimuli, is a well described yet underappreciated phenomenon. Tubular remodelling occurs not only in response to genetic modification of signal pathways39, but also chronic diuretic exposure40, kidney injury41, and both chronic11 and acute42 hypokalaemia. These changes occur rapidly, within 3 days of diet induced hypokalaemia12. Our data robustly and orthogonally supports tubular remodelling occurring in microgravity with and without GCR. This is highly likely to have functional consequences, as tubular remodelling does in other scenarios39. Renal remodelling in microgravity (possibly related to the cephalad fluid shift) may therefore be a primary event that causes subsequent dysregulation of serum and urine electrolyte homeostasis. This is supported by the prompt return to baseline of humans on return to terrestrial gravity. Changes in urinary biochemistry are known to be critical in the pathogenesis of kidney stone formation; a condition that occurs disproportionally commonly in astronauts, and that is potentially mission critical. The increased risk for nephrolithiasis in space has been historically attributed to the negative impact of microgravity on bone mineral density that leads to increased resorption of bone, release of calcium salts in the bloodstream, increased renal load and therefore increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate6,8. Our historical data (from 66 astronauts) confirms hypercalciuria, and the phosphoproteomic data shows decreased phosphorylation of NKCC2 (SLC12A1), which will cause decreased paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations in the loop of Henle, and thus renal calcium and magnesium wasting. Hypocitraturia was not observed; this is in line with previous observations by Pietryzk et al. of an approximate rate of 14% of hypocitraturia during spaceflight6, and Whitson et al. who found no significant hypocitraturia8. Hyperoxaluria also occurs during spaceflight. Oxalate is freely filtered by the glomerulus and almost entirely excreted in the urine. Increased urinary oxalate reflects increased plasma oxalate load that could come from either increased endogenous liver production or increased absorption by the gut. The latter could be caused by several conditions such as increased dietary oxalate, malabsorptive conditions or altered microbiome. Dietary data were not available, and we assumed an absence of malabsorptive conditions. However, we do know that spaceflight affects the gut microbiome43. Metagenomic analysis of the microbiome showed that in the highest quality faecal microbiome dataset (namely RR-23) Oxalobacter sp., the bacterium primarily responsible for oxalate metabolism44, increases during spaceflight. Bacteroides, a bacterium that was found to be increased in stone formers45, and Bifidobacterium, a pro-biotic able to metabolise oxalate in the gut46, were enriched and depleted in spaceflight respectively. It is difficult, based on low replicability of data to ascribe a primary, or even secondary microbiome-related aetiology for increased stone formation in spaceflight. Proposed interventions to prevent potential mission critical kidney stone formation in spaceflight include increasing urine output by maximising oral fluid intake47, oral potassium citrate48 (or potassium magnesium citrate49) supplementation and inflight management, including ureteral stenting50 and lithotripsy51. While these are sensible and may indeed be effective, none deal with the hypercalciuria that has been consistently shown in human space travellers. Oral or parenteral bisphosphonates have been used with some success52. Further, thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium excretion53 (possibly by ECV contraction causing increased proximal tubular calcium reabsorption54) and reduce age related bone mineral density loss55, and could represent a “two birds with one stone” therapeutic option. Could the dephosphorylation of NKCC2 guide us toward a therapeutic target to reduce spaceflight induced hypercalciuria? NKCC2 activity is modulated by the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) via phosphorylation56, and calcilytics (CaSR antagonists), well tolerated but disappointing agents in their utility for treating terrestrial osteoporosis57, might be one potential avenue to manipulate NKCC2 activity to ameliorate spaceflight induced hypercalciuria. Abnormal water homeostasis has been noted in astronauts since the early days of spaceflight, with a marked reduction in both diuresis and natriuresis with vasopressin dysregulation via unknown mechanisms1–3. In fact, the reduced NKCC2 activity would conversely be anticipated to enhance diuresis, much like a loop diuretic. In this context, downregulation of prostaglandin transporters (PGT; encoded by SLCO2A1), a result seen in multiple of our proteomic and transcriptomic datasets (Fig. 5), is intriguing and may offer a way to reconcile this paradox. As carriers of a gain-of-function mutation of SLCO2A158, see a reduction in PGT activity in the proximal straight tubule and the cortical collecting duct which colocalises with Aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Loss of PGT-mediated reabsorption by collecting duct principal cells, causes a subsequent build-up in the luminal concentration of the prostaglandin PGE2, which stimulates apical prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (EP4) receptors to activate Aquaporin-2 and inappropriate water reabsorption. In our study the loss of NKCC2 activity through dephosphorylation and reduction of PGT abundance can offset each other. Tubular remodelling in spaceflight raises another, interesting question; is the hypercalciuria seen in spaceflight a consequence or cause of spaceflight related loss of bone mineral density (BMD)? We know that primary renal phenomena associated with tubular remodelling (e.g. genetic inactivation of SLC12A1 in Bartter syndrome59 or chronic furosemide exposure60) can cause a loss of BMD as a consequence of the primary hypercalciuria. This implies that renally targeted therapies (e.g. thiazides, calcilytics) will be effective. There does appear to be a synergistic effect of microgravity and GCR on BMD loss; GCR does have primary bone effects, increasing osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in rodents16, so bone targeted countermeasures will still be relevant. The kidney is a key microvascular end-organ and microvascular disease appears to be one of the main consequences of GCR exposure30. We concur with this view: vascular disease and endothelial dysfunction disease ontologies were highly enriched across omics datasets (Fig. 8). Consistent with this, the arginine biosynthesis pathway was highly enriched across our human and mouse datasets (Fig. 4c), there was a significantly increased amount of pathogenic miR-125b in the highly vascular ISOM (Fig. 9b) and as a likely consequence of this microvascular pathology, we observed incidences of thrombotic microangiopathy on histopathological examination (Fig. 10a). In addition to this, pathophysiological macrovascular changes are a well-documented consequence of microgravity, with 6 months in space shown to induce ~ 20 years of vascular ageing through arterial stiffening61. The resultant loss of vascular elasticity, and thus buffering capacity, leads to elevated transmission of blood flow and pressure pulsatility to the microvasculature. Long-term, this can cause barotrauma or oxidative stress to renal microvasculature due to suboptimal perfusion, especially as the myogenic response of the afferent arteriole is to vasoconstrict and provide resistance (and thus reduce flow) in the face of excessive pulsatile pressure62. Indeed arterial stiffness and CKD are strongly associated, and it is thought that one begets the other in a positive feedback loop63. Taken together with the general drop in blood pressure experienced by astronauts64, exposure to spaceflight long-term places the kidney in an impossible position whereby it must choose whether to defend renal perfusion or the health of its microvasculature. If the arterioles dilate to enhance blood flow, they leave the microvasculature open to damage from unbuffered pressure waves on top of the radiation damage caused by GCR. Whereas if they constrict to provide protection to the microvasculature, they reduce blood flow and therefore oxygen supply to the renal tubules, which further compounds and exacerbates the chronic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction from GCR bombardment. This study is the largest to ever look at the effect of spaceflight on kidney function. We have demonstrated that there is renal structural and functional remodelling likely caused by microgravity, probably synergistically with GCR. We have shown that this remodelling is a potential driver of kidney stone formation and many of the changes in the urinary biochemistry of humans and animals experienced by those exposed to LEO spaceflight. We have also shown that acute exposure to simulated GCR causes both acute and chronic tubular epithelial and vascular damage that appears both progressive and irreversible. However, our study has several limitations. We have necessarily relied on human (mostly male) and animal (mostly female) data from missions which were exposed to microgravity for relatively short periods of time compared to the projected length of a Mars mission, and only in LEO, which also limited the amount of GCR and other space radiation that they were exposed to. Additionally, our simulated GCR experiments only looked at acute unfractionated dosing, which may not accurately model the chronic cumulative exposure that would happen on a Mars mission. Therefore, in the absence of experiments that can more accurately model the long-term simultaneous exposure to full GCR and microgravity over several years, and the plausible synergistic impact of these insults, our results should be taken a conservative glimpse into the potential dire health consequences of long-term deep space travel. Much more intensive study of the health impacts of spaceflight on the kidneys and other visceral organs that have received little attention is of the utmost importance if we are to develop mitigation strategies and send humans to other planets and beyond.",

Yet the health consequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceflight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts’ increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR. Subject terms: Nephrons, Renal calculi, Thrombotic microangiopathies, Sequencing, Mass spectrometry Siew et al. using multi-omic, physiological & imaging approaches have demonstrated that spaceflight causes kidney remodelling, suggesting a contribution to kidney stone formation, & that space radiation causes kidney damage & early signs of dysfunction.Introduction The renewed zeitgeist for space travel, ushered in by the advent of commercial spaceflight and tourism, has spurred on state-funded agencies to embark on even more ambitious exploratory ‘Deep Space’ missions. The first of these, namely the Artemis Program, Lunar Gateway space station and later the Deep Space Transport/Mars Missions, will for the first-time place humans outside of Earth’s protective magnetic field exposed to significant quantities of unmitigated space radiation and weightlessness for many months to years at a time. The health effects of low Earth orbit (LEO) spaceflight (e.g. the International Space Station) are multiple, with much of the research communities’ intense focus centred on the musculoskeletal, neurological, ocular and cardiovascular degeneration that can manifest as early as a few weeks into a mission. Notably, the effects of LEO spaceflight on many other organ systems are less clear, with indispensable organs such as the kidneys receiving relatively little attention in the absence of overt symptoms. However, in the face of extended periods of deep space travel health issues may only present with late onset due to cloaked subclinical pathophysiology and chronic damage eating into the extensive functional reserves of such organs. The kidneys are critical in regulating blood pressure, by controlling both the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system (RAAS) and the reabsorption of sodium chloride and water from the urine. In microgravity, the cephalad redistribution of blood volume with the concomitant decrease in the pressure gradient should reduce kidney perfusion. In turn, a lower perfusion pressure within the renal artery should lead to a greater release of renin and activation of the RAAS. However, studies show a marked reduction of diuresis and natriuresis in space with the RAAS, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increasing through unknown mechanisms1–3. These unexplained effects, be they mediated through known homeostatic mechanisms, or more theoretical ones, such as tensegrity4, are germane to kidney stone formation (i.e. nephrolithiasis). Astronauts have an unusually high rate of kidney stone formation, with 1-year post-flight astronauts experiencing incidence rates of 2–7 times that of pre-flight estimates, and in-flight risk estimated to be double that again5. This is of mission critical significance, one Soviet in-flight renal stone episode nearly caused a mission termination due to the severe symptoms, but was relieved by spontaneous stone passage by the cosmonaut just before an urgent deorbit was initiated6. It has been demonstrated that spaceflight associated changes in urinary biochemistry favour kidney stone formation7–9. Microgravity may have a direct effect on the crystallisation and nucleation of nascent kidney stones10, but this is dwarfed by the net biochemical urinary changes historically attributed to the microgravity-induced bone demineralisation observed in spaceflight. A school of thought that has led to a paucity of research into other pathophysiological phenomena that may be contributing to the unusually high incidence of nephrolithiasis. The kidney is a plastic organ, and is capable of dynamically remodelling the architecture of the nephron in response to changes in blood pressure or dietary potassium. An 18 day potassium-free diet resulted in a 31% increase in rat kidney weight, which was mainly seen in the medullary collecting duct11. Changes in the size of nephron segments in wild type mice have been observed using advanced imaging techniques in a period as short as three days12. So, it is plausible that spaceflight-induced shifts in fluid and electrolyte handling could precipitate maladaptive remodelling events that contribute to the underlying pathophysiology. In addition to the well-studied environmental stressor of microgravity, deep space missions beyond the protection of the geomagnetosphere (the Van Allen belts) are exposed to space radiation. Space radiation comprises both intermittent events (e.g. Solar Particle Events or Solar Proton Events) with the most energetic being a Coronal Mass Ejection and Solar Wind and Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), with GCR having the most significant health impacts. There is concern regarding the carcinogenic effect of GCR exposure in the planned Mars Missions. However, the kidney is an exquisitely radiation sensitive organ; it is the dose limiting organ in abdominal radiotherapy13. Chronic kidney dysfunction can occur with acute low linear energy transfer (LET) γ-radiation doses as low as <0.5 Gy14, the LET dose expected on a Mars Mission. However, GCR comprises low-LET x- and γ-rays with protons and high energy ‘HZE’ ions of heavier elements (e.g. silicon, titanium, iron). It has been established that exposure to HZE ions results in mitochondrial damage15,16. The renal proximal tubule is heavily dependent on mitochondrial respiration17 and is one of the main tubular segments in which damage is associated with kidney failure18. Indeed, proximal tubular injury is a prominent histological feature in medical (low-LET) radiation nephropathy19. Due to their dependence on mitochondrial aerobic respiration, proximal tubular cells are extremely vulnerable to mitochondrial damage that we would expect from HZE exposure in addition to low-LET radiation damage. We hypothesised that the biochemical urinary changes seen in spaceflight might reflect functional and morphological changes detectable in the kidney secondary to microgravity, possibly due to abnormal renal perfusion. Further, we hypothesised that GCR exposure will cause mitochondrial and therefore proximal tubular dysfunction, leading to tissue damage and potentially irreversible loss of renal function, in addition to the known micro and macrovascular damage caused by GCR. In order to explore these questions, we took a pan-omics approach incorporating anatomical and physiological parameters from 20 independent human and rodent spaceflight missions/simulations that had extant data and/or samples from which we could generate novel data (Fig. 1).

Values were analysed across time, including before, during and after flight. Our data showed an increased urinary excretion of metabolites and electrolytes that are considered risk factors for nephrolithiasis (Fig. 2). In the figure, urinary excretion of calcium is expressed as fractional excretion (FECa). In the absence of plasma calcium abnormalities FECa should be < 1%; in astronauts, FECa increases significantly during flight. This urinary abnormality normalises on return to Earth (Fig. 2). A less significant increase was seen in oxalate, phosphate, uric acid urinary excretion during spaceflight, all rapidly decreasing at return with some parameters transiently overcorrecting. Urinary citrate did not significantly change and remained within the normal range. There was also a decrease in urinary volume during spaceflight and an increase in urinary osmolality (Fig. 2). Urinary electrolytes (chloride, sodium and potassium) remained stable during spaceflight compared to pre-flight with the exception of magnesium that, although within the normal range, significantly increased (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 1A). Calculated values including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), aldosterone:renin ratio, FE for urinary electrolytes and water, transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) and the ratio of tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate (TmP) to GFR can be found in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1A, B. In addition, Supplementary Fig. 1C shows plasma values from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. Although these astronauts only spent 3 days in space, there was a degree of eGFR instability detected several months after returning to Earth. Fig. 2.

FGF-23 fibroblast growth factor-23.Although, most of the metabolite changes support the emergence of pro-lithogenic profile during spaceflight, they do not entirely explain the increased risk of nephrolithiasis in astronauts, suggesting that there might be other previously unidentified mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon. To investigate this, we initially explored RR-10 spaceflight mouse kidney tissue epiproteomic data to infer functional changes. Post-translational modifications of channels, transporters and pumps can alter their activity, and chief among these is phosphorylation status for which we noted several thousand significantly altered phosphosites (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Data 1), suggesting a general increase in phosphatase and decrease in kinase activities (Fig. 3b). In particular, two of the most dramatically dephosphorylated proteins were the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), encoded by SLC12A3, expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (and validated by phospho-specific antibody staining in Fig. 3c) and furosemide-sensitive Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2), encoded by SLC12A1, expressed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (Fig. 3a). These transporters requires phosphorylation of key residues at their N-terminus for activation20, and NKCC2 is regulated by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and genetic (i.e., Bartter syndrome) or pharmacological (e.g., furosemide) impairment of NKCC2 leads to hypercalciuria, and is associated with nephrolithiasis. Whereas changes in NCC activity can lead to alterations in calcium handling and bone mineral density. Fig. 3. Spaceflight-induced changes in the kidney phosphoproteome. Open in a new tab a Volcano plot of differentially phosphorylated amino acid residues detected in phosphopeptide-enriched kidney protein extract from RR-10 spaceflight-exposed mice (28 days).

Green indicates a statistically significant increase in peptide phosphorylation, magenta indicates a decrease, and grey represents no significant change. An unadjusted two-tailed -Log10(Adjusted P-value) of 1.3 was considered statistically significant (indicated by the dashed line intersecting the x-axis).

Bars in blue represent downregulated activity and those in red represent upregulated activity. An adjusted P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are mean SEM. An FDR of 5% was used as a cutoff. N = 10 biologically independent animals per group (flight vs ground control). 4257 single-site phosphopeptides (Ser/Thr/Tyr) were used as initial input, 495 of which were matched to known kinase/phosphatase targets, that were then used to calculate respective predicted kinase/phosphatase activities. Input and results files for this can be found at OSD 466.c Representative confocal images of RR-10 spaceflight-exposed mice (28 days) kidney sections [n = 7 spaceflight / n = 10 ground control) stained with an anti-NCC pT44, pT48 & pT53 antibody (green; pNCC) and a total NCC antibody (magenta; tNCC) to visualise NCC phosphorylation-dependent activation (green and magenta overlap will appear as white); 50 µm scale bar.To look for corroborating evidence of primary changes in renal function, we analysed plasma and kidney tissue multi-omic data from human and mouse samples (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 2) for disease ontologies related to kidney stone formation. The nephrolithiasis and related ontologies were heavily represented across different datasets, providing orthogonal confirmation of real changes in the gene products comprising this ontology for spaceflight conditions vs controls. For example, α-tubulin (TUB1A1) is known to protect against cell-crystal adhesion21 but is decreased across multiple kidney datasets in our study (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 3). In contrast, hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria ontologies were scantily represented, implying that standard terrestrial causes of dysregulated urinary calcium and oxalate were not particularly enriched and therefore not strongly implicated in kidney stone formation.

To integrate datasets from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules (e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites, isoforms, CpG sites). These differentially regulated gene products (DRGP) were ranked and represented in descending order using the following rules: (1) only DRGPs with a P-value < 0.05 by Wald test were counted as significant and plotted; (2) Each DRGP was assigned a score of +1 each time it was upregulated or −1 each time it was downregulated; (3) only DRGPs observed in proteome and transcriptome kidney-specific datasets were used for the calculation of the ranking score to avoid confounders, although additional datasets (epiproteome, epigenome and those from plasma/exosomes sources) were plotted for visualisation comparison purposes; (4) The resulting sum of scores for each DRGP was then calculated and multiplied by the number of times the DRGP was observed in the kidney-specific proteome and transcriptome datasets; (5) To increase confidence only DRGPs with a product score of absolute value 9 or higher (but excluding a score of 12) were plotted as these will have a directionality consensus of at least 3 datasets above the number of disagreeing datasets.The directional changes in nephrolithiasis-related faecal microbiome abundances between spaceflight and ground controls are illustrated in (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Data 4). Overall, these microbiota changes paint a mixed picture with some changes expected to confer a protective profile against nephrolithiasis and others tending to contribute to increased risk, implying that the increased urinary oxalate excretion is unlikely to be primarily diet or microbiota-dependent. Nevertheless, whole faecal microbiome KEGG analysis shows some enrichment of glyoxalate (a precursor to oxalate) and arginine metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 3). Pathway analysis of novel plasma metabolomic data from humans and rodents under spaceflight conditions (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Data 5) shows a striking over-representation of Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis metabolic pathways. Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis is the ubiquitous housekeeping process of charging amino acids to their cognate tRNAs and providing the substrates for global protein synthesis. In addition to this canonical function, it has become clear that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes including angiogenesis, inflammation, translational control and post translational modification22–24. Arginine metabolism has been implicated in toxic nephrolithiasis25 and glycerophospholipids are the main lipid component of cell membranes and pathway enrichment is compatible with remodelling events (reviewed by Han26). Citric Acid Cycle pathway is common to many metabolomic analyses of oxalosis.Structural remodelling of the nephron occurs within a month of spaceflight exposure To investigate whether renal remodelling was occurring in spaceflight, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis across 24 datasets obtained from 2 human and 13 rodent spaceflight missions and 2 rodent GCR simulation experiments. The datasets were epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic. GO pathways (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Data 6) that are repeatedly significantly enriched across the datasets are compatible with remodelling events occurring in the kidney, these include regulation of cell adhesion, actin filament organisation, epithelial tube morphogenesis and renal system development pathways.

Proteomic analysis of urine from the Russian Roscosmos human spaceflight mission (Fig. 6c) shows extracellular matrix (ECM) and lipid-turnover related proteins that were enriched 7 days after spaceflight compared to baseline. These include Fibronectin (FN1; involved in the organisation of the ECM), Cathepsin B (CTSB; maintains turnover of glomerular basement membrane27), Apolipoprotein H (APOH; which binds to cell surface phospholipids) and Proactivator Polypeptide (PSAP; involved in the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids). Notable among these are Nidogen-1 (NID1; a key part of the nephron basement membrane) and Podocalyxin (PODXL; a major constituent of the glycocalyx of podocytes in the glomerulus) which are two of the most frequently downregulated gene products across kidney datasets in our study (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 3). To determine the extent of any potential structural remodelling, we looked for macroscopic changes in GCR and/or microgravity exposed rodent kidneys. Much like Elger and co-workers11, who found an increase in kidney weight of 30% in chronically potassium depleted animals, we found that microgravity (simulated) and microgravity+GCR (real and simulated) exposed animals had significantly greater kidney weights (relative to bodyweight) than control animals (Fig. 7a).

Open in a new tab a Morphometry of kidney mass was assessed by wet weights in 1 G, the weight of both left and right kidneys were averaged, and the kidney weights were normalised against bodyweight (BW) for the same animal and expressed as a percentage. All ground control and sham animals that received no exposure treatment were grouped into control. Animals that only received either full or simplified galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) simulations were grouped into GCR. Animals that only underwent hindlimb unloading microgravity simulation were grouped into microgravity (MG). Animals that underwent a combination of GCR and MG, or were exposed to spaceflight, were grouped into GCR + MG. Data are presented as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA with pairwise Dunnett’s multiple comparison post-hoc tests (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). N numbers are control = 48, GCR = 30, MG = 28, MG + GCR = 39 biologically independent animals per group. b Representative confocal images showing the annotations of cortex regions (magenta borders) and distal convoluted tubules (DCT, green) in RR-10 spaceflight-exposed mice (28 days) from whole slide images of kidney sections immunolabelled with tNCC/pNCC as DCT markers. 200 µm scale bar. c Morphometric analysis of DCTs assessed the average area per tubule (top Y-axis), the density of no. of tubules per unit area of cortex (middle Y-axis), and the total summed area of all DCTs as percentage of cortex area.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To establish that these changes weren’t merely due to alterations in extracellular fluid content, quantitative and qualitative histomorphometry was performed on mouse kidneys from the RR-10 spaceflight mission. Samples were stained for the canonical distal convoluted tubule marker Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC; encoded by SLC12A3), as this segment is known to be the most plastic in the nephron. Our data suggest that RR-10 mice have chronic dephosphorylation of NCC in addition to potentially altered basolateral potassium handling via Kir4.1/5.1 and KCC4, both of which are known to induce distal convoluted tubule remodelling12,28 (Fig. 3a, c; Supplementary Data 1). Qualitative assessment of 3D images of optically cleared tissues revealed no obvious lesions or anatomical abnormalities (See videos in Supplementary Movie 1 & 2). However, quantitative analysis of distal convoluted tubules revealed that spaceflight led to a reduction in tubule density, but that these retained tubules had a larger average size, demonstrating tubular segment remodelling (Fig. 7b, c).Multi-omic analyses reveal convergent disease pathways induced by spaceflight To understand the common processes occurring across the multiple human and rodent, spaceflight and GCR exposed missions, omics data were analysed against DisGeNET, KEGG and GO databases. Significantly enriched kidney-relevant disease ontologies that were reproduced in our diverse cohort of datasets were plotted in Fig. 8 for DisGeNET (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 2). Fig. 8. Biomolecular evidence for spaceflight-induced kidney damage. Open in a new tab A curated list of enriched gene-disease associations are presented for DisGeNET ontological terms relevant to kidney health. These were ranked and represented in descending order using the following rules: 1) No. of mission datasets it replicated in; 2) most significant P-value; 3) greatest enrichment. To integrate datasets from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules (e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites, isoforms, CpG sites). An unadjusted, two-tailed Log10(P-value) of 2 was considered significant for ontological term enrichment. Enrichment ratio; the number of differentially regulated hits in a dataset that belong to a given ontological term, normalised to the total number of statistically significant hits in the respective dataset.Many of the same ontologies are represented in both the spaceflight and simulated GCR experiments. Ontologies that are particularly enriched include amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous glomerulonephritis, reflecting the presence of acute phase and inflammatory gene products in addition to the profibrotic and cell death gene products represented in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, renal fibrosis and renal insufficiency ontologies. The heavily enriched peripheral vascular disease and endothelial damage ontologies reflect the known endothelial and microvascular damage marker gene products enriched across the multiple GCR and spaceflight datasets. Mitochondrial diseases are enriched in the proteomics datasets of kidney tissues (Fig. 8) and is further supported by the enrichment of ontologies relating to mitochondrial suborganellular structures, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, cellular senescence, HIF-1 and TNFα signalling in GO (Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Data 6) and KEGG (Supplementary Fig. 5; Supplementary Data 7) over-representation analyses. Mitochondria may also be showing signs of stress-induced fusion (Supplementary Fig. 6), although future studies would be needed to specifically address changes in mitochondria morphology. As a final step we used the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE)29 knowledge graph tool which is capable of integrating heterogeneous datasets from various biological levels, assay modalities, tissue types, organisms and experimental conditions to validate our findings (Supplementary Fig. 7).A GCR exposure with a dose-equivalent to a Mars roundtrip induces renal damage and dysfunction LEO spaceflight mission participants are exposed to comparatively low doses of GCR due to the protection provided by Earth’s magnetic field. Therefore, to disentangle the impacts of GCR from microgravity and evaluate the consequence of unmitigated GCR exposure, we examined tissues that had only been exposed to simulated GCR. To do this we utilised NASA’s ground-based GCR simulator at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where animals either had an acute exposure to a ~ 1.5-year dose-equivalent (0.5 Gy) in the simplified 6-beam/5-ion GCR simulator followed by rapid 24 h sacrifice (BNL experiments) or were given an acute exposure to a ~ 2.5-year dose-equivalent (0.75 Gy) in the full 33-beam/7-ion GCR simulator with sacrifice at 6 months post-exposure (NSRL-22A experiment). Pathogenic serum miRNA species have been previously implicated to mediate tissue damage in spaceflight30, and GCR is a plausible pathogenic factor. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of plasma miRNAs revealed three clusters that generally trended downward in BNL-1 (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, investigation of miRNA predicted mRNA targets and DisGeNET analysis of these targets suggested that these circulating miRNAs would be minor players in the context of renal damage in the acute setting (Supplementary Data 8). Retaining biomolecular information within the gross and micro-anatomical context is important, especially when highly heterogenous tissues like the kidney (Fig. 9a). So, we next performed in situ hybridisation (RNAScope) and quantitative whole slide imaging to ascertain the presence and density of these pathogenic miRNAs in kidney tissues of BNL-3 mice. miR-125b was significantly increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) (Fig. 9b), particularly in the vascular compartment (arrows) which corresponds to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the thin descending limb of the loop and the medullary collecting duct. miR-16 has a similar pattern of distribution and differential expression but fails to reach significance (Supplementary Fig. 9). These miRNA species are implicated in vascular damage and the ISOM is also the site of the vascular bundle31, a complex structure which is the bottleneck of all blood flow to and from the inner medulla. Additionally, mRNA target prediction, KEGG and DisGeNET analysis of miR-125b and miR-16 suggest that these may mediate cell senescence, apoptosis, TGFβ signalling and oncogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 9).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further understand the effect of simulated GCR on the segment-specific cell types of the kidney’s nephron (Fig. 9a), we performed 2D spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq32) on BNL-1 GCR-exposed renal tissue. Cell types were inferred using a published renal cell atlas33, which were mapped onto individual data points which accurately reproduced anatomy (Fig. 9c). Individual significant transcriptional changes in specific cell types were then examined and top hits were analysed by KEGG and DisGeNET (Fig. 9d; Supplementary Data 10). Interestingly, immunoglobulin components were among the hits overexpressed by loop of Henle cells, presumably reflecting increased B-cell activity in the interstitium as supported by enrichment of the KEGG pathway for “leukocyte transendothelial migration” (Supplementary Data 10). SGK1 transcriptional activity was decreased in proximal convoluted and straight tubule cells (Fig. 9d). SGK1 is a master regulator of multiple epithelial membrane transporters, including canonical segment specific transporters. The data also support disruption of circadian rhythm in several tubule segments via Cytochrome-1 and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 (also known as Rev-Erbɑ; encoded by NR1D1)34 (Fig. 9d), and hits on KEGG and DisGeNET (Supplementary Data 10). When it comes to damage markers, again the proximal straight tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle appear to be the most impacted, with decrease in ALAS1, and increases in ANGPT2 and KRT18 all prognostically poor for renal outcomes35–37 (Fig. 9d). From a radiobiological perspective, the kidney is considered a late-responding tissue, and studies spanning at least 1-2 years may be required to appreciate the full impact of chronic GCR exposure on kidney health38. Although, some features of radiation-induced nephropathy and sub-clinical manifestations can emerge in < 6 months post-irradiation. To investigate this, serial tissue sections from NSRL-22A mice were histochemically stained for routine examination of potential kidney damage (haematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome stain, Martius Scarlet Blue) were examined by a blinded expert histopathologist (Fig. 10a).

To confirm this, we quantitated the fractional interstitial area in the PAS stains which showed no difference between groups (mean 6.10% ± 2.10 vs 6.16% ± 2.27. p = 0.9623). As previously reported, first signs of fibrosis or calcifications may not present until after 6 months38, and therefore NSRL-22A may be too short a period to observe these disease features, despite significant enrichment of fibrosis-related DisGeNET ontologies in the kidney proteomics from the same animals (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 2). However, consistent with radiation-induced nephropathy, overt thrombotic microangiopathy was detected in GCR exposed tissues from 27% (3/11) female animals, and 0% (0/12) male animals. None was seen in tissue from sham exposed animals (Fig. 10a). Given the biomolecular and histopathological signs of renal injury, we then looked for functional evidence of glomerular, proximal tubular and distal tubular dysfunction. Urinary and plasma biochemical analyses (Fig. 10b; Supplementary Fig. 10) showed significantly greater urinary protein excretion in GCR vs sham animals, consistent with a glomerular lesion or proximal tubule dysfunction, the latter supported by the reduction in the endocytic receptor megalin (LRP2) which normally reabsorbs proteins that escape into the ultrafiltrate (Fig. 5). There was a slight increase in urinary glucose, which is a highly specific, but not very sensitive marker of proximal tubular dysfunction in non-diabetic animals. While this did not reach significance (p = 0.1198), there was significant downregulation of sodium-glucose linked transporter, SGLT1 (SLC5A1) (Fig. 5), that would be consistent with proximal tubule dysfunction. Finally, there was significantly greater magnesiuria in GCR exposed animals, consistent with downregulated magnesium reabsorption in the loop of Henle or the distal convoluted tubule.Discussion We have presented a large volume of data encompassing both human and rodent data, extant and novel multi-omics datasets, historical and extant clinical chemistry and novel imaging data from 16 spaceflight missions and 4 GCR exposures to examine the effect of spaceflight on kidney function. Tubular remodelling, by which we mean structural and functional adaptation of the tubular nephron to environmental stimuli, is a well described yet underappreciated phenomenon. Tubular remodelling occurs not only in response to genetic modification of signal pathways39, but also chronic diuretic exposure40, kidney injury41, and both chronic11 and acute42 hypokalaemia. These changes occur rapidly, within 3 days of diet induced hypokalaemia12. Our data robustly and orthogonally supports tubular remodelling occurring in microgravity with and without GCR. This is highly likely to have functional consequences, as tubular remodelling does in other scenarios39. Renal remodelling in microgravity (possibly related to the cephalad fluid shift) may therefore be a primary event that causes subsequent dysregulation of serum and urine electrolyte homeostasis. This is supported by the prompt return to baseline of humans on return to terrestrial gravity. Changes in urinary biochemistry are known to be critical in the pathogenesis of kidney stone formation; a condition that occurs disproportionally commonly in astronauts, and that is potentially mission critical. The increased risk for nephrolithiasis in space has been historically attributed to the negative impact of microgravity on bone mineral density that leads to increased resorption of bone, release of calcium salts in the bloodstream, increased renal load and therefore increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate6,8. Our historical data (from 66 astronauts) confirms hypercalciuria, and the phosphoproteomic data shows decreased phosphorylation of NKCC2 (SLC12A1), which will cause decreased paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations in the loop of Henle, and thus renal calcium and magnesium wasting. Hypocitraturia was not observed; this is in line with previous observations by Pietryzk et al. of an approximate rate of 14% of hypocitraturia during spaceflight6, and Whitson et al. who found no significant hypocitraturia8. Hyperoxaluria also occurs during spaceflight. Oxalate is freely filtered by the glomerulus and almost entirely excreted in the urine. Increased urinary oxalate reflects increased plasma oxalate load that could come from either increased endogenous liver production or increased absorption by the gut. The latter could be caused by several conditions such as increased dietary oxalate, malabsorptive conditions or altered microbiome. Dietary data were not available, and we assumed an absence of malabsorptive conditions. However, we do know that spaceflight affects the gut microbiome43. Metagenomic analysis of the microbiome showed that in the highest quality faecal microbiome dataset (namely RR-23) Oxalobacter sp., the bacterium primarily responsible for oxalate metabolism44, increases during spaceflight. Bacteroides, a bacterium that was found to be increased in stone formers45, and Bifidobacterium, a pro-biotic able to metabolise oxalate in the gut46, were enriched and depleted in spaceflight respectively. It is difficult, based on low replicability of data to ascribe a primary, or even secondary microbiome-related aetiology for increased stone formation in spaceflight. Proposed interventions to prevent potential mission critical kidney stone formation in spaceflight include increasing urine output by maximising oral fluid intake47, oral potassium citrate48 (or potassium magnesium citrate49) supplementation and inflight management, including ureteral stenting50 and lithotripsy51. While these are sensible and may indeed be effective, none deal with the hypercalciuria that has been consistently shown in human space travellers. Oral or parenteral bisphosphonates have been used with some success52. Further, thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium excretion53 (possibly by ECV contraction causing increased proximal tubular calcium reabsorption54) and reduce age related bone mineral density loss55, and could represent a “two birds with one stone” therapeutic option. Could the dephosphorylation of NKCC2 guide us toward a therapeutic target to reduce spaceflight induced hypercalciuria? NKCC2 activity is modulated by the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) via phosphorylation56, and calcilytics (CaSR antagonists), well tolerated but disappointing agents in their utility for treating terrestrial osteoporosis57, might be one potential avenue to manipulate NKCC2 activity to ameliorate spaceflight induced hypercalciuria. Abnormal water homeostasis has been noted in astronauts since the early days of spaceflight, with a marked reduction in both diuresis and natriuresis with vasopressin dysregulation via unknown mechanisms1–3. In fact, the reduced NKCC2 activity would conversely be anticipated to enhance diuresis, much like a loop diuretic. In this context, downregulation of prostaglandin transporters (PGT; encoded by SLCO2A1), a result seen in multiple of our proteomic and transcriptomic datasets (Fig. 5), is intriguing and may offer a way to reconcile this paradox. As carriers of a gain-of-function mutation of SLCO2A158, see a reduction in PGT activity in the proximal straight tubule and the cortical collecting duct which colocalises with Aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Loss of PGT-mediated reabsorption by collecting duct principal cells, causes a subsequent build-up in the luminal concentration of the prostaglandin PGE2, which stimulates apical prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (EP4) receptors to activate Aquaporin-2 and inappropriate water reabsorption. In our study the loss of NKCC2 activity through dephosphorylation and reduction of PGT abundance can offset each other. Tubular remodelling in spaceflight raises another, interesting question; is the hypercalciuria seen in spaceflight a consequence or cause of spaceflight related loss of bone mineral density (BMD)? We know that primary renal phenomena associated with tubular remodelling (e.g. genetic inactivation of SLC12A1 in Bartter syndrome59 or chronic furosemide exposure60) can cause a loss of BMD as a consequence of the primary hypercalciuria. This implies that renally targeted therapies (e.g. thiazides, calcilytics) will be effective. There does appear to be a synergistic effect of microgravity and GCR on BMD loss; GCR does have primary bone effects, increasing osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in rodents16, so bone targeted countermeasures will still be relevant. The kidney is a key microvascular end-organ and microvascular disease appears to be one of the main consequences of GCR exposure30. We concur with this view: vascular disease and endothelial dysfunction disease ontologies were highly enriched across omics datasets (Fig. 8). Consistent with this, the arginine biosynthesis pathway was highly enriched across our human and mouse datasets (Fig. 4c), there was a significantly increased amount of pathogenic miR-125b in the highly vascular ISOM (Fig. 9b) and as a likely consequence of this microvascular pathology, we observed incidences of thrombotic microangiopathy on histopathological examination (Fig. 10a). In addition to this, pathophysiological macrovascular changes are a well-documented consequence of microgravity, with 6 months in space shown to induce ~ 20 years of vascular ageing through arterial stiffening61. The resultant loss of vascular elasticity, and thus buffering capacity, leads to elevated transmission of blood flow and pressure pulsatility to the microvasculature. Long-term, this can cause barotrauma or oxidative stress to renal microvasculature due to suboptimal perfusion, especially as the myogenic response of the afferent arteriole is to vasoconstrict and provide resistance (and thus reduce flow) in the face of excessive pulsatile pressure62. Indeed arterial stiffness and CKD are strongly associated, and it is thought that one begets the other in a positive feedback loop63. Taken together with the general drop in blood pressure experienced by astronauts64, exposure to spaceflight long-term places the kidney in an impossible position whereby it must choose whether to defend renal perfusion or the health of its microvasculature. If the arterioles dilate to enhance blood flow, they leave the microvasculature open to damage from unbuffered pressure waves on top of the radiation damage caused by GCR. Whereas if they constrict to provide protection to the microvasculature, they reduce blood flow and therefore oxygen supply to the renal tubules, which further compounds and exacerbates the chronic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction from GCR bombardment. This study is the largest to ever look at the effect of spaceflight on kidney function. We have demonstrated that there is renal structural and functional remodelling likely caused by microgravity, probably synergistically with GCR. We have shown that this remodelling is a potential driver of kidney stone formation and many of the changes in the urinary biochemistry of humans and animals experienced by those exposed to LEO spaceflight. We have also shown that acute exposure to simulated GCR causes both acute and chronic tubular epithelial and vascular damage that appears both progressive and irreversible. However, our study has several limitations. We have necessarily relied on human (mostly male) and animal (mostly female) data from missions which were exposed to microgravity for relatively short periods of time compared to the projected length of a Mars mission, and only in LEO, which also limited the amount of GCR and other space radiation that they were exposed to. Additionally, our simulated GCR experiments only looked at acute unfractionated dosing, which may not accurately model the chronic cumulative exposure that would happen on a Mars mission. Therefore, in the absence of experiments that can more accurately model the long-term simultaneous exposure to full GCR and microgravity over several years, and the plausible synergistic impact of these insults, our results should be taken a conservative glimpse into the potential dire health consequences of long-term deep space travel. Much more intensive study of the health impacts of spaceflight on the kidneys and other visceral organs that have received little attention is of the utmost importance if we are to develop mitigation strategies and send humans to other planets and beyond.Methods Human studies ethical approval All crews from the Inspiration4, NASA, JAXA spaceflights provided informed written consent prior to their participation.

Cosmonaut and JAXA data is all male. SpaceX data involves both sexes, but this cannot be disaggregated for ethical reasons of anonymity. For the animal studies: The findings apply mostly female animals (roughly two thirds of animal missions were female). As we were collecting data from previously conducted experiments, we did not have the ability to alter this sex disparity. Only one study had both males and females, which enabled us to perform sex difference analyses for parameters such as blood and urine electrolytes.Sample sizes Due to the nature of our study we used samples from animals that had been in spaceflight (usually as part of the ‘Rodent Research’ missions to the International Space Station) or had been taken from costly experiments using the Galactic Cosmic Radiation Simulator at Brookhaven national laboratories. We also used samples and/or data from humans who had undergone spaceflight (in historical NASA missions, Roscosmos missions, and JAXA missions to the ISS or modern commercial missions with SpaceX such as inspiration4). Our sample numbers were therefore limited to the number of samples made available to us in the original experimental designs or mission parameter limitations (restricted by practical considerations of weight to launch, available space and resource consumption). In all cases, we endeavoured to use the maximum number of biological replicates available to us to maximise experimental power.Statistics and reproducibility Omics studies This study encompassed 2 epigenomic (Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing), 9 transcriptomic (8 Bulk RNA sequencing, 1 Bulk small RNA sequencing), 7 proteomic (3 Quantitative fractionated TMT-labelled DDA LC-MS/MS, 2 Quantitative label-free SEER DIA LC-MS/MS, 1 Plasma Slow Off-Rate Modified Aptamers, 1 Shotgun LC-MS/MS), 1 epiproteomic (Quantitative fractionated TMT-labelled DDA LC-MS/MS of phospho-enriched peptides), 3 metabolomic (Quantitative label-free UHPLC-MS/MS) and 6 metagenomic (4 Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, 2 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) studies on both humans and animals. Full details of the experimental, processing and analytical methodologies and locations of publicly available raw data are given in the supplementary methods.Physiology Sample collection and processing NSRL-22A Urine collection was performed in awake mice to obtain spontaneous and uncontaminated samples. Mice were gently handled over a sheet of Saran® wrap or Parafilm® to facilitate micturition. Upon collection, each urine sample was carefully divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was immediately acidified with HNO3 to achieve a final concentration of 1% v/v, preventing precipitation of electrolytes and maintaining sample integrity. Both aliquots were then promptly stored at − 80 °C to preserve their biochemical constituents until further analysis. For blood collection, mice were subjected to terminal anaesthesia to minimise distress and ensure compliance with ethical guidelines. Blood samples were drawn from the vena cava using a fine needle and syringe. Plasma was separated by transferring the blood into Microvette® CB 300 LH (Sarstedt) tubes and centrifuging at 2000 g for 5 min. The resulting plasma supernatant was carefully aspirated and stored at − 80 °C for future analysis. Both plasma and non-acidified urine samples were analysed for creatinine levels by employing either the standard Jaffe reaction or the enzymatic method, depending on the investigator’s preference and laboratory resources. Electrolyte levels, biochemistries and biomarkers were assessed using the Siemens Dimension RxL Max Integrated Chemistry System, at the Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, UK. Inspiration4 Plasma samples collected from astronauts at timepoints L-92d, L-44d and L-3d were grouped and averaged into “pre-flight” for comparison against individual post-flight timepoints R + 1d, R + 45d, R + 82d and R + 194d. These samples were analysed by Quest Diagnostics using the Comprehensive metabolic panel [CMP; CPT code 80053]. NASA A historical collection of archived astronaut frozen plasma and urine aliquots were collected and stored at − 80 °C over many years. Clinical chemistries, endocrine profiles and biomarkers were obtained at the Nutritional Biochemistry Laboratory at NASA Johnson Space Center. Timepoints L-180d and L-45d were grouped and averaged as “pre-flight” for comparison to individual timepoints L + 15d, L + 30d, L + 60d, L + 120d, L + 180d, R + 0d and R + 30d.Functional calculations Functional calculations used in the data analysis are fully detailed in the supplementary methods.Imaging Sample fixation and processing Mouse kidney samples were harvested and fixed through immersion in freshly prepared 4% (w/v) formaldehyde-PBS solution (pH 6.9) for 16 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the samples were washed three times with PBS with 0.02% Na-Azide and stored at 4 °C until they were embedded in paraffin.Histopathology and Brightfield WSI 2-3 µm FFPE sections from NSRL-22A kidneys were prepared, deparaffinised using Histoclear (National Diagnostics), and rehydrated through a series of graded methanol steps. These were then stained for either Haematoxylin and Eosin (#ab245880, Abcam) or Masson’s Trichrome (#ab150686, Abcam) according to the manufacturers guidelines. Sections underwent brightfield whole slide imaging with 20X objective tiled and stitched focus stacks taken for each section on a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner. The resultant images were viewed in QuPath (v0.4.3) and semi-quantitatively scored for any histopathological findings.Immunostaining and confocal WSI 5 µm FFPE sections from RR-10 kidneys were prepared, deparaffinised using Histoclear (National Diagnostics), and rehydrated through a series of graded methanol steps. Antigen retrieval was performed using [1X] R-Universal buffer (AP0530) in a 2100 antigen retriever for a single heat-pressure cycle (Aptum Biologics). Sections were then permeabilized with 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100-PBS solution for 20 minutes and incubated with Section Block ‘ready-to-use’ (AP0471; Aptum Biologics) for 30 mins at RT. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C for 16 hours at specified concentrations (see supplementary methods), diluted in Antibody Diluent ‘FF/PE Sections’ (AP0472; Aptum Biologics). For phospho-specific antibodies, 10 μg/ml of the non-phospho peptide used to raise the antibody was added per 2 μg/ml of the antibody used. Negative control samples omitted the primary antibody and were processed simultaneously. Following incubation, slides were washed by dipping slides 50x times in 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100-PBS for 3 rounds, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at RT. Pre-absorbed fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies were utilised at specified concentrations (concentrations (see supplementary methods), diluted in Antibody Diluent ‘FF/PE Sections’ (AP0472; Aptum Biologics). After washing, slides were mounted using Prolong Gold antifade (#P36930, Life Technologies), permitted to cure for 48-72hrs, sealed with CoverGrip Coverslip Sealant (#23005; Biotium) and protected from light exposure. Immunofluorescent images were captured using either a Zeiss LSM700 LED laser-scanning confocal microscope or Leica SP8 white-light laser-scanning confocal microscope using 488-nm, 555-nm and 639-nm laser lines, employing a 10X/0.3NA (Zeiss) or 10X/0.5NA (Leica) objective. Zeiss acquisition parameters included single field of view, 8-bit resolution, 1844 x 1844 pixels, 1x digital zoom, 3.85µs pixel dwell time, 4-line Kalman filtering, sequential (by line) channel imaging, and a 4-slice z-stack with a 6 µm thickness to account for chromatic aberration. Leica acquisition parameters included tile scanning with a 10% overlap, 8-bit resolution, 1024 × 1024 pixels, 0.75x digital zoom, 600 Hz scan speed, 6-line Kalman filtering, sequential (by line) channel imaging, and a 3-slice z-stack with a 5 µm thickness to account for chromatic aberration. Images were processed using FIJI image analysis software (v.1.53p). Fluorescent z-stacks underwent background subtraction (200 px radius rolling ball) and maximum intensity z-projection. Brightness and contrast adjustments were made using linear histogram stretching to enhance visibility.miRNA in situ hybridisation and brightfield WSI FFPE blocks for BNL-3 kidneys were trimmed to remove tissue exposed to air, and fresh 5 µm sections were taken. These were not baked onto the slide and stored with desiccant instead. Samples were then processed using the miRNAscope™ HD RED assay (#324531 and #324500, ACD-Biotechne) with the FFPE tissue section workflow according to the manufacturers guidelines. miRNAscope™ Probes against the following were used: mmu-miR-125b-5p (#1082311-S1), mmu-let-7a-5p (#727761-S1) and mmu-miR-16-5p (729031-S1). Sections underwent brightfield whole slide imaging with 20X objective tiled and stitched focus stacks (with extended depth of focus) taken for each section on a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner. Using QuPath (v0.4.3) the cortex, outer stripe of the outer medulla, inner stripe of the outer medulla and inner medulla were manually annotated with the aid of a Wacom cintiq pro 32 to create a segmentation mask of the anatomical regions for area calculation. Ilastik (v1.4.0)65 automated (supervised) pixel-level classification was then trained to identify positive miRNAscope probe staining. A custom in-house python script was then used to count all positive staining and calculate the area of all anatomical regions, so that the density of each miRNA per unit area of each region could be determined for each kidney section.Optical clearing and 3D imaging Tissue transformation, delipidation and refractive index matching Quartered formaldehyde-fixed kidneys from RR-10 mice were tissue transformed using the SHIELD protocol66 and reagents from Lifecanvas technologies (MA, USA) based on (10.1038/nbt.4281). SHIELD-transformed kidneys were delipidated (Lifecanvas Technologies; Full Passive Pipeline Protocol v4.06) for approximately 10–14 days at 37 °C in 40 mL of passive delipidation buffer with gentle agitation in EasyClear device. Following delipidation, tissues were washed in several rounds of PBS at 37˚C overnight to remove any delipidation buffer. Before imaging tissues were immersed in Incubated in EasyIndex RI 1.53 refractive index matching solution as per protocol. Tissues were then embedded in 2% w/v ultra-low melting point agarose (Sigma A5030) blocks made up with EasyIndex solution to immobilise the samples. These were then stored in EasyIndex in airtight containers shielded from light prior to imaging. MesoSPIM imaging Samples were mounted in quartz cuvettes and immersion oil with refractive indices matching that of EasyIndex, and then suspended and aligned for light-sheet fluorescence imaging with a MesoSPIM67. Images were captured at 16-bit for 1-channel dual laser lightsheet illumination (488 nm excitations) to obtain autofluorescence emissions at 2048 x 2048 pixels in the XY, with a Z depth range of 700-1200 pixels, giving a pixel resolution of 3.26 μm (XY) and 4.0 μm (Z). Image analysis To evaluate any qualitative changes in gross morphology images were imported into Syglass68 (v.1.7.2-79; https://www.syglass.io/; RRID: SCR_017961) for visual investigation by nephrologists and histopathologists in 3D virtual space using Meta Quest 2 VR headsets. Images were also imported into Imaris69(v10.0) for visualisation on a Wacom cintiq pro 32” 4 K touchscreen monitor. 3D video renders were later generated with Syglass (v.2.0.0) and Z-slice video created with FIJI (ImageJ; v.1.54 h).Morphometry Normalised kidney weights PI and NASA GeneLab records for all animals included in the study were examined for bodyweight and kidney wet weight measurements. Only BNL-1, BNL-2, BNL-3 and RR-23 missions had complete kidney and body weight information available. Where available, the weights of both left and right kidneys were averaged, and the kidney weights were normalised against bodyweight for the same animal and expressed as a percentage. All ground control and sham animals that received no exposure treatment were grouped into control for pairwise comparisons against GCR (animals that only received either full or simplified galactic cosmic radiation simulations) or MG (animals that only underwent hindlimb unloading microgravity simulation) or GCR + MG (animals that underwent a combination of GCR and MG or were exposed to spaceflight).Histomorphometry Whole slide images of tiled immunofluorescent confocal images taken from RR-10 were used for analysis. Using QuPath (v0.4.3) the cortex was manually annotated with the aid of a Wacom cintiq pro 32 to create a segmentation mask of the anatomical region for area calculation. Similarly distal convoluted tubules (DCT) labelled with antibodies against total NCC / phospho-NCC (see supplementary methods for details), the canonical DCT marker, were annotated. Initially, only a handful of tubules were annotated from each slide, and these were then used to train Ilastik (v1.4.0)65 for automated (supervised) pixel-level classification of DCTs. These were then further manually refined to remove/include any false-positive/negatives. A custom in-house python script was then used to compute the number of discrete tubules positive for DCT markers, the corresponding area of each of these as well as the total cortex area, such that average tubule area and DCT density per area of cortex could be determined for each kidney section.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information (7.2MB, pdf) Peer Review File (132.5KB, pdf) 41467_2024_49212_MOESM3_ESM.pdf (72.4KB, pdf) Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 (263.4KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 2 (338KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 3 (282.4KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 4 (38.2KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 5 (22KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 6 (398.1KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 7 (44.7KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 8 (86.8KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 9 (25.9KB, xlsx) Supplementary Data 10 (13.9MB, xlsx) Supplementary Movie 1 (10.8MB, mp4) Supplementary Movie 2 (82.9MB, avi) Reporting Summary (388.1KB, pdf) Source data Source Data (158.1KB, xlsx) Acknowledgements S.B.W. and K.S. acknowledges this work was partially funded by the UK Space Agency through a grant [ST/X000036/1] administered by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).
