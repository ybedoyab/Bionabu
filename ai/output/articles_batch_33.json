While rapid screening methods for microtiter plate well (“static”) biofilms are available, there are no methods for such screening of continuous flow biofilms (“flow biofilms”). Since the latter biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe here a new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of biofilm viability. The biofilm viability measured with the plate reader agreed with that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of fluorescence microscope image analysis. Using BioFlux and the plate reader, we were able to rapidly screen the effects of several antimicrobials on the viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 flow biofilms. Bacterial biofilms are surface-attached communities that are encased in a polymeric matrix, which exhibit a high degree of resistance to antimicrobial agents and the host immune system (12, 16). This makes them medically important; diseases with a biofilm component are chronic and difficult to eradicate. Examples of such diseases are cystitis (1), endocarditis (31), cystic fibrosis (35), and middle-ear (17) and indwelling medical device-associated (20) infections. Biofilms also play important environmental roles in, for example, wastewater treatment (38), bioremediation (29, 30), biofouling (7), and biocorrosion (2). Better control of biofilms requires elucidation of the molecular basis of their superior resistance (by identifying resistance-compromised mutants) and identification of compounds with antibiofilm activity. While our understanding of these aspects of biofilms has increased (11, 15, 25-27, 36), further work, including development of accurate high-throughput (HTP) methods for screening biofilm viability, is needed. Two major biofilm models are studied in the laboratory, biofilms grown without a continuous flow of fresh medium and biofilms grown with a continuous flow of fresh medium; examples of these two models are microtiter well biofilms and flow cell biofilms, respectively. Methods have been developed for HTP screening of the viability of static biofilms (6, 28, 32, 33), but there are no methods for HTP screening of flow biofilms. The latter biofilms are typically grown in flow cells, which have to be examined individually to determine viability and thus cannot be used for rapid screening. An HTP screening method for flow biofilms is desirable, as these biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms and can differ from static biofilms evidently due to hydrodynamic influences on cell signaling (22, 34). For example, the ability of rpoS-deficient Escherichia coli (lacking σS) to form flow biofilms is impaired, but its capacity to form biofilms under static conditions is enhanced (18). We describe here a new application of a recently developed device (8-10, 13), the “BioFlux” device consisting of microfluidic channels for biofilm growth. Other microfluidic devices have recently been used for biofilm formation (14, 19, 21, 23), but none of them has been used for HTP screening. The BioFlux device permits rapid measurement of the fluorescence of flow biofilms with a plate reader, which permits initial HTP screening of the viability of such biofilms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and media. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strain AMG1, a clinical isolate obtained from the Infectious Disease Department at the Stanford Medical Center (25), was cultured in Lennox L broth (LB). Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens 700830 were cultured in Bacto tryptic soy broth (TSB). To obtain a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing strain, UPEC was transformed by electroporation with plasmid pFPV25.1 (37). PAO1 carrying pSMC2 (4) for GFP expression was graciously provided by Terry Machen (University of California, Berkeley). Ampicillin was added to the medium to maintain the expression vectors (100 and 16 μg/ml for UPEC/pFPV25.1 and PAO1/pSMC2, respectively). LB agar and Difco tryptic soy agar (TSA) were used for plating the UPEC and PAO1 strains, respectively.Growth and determination of the viability of microtiter plate (“static”) biofilms. Static biofilms of GFP-expressing strains were grown in Costar 96-well polystyrene plates (with black walls to prevent interference between wells due to fluorescence) as described previously (25, 36). Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in LB (for UPEC) or TSB (for PAO1), and 100 μl was dispensed into each well and incubated for 24 h and 37°C. After a rinse with saline (0.85%), eight replicate biofilms were treated with a saline bleach solution using concentrations specified below; treatment with saline alone was used as a control. Following 1 h of treatment and a saline rinse, biofilm viability was determined in parallel using colony counting as well as measurement of fluorescence. For colony counting, quadruplicate biofilms were resuspended in saline and pooled in glass tubes. The biofilms were broken up by vigorous vortexing and were serially diluted in saline. Then 25-μl portions of three dilutions were plated in duplicate on LB agar (UPEC) or TSA (PAO1) plates. After 12 h of incubation at 37°C, colonies were counted, and the results were compared to the results for saline-treated controls. For measurement of fluorescence, the remaining four replicate biofilms were stained with 100 μl of a saline solution containing 30 μM propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min, and then the wells were washed and refilled with saline. Empty microtiter wells (without biofilms) were stained similarly and then washed and refilled with saline and used as blanks to measure the background fluorescence. Fluorescence emission spectra (505 to 650 nm, with 5-nm steps) were measured with a Safire fluorescence plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) with excitation at 488 nm. The background fluorescence was subtracted from the emission spectra, and the ratio of green fluorescence (integrated from 505 to 525 nm) to red fluorescence (integrated from 605 to 625 nm) was calculated for each biofilm. The absolute fluorescence values were a product of the fluorescence per cell and the number of cells in the biofilm. Following treatment, static biofilms were rinsed prior to PI staining, which could result in removal of some biofilm. Using the ratio of green fluorescence to red fluorescence compensated for this effect. The fluorescence of saline-treated control biofilms was designated 100% viable, and the fluorescence of biofilms treated with 0.2% bleach was designated 0% viable (in agreement with colony count data). Intermediate levels of viability were calculated by linear interpolation between the green fluorescence/red fluorescence ratios for the 100% viable biofilms (treated with saline) and the 0% viable biofilms (treated with 0.2% bleach).Biofilm growth and determination of viability for the BioFlux flowthrough device. The BioFlux device (Fluxion Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA), which allows simultaneous cultivation of 96 flow biofilms, is described in the Results. To grow biofilms in this device, the microfluidic channels (depth, 70 μm; width, 370 μm) were wetted with medium and inoculated with an overnight culture (whose concentration was adjusted so that the optical density at 600 nm [OD600] in medium was 0.1). To obtain time course images, P. fluorescens was grown in TSB with a flow rate of 186 μl/h (2 cm/s). We found that with full-strength TSB there was inconsistent formation of fully formed biofilms due to device volume constraints. For treatment assays, 0.1× TSB was used to control the PAO1 biofilm yield, which resulted in a similar time course of development but more consistent fully formed biofilms. Inoculation was performed using the “outlet” well to prevent contamination of the “inlet” well by pumping in the reverse direction for a few seconds (see Fig. 1). Following 30 min of incubation for cell attachment (37°C), fresh medium (0.1× TSB) was pumped (at a flow rate of 65 μl/h, corresponding to 697 μm/s) from inlet wells through the channels to outlet wells. The flow rate was sufficient to prevent back-contamination of the inlet wells. After biofilms had formed (8 h, 37°C), antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, or enrofloxacin) dissolved in 0.1× TSB at a range of concentrations were applied overnight (at a flow rate of 65 μl/h) in quadruplicate. Treatment with bleach or 70% isopropyl alcohol was used to obtain completely nonviable biofilms, as some viability remained following treatment with 0.2% bleach, which was not the case with static biofilms (see above). FIG. 1. Open in a new tab BioFlux high-throughput system for screening of flow biofilm viability and other parameters. (A) Photograph of BioFlux system. The device consists of a pneumatic pump connected via an interface to the top of a BioFlux plate (shown on the microscope stage). (B) Schematic diagram of the BioFlux plate, showing 48 wells and 24 independent channels connecting pairs of wells. (C) Schematic diagram showing the inlet and outlet wells containing fresh and spent media, respectively. Pneumatic pressure delivered to the top of the inlet well pushes fresh medium through the microfluidic channel (containing the biofilm) and into the outlet well. The biofilm can be viewed with a microscope or scanned with a plate reader. (D) Close-up of two microfluidic channels (black lines). Each channel has a serpentine region (one serpentine region is enclosed in a box) to provide sufficient back pressure and a chamber for microscope viewing (arrow).Two strategies were employed to provide fluorescence for measurement of viability. One strategy involved the use of GFP-expressing strains and staining with PI (30 μM in 0.85% saline) for 15 min at a flow rate of 93 μl/h (997 μm/s), followed by a 20-min rinse with saline. The second strategy involved bacteria not expressing GFP and viability staining with LIVE/DEAD BacLight stain (Invitrogen). The BacLight stain consists of SYTO9 (5 μM in 0.85% saline) and PI (30 μM in 0.85% saline), which were pumped through the channels (at the same flow rate and for the same time as described above), which were then rinsed with saline for 20 min. Two methods were used to measure fluorescence: plate reader measurement and quantification of fluorescence microscope images. For the first method, BioFlux plates were scanned with a Safire fluorescence plate reader by positioning the emission detector beneath the viewing region of each microfluidic channel (see Fig. 1D). To locate this region, a BioFlux plate containing stained biofilms was scanned at 1,536 positions (using a 48-by-32 grid). Fluorescence measurements were obtained for two positions along the length of each biofilm region viewed. The excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and emission was determined for wavelength ranges that matched those used for fluorescence microscopy (505 to 525 nm for green; 605 to 625 nm for red) in 5-nm steps. For the second method, images of BioFlux biofilms were obtained using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE 300), a digital camera (Retiga EX; Q Imaging), and the Image-Pro Plus 5.0 software. Phase-contrast images were also collected to verify that all of the cells remained fluorescent. The fluorescence intensity of images was quantified using the  freeware ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html) as described previously (25, 26). Fluorescence values (obtained using both methods) were integrated and used to calculate the ratio of green fluorescence to red fluorescence. Intermediate levels of viability were determined by linearly interpolating between green fluorescence/red fluorescence ratios of 100% viable biofilms (untreated) and 0% viable biofilms (treated with 70% isopropyl alcohol).Statistical analyses. GraphPad Prism v. 5.00 was used for all statistical calculations. The Student t test was used to assess differences between SYTO9-PI data and GFP-PI data (see Fig. 5). To quantify the correlation between methods (both for colony counts versus images and for images versus plate reader), the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the associated P value were determined, where r ranged from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect correlation). We assumed that P values of <0.05 indicated statistical significance. Linear regression analysis was also performed to compare methods. The coefficient of determination (r2), which is the fraction of variance that is shared by two methods, is related to correlation in that r is the Pearson correlation coefficient. Due to the heterogeneous nature of biofilms and considering that the method used was intended for screening purposes, we considered that r2 values greater than 0.9 indicate a strong correlation. FIG. 5. Open in a new tab Viability of PAO1 BioFlux biofilms determined using SYTO9-PI and GFP-PI. Treatment with low levels (0.01 and 0.1 μg/ml) of gentamicin increased SYTO9 uptake and green fluorescence, resulting in enhancement of false-positive viability (>100%), which did not occur with GFP-PI fluorescence. The Student t test P value is shown for each concentration of gentamicin; a P value of <0.05 indicates that there is a statistically significant difference.RESULTS BioFlux device. High-throughput screening of flow biofilm viability requires a device that permits development of multiple biofilms with controlled flow rates and determination of viability in real time. We constructed such a device (Fig. 1 A) with microfluidic channels integrated into microtiter well plates. The use of a standard well plate format (Fig. 1B) allowed compatibility with plate readers and multichannel pipettors, and the plate also could be examined microscopically. The microfluidic channels are generated using photolithography-etched micropatterned silicon wafers as a mold for polydimethylsiloxane, which forms the sides and roofs of the channels. The bottom of the channels consists of standard 180-μm coverslip glass, which allows microscopic examination. The channels connect pairs of microtiter wells; one well of each pair is the inlet well from which fresh medium is pushed by pneumatic pressure through the channel into the outlet well, which holds the spent medium (Fig. 1C). The microfluidic channels are 1/10 the size of conventional flow cells, which permits laminar flow at a wider range of flow rates and results in uniform biofilm growth in the entire channel. Figure 2 shows P. fluorescens biofilm formation, which appeared to be qualitatively similar to PAO1 biofilm formation; the series of images was taken 0.5 to 21 h after flow was initiated. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Biofilm formation and development in a BioFlux channel. The images are phase-contrast images obtained after flow began (the flow was from left to right; each channel was 370 μm wide) and show initial attachment (0.5 and 1 h), microcolony formation (2 and 3 h), and development (4, 5, and 6.5 h) into fully formed biofilms (21 h).The system includes an air compressor and electropneumatic regulators to deliver precisely controlled pressure to each channel via a manifold that interfaces with individual wells of the microtiter plate. Thus, the flow (and shear) rate in each channel can be controlled individually. A thin transparent heating stage provides temperature control, and a software interface permits control of the flow rate by the user and saving and reuse of experimental profiles. Unlike conventional flow cell systems, the BioFlux plates are presterilized and do not require assembly or tubing connections, which minimizes the possibility of contamination. The plates each contain 24 channels connecting 48 wells (Fig. 1B). The BioFlux system controls four plates simultaneously, providing a total of 96 biofilms. Each inlet well and outlet well holds 1.25 ml of liquid, so there can be 11 to 20 h of continuous flow before replenishment is necessary at commonly used flow rates. The small volume of the microchannels also results in conservation of reagents.Quantification of viability by measurement of fluorescence. Flow cell biofilm viability is generally determined using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight stain combined with imaging of green fluorescence and red fluorescence, which indicate live and dead cells, respectively. However, according to recent reports, this method can overestimate the number of viable cells remaining after treatment with low levels of antimicrobial agents, evidently due to changes in membrane permeability that facilitate disproportionate uptake of SYTO9 green (the green “viable” dye) (3, 24). An alternate method to measure viability by fluorescence is to use green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria and the red fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI) (24). To test if this method provides a reliable measure of biofilm viability, we first experimented with static biofilms. These biofilms can be removed, which permits plate counting, and thus are suitable for comparison to a standard method. Biofilms were grown in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 h, treated with bleach at different concentrations (in quadruplicate), and either stained with PI or removed for colony counting (Fig. 3). Emission spectra were collected for stained biofilms (Fig. 3A and 3B). The ratio of green fluorescence to red fluorescence was used to estimate biofilm viability, and the results were compared to the viability of identically treated biofilms determined by plate counting. The two methods showed that there were comparable dose-dependent responses to bleach treatment for UPEC (Fig. 3C) and PAO1 (Fig. 3D) biofilms. To quantify the correlation between methods, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and its associated P value for viability estimates obtained in three independent experiments and found that r was 0.9876 and P was 0.0017 for UPEC and that r was 0.9855 and P was 0.0021 for PAO1. The high correlation coefficients and low P values, together with the results of linear regression analyses (Fig. 3E and 3F), revealed that there was a strong correlation between the methods, validating the GFP-PI method for measuring the viability of two common bacterial biofilm pathogens. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab Comparison of static biofilm viabilities determined by colony counting and by using GFP-PI fluorescence ratios. (A and B) Representative fluorescence emission spectra of quadruplicate GFP-expressing UPEC (A) and PAO1 (B) biofilms following 1 h of treatment with bleach (in saline) at the concentrations indicated (as percentages) and PI staining. The absorption peaks on the left and right correspond to live and dead cells, respectively. (C and D) Mean levels of viability as determined by colony counting and GFP-PI fluorescence (GFP-PI Fluor.) for UPEC (C) and PAO1 (D) biofilms. The error bars indicate standard deviations. (E and F) Linear regression analysis of viability data for the two methods using pooled data from three independent experiments.To determine if the BioFlux device can be used to screen the effects of antimicrobial agents on flow biofilms, we cultivated GFP-expressing PAO1 biofilms in this device. The biofilms were treated with bleach or antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, or enrofloxacin) and then stained with PI, which was followed by measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader. Both the bleach and the antibiotics caused dose-dependent biofilm killing, as determined by fluorescence measured with the plate reader (Fig. 4). Bleach was less effective for flow biofilms than it was for static biofilms (86% viability versus 50% viability for 0.05% bleach, 56% viability versus 17% viability for 0.02% bleach, and 6% viability versus 0% viability for 0.2% bleach), and 70% isopropanol was required to completely kill the biofilms. Whether this was due to greater resistance is unclear because in addition to the presence of flow, there are other differences between biofilms grown in 96-well plates and BioFlux biofilms. The quinolones had the most potent effect; ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin caused complete loss of viability at concentrations of 1 and 10 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 4D and 4E). As a further check of the reliability of rapid plate reader scanning for determination of viability, we analyzed biofilm images obtained by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4, insets), as reported previously (25, 26). The biofilm viability calculated from fluorescence ratios obtained using microscope images agreed with that measured with the plate reader (Fig. 4); the correlation coefficient (r = 0.9565; P < 0.0001) and linear regression analysis (Fig. 4F) verified that there was a strong correlation between the results of the two methods. The fluorescent microscope images confirmed that the quinolones completely eradicated the biofilms (ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and enrofloxacin at a concentration of 10 μg/ml), as indicated by the complete absence of fluorescence (Fig. 4D and 4E, insets). FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Estimates of the viability of GFP-producing P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms cultivated in the BioFlux device following treatment with bleach (A) or various antibiotics (B to E) and then stained with PI. Levels of viability were calculated by using the green fluorescence/red fluorescence ratios determined from quantified microscope images (black bars) and by using plate reader measurements (white bars). Isopropyl alcohol (70%) was used to ensure complete loss of viability. Insets show representative microscope images, including images of untreated (0) and isopropyl-alcohol treated (isop.) controls. Note that no biofilm remained after treatment with the highest dose of enrofloxacin (E) and the two highest doses of ciprofloxacin (D). Fluorescence signals were not detected (N.D.) with the plate reader, and no biofilms were observed using microscopy (insets). (F) Linear regression analysis for determinations of viability by the two methods.We used the GFP-PI method because Lehtinen et al. (24) showed that it was superior to the BacLight method for measuring the effects of low concentrations of antimicrobial agents on the viability of planktonic bacteria. The limitation of the BacLight method at low concentrations of antimicrobials is apparently due to increased penetration of SYTO9 but not PI, which falsely increases the green fluorescence/red fluorescence ratio used to determine viability (3, 24). We assumed that this limitation was applicable to bacterial biofilms. The success of the BioFlux device for HTP screening of flow biofilm viability, as reported above, enabled us to test this assumption directly. We cultivated PAO1 biofilms not expressing GFP in the BioFlux apparatus, treated them with gentamicin, stained them with the two BacLight stains (SYTO9 and PI), and used the ratio of green fluorescence to red fluorescence to calculate the viability. Compared to the GFP-PI fluorescence results, treatment with SYTO9 resulted in much higher levels of green fluorescence for the two low concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 μg/ml), resulting in a false increase in viability (e.g., viability greater than 100% compared to untreated controls). However, at higher concentrations of the antibiotic the two methods gave comparable results (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with tobramycin, enrofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin; for example, with 0.01 μg/ml of each antibiotic, the levels of viability determined by the BacLight light method were 166%, 117%, and 70% of the untreated control values, respectively, while the levels of viability determined by the GFP-PI method were 77%, 44%, and 47% of the untreated control values, respectively (Fig. 4). Thus, the BacLight method gives an erroneous picture of viability after exposure to low antimicrobial agent concentrations not only for planktonic cells but also for biofilms.DISCUSSION Flow biofilms are commonly cultivated in flow cells, and their viability is determined by quantification of microscopic fluorescent images or by colony counting, both of which are time-consuming; colony counting is particularly difficult because flow biofilms cannot be easily removed from the flow cells. HTP screening of viability by this method is not feasible not only because of these constraints but also because it would require the use of a prohibitively large number of flow cells. We used a microfluidic device, the BioFlux device, which accurately controls fluid flow and permits simultaneous growth of multiple biofilms with a large range of precisely controlled flow rates. Here we describe a method for rapidly determining biofilm viability simply by measuring fluorescence with a plate reader, eliminating the need for the labor-intensive analyses mentioned above. The results show that measurement of GFP-PI fluorescence with a plate reader reliably reflects biofilm viability as verified by plate counting (Fig. 3), as well as viability determined by quantification of fluorescence microscope images (Fig. 4). Thus, the BioFlux device used in conjunction with the GFP-PI viability assessment method is an excellent method for initial HTP screening of flow biofilms; this was verified by successful use of this method for HTP screening of PAO1 biofilms for sensitivity to a number of antimicrobials. The plate reader-based BioFlux viability screening method relied on the use of bacterial strains expressing GFP; for non-GFP-expressing bacteria another method, such as LIVE/DEAD BacLight staining, must be used. However, the BacLight viability method, as reported previously for planktonic cells (3, 24) and confirmed here for biofilms, is limited to treatments causing a relatively higher level of killing. This finding appears to limit use of the BioFlux to bacteria capable of expressing GFP. However, there are other possibilities. For example, the LIVE/DEAD stain is accurate for determination of viability where the level of killing is high, which is often the goal of HTP screening; another possibility is to use a fluorogenic substrate, such as 4-methylumbellyferyl-β-d-glucuronide (28), to measure biofilm metabolic activity. The BioFlux device is also likely to be useful in HTP screening of other biofilm parameters. One example is investigating expression of a fluorescently tagged protein under different conditions, such as fluid shear. Another example is determination of the formation or elimination of the extracellular matrix, which can be done by using poly-N-acetylglucosamine-binding wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (5).Acknowledgments This work was supported by NASA grant NNH08ZTT003N to A.M., by /NIGMS grant F32-GM077827 to M.R.B., and by /NIGMS grant 1R43GM083384-01A1 to C.I.-Z.Footnotes ▿Published ahead of print on 30 April 2010.

Relevant aspects of the current controversy on the role of ROS in killing by bactericidal drugs of exponential-phase bacteria, which represent a different physiological state, are discussed.INTRODUCTION Stationary-phase bacteria play critical roles in disease causation (1–4). Due to a dearth of nutrients and/or other factors, bacteria in the host often experience this late growth phase (5–8), and it is in this phase that many of their virulence traits are primarily expressed (9–11). For example, in pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, the csgBA genes, encoding curli which mediate host invasion (12), and the fim genes, encoding type I fimbriae which are involved in bladder colonization, are expressed in stationary phase (13, 14). Stationary-phase bacteria become highly resistant to disinfectants, are difficult to eradicate, and play a key role in the heightened resistance of bacterial biofilms (15, 16); it is therefore important to explore means for their control (17, 18). The bacterial general stress response (GSR), regulated by σS (product of the rpoS gene), is activated in the stationary phase of E. coli bacteria (7, 8, 19) and is responsible for their high degree of resistance, which is due to the expression of a core set of proteins that protect vital cell biomolecules, i.e., proteins, DNA, and the cell envelope (7, 8, 20). Since bactericidal antibiotics exert their toxic effects in bacteria by damaging these molecules, we along with others postulated that σS is likely to have a role in protecting bacteria against these drugs as well, and it has been shown that constitutive expression of rpoS can minimize antibiotic sensitivity in a multidrug-resistant strain of E. coli and that an rpoS mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa becomes more sensitive to carbapenems in stationary phase (8, 21). However, the mechanistic basis of this role has as yet remained unexplored. We have discovered that in stationary-phase E. coli, the loss of σS does indeed result in rendering the bacterium markedly more sensitive to three bactericidal antibiotics that target different macromolecules: gentamicin ([Gm] ribosomes), ampicillin (peptidoglycan), and ciprofloxacin (DNA). Here, we present in-depth analysis of the biochemical basis that renders the ΔrpoS mutant sensitive to Gm; a future report will deal with the other two antibiotics. We show that the efficacy of Gm in killing stationary-phase E. coli is enhanced by the absence of not only σS but also of several σS-dependent proteins of antioxidant defense, that this loss leads to higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress upon Gm treatment, and that the antioxidant defense contributes to Gm resistance of E. coli also in vivo. In identifying new targets for enhancing the effectiveness of a widely used antibiotic, we address the worldwide public health threat posed by the increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance (22, 23). σs has been implicated in resistance of stationary-phase E. coli to bacteriostatic drugs by Kolodkin-Gal and Engelberg-Kulka but only in strains also missing the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system (24), which is not the case with the mechanism reported here. The MazF toxin was implicated as being responsible for the killing, but whether this toxin actually kills bacteria is controversial (25). Regardless, their studies dealt with a different class of antibiotics. There is currently a strong controversy concerning the role of oxidative stress in the toxicity of bactericidal drugs in exponential-phase E. coli (26–29). The stationary-phase bacteria differ from their exponential-phase counterparts not only as regards the σs-mediated changes noted above but also in other respects (30–32). Thus, as stationary-phase bacteria represent a physiological state very different from exponential-phase cells, this controversy is not germane to this study and is noted only in relevant contexts.MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and experimental design. The E. coli K-12 BW25113 strain and several of its isogenic gene knockout mutants from the Keio collection (33) were used, as well as our clinical isolate of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC strain AMG1) (34); its isogenic ΔrpoS mutant and double mutants of the Keio strain were generated as described previously (35). The knockouts were confirmed by PCR. To construct strains bearing a single copy of an sfiA-lacZ fusion to monitor oxidative stress intracellularly, bacteria were transfected with the sfiA-lacZ fusion cassette from the E. coli SY2 strain by P1vir (Coli Genetic Stock Center [CGSC], Yale University) transduction according to established protocols (36). Activation of the sfiA promoter (psfiA) was measured using a chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) β-galactosidase assay kit (G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer's protocol with modifications in the cell lysis procedure for bacteria (37). β-Galactosidase activity was normalized to the CFU/ml value. Bacteria were grown overnight to late stationary phase at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with shaking (200 rpm); the following morning, they were diluted to an A600 of 0.45 (1.3 × 109 cells/ml) in M9 minimal medium without glucose (34, 35) (referred to as M9 salts). Gm was added at 16 μg/ml; parallel controls were run without the drug. This drug concentration was chosen because in the experimental period, it had minimal effect on the viability of the wild type and clearly revealed the effect of various mutations on drug sensitivity. Gm at 16 μg/ml represents the MIC for resistant (R) Gram-negative bacteria. (Gm MICs for intermediate [I] and sensitive [S] strains are 8 and 4 μg/ml, respectively.) MIC values are determined for growing bacteria and represent concentrations that inhibit growth; in contrast, our work concerns stationary-phase bacteria, which are well known to be more resistant, and deals with bactericidal effects, which occur at higher concentrations than the MIC values (38). The suspensions were incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 h without shaking (unless otherwise indicated). Samples were drawn at specified times (as indicated in the text and in Table S1 in the supplemental material), serially diluted in M9 salts, and cultured on LB agar to determine CFU counts. For determining drug sensitivity under anoxic conditions, cell suspensions were incubated anaerobically in a GasPak EZ gas kit (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD). In vivo studies in mice, conducted according to Stanford University protocols, were done as described previously (39). Seven-week-old CBA/J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were acclimated to our animal facility for 1 week prior to the experiments. Transurethral inoculation of 107 CFU/50 μl/mouse was performed using wild-type UPEC AMG1 or its isogenic ΔrpoS mutant. LB-grown cultures of the two strains were diluted to 107 CFU/50 μl using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane, and their perinea were cleaned with 70% ethanol. To ensure that mouse bladders did not overflow during transurethral inoculation and to reduce urine output, the animals were deprived of water for 30 min prior to anesthesia administration and encouraged to void by scruffing and gentle pressure on the lower abdomen. Using PE10 polyethylene tubing-covered 30-gauge needles (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), the mice were transurethrally catheterized, and the inoculum was injected over 5 s. Immediately thereafter, mice were administered PBS alone or PBS with 50, 5, or 0.5 μg of Gm by subcutaneous injection, followed by four more doses every 2 h (total of five doses). Two days after infection, the animals were sacrificed by a combination of isoflurane overdose and cervical dislocation. Mouse bladders were removed aseptically and homogenized using sterile 1.6-mm stainless steel beads and a Bullet Blender homogenizer (Next Advance, Averill Park, NY). Suitably diluted samples of the bladder homogenate were used in CFU determinations on MacConkey agar.Proteomic analysis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-DiGE) was performed by Applied Biomics, Hayward, CA. Cells were grown and treated with Gm (48 h) as for viability determination. Frozen cell pellets were supplied to Applied Biomics. The company's protein extraction procedure entails use of 2D lysis buffer [7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8]. Equal amounts of samples of Gm-treated or untreated cells were labeled by CyDye Difference in DiGE fluorophores (size and charge matched). Isoelectric focusing was used in the first dimension, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used in the second. The gels were scanned using a Typhoon image scanner to reveal CyDye signals. ImageQuant software was used to generate single and overlay images, which were then subjected to DeCyder software analysis to determine differentially expressed protein spots. An Ettan Spot Picker was used to pick spots of interest, which were subsequently identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (protein or total ion confidence interval of 95% or higher). Only protein spots exhibiting >1.4-fold change under at least one of the conditions (e.g., treated/untreated wild type or the mutant) are included in Table 1. TABLE 1.

Underlining indicates proteins that were downregulated in the mutant compared to the wild type upon Gm treatment. w/o, without. ROS determination. To measure ROS by 3′-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) (490-nm excitation and 515-nm emission; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), suitably diluted stock solution of the dye with or without the antibiotic was added to cell suspensions (final HPF concentration, 5 μM) and incubated in the dark at 37°C. After 48 h, samples were vortexed, washed in ice-cold M9 salts, redissolved in 1/10 volume of M9 salts, and loaded in a 96-well black plate (Corning Costar, Tewksbury, MA). Fluorescence was measured in a Gemini SpectraMax fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Controls without HPF were used to correct for background fluorescence. See the Results section for further information. To measure H2O2, an Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell suspensions in the presence of Amplex Red reagents with or without Gm were loaded onto a black 96-well plate as described above. The samples were incubated at 37°C in a light shield enclosure. Fluorescence (excitation, 560; emission, 590 nm) of the suspension was measured at 2, 4, and 6 h.Visualization of cell dimensions. Antibiotic-treated and untreated cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 1/10 volume of ice-cold PBS. Five microliters of the samples was spotted on glass slides and allowed to air dry in a flow hood, followed by an overlay of the mounting medium (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). A glass coverslip was placed on the samples, and its edges were sealed with nail polish. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were visualized in a Zeiss AxioImager DIC microscope (Stanford Neuroscience Microscopy Service) at magnification settings of ×63, ×1.6, and ×10 (objective, Optovar, and eyepiece, respectively) and captured by an AxioCam HRm Rev 3 camera.NADP/NADPH ratio determination. NADP and NADPH levels were measured using a Fluoro NADP/NADPH Detection Kit (Cell Technology, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The cultures were prepared as described for antibiotic treatment. After incubation with gentamicin, NADP and NADPH were extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions; cells not treated with the drug were used as controls. A nonfluorescent reagent becomes reduced in the presence of NADPH to form NADP and a fluorescent analog. NADP is converted back to NADPH via an enzyme-coupled reaction, and the reaction proceeds back to the first step. Fluorescence was measured using a SpectraMax fluorescence plate reader (550-nm excitation; 595-nm emission). The protein concentration of each sample was determined after the fluorescence measurement for normalization.Protein carbonylation. Protein carbonylation was done as described before (40). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, the pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (150 μl; 200 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1% SDS), vortexed, and boiled (5 min); protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad detergent-compatible (DC) protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and adjusted to 100 μg/ml. Samples were derivatized by the addition of 1 volume of 12% SDS, followed by 2 volumes of 20 mM 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, mixed, and incubated at room temperature (30 min). Derivatization was stopped by the addition of 1.5 volumes of 2 M Tris in 30% glycerol. Samples were loaded onto a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and vacuum transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was blocked using 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, plus 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation (1 h) with rabbit anti-dinitrophenol antibody (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The membrane was washed with TBST and incubated with mouse anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (at 1:2,000 for 1 h) (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA). Bands were visualized using Kodak BioMax chemiluminescent film (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) after incubation of the membrane with an ECL kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Band intensity on the exposed film was quantified by ImageJ software ().alamarBlue reduction. Membrane fractions of cell extracts were prepared as described previously (41). Cells were grown overnight as described above and harvested by centrifugation (4,200 × g for 30 min at 4°C). The cell pellet was washed with ice-cold 6 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), resuspended in buffer of the same composition to an A600 of 75, and broken in a French press (20,000 lb/in2). Cell debris was removed by a low spin (11,000 × g for 50 min at 4°C). The supernatant was ultracentrifuged (165,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C) to pellet the membrane fraction, which was suspended in potassium phosphate buffer (6 mM, pH 7.0), and protein concentration was determined (Bradford method). The reaction mixture for alamarBlue (AB) reduction (250 μl) contained 100 μg of the membrane fraction protein, 10% AB, 0.1 μmol of NADH, 6 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and rotenone (1 μM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with or without Gm. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C in the dark for 20 min, followed by measurement of fluorescence (560-nm excitation and 590-nm emission wavelengths). Controls were devoid of cell extracts and generated no change in AB fluorescence.Statistical analyses. All experiments were done at least in triplicate. Statistical analyses were carried out by Student's t test.RESULTS Gm treatment is more lethal to, and causes greater oxidative stress in, the rpoS mutant of E. coli. Results presented throughout this paper refer to stationary-phase cells. As stated in the previous section, to determine viability, 16 μg/ml Gm was added to cell suspensions in M9 salts (without glucose) (34, 35, 42), and cells were incubated aerobically, followed by counting the CFU. (As stated in Materials and Methods, this drug concentration had minimal effect on the viability of the wild type and thus clearly revealed the drug's differential effects in the mutants.) Deletion of the rpoS gene (absence of σs) rendered E. coli (K-12 BW25113) (33) more sensitive to Gm: at 24 h of treatment, mutant survival was more than 2 logs less than that of the wild type (Fig. 1). As noted in the introduction, σs regulates GSR, which protects against diverse stresses (5–8), and since protein synthesis continued in the Gm-treated cells, we conducted proteomic analysis to attempt to determine the identity of the σs-controlled stress involved in protection against Gm. As expected (43), the loss of σs altered the level of several proteins (Table 1, control strains, ΔrpoS mutant versus wild type; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Gm affected these proteins differently in the wild type (Table 1, wild type with Gm versus wild type without Gm) and the mutant (Table 1, ΔrpoS mutant with Gm versus ΔrpoS mutant without Gm), with a large majority (in boldface) being upregulated in the wild type compared to the mutant, indicating that the former is more competent at activating the stress response upon Gm treatment. Furthermore, the data in Table 1 showing the differential effect of Gm treatment on the mutant compared to the wild type (Table 1, ΔrpoS mutant with Gm versus wild type with Gm) indicate that, among the proteins showing greater downregulation in the mutant, over 10 concerned antioxidant defense (underlined). We therefore examined if Gm treatment generated greater oxidative stress in the rpoS strain than in the wild type. FIG 1. Open in a new tab The ΔrpoS mutant of E. coli is more sensitive to Gm than the wild type (WT). Data presented here and subsequently are for stationary-phase cells. E. coli K-12, strain BW25113 was used, except where otherwise indicated. Gm was used at a concentration of 16 μg/ml with incubation at 37°C. Solid bars show mean log CFU counts per ml after Gm treatment for 24 h; striped bars represent untreated controls. The Student t test comparison is between drug-treated and untreated cells of the same strain. **, P < 0.01.Oxidative stress activates the bacterial SOS response, and this activation can be detected by the induction of the SOS-regulated promoter of the sfiA gene (psfiA) (44, 45). psfiA activation thus provides a means of detecting oxidative stress within the cell and can be monitored by the use of an sfiA-lacZ transcriptional fusion. We measured β-galactosidase activity in untreated controls and drug-treated cells. In both the wild-type and the ΔrpoS strains, psfiA showed a basal level of expression, which was greater in the mutant (Fig. 2A), indicating intrinsic oxidative stress that was more marked in the latter. This is consistent with the fact that ROS and oxidative stress are generated in the course of normal metabolism (due, for instance, to the leakage of O from the respiratory chain [46, 47]) and that the rpoS mutant is compromised in mitigating this innate stress (25). Gm treatment activated psfiA in both strains but to a much greater extent in the mutant, indicating that the latter experienced greater drug-mediated oxidative stress. FIG 2. Open in a new tab Gm treatment results in greater ROS levels in the ΔrpoS mutant. Solid bars represent Gm-treated cells, and striped bars represent untreated controls. (A) Activation of SOS response with and without Gm treatment in the wild type and the ΔrpoS mutant containing a single copy of the sfiA-lacZ fusion at 24 h, as monitored by β-galactosidase activity. (B) Representative differential interference contrast micrographs of cells of the two strains with and without 24-h Gm treatment (magnification, ×1,000; number of cells examined, ca. 10,000 of each strain). (C) Effect of 24-h Gm treatment on mean relative fluorescence units (RFU) of 3′-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) in cells of the two strains. (D) Effect of Gm treatment on H2O2 production by the two strains. H2O2 was measured in Gm-treated cells by Amplex Red at 2, 4, and 6 h; the area under the concentration-time curve for H2O2 at these time points is plotted and represents total cellular H2O2 generation during this time; a shorter treatment time was used for this measurement because intracellular H2O2 may be subject to decomposition (26). (E) Effect of 24-h Gm treatment on protein carbonylation in the two strains, as detected by slot blot analysis. Student's t test was used to compare Gm-treated and untreated cells of the same strain (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001) and untreated cells of the wild type and the mutant (††, P < 0.01; †††, P < 0.001).In exponential-phase cells, activation of the SOS response results in generation of elongated cells because it inhibits cell division (48). As stationary-phase bacteria are in stasis, the SOS response is unlikely to result in cell elongation, and indeed we found that the Gm-mediated activation of this response in the stationary-phase wild-type and the mutant strains did not alter cell morphology; differential interference contrast micrographs showed similar dimensions in treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2B). This was of interest to us for the following reason. The cell-penetrating dye 3′-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) is used in detecting oxidative stress, as it responds to HO· (49, 50), but recent studies have shown that it may give erroneous results in situations where cell size is increased as elongated cells have greater autofluorescence (51, 52). Since cell morphology did not change by Gm treatment, we used HPF as an additional method for comparing Gm-caused oxidative stress in the wild type and the ΔrpoS mutant. The results (Fig. 2C) agreed with the psfiA induction-based findings (Fig. 2A). There was HO· generation in the untreated cells, which was greater in the mutant, and the drug treatment increased its levels in both strains but to a greater extent in the latter. We also used Amplex Red, which measures H2O2 (29, 40), to further assess the Gm-caused oxidative stress. The results agreed with the above findings. That is, a basal level was seen in the untreated cells, which was greater in the mutant; it increased, also to a larger extent in the mutant, upon Gm treatment (Fig. 2D). A consequence of oxidative stress is protein carbonylation (53, 54), which we also examined to assess this stress in the two strains; Gm-mediated protein carbonylation was more pronounced in the mutant (Fig. 2E). Inaccuracy of ribosome function, which may result from Gm treatment, could conceivably also cause protein carbonylation (55), but this aspect would be the same in the wild type and the mutant. So it is reasonable to see enhanced carbonylation in the latter as due to greater oxidative stress.Use of an antioxidant and treatment under anoxia mitigate Gm lethality. If oxidative stress contributes to Gm lethality, it should be minimized by coadministration of an antioxidant. We used N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) to test this. Both the wild-type and the ΔrpoS strains were more tolerant of Gm when NAC was also administered, indicating that countering the oxidative stress was protective. The protection was more marked in the mutant (Fig. 3A), consistent with the greater oxidative stress that the drug generated in this strain (Fig. 2 and 3A). FIG 3. Open in a new tab Coadministration of N-acetyl cysteine (5 mg/ml) (A) and anaerobiosis (B) decrease Gm lethality in stationary-phase cells in both the wild type and the ΔrpoS mutant but to a greater extent in the latter. Bars show survival after 24 h of Gm treatment under the specified conditions. Asterisks indicate P values in comparisons of NAC treatment or anoxic effects within the same strains. *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001.Anaerobiosis prevents ROS formation. Would it also mitigate Gm toxicity? Gm uptake is mediated by the proton motive force (PMF), but PMF is decreased, not eliminated, under anaerobiosis as the ATP synthetase continues to extrude protons (56), and Gm retains lethality under these conditions (26). Gm exposure under anoxia had an effect similar to that of aerobic coadministration of NAC and Gm (Fig. 3B): the drug tolerance increased in both the wild type and the mutant but to a far greater extent in the latter (74-fold versus 2.3-fold in the wild type). Both strains retained sensitivity to the drug under these conditions, indicating the drug's ability to kill the bacteria by means other than the oxidative stress; this stress therefore augments, and does not replace, Gm killing by inhibition of protein synthesis.Absence of antioxidant proteins also renders E. coli more sensitive to Gm and prone to greater drug-mediated oxidative stress. Results with the rpoS mutant show that oxidative stress contributes to Gm toxicity. We wanted to determine whether compromising the E. coli antioxidant defense by other means would also result in greater drug sensitivity. We used mutants lacking the antioxidant proteins KatE (hydroperoxidase HPII [catalase]) and superoxide dismutase (SOD); these proteins decompose ROS (48) and were selectively downregulated in the drug-treated rpoS mutant (Table 1, ΔrpoS mutant with Gm versus wild type with Gm). The stationary-phase ΔkatE and ΔsodA mutants were not more sensitive to Gm (data not shown), possibly because of the redundancy of the antioxidant defense, where the absence of a protein can be functionally compensated by others (44, 46, 47, 57, 58). When the double mutants ΔsodA ΔsodB and ΔkatE ΔsodA were tested, increased sensitivity to the drug was indeed found (Fig. 4). FIG 4. Open in a new tab Deletion of ROS quencher proteins or PPP enzymes renders E. coli more sensitive to Gm. Effect of Gm treatment was determined as described in the legend of Fig. 1 on strains lacking ROS quencher proteins (ΔkatE ΔsodA and ΔsodA ΔsodB mutants) or PPP enzymes (Δzwf Δgnd and ΔtalA mutants). Solid bars represent the effect of Gm treatment; bars with stripes represent untreated controls. The effect of the drug on the wild type is reproduced from Fig. 1 for reference. Asterisks indicate P values for Gm-treated and untreated cells of the same strain. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.Catalase and SOD decompose ROS and require the reductant NADPH for their activity (48). A major source of NADPH in biological entities is the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and disruption of this pathway results in increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (59, 60). Two enzymes of this pathway, transketolase B (TktB) and transaldolase A (TalA), were also selectively downregulated by Gm in the ΔrpoS mutant (Table 1, ΔrpoS mutant with Gm versus the wild type with Gm), suggesting that a dearth of NADPH from inhibition of the PPP may have reinforced the greater Gm sensitivity of this strain. This possibility was supported by the fact that the NADP/NADPH ratio in the drug-treated rpoS mutant was higher than in the similarly treated wild type, with values of (3.00 ± 0.82)-fold versus (1.05 ± 0.04)-fold, respectively (n = 3; P < 0.05). To directly test if the PPP plays a role in Gm tolerance of stationary-phase E. coli, we tested mutants lacking selected enzymes of this pathway. The Δzwf and Δgnd mutants, lacking glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, respectively, exhibited marginally increased sensitivity (data not shown), and since the activity of these enzymes also can be supplanted by other proteins (61, 62), we tested a Δzwf Δgnd double mutant. This mutant was markedly more sensitive (Fig. 4). The ΔtalA mutant, missing the PPP enzyme transaldolase A, likewise showed increased Gm sensitivity, which was decreased by coadministration of NAC (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), implicating the contribution of oxidative stress in the mutant's increased vulnerability. That Gm treatment resulted in greater oxidative stress in the ΔsodA ΔsodB and Δzwf Δgnd mutants and the ΔtalA mutant was shown by psfiA induction and protein carbonylation results (Fig. 5). We note that whereas the activation of the SOS response appeared less intense in the Δzwf Δgnd mutant than in the ΔsodA ΔsodB mutant, the levels of protein carbonylation were similar in these strains. Such differences in expression of oxidative stress have been noted before and point to the complexity of the this stress: the different effectiveness levels of the radicals generated by these mutations in causing protein carbonylation, the fact that only some proteins are subject to carbonylation, and the downstream effects of the mutations on metabolic networks (26, 53, 54, 63). FIG 5. Open in a new tab Gm treatment generates greater oxidative stress in mutants lacking quencher or PPP proteins than in the wild type. (A) Activation of SOS response at 24 h, as monitored by measuring β-galactosidase activity after Gm treatment in the quencher (ΔsodA ΔsodB mutant) or PPP (Δzwf Δgnd mutant) class of mutants containing a single copy of the sfiA-lacZ fusion. (B) Effect of 24-h Gm treatment on protein carbonylation in the ΔsodA ΔsodB, Δzwf Δgnd, and ΔtalA mutants as detected by slot blot analysis. Data on the wild type are reproduced from Fig. 2 for comparison. Asterisks indicate P values for Gm-treated and untreated cells of the same strain (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001), and daggers represent comparisons between untreated cells of the wild type and the mutant (††, P < 0.01; †††, P < 0.001).The rpoS mutant of the uropathogenic strain of E. coli (UPEC) is more sensitive to Gm in a mouse model of bladder infection. To examine the clinical relevance of the above findings, we worked with the uropathogenic strain of E. coli (UPEC), AMG1 (34, 35), and its isogenic ΔrpoS mutant. UPEC causes infection of the urinary tract, and Gm is used in treating this disease. Gm caused greater killing and oxidative stress in the stationary-phase ΔrpoS mutant also of this strain in vitro (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). We used a mouse model (39) to examine whether this difference also occurred in vivo. As before, for these studies we sought a Gm concentration that would selectively affect the infective capability of the mutant and tested 50, 5, and 0.5 μg of the drug. Transurethrally injected stationary-phase wild-type and ΔrpoS mutant strains colonized the bladder of female CBA/J mice when no Gm was administered. Treatment with 50 or 5 μg of drug prevented colonization by both strains, but 0.5 μg prevented bladder colonization by the mutant only (Fig. 6A). Administration of NAC intraperitoneally 1 h before the bacterial injection enabled the mutant to colonize the bladder at this Gm concentration (Fig. 6B), showing that diminished oxidative stress made the mutant more resistant to the drug. (Controls receiving PBS instead of NAC showed no difference.) We interpret this to show that, at higher concentrations, the ability of Gm to disrupt protein synthesis is strong enough not to be affected by the defective antioxidant defense of the mutant, but at a low concentration, the drug relies also on the added effect of oxidative stress to be effective. A strong enough attack on elements of the E. coli antioxidant defense, for example, by small-molecule inhibitors of the proteins identified above, should therefore enhance Gm effectiveness in combating this disease and permit the use of lower drug concentrations, thereby minimizing drug side effects such as nephrotoxicity (64, 65). FIG 6. Open in a new tab Gm compromises ability of the ΔrpoS mutant of UPEC (AMG1) to colonize female mouse bladder. Bladder infections in mice were initiated using stationary-phase wild-type or ΔrpoS mutant bacteria of the AMG1 strain. The mice were treated with 0, 0.5, 5, or 50 μg of Gm (A) or after N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; 10 mg/kg) administration (B). Data are presented as box-and-whisker plots which depict maximum, 75th percentile, median, 25th percentile, and minimum values of each group. For the experiment depicted in panel B, NAC was given as a single 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal dose 1 h before infection. Gm was administered at the time of infection and every 2 h thereafter for five doses of 0.5 μg. For statistical analysis, the data were transformed into log10 values to equalize group variance. Student's t test was performed using the transformed data (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, between groups as indicated).Source of ROS. The increase in ROS upon Gm treatment is accompanied by a diminished antioxidant defense, and this increase can result from the decreased quenching of ROS generated in the course of normal metabolism (46, 47, 66). In exponential-phase E. coli, Kohanski et al. (49) implicated bactericidal drug-mediated stimulation of respiration and the resulting increase in leakage of ROS from the respiratory chain and accompanying effects as the source of elevated ROS in drug-treated cells. This notion was challenged (28, 29), but recently Dwyer et al. (26) have presented strong evidence for this possibility, using a dynamic method for measuring the cellular oxygen consumption rate. To test whether Gm stimulates electron leakage from the respiratory chain in stationary phase, we used another approach. Rotenone inhibits electron transfer from iron-sulfur centers in complex I to quinone of the respiratory chain, causing accumulation of electrons in the intermembrane space, which results in ROS generation (67, 68). The redox indicator dye alamarBlue (AB) can accept these electrons and, due to the resulting change in its fluorescence, can act as a reporter of this accumulation (69). We used the particulate fraction of cell extracts of stationary-phase E. coli, which contains the cell membrane and the electron transport chain and is essentially devoid of soluble (nonmembrane) cell constituents (41), and measured AB reduction in reaction mixtures containing rotenone with and without Gm. There was a basal level of AB reduction without Gm, consistent with the other results presented here showing intrinsic ROS generation in cells not treated with the drug (Fig. 7). AB reduction was enhanced in the presence of Gm, which is consistent with the possibility that this drug stimulates electron leakage from the respiratory chain, leading to ROS formation. FIG 7. Open in a new tab Gm increases electron leakage from the respiratory chain. Relative fluorescence units (RFU) of alamarBlue are shown for the membrane fraction of cell extracts of stationary-phase E. coli (BW25113) containing rotenone without (CE, for cell extract) and with (CE+Gm) Gm. ***, P < 0.001. See the text for further details.DISCUSSION As noted, stationary-phase bacteria play critical roles in disease causation, and it is important to develop means for their control (3, 4, 11–15, 17, 18, 70), which is addressed in this study. The rpoS mutant of the two E. coli strains examined here exhibited greater Gm sensitivity than the wild type (Fig. 1). Although this is reported so far only for 24 h of Gm treatment, we determined this for the rpoS mutant and selected other mutants after 48 and 72 h of Gm treatment. While increased drug exposure time generated greater killing of all strains, the mutants continued to show greater sensitivity (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Proteomic analysis (Table 1) suggested that the increased Gm sensitivity of the stationary-phase rpoS mutant to Gm was due to a compromised antioxidant defense. Three different methods of analysis were used: activation of the SOS response, which is a hallmark of the oxidative stress (48) that we monitored by a genetic reporter assay involving psfiA; the use of cell-penetrating dye HPF, which measures HO· (49, 50); and the use of Amplex Red, which responds to H2O2 (29, 40). The analysis did indeed show that Gm treatment resulted in greater ROS formation in the rpoS mutant than in the wild type, and this was backed up by the greater drug-mediated protein carbonylation in the mutant (Fig. 2), another indication of oxidative stress (25). The HPF method for assessing ROS generation by bactericidal drugs in exponential-phase bacteria has been deemed to be unsuitable as the alteration in cell dimensions distorts the results (51, 52); since Gm treatment had no such effect in stationary-phase cells, this is not relevant here. It was also reported that HPF fluorescence is reversible (29), but this is now shown not to be the case (26). Dwyer et al. (26) have advocated the use of the Amplex Red method to measure H2O2 within the cells rather than its excreted counterpart, which has been the standard approach (29, 40, 71, 72), but in the stationary-phase cells that were used here, the standard method was reliable and gave the same overall results as the other methods (Fig. 2). That the increased oxidative stress in the ΔrpoS mutant contributed to increased Gm lethality of this strain is shown by the fact that the drug toxicity was significantly mitigated when Gm treatment accompanied the administration of the antioxidant NAC or when cells were exposed to Gm under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. Experiments with the uropathogenic strain of E. coli (AMG1) (34, 35) in a mouse urinary tract infection (UTI) model showed that this is the case also in vivo: Gm at a low concentration compromised the ability of the UPEC rpoS mutant to colonize female mouse bladder but not when the antioxidant NAC was also administered (Fig. 6). Additional evidence bolsters the conclusion that an intact antioxidant defense is important in Gm tolerance of stationary-phase E. coli. Thus, disrupting this defense by the elimination of the quencher proteins SodA/SodB or KatE/SodA also subjected these bacteria to greater Gm-mediated oxidative stress (Fig. 5) and increased lethality (Fig. 4). It has been shown that the combined loss of SodA and SodB renders exponential-phase E. coli also more sensitive to certain bactericidal drugs (58), but it has not been previously shown in stationary-phase cells nor in the context of the σs-regulated stress response. The loss of Zwf/Gnd or of the TalA protein of the PPP, which supplies the NADPH that fuels the quencher proteins and is a well-established part of the antioxidant defense (59, 60), also imposed greater oxidative stress (Fig. 5) and rendered the cells more sensitive to the drug (Fig. 4); this sensitivity too was minimized by NAC coadministration (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the PPP has been implicated in resistance to a bactericidal drug. This pathway also supplies pentoses required in ribosome function, and its disruption and the resulting potential pentose scarcity may have also contributed to enhanced Gm lethality in these mutants by exacerbating inhibition of protein synthesis. The NAC effect, however, clearly affirms the role of oxidative stress. The mutants of both the quencher and PPP classes showed different degrees of increase in Gm sensitivity (Fig. 4). This is unsurprising, given that the quencher proteins involved likely differ in decomposing the major reactive species generated by Gm and that the mutational loss of a vital function can activate metabolic networks with different capacities to compensate for it (73, 74). Other findings also point to the fact that Gm generates oxidative stress. Thus, in mice, this drug significantly increases kidney myeloperoxidase activity, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation. It has been shown that the resulting acute renal failure is caused by ROS, and the use of M40403, which is a low-molecular-weight mimetic of superoxide dismutase, attenuates this damage (64, 65, 75). Similarly, proteomic analysis implicates Gm-mediated oxidative stress in Leishmania since the proteins affected by drug exposure included the thiol-redox control system (76). Furthermore, it was shown that Gm-mediated ROS production can enhance the effectiveness of drugs like camptothecin and digitoxin against the lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 (77). It needs to be emphasized that the established mechanism of Gm action on bacteria is not questioned by these data; instead, they show that an additional mechanism—oxidative stress—has a role in the lethality of this drug in stationary-phase cells. It is clear that neither NAC nor anaerobiosis rendered the drug harmless (Fig. 3), and it was only at a low dose of Gm that the administration of NAC was needed to bolster the colonizing ability of the rpoS mutant (Fig. 6). Other factors were therefore involved, and it is logical to assume that inhibition of protein synthesis continued to have a key role in the toxicity of the drug. This study, however, has detected new targets to enhance the effectiveness of Gm. Even though some of the proteins implicated have mammalian orthologues, sufficient differences exist between the pro- and eukaryotic proteins that selective targeting of the former should be possible. As regards the source of increased ROS in Gm-treated cells, our data implicate two possibilities. One is endogenous ROS. As stated, normal metabolic processes generate ROS; these species leak out of the electron transport chain during respiration, and many metabolic products, e.g., quinonoid compounds, are subject to redox cycling that generates these radicals (46, 49, 66, 78). A dynamic balance between the ROS so generated and their decomposition by the cellular antioxidant defense keeps the endogenous ROS at a low level (47, 78). As we have seen (Fig. 2), in non-drug-treated cells, compromising the antioxidant defense by the elimination of σS or the σS-dependent quencher proteins tilted this balance to a higher steady-state ROS level. The increased ROS in the drug-treated cells accompanied a weakened antioxidant defense; therefore, this increase may just reflect insufficient quenching of the endogenous ROS. An additional mechanism, indicated by the AB results, is stimulation of ROS leakage from the respiratory chain by Gm. This possibility is in agreement with the findings of the Dwyer et al. and Kohanski et al. in exponential-phase cells (26, 49). A third possibility that remains to be explored is that the bactericidal drugs themselves can redox cycle (79, 80), generating extra ROS. A few comments on the current controversy on the role of ROS in bactericidal drug toxicity are in order. Several studies have hinted at the possibility that in bacteria in this phase, these drugs, in addition to damaging their established targets, also injure the cells by generating ROS (81–85), and a mechanistic basis for ROS generation by the drugs was presented for E. coli by the Kohanski et al. (49) involving as noted above, stimulation of respiration. Three subsequent studies not only questioned the proposed mechanism but also ruled out the contribution of ROS in the lethality of these drugs (27–29). This has evoked a response from Dwyer et al., by and large reinstating their original conclusions (26). One possible explanation for the conflicting findings relates to the growth stage. Liu and Imlay (29) used very early exponential-phase cells (optical density [OD] of 0.05 to 0.2), while Dwyer et al. (26) may have studied cells grown to a much higher density. It has been shown that the σs-mediated stress response begins already in advanced exponential phase (86), and it may be that the ROS role found by Dwyer et al. is due to some commonality with stationary-phase cells. Be that as it may, the disagreement is not relevant to this study, which deals with bacteria in confirmed stationary phase, representing, as stated, a very different physiological state than cells in the exponential phase (7–10, 13, 31, 32).Supplementary Material Supplemental material supp_58_10_5964__index.html (1,012B, html) ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank C.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Environmental adaptation is paramount to survival from the whole organism down to the cellular level, and a key component of this process is recognizing and responding to physical stimuli. Mechanotransduction is an evolutionarily conserved process that describes the conversion of mechanical stimuli into cellular signaling (1,2). This process informs how we perceive and respond to everyday life, from sensory information like touch, balance and proprioception, to cellular adaptation responses such as muscular hypertrophy, where mechanical loads initiate downstream signaling cascades that alter cellular behavior (3–6). Mechanosensation mechanisms, or the processes by which cells detect and recognize mechanical stimuli, remain an area of rigorous study in many fields. Cells concurrently utilize myriad mechanisms to recognize mechanical stimuli, such as stretch-gated ion channels, chemical or force-mediated conformational changes of the cytoskeleton, molecular transport through channel proteins like gap junctions, hemichannels, and pannexins, and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (7–20). Another such mechanosensation mechanism is the loading-induced development of small, transient discontinuities in the cell membrane called plasma membrane disruptions (PMD) (21). These PMD can be induced through several different mechanisms, including but not limited to exposure of the cell to physical deformation, debris, or fluid shear stress (12,22–25). Once formed, PMD initiate mechanotransduction signaling cascades similar to other known mechanosensation mechanisms (4,12,25–35). PMD facilitate the release of secondary messengers including ATP, nitric oxide (NO), and various growth factors (e.g., fibroblast growth factors) (34,36,37). Mechanotransduction can also be induced by transmission of signals from PMD-affected cells to nearby, non-wounded neighboring populations, providing a mechanism by which signaling from a small population of wounded cells may be amplified. For example, in MDCK kidney epithelial cells, PMD induced a paracrine purinergic signaling event that increased cyclic AMP synthesis in neighboring cells (34,35). Following PMD, neighboring cells displayed an initial decrease in cAMP, before experiencing a transient ATP-dependent increase in cAMP. In wounded cells, cAMP activity increases membrane repair rate, in anticipation of repetitive disruptions (38). The increased cAMP signaling in neighboring cells has been hypothesized to play a protective role in response to PMD events in nearby cells by preparing for their own PMD events to subsequently occur. Resealing of PMD is necessary for cell survival, as without resealing, the cell is vulnerable to an unregulated influx of cytosolic toxins (such as calcium and oxidants) while simultaneously allowing ATP and proteins to escape (4,25,27,28,32,34–36,39–50). PMD repair (which will be discussed in the next section) therefore represents a fundamental, biological response to cell injury (4,6,12,29,30,33,51,52). Mechanosensitive cell populations utilize PMD-initiated signaling cascades to coordinate inflammatory mediators, release of secondary messengers, and recruitment of repair machinery to the site of the disruption and to initiate subsequent downstream signaling events. Calpains, annexins, growth factors, and NO have all been reported to play roles in signaling downstream of PMD in multiple types of mechanosensitive tissues (12,25,34–36,48,53–55). PMD have been detected in skin, alveolar, kidney, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocyte fibroblasts and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal myocytes, neurons, and most recently in the periodontal ligament cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes of the skeletal system (4,12,25,30,31,33,35,52,56) (Figure 1). A common feature of these cell types is that they are regularly exposed to varying magnitudes of shear stress (9,57–62). For example, epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract are affected by gut motility, which subjects the tract to compressive and shear stresses (29). Likewise, aortic endothelial cells are exposed to shear stress as blood circulates through the body (33,63), and osteocytes are exposed to fluid shear within the lacunocanalicular system (64,65). This review will address the similarities and differences between PMD in mechanosensitive tissues, with a focus on bone, comparing repair mechanisms, downstream signaling pathways, and the implications of these properties for disease states.

Conclusion In conclusion, this review has highlighted that PMD are a key mechanosensation mechanism in the processes by which mechanosensitive mammalian cells detect and respond to mechanical loading in their environment. While bone may be the most recently discovered tissue to develop and respond to PMD with loading, it is notable that all responses downstream of PMD in bone cells discovered thus far are consistent with PMD responses reported in other mechanosensitive tissues like epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and myocytes. Thus, PMD formation and repair may represent a novel mechanosensation pathway in bone and a target for modifying skeletal adaptation signaling in osteocytes, such as strategies aimed at improving bone mechanosensitivity with aging.",

Figure 1. Open in a new tab Tissues and cell types in which plasma membrane disruptions (PMD) have been observed. Figure created with BioRender.com.2. Generalized PMD repair mechanisms PMD resealing is the outcome of an active, dynamic mechanism that is heavily reliant on a series of cytoplasmic components, including membranes, the cytoskeleton, and repair proteins (34–36,41,54,66–68). While some aspects of PMD development and repair are cell-type specific, the majority of known PMD repair processes follow a core set of basic principles (69,70). The first and immediate response of any cell to a PMD event is an influx of extracellular fluid, which under physiological conditions contains an abundance of calcium (Ca2+). The resealing mechanism initiated to repair a PMD is dependent upon its size. With very small PMD (< 1 nm), the exposure of the hydrophobic domains within the lipid bilayer results in rapid resealing of the membrane via diffusion of the lipids surrounding the PMD site (21,71–73); this resealing process is calcium-independent. However, in eukaryotic cells the plasma membrane is tethered to an underlying cytoskeleton, which produces an opposing membrane tension force (proportional to the disruption diameter cubed) that impedes spontaneous repair once the disruption exceeds a certain size (21). In mammalian cells, Ca2+-initiated de-polymerization of cortical actin in the cytoskeleton is a prerequisite for PMD resealing (54,66,68,74,75). Disassembly and reassembly of microtubules also occurs in a Ca2+-dependent fashion following a PMD (48). Uniform across mechanisms linked to mechanically induced PMD is the requirement of extracellular Ca2+ to initiate plasma membrane repair (32,43). Ca2+-dependent exocytosis induces a decrease in membrane tension leading to resealing via lipid diffusion of small disruptions (10 to 100 nm in size) (49,76). Larger PMD (up to microns in size) rely on calcium-dependent exocytosis vesicle-vesicle and vesicle-plasma membrane fusion events to repair the damaged membrane (46,47,53). It has been proposed that during repair of large PMD, intracellular membranes form a “patch”, which then fuses to the plasma membrane surrounding the defect site (21,32) (Figure 2). Other proposed repair mechanisms, which vary across cell types and with PMD size, include caveolae-mediated constriction of the membrane around the disruption site, budding and blebbing of the wound site, and endocytosis of the PMD via invagination of caveolar vesicles (21,77–79). These repair mechanisms integrate with utilization of molecular motors and annexin proteins such as Annexin A1, A5, and A6 (41,53,80). A recent publication, using an array of visualization techniques (high-speed atomic force microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulation) demonstrated that Annexin A5’s particular role in PMD repair is to stabilize membrane defects so that subsequent vesicle-fusion resealing processes can occur (81). In contrast, Annexin A6’s role in PMD repair has been hypothesized to involve promoting the folding and curvature of the extensions of cell, helping to refill the membrane disruption (82). Figure 2: Open in a new tab Generalized molecular mechanisms and relative time frame for PMD repair. Figure created with BioRender.com.Protein machinery is recruited to the site of PMD repair. In the immediate aftermath of a physiological PMD event, increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels activates proteins including calpains and nitric oxide synthase. Various growth factors (e.g., fibroblast growth factors, FGFs), may also be released and promote tissue adaptation responses (43). Depending on the repair mechanism employed, additional protein machinery may accumulate about the PMD site such as ALG-2 interacting protein X (ALIX), charged multivesicular body protein (CHMP), vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4 (Vsp4), and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT, particularly ESCRT III) proteins (32,34,36,40,46,79,83). SNAP Receptor (SNARE) proteins, comprised of syntaxins, soluble N-ethylmaleamide attachment proteins (SNAPs), and vesicle associated membrane proteins (VAMPs) are thought to drive membrane fusion (83–85) (Figure 2). Calpains are a critical component of PMD repair at this stage, as calpain small subunit (Capns) knockout cells demonstrated repair failure; calpains facilitate localized remodeling of the cytoskeleton at the site of the PMD, removing exposed cytoskeleton from the site of PMD and clearing the way for exocytotic vesicular fusion to reseal the cell membrane (54,67,68) (Figure 2). Within one to two minutes after formation of the PMD, the cytoskeletal network is re-established and the cell returns to normal function (49,79,86,87). Interestingly, a cell experiencing a second PMD soon after the first will reseal the latter PMD more quickly than the initial disruption (76,88) due to an increased amount of exocytosis triggered by the second insult to the plasma membrane; this process is dependent on signaling molecules like protein kinase C and protein kinase A (23,76,88). For more information on generalized PMD repair mechanisms, the reader is referred to several previously published reviews (21,71–73).3. Cell specific PMD repair and signaling pathways In this next section, we will describe the process of PMD formation, repair, and associated signaling cascades initiated by PMD that have been documented across several types of mechanosensitive tissues. Relevance to disease states and potential therapeutics, when known, will also be described. 3.1. Epithelial cell and fibroblast PMD Epithelial cells are often directly subjected to environmental mechanical forces, and these loading scenarios can lead to formation of PMD. For example, mechanical brushing of the gingivae and tongue induced PMD in the oral cavity of rats, which increased expression of the mechanically responsive transcription factor c-fos in junctional epithelial cells (89). Likewise, keratinocyte epithelial cells in the skin developed PMD when mechanically lifted from the substratum (90). This process activated phospholipase D (particularly the phospholipase D2 isoform), an enzyme involved in membrane trafficking. Additionally, keratinocyte PMD repair was inhibited in the presence of phospholipase D inhibitors, suggesting that induction of phospholipase D activity is critical for keratinocyte membrane repair mechanisms (90). Carrying these studies in vivo, provision of phosphatidylglycerol (a lipid signal generated by phospholipase D) to a mouse full-thickness skin biopsy wound enhanced the rate of wound healing (90). In addition to skin and oral cavity epithelial cells, PMD have been observed in the mucosal epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial cells and keratocytes in the cornea, alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, renal proximal tubular epithelium, and in epithelial breast cancer cell lines. Epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract are subjected to compressive and shear stresses during gut motility that can lead to PMD formation (29). In rat gastric epithelial cells, an apparent reduction in F-actin was visualized at disruption sites and flow cytofluorometric analysis of the cytoskeleton using phalloidin staining showed that this decrease in F-actin was Ca2+- dependent (74). PMD formation in gastric mucous epithelial cells promoted mucous secretion both in isolated cells and in organ culture models, and both PMD repair and the resulting mucous secretion were Ca2+-dependent (63). Carbohydrate-binding lectin proteins, which can be toxic following ingestion, impaired PMD repair in gastric epithelial cells; this was suggested as a novel form of protein-based toxicity that could explain mechanisms of lectin-associated food poisoning (91). Corneal epithelial cells develop PMD, which reseal via vesicular fusion events, in response to ultrasound exposure (52). Likewise, corneal keratocyte fibroblasts develop PMD from rubbing motions (i.e., rubbing the eye), and these PMD initiate Ca2+ signaling both in the wounded cell and in non-wounded adjacent cells (22). In the lung, PMD in alveolar epithelial cells have been hypothesized to play a role in ventilator-induced lung injury (92,93). The protein tripartite motif containing 72 (TRIM72) is critical for repair of lung alveolar epithelial cells following induction of PMD (94), where TRIM72-mediated repair inhibited stretch-induced p53 activation by promoting its proteasomal degradation, consequently reducing cell apoptosis (95). A recent report demonstrated that MDA-MB-231 breast cancer epithelial cells developed PMD during migration associated with metastatic invasion, and that annexin proteins, particular Annexin A5 and A6, were critical to the repair of these PMD (96). Moreover, silencing Annexin A5 and A6 via shRNA impaired PMD repair in these cells and led to cell death, suggesting a potential novel avenue for preventing cancer metastasis (96). Specialized secondary messengers, such as NF-kB, are activated following the induction of a PMD in epithelial cells (70).3.2. Endothelial cell PMD Caveolae play an important stabilizing role in endothelial cell membranes subjected to physiological hemodynamic forces, where disassembly of caveolae protects against PMD formation during loading (97). Not surprisingly, endothelial cells from caveolin 1-null mice were more susceptible to PMD formation when challenged with increased cardiac output from treatment with dobutamine (97). Using endogenous albumin as a PMD tracer, approximately 6.5% (ranging from 1.4 to 17.9% across a group of n=14 animals) of aortic endothelial cells in young male Sprague-Dawley CD rats presented with PMD under baseline in vivo conditions (33). These PMD occurred in longitudinal streaks aligned along the axis of blood flow or in clusters around vascular bifurcations. Surprisingly, the abundance of endothelial cell PMD did not increase with exercise, although sample sizes were quite small (n=5 exercised animals) to detect this change (33), suggesting further study would be necessary before forming conclusions regarding the role of exercise in vascular endothelial PMD formation. Endothelial cells produce and respond to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), also known as FGF2. Interestingly, bFGF lacks a key signaling peptide required for exocytotic export, and therefore is believed to be released primarily via PMD (36). It has been proposed that PMD-induced release of bFGF from endothelial cells promotes proliferation either in the wounded cell or in adjacent non-wounded neighboring cells (33).3.3. Neuron PMD Traumatic brain injury (TBI), caused by high strain rate loading, induces PMD in neurons (98–103). As one example, a 2 atmosphere central fluid percussion injury in rats led to detection of PMD in more than half of the neurons in layers V and VI of the lateral neocortex soon after injury (104). These PMD, also referred to as “mechanoporation” (101,104) occur in both focal and diffuse models of TBI immediately upon induction of the injury (103–105). The severity of the injury correlates with the number of PMD formed, and PMD are formed in the areas of highest principal strain and shear stress in the tissue (98,101). In the event of PMD repair failure, neurons experience uncontrolled calcium influx, ATP dysregulation, and eventual cell death (100,106). However, some wounded neurons are capable of PMD repair, particularly in diffuse TBI models (100,107). For example, in rats subjected to a diffuse TBI (450 g weight dropped from 2 m onto a metallic helmet affixed to the rat’s skull), approximately 40% of the neurons with PMD at 4 hours after wounding demonstrated an ability to reseal the disruption and presented with normal cellular morphology (107). Interestingly, several studies suggest that PMD formation in neurons following a TBI is biphasic, where an additional population of neurons develop PMD as a secondary (non-mechanical) event in the hours to days after injury (104,107).3.4. Myocyte PMD Skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle have both been reported to develop PMD with in vitro and in vivo mechanical loading (25,108–110). Skeletal muscle myocytes are particularly prone to injury during eccentric loading, when actively contracting against a lengthening stretch (4,111). Conversely, at least one human study suggests that PMD formation in skeletal muscle is reduced during simulated microgravity (112). In addition to their role in genetic myopathy conditions such as muscular dystrophy, myocyte PMD explain the physiologically relevant immediate loss of muscle’s capacity for force production after high force exercise (4). PMD are also critical effectors in cardiac muscle. Ischemic-reperfusion injuries, which can occur following stroke or heart attack, induce PMD (113,114). Like bone cells (115), myocytes increase expression of c-fos following exposure to mechanical loading as part of their hypertrophic response (116–118), and formation of PMD is required for this to occur (25). PMD in muscle have also been shown to be critical for release of bFGF / FGF2; this has been hypothesized to be an important mode of bone-muscle crosstalk during musculoskeletal hypertrophy (119). PMD repair in myocytes requires Annexin A5 (80) and A6 (82). Lipid-directed antioxidant activity, such as the antioxidant Vitamin E or the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), is also required for both in vitro and in vivo myocyte membrane repair, as long-term dietary vitamin E deficiency or knockout of the GPx4 enzyme led to PMD repair failure (42,120). Myocyte PMD repair is impaired in microgravity, as acute microgravity exposure (parabolic flight) inhibited membrane-membrane fusion events in human myoblasts (121). Dysferlin, a calcium-sensitive protein important for vesicle fusion, is recruited to the PMD site in skeletal and cardiac muscle (66,122), where it is eventually cleaved by calpain 1 and 2 (54,68). Dysferlin deficiency impairs tethering of lysosomes to the cell membrane, resulting in impaired lysosome exocytosis that delays PMD repair (123). Mitsugumin 53 (MG53), also known as TRIM72, is a member of the tripartite motif family that is also critical for muscle PMD repair (108,124,125), as it accumulates in the membrane at the PMD site and recruits vesicles needed for resealing of the disruption (124). MG53-deficient myocytes are unable to repair PMD, which may explain why MG53 knockout led to progressive myopathy and myocardial damage in vivo (108,124,125). Changes in processes of myocyte PMD formation and repair are associated with muscular disorders. In humans, dietary deficiency in Vitamin E is associated with skeletal myopathy and frailty, particularly in the elderly; this is consistent with Vitamin E’s critical role in myocyte plasma membrane repair (120,126). Similarly, mutations in the myocyte PMD repair-associated protein dysferlin result in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (109,127) and cardiomyopathy (110). The propensity for myocyte PMD formation and repair is altered in patients with Duchene’s Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the spectrin family member dystrophin (128). Dystrophin is a cytoskeletal structural protein that provides support for the plasma membrane and links the plasma membrane to the extracellular matrix (129). Absence of dystrophin in DMD results in increased susceptibility to PMD development and a reduced chance of surviving the disruption, thereby increasing post-wounding myocyte death that leads to muscle atrophy (129,130). In the mdx mouse model of DMD, dystrophin-deficient mice developed significantly greater PMD under conditions of normal cage activity and following mechanical loading from exercise (131,132). These data suggest an intriguing role for dystrophin and the spectrin family of proteins in mechanosensation. Several studies suggest that enhancing plasma membrane stability and repair, via treatment with Poloxamer 188 (also known as Pluronic F-68), can abrogate myopathy phenotypes in dystrophin- and dysferlin-deficient mice (133–137). However, conflicting reports also exist (138,139), suggesting that further research into the potential benefit of Poloxamer 188 therapy in PMD-associated disorders is required.3.5. Bone cell PMD We (12,24,140) and others (30,141,142) have shown that various cell populations within the skeletal system likely utilize PMD as a mechanism to sense mechanical stimuli. In teeth, mechanical forces initiated by chewing induce PMD in periodontal ligament cells, which promotes release of factors that may affect bone remodeling like IL-113 and bFGF (142). In the appendicular skeleton, it is commonly understood that fluid shear within the lacunocanalicular system is a primary stimulus for the mechanobiological responses of bone, and that osteocytes sense this fluid shear via their dendritic processes (62,143,144). Osteocytes likely utilize many different mechanosensation mechanisms to respond to mechanical loads, where the magnitude of loading (i.e., level of strain) may dictate which mechanism dominates (7,10,12,14,145–150). However, consistent with the processes described above, we have shown that osteocytes develop PMD in response to mechanical loading both in vitro and in vivo, and that these PMD occur on the osteocyte’s dendritic processes (Figure 3) (12). This work was verified by an independent laboratory, who showed that PMD formation can also occur in osteoblasts (141). Figure 3: Plasma membrane disruption (PMD) formation and repair in osteocytes. Open in a new tab A) PMD formation in osteocytes is hypothesized to occur via drag forces from fluid flow acting on the pericellular matrix of the osteocyte. B) Magnified view of an osteocyte dendritic process with a PMD, demonstrating mechanisms of PMD formation, downstream signaling, and repair triggered by influx of extracellular calcium through the PMD. Figure created with BioRender.com.In osteocytes, PMD likely form in response to the drag forces induced by fluid shear on the osteocyte pericellular matrix (i.e., glycocalyx) (24) (Figure 3). This is evidenced by the fact that osteocyte PMD are most readily formed by in vitro fluid shear when cells have been cultured for at least 3 or 4 days prior to loading (unpublished observation), consistent with the timeframe needed for pericellular matrix deposition (151). Furthermore, removal of the pericellular matrix with hyaluronidase negated fluid shear-induced osteocyte PMD formation (24). Osteocyte PMD formation is also dependent upon the loading profiles to which the cells are exposed. Most in vitro osteocyte mechanobiology studies utilize fluid shear stresses of less than 20 dynes/cm2, and osteocyte PMD formation is not robust at these levels of loading (12). However, modeling- and tracer-based studies suggest that osteocytes experience much higher shear stresses in vivo (between 30 to 70 dynes/cm2) due to amplification from lacunocanalicular geometry (64,152), and in line with this concept, osteocyte PMD formation was abundant within this range of shear stresses (12). Therefore, PMD may represent a mechanosensation mechanism that is preferentially activated in higher intensity loading scenarios. Consistent with this hypothesis, PMD are only formed in osteocytes when a fluid shear load is applied rapidly; gradual application of shear (such as through a ramped approach to a peak shear stress) prevents the formation of osteocyte PMD (12). Notably, this harmonizes with the previously published finding that osteocytes require a “stress kick” to respond to fluid shear, where a gradual onset of loading blunts downstream mechanotransduction events like release of nitric oxide (153). PMD induce intracellular Ca2+ signaling, release of ATP, and upregulation of c-fos in bone cells (12,141); analysis of other downstream mechanotransduction responses is currently ongoing. Following induction of a PMD in osteoblasts or osteocytes, extracellular Ca2+ rushes into the cell and triggers release of intracellular Ca2+ stores (12,24,140). Increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels activate PLC/PKC signaling, initiating repair of the PMD via Ca2+/PLC/PKC-dependent vesicular exocytosis of ATP (141) (Figure 3). The increased PKC levels “prime” the vesicular pathway, and over time and multiple cycles of mechanical stress, influence the resilience and sensitivity of the cell’s response to mechanical stimulation (141,154). Vesicular fusion is promoted by Ca2+/PLC/PKC-dependent exocytosis in bone, similar to its role described in the resealing of PMD in other cell types (35,141). The PKC isoform PKCμ, also known as Prkd1, was particularly identified as critical for mediating PMD repair in bone cells (Figure 3) (141). The rate of PMD repair in osteocytes can be altered, and doing so can affect downstream signaling (12,140). As one example, enhancing osteocyte PMD repair rate via Vitamin E supplementation, while beneficial for cell survival, blunted the downstream mechanotransduction response (12). Carrying this in vivo, male mice fed a Vitamin E-deficient diet developed more PMD with loading, and showed an increased bone formation response to exercise, as compared to mice fed a control diet (140). PMD formation and repair-related mechanisms may underlie some of the changes in bone mechanobiology with aging, where aged bone becomes less responsive to a given level of loading (155). Bone’s mechanosensing osteocytes are lost with aging, and surviving osteocytes demonstrate impaired mechanotransduction (156,157). Consistent with this idea, we recently reported that osteocytes from old mice developed fewer PMD from fluid shear than cells from young mice, and old mice developed fewer osteocyte PMD during exercise in vivo (24). This was due at least in part to decreased pericellular matrix production with age, as pericellular matrix was critical for osteocyte PMD formation, and aged osteocytes produced approximately half of the pericellular matrix levels detected in young osteocytes (24). Quite surprisingly, PMD repair rate was faster in old as compared to young osteocytes (24). This observation was associated with a blunted calcium wave propagation to adjacent non-wounded osteocytes and was attributed to increased oxidative stress with age. As oxidative stress impairs osteocyte PMD repair and subsequent cellular survival (158), it was hypothesized that increased oxidative stress during aging promoted a progressive loss in slower- repairing osteocytes consistent with both osteocyte loss and impaired mechanosensitivity in aged bone (24). It is worth noting that many key features of bone cell mechanotransduction share considerable overlap with processes related to PMD formation and repair. For example, an intracellular Ca2+ spike is one of the earliest responses triggered in an osteocyte exposed to fluid shear, and that response requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (37,159). This is identical to the influx of extracellular Ca2+ as being the earliest detectable event in PMD formation, and the requirement of the presence of extracellular Ca2+ for subsequent PMD repair (32,43). Release of ATP is a critical component for transmission of Ca2+ signaling between osteocytes during loading (37,150), and is also critical for transmission of Ca2+ signaling between wounded and non-wounded bone cells (12,141,160): degradation of extracellular ATP with apyrase prevents propagation of a Ca2+ wave from an osteocyte with a PMD to non-wounded neighboring osteocytes (12), similar to mechanotransduction mechanisms previously reported for mechanically-loaded osteocytes (37). As described above, Annexin A5 is critical for proper resealing of a PMD (80,81), which is consistent with the finding that Annexin A5 disruption impairs mechanically-induced calcium signaling in osteoblastic cells (161). The transcription factor c-fos is induced in osteocytes by both fluid shear (115) and PMD (12), and the microtubule network is implicated in both the response of osteocytes to fluid shear (162) and PMD repair (48). Both fluid shear (37,159,163–165), and PMD (141,166,167) induce ATP, NO, and prostaglandin E2 release as secondary messengers downstream of the initial precipitating event. Likewise, other laboratories have shown that pericellular matrix is critical for osteocyte mechanobiology (151,168,169), and that degradation of the osteocyte glycocalyx blunts flow-induced upregulation of prostaglandin E2 release (170), and we showed that the osteocyte glycocalyx is critical for the formation of flow-induced PMD (24). Under physiological conditions, osteocytes repair a PMD in approximately 10 to 30 seconds (12). Cells that experience a second PMD soon after the first repair the latter PMD more quickly (34), and in osteocytes, PMD repair that occurs too quickly blunts the subsequent downstream mechanotransduction cascade (12,24). Together, these findings could be consistent with the well-accepted principle that insertion of rest periods between bouts of mechanical loading enhances skeletal responses to loading (171–173). Admittedly, these points comparing downstream responses to fluid shear and PMD in bone cells show correlation and not necessarily causation. However, they do highlight the striking similarities in these processes and provide further support for the notion that PMD may be an important mechanosensation mechanism in bone cells, particularly at higher levels of loading. Future studies, designed to alter PMD susceptibility and repair in osteocytes, will be needed to definitively test the role of osteocyte PMD formation in skeletal mechanobiology.4. Conclusion In conclusion, this review has highlighted that PMD are a key mechanosensation mechanism in the processes by which mechanosensitive mammalian cells detect and respond to mechanical loading in their environment. While bone may be the most recently discovered tissue to develop and respond to PMD with loading, it is notable that all responses downstream of PMD in bone cells discovered thus far are consistent with PMD responses reported in other mechanosensitive tissues like epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and myocytes. Thus, PMD formation and repair may represent a novel mechanosensation pathway in bone and a target for modifying skeletal adaptation signaling in osteocytes, such as strategies aimed at improving bone mechanosensitivity with aging.Highlights.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: This study was conducted to determine if the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland is affected by microgravity and the spaceflight environment.Design: Tissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry.Results: In contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen after 30 d in space.Conclusion: These results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva contains proteins secreted from salivary glands and is easily collected, therefore is a useful biofluid for general medical analyses and in particular for monitoring the physiology and health of astronauts.Keywords: salivary glands, microgravity, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry",
    "introduction": "Introduction Spaceflight exposes organisms to numerous environmental stressors, such as gravitational changes, radiation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise, confinement, and disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms. Previous studies of animals and humans after travel in space have documented alterations in several tissues and organ systems, including skeletal, immune, cardiovascular, nervous and gastrointestinal (e.g., Borchers et al., 2002; Hargens and Richardson, 2009; Nagaraja and Risin, 2013; Latchney et al., 2014; Porseva et al., 2017; Demontis et al., 2017; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Early and more recent studies have demonstrated that oral hard and soft tissues, including the mandible (Simmons et al., 1983; Ghosh et al., 2016; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), teeth (Rosenberg et al., 1984; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), salivary glands (Groza et al., 1981, 1983; Mednieks and Hand, 1985, 1987; Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015; Dagdeviren et al., 2018a) and saliva (Brown et al., 1977), are significantly affected by spaceflight. The response of rodent salivary glands to spaceflight varies among glands and cell types. An increase in autophagy and apoptosis occurs in parotid acinar cells (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015). Large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar cell proteins are present in intercalated and striated duct cells. Changes also occur in the expression of several acinar cell secretory proteins. In contrast, the sublingual gland shows few morphological alterations, but changes do occur in serous demilune cell protein expression (Dagdeviren et al., 2018a). The aims of the present study were to determine if spaceflight affects the morphology and secretory protein expression of the mouse submandibular gland. Glands from mice flown on two US space shuttle flights and from the Russian Bion-M1 satellite, along with ground control mice, were examined using transmission electron microcopy, immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling. The findings indicate that the three major salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight and suggest that the age and sex of the animals and the length of the flight affect the response.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals: Eight 16-23 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 15 d on space shuttle Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131), and seven 9 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 13 d on space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135). The mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules, specially designed cages that provide ventilation, lighting, waste collection, food and water (Morey-Holton et al., 2000). Eight mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 15 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-131 flight, and 5 mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 13 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-135 flight. Six 15-16 wk old male C57BL/6N mice were flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 satellite. The mice were housed in “BOS” flight habitats (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). Four age-matched male C57BL/6N mice housed in the same flight habitats served as asynchronous ground controls. The experimental procedures were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Moscow State University Institute of Mitoengineering (Protocol No-35, 1 November, 2012), and the Biomedical Ethics Commission of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (Moscow) (protocol No–319, 4 April, 2013). All procedures conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. The samples were made available through the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the space shuttle missions were provided with NASA rodent food bars (Sun et al., 2014) attached to the sides of the Animal Enclosure Modules and water ad libitum. Five mice housed in standard vivarium cages, with rodent chow and water available ad libitum, served as additional ground control animals for the STS-135 mission. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the Bion-M1 mission were fed a paste diet based on standard rodent chow, with water and casein added as a gelling agent (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). The paste food was available at 4 h intervals. Four additional ground control mice were housed in standard vivarium cages and fed rodent chow and water ad libitum. Pre- and post-flight body weight and food consumption data have been published (Mednieks et al., 2014; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b). Sample Collection: Dissection of the mice from the space shuttle flights began about 3 h after landing of the shuttles at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida; dissection of the habitat ground control mice took place 48 h after the flight mice. The vivarium-housed mice were dissected 48 h prior to dissection of the STS-135 flight mice. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Dissection of the Bion-M1 flight mice took place at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow, beginning about 13 h after landing in the Orenburg region of Russia. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The vivarium control mice were dissected immediately after the flight mice, and the asynchronous habitat ground control mice were dissected 99 days after the flight mice. Submandibular glands were removed, rinsed briefly in cold phosphate buffered saline and prepared for morphological and immunohistochemical examination. Small pieces of tissue for morphologic analysis were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Samples for immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After overnight fixation at 4°C, the samples were rinsed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and stored in either buffer (morphology) or 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (immunohistochemistry). The samples were shipped cold by express service from the dissection sites to UConn Health. Morphologic Analysis: The samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, stained in block with 1% uranyl acetate, and processed by standard methods (Hand, 1995) for embedding in PolyBed epoxy resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). Thin sections (~70-80 nm) were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined and photographed in a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT digital camera. Immunohistochemistry: Paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sections were cut at 5 μm thickness, and immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously (Le et al., 2011), using the Vectastain Elite kits for rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. The sections were observed and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA) equipped with an Accu-Scope Excelis digital camera (Accu-Scope, Commack, NY, USA). Immunogold Labeling: Postfixation was omitted, and the paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were rinsed briefly in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in cold methanol solutions, embedded in LR Gold resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and polymerized in UV light at −20°C. Thin sections from each mouse of the flight and ground control groups from the three missions were collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. Immunolabeling was carried out overnight at 4°C as described previously (Dagdeviren et al., 2018a), using primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in phosphate buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum. Immunolabeling controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Int., Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK, or Aurion, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The labeled grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in the transmission electron microscope. Table 1: Antibodies Used for Immunohistochemistry.

Labeling densities of secretory granules of acinar cells, terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells, and granular convoluted duct cells were calculated for each mouse as the average number of gold particles/μm2. For direct comparison between different immunogold labeling experiments, the labeling densities were converted to percentages of the corresponding ground control averages. Differences in expression of each protein between the flight and ground control groups were evaluated using ANOVA and t-test functions in Microsoft Excel or StatPlus (v.6.1.60, AnalystSoft, Walnut, CA, USA). Antibodies: Primary antibodies used were to salivary androgen binding protein alpha (SABPα), proline-rich protein (PRP), submandibular gland protein C (SMGC), nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Table 1). A rabbit anti-chicken antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat No. ab97136) was used as a secondary antibody with the chicken anti-PRP primary.",
    "results": "Results The flight and habitat ground control mice from both space shuttle missions lost approximately 1-2 g of body weight (Mednieks et al., 2014), but the differences were not statistically significant. Consumption of food and water were similar for the flight and habitat ground control mice. The flight and habitat ground control mice from the Bion-M1 mission gained approximately 2-2.5 g body weight; the differences were significant for the flight mice (p = 0.0010) and habitat ground control mice (p = 0.0456) (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). Food consumption for the flight and habitat ground control mice, determined in preliminary experiments, was identical. Morphology: The acinar cells of the mouse submandibular gland are seromucous in nature, with a basally located nucleus, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the basal cytoplasm, a large Golgi complex, and secretory granules with a granular content of moderate density located in the supranuclear cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A, B; see review by Denny et al., 1997). In adult female glands, terminal tubule cells, also called granular intercalated duct cells, retained from prenatal and early postnatal stages, often are observed at the acinar-intercalated duct junction (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik and MaRae, 1975; Hayashi and Sasa, 1989; Yamamoto et al., 2018) (Fig. 1C). These cells contain numerous small dense secretory granules ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.3 μm. In males, the terminal tubule cells undergo androgen-dependent apoptosis and are completely lost by about 1 month of age (Hayashi et al., 2000; Hecht et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2018). The intercalated ducts, consisting of cuboidal cells that occasionally contain a few small granules, connect to a short striated granular duct (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik and MacRae, 1975; Denny et al., 1990) which is confluent with the granular convoluted duct. The granular convoluted ducts consist of tall columnar cells, with basal nuclei, variably infolded basal cell membranes with adjacent mitochondria, and numerous large dense granules in the supranuclear cytoplasm. (Fig. 2) As described by Watson et al. (1985), smaller dense granules often are present in the cytoplasm between the large granules. These ducts are well-developed in adult male glands, constituting about 45% to 60% of the gland parenchyma (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik, 1994; Jayasinghe et al., 1990; Pardini and Taga, 1996) (Fig. 2A). In female glands, the granular convoluted duct cells are smaller than those of males, contain fewer secretory granules (Fig. 2B), and constitute about 25% of the parenchyma. The granular convoluted ducts are confluent with the striated ducts, which become excretory ducts as they enter the connective tissue septa dividing the gland into lobules and lobes.

All of the cellular organelles exhibited a normal appearance, and the acinar and duct cells had a full complement of secretory granules. Immunohistochemistry: In paraffin sections, antibodies to SABPα labeled all of the submandibular gland acinar cells (Fig. 3A), whereas no reactivity was present in duct cells. Antibody to NGF labeled the granular convoluted duct cells (Fig. 3B). In female mice, the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells were labeled with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 3C, D). No labeling was seen in control sections that were incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune serum or IgG substituted for the primary antibody (Fig. 3E).

Immunogold labeling: In the submandibular gland acinar cells, electron microscopic immunogold labeling with antibodies to SABPα and PRP resulted in labeling of the secretory granules (Fig. 4A, B). A few gold particles were also present over the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The labeling density for SABPα in female mice flown on STS-131 and STS-135 was not significantly different than in habitat ground control mice. In male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite, labeling for SABPα was significantly increased in flight mice compared to habitat control mice (Fig. 5). The labeling density for PRP was unchanged from controls in both female and male flight mice. Figure 4: Open in a new tab Electron microscopic immunogold labeling. A, Bion-M1.

In our samples fixed only in paraformaldehyde, the secretory granules exhibited variable electron density. The immunogold labeling density is reported only for the electron dense and moderately electron dense granules. No differences were seen in the labeling densities for EGF and NGF between female flight and habitat ground control mice in the STS-131 and STS-135 missions. Although the EGF labeling was decreased in STS-135 flight mice, it was not significantly different from the habitat ground control mice due to substantial variability among the individual mice. Labeling for both EGF and NGF, however, was significantly increased in male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite compared to habitat ground control mice (Fig. 5). The labeling of terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells in female mice from the STS-131 and STS-135 missions with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 4E) showed no difference between flight and habitat ground controls (Fig. 5). Ground control vivarium mice were available for study for the STS-135 and Bion-M1 missions. Labeling of female vivarium control mice from the STS-135 mission with antibodies to PRP, EGF, NGF and SMGC was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling for SABPα, however, was greater in vivarium control mice than in flight mice (p<0.01) and habitat control mice (p<0.05). Labeling of male vivarium control mice from the Bion-M1 mission with antibodies to PRP and EGF was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling of vivarium control mice for SABPα and NGF was significantly less than in flight mice (p<0.05), but no different from habitat control mice. Non-specific labeling of sections incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune IgG instead of primary antibody was generally very low, in most cases in the range of 0% to 6% of the specific antibody labeling of secretory granules. Non-specific binding of primary antibodies to plastic in interstitial areas ranged from 0.37% to less than 5%.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In the submandibular gland, as in the parotid and sublingual glands of these mice, spaceflight resulted in specific changes in secretory protein expression. Male mice flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 biosatellite had an increased content of SABPα in acinar cell secretory granules, and EGF and NGF in granular convoluted duct cell secretory granules, when compared to that in the habitat ground control mice. This appears to be a specific effect of microgravity. The shorter 13 d and 15 d flights on the space shuttle, however, did not cause increased expression of these proteins in female glands. This suggests that longer exposure to microgravity may result in more profound changes. Other factors also may play a role, such as the age and sex of the mice, stresses during landing given the different space craft, and the time elapsed between landing and dissection. It is possible that the different diets consumed by the mice on the space shuttle flights compared to those on the Bion-M1 flight could have resulted in differences in protein expression. The comparisons in the present study, therefore, are made between the flight mice and habitat ground control mice that were fed the same diets. SABPα, also known as SCGB1B27, is a member of the secretoglobin protein family. Secretoglobins bind lipophilic ligands and are present in mammals and birds (Laukaitis et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2011). In the mouse submandibular gland, SABPα forms heterotetramers with β and γ subunits; the complex binds androgens and acts as a pheromone involved in mate selection (Laukaitis et al., 1997). Previous studies have shown that its expression is similar in male and female mice (Wickliffe et al., 2002), although some paralogues expressed in the female submandibular gland are not present in the male submandibular gland (Laukaitis et al., 2005). Although the pathways regulating SABPα expression are not known, the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, significantly upregulates its expression in male mice after 30 d in space. The PRPs are expressed in the submandibular and parotid glands of humans, rodents and other species, are secreted into saliva, and have bacterial, calcium, tannin and polyphenol binding functions (Oppenheim et al., 1971; Bennick 1982, 2002; Gibbons and Hay, 1988, 1989; Takano et al., 1993). Their synthesis is enhanced by dietary tannins and by the administration of isoproterenol (Fernandez-Sorensen and Carlson, 1974; Mehansho and Carlson, 1983; Mehansho et al., 1985; Divecha et al., 1989; Matsuura and Hand, 1991). Regulation of PRP gene expression by tannins and β-adrenergic agonists occurs via the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signaling system (Carlson, 1993; Ann and Lin, 1998), whose responses vary with the amount of stress imposed on the system. Long-term spaceflight appears to have minimal effects on components of the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A system (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015; Dagdeviren et al., 2018a, 2018b). Relatively modest changes in the levels of salivary and plasma corticosteroids and catecholamines occur as a result of spaceflight in both animals and humans (Kvetnansky et al., 1981, 1991; Macho et al., 1996, 2001, 2004; Larina et al., 1997; Strollo et al., 1997; Blottner et al., 2009; Buchheim et al., 2019). This suggests that the mice from these missions experienced minimal stress due to the spaceflight environment. Stress associated with landing and post-flight readaptation to gravity potentially could affect the salivary glands. However, the relatively short interval between landing and tissue collection for the STS-131 and STS-135 flights may have minimized such effects. This is supported by the lack of significant changes in PRP expression. SMGC, a secretory protein of unknown function, is produced by the terminal tubule cells of neonatal rats and mice (Ball et al., 1988; Zinzen et al., 2004). As the terminal tubule cells decline in number beyond 20 d of age in females, and disappear in males (Hayashi et al., 2000; Hecht et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2018), the levels of SMGC transcripts and protein detectable in the submandibular gland are greatly diminished (Hecht et al., 2000; Zinzen et al., 2004). SMGC expression in females is decreased after ovariectomy and increased by β-estradiol administration (Kusakabe et al., 2016). No differences in immunogold labeling were observed for the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells present in the submandibular gland of the female mice flown on the two space shuttle missions. This suggests that SMGC expression is not affected by microgravity. Alternatively, the length of exposure to microgravity (13-15 d) may have been insufficient to induce changes in SMGC expression. Numerous studies have demonstrated that granular convoluted duct structure and protein expression are dependent on androgens and thyroid hormones, and that the expression of EGF and NGF is much greater in the adult male submandibular gland than in the female submandibular gland (Caramia, 1966b; Chretien, 1977; Aloe and Levi-Montalcini, 1980; Matsuura et al., 1984; Gubits et al., 1986; Kasayama et al., 1989; Gresik, 1994; Adthapanyawanich et al., 2015; Yamanoto et al., 2018). While plasma levels of androgens and thyroid hormones were not determined in the male mice from the Bion-M1 mission, previous studies have shown decreased plasma testosterone in rats (Amann et al., 1992; Macho et al., 2001), and decreased plasma, salivary and urinary testosterone in astronauts (Strollo et al., 1998; Strollo, 1999). Decreases in thyroid function and plasma levels of thyroid hormones after spaceflight have been observed in rodents and humans (Plakhuta-Plakutina et al., 1990; Strollo, 1999; Macho et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2011). The increase in EGF and NGF expression in the granular convoluted duct cells of the Bion-M1 flight mice thus was unexpected. However, androgens and thyroid hormones also act through non-classic nongenomic pathways (Foradori et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2010; Hammes and Davis, 2015); it is possible that microgravity may influence EGF and NGF expression via signaling intermediates that intersect with these pathways. The increased expression of both EGF and NGF by approximately 60% in flight mice compared to habitat ground control mice suggests that the same regulatory pathway(s) was activated for both genes. Watson et al. (1985), using double labeling with different size gold particles, showed that all moderate to large size granules of the granular convoluted duct cells contain both EGF and NGF. They also observed small unreactive granules and suggested that they may contain other granular convoluted duct cell proteins, or perhaps precursors to EGF and NGF that did not react with their antibodies. Similar small granules, occasionally labeled with EGF and NGF antibodies, were observed in the present study. It was not clear whether these labeled granules represent a separate population from the medium to large size granules, or whether they were tangential sections through the larger granules. Autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic acinar cells were observed more frequently in the parotid glands of the flight mice from these three missions than in the corresponding ground controls (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015). In other studies an increase in autophagy and apoptosis in various tissues and in cultured cells was observed after spaceflight, as well as increased expression of genes involved in these processes (Schatten et al., 2001; Gridley et al., 2013, 2015; Novoselova et al., 2015; Blaber et al., 2017). In contrast, the morphology of the submandibular gland appeared to be unaffected by either the 13-15 d or 30 d flights, and autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic cells were rare in both flight and ground control mice. The basis for the different responses seen in the parotid and submandibular gland is not known. However, the responses of the two glands to spaceflight parallel those seen in rats in experimental conditions such as feeding a liquid diet and streptozotocin diabetes, which result in increased autophagy and apoptosis in the parotid (Hand and Ho, 1981; Hand and Weiss, 1984; Takahashi et al., 2012), but few morphological changes in the submandibular gland (Mednieks et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2014). In conclusion, exposure to the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, results in alterations in secretory protein expression in acinar and granular convoluted duct cells of the mouse submandibular gland. The effects appear to be related to the length of the spaceflight as they were seen after a 30 d flight but not after 13-15 d flights. They also may be influenced by the animal’s sex as they occurred in males but not females. Unlike the response of the parotid gland, no obvious changes in cell structure were observed in the submandibular gland. Our findings suggest that evaluating changes in the levels of specific proteins in saliva may be useful for monitoring astronaut physiology and health during long-term spaceflights.",

Copyright notice ID: 6981245 MSID: MS1545090 PMID: 31805482 The publisher's version of this article is available at Arch Oral Biol Abstract Objective: This study was conducted to determine if the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland is affected by microgravity and the spaceflight environment.Design: Tissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry.Results: In contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen after 30 d in space.Conclusion: These results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva contains proteins secreted from salivary glands and is easily collected, therefore is a useful biofluid for general medical analyses and in particular for monitoring the physiology and health of astronauts.Keywords: salivary glands, microgravity, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistryIntroduction Spaceflight exposes organisms to numerous environmental stressors, such as gravitational changes, radiation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise, confinement, and disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms. Previous studies of animals and humans after travel in space have documented alterations in several tissues and organ systems, including skeletal, immune, cardiovascular, nervous and gastrointestinal (e.g., Borchers et al., 2002; Hargens and Richardson, 2009; Nagaraja and Risin, 2013; Latchney et al., 2014; Porseva et al., 2017; Demontis et al., 2017; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Early and more recent studies have demonstrated that oral hard and soft tissues, including the mandible (Simmons et al., 1983; Ghosh et al., 2016; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), teeth (Rosenberg et al., 1984; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), salivary glands (Groza et al., 1981, 1983; Mednieks and Hand, 1985, 1987; Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015; Dagdeviren et al., 2018a) and saliva (Brown et al., 1977), are significantly affected by spaceflight. The response of rodent salivary glands to spaceflight varies among glands and cell types. An increase in autophagy and apoptosis occurs in parotid acinar cells (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015). Large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar cell proteins are present in intercalated and striated duct cells. Changes also occur in the expression of several acinar cell secretory proteins. In contrast, the sublingual gland shows few morphological alterations, but changes do occur in serous demilune cell protein expression (Dagdeviren et al., 2018a). The aims of the present study were to determine if spaceflight affects the morphology and secretory protein expression of the mouse submandibular gland. Glands from mice flown on two US space shuttle flights and from the Russian Bion-M1 satellite, along with ground control mice, were examined using transmission electron microcopy, immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling. The findings indicate that the three major salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight and suggest that the age and sex of the animals and the length of the flight affect the response.Materials and Methods Animals: Eight 16-23 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 15 d on space shuttle Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131), and seven 9 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 13 d on space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135). The mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules, specially designed cages that provide ventilation, lighting, waste collection, food and water (Morey-Holton et al., 2000). Eight mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 15 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-131 flight, and 5 mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 13 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-135 flight. Six 15-16 wk old male C57BL/6N mice were flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 satellite. The mice were housed in “BOS” flight habitats (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). Four age-matched male C57BL/6N mice housed in the same flight habitats served as asynchronous ground controls. The experimental procedures were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Moscow State University Institute of Mitoengineering (Protocol No-35, 1 November, 2012), and the Biomedical Ethics Commission of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (Moscow) (protocol No–319, 4 April, 2013). All procedures conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. The samples were made available through the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the space shuttle missions were provided with NASA rodent food bars (Sun et al., 2014) attached to the sides of the Animal Enclosure Modules and water ad libitum. Five mice housed in standard vivarium cages, with rodent chow and water available ad libitum, served as additional ground control animals for the STS-135 mission. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the Bion-M1 mission were fed a paste diet based on standard rodent chow, with water and casein added as a gelling agent (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). The paste food was available at 4 h intervals. Four additional ground control mice were housed in standard vivarium cages and fed rodent chow and water ad libitum. Pre- and post-flight body weight and food consumption data have been published (Mednieks et al., 2014; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b).Sample Collection: Dissection of the mice from the space shuttle flights began about 3 h after landing of the shuttles at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida; dissection of the habitat ground control mice took place 48 h after the flight mice. The vivarium-housed mice were dissected 48 h prior to dissection of the STS-135 flight mice. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Dissection of the Bion-M1 flight mice took place at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow, beginning about 13 h after landing in the Orenburg region of Russia. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The vivarium control mice were dissected immediately after the flight mice, and the asynchronous habitat ground control mice were dissected 99 days after the flight mice. Submandibular glands were removed, rinsed briefly in cold phosphate buffered saline and prepared for morphological and immunohistochemical examination. Small pieces of tissue for morphologic analysis were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Samples for immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After overnight fixation at 4°C, the samples were rinsed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and stored in either buffer (morphology) or 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (immunohistochemistry). The samples were shipped cold by express service from the dissection sites to UConn Health.Morphologic Analysis: The samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, stained in block with 1% uranyl acetate, and processed by standard methods (Hand, 1995) for embedding in PolyBed epoxy resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). Thin sections (~70-80 nm) were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined and photographed in a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT digital camera.Immunohistochemistry: Paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sections were cut at 5 μm thickness, and immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously (Le et al., 2011), using the Vectastain Elite kits for rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. The sections were observed and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA) equipped with an Accu-Scope Excelis digital camera (Accu-Scope, Commack, NY, USA).Immunogold Labeling: Postfixation was omitted, and the paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were rinsed briefly in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in cold methanol solutions, embedded in LR Gold resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and polymerized in UV light at −20°C. Thin sections from each mouse of the flight and ground control groups from the three missions were collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. Immunolabeling was carried out overnight at 4°C as described previously (Dagdeviren et al., 2018a), using primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in phosphate buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum. Immunolabeling controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Int., Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK, or Aurion, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The labeled grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in the transmission electron microscope. Table 1: Antibodies Used for Immunohistochemistry.

Labeling densities of secretory granules of acinar cells, terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells, and granular convoluted duct cells were calculated for each mouse as the average number of gold particles/μm2. For direct comparison between different immunogold labeling experiments, the labeling densities were converted to percentages of the corresponding ground control averages. Differences in expression of each protein between the flight and ground control groups were evaluated using ANOVA and t-test functions in Microsoft Excel or StatPlus (v.6.1.60, AnalystSoft, Walnut, CA, USA).Antibodies: Primary antibodies used were to salivary androgen binding protein alpha (SABPα), proline-rich protein (PRP), submandibular gland protein C (SMGC), nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Table 1). A rabbit anti-chicken antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat No. ab97136) was used as a secondary antibody with the chicken anti-PRP primary.Results The flight and habitat ground control mice from both space shuttle missions lost approximately 1-2 g of body weight (Mednieks et al., 2014), but the differences were not statistically significant. Consumption of food and water were similar for the flight and habitat ground control mice. The flight and habitat ground control mice from the Bion-M1 mission gained approximately 2-2.5 g body weight; the differences were significant for the flight mice (p = 0.0010) and habitat ground control mice (p = 0.0456) (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). Food consumption for the flight and habitat ground control mice, determined in preliminary experiments, was identical. Morphology: The acinar cells of the mouse submandibular gland are seromucous in nature, with a basally located nucleus, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the basal cytoplasm, a large Golgi complex, and secretory granules with a granular content of moderate density located in the supranuclear cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A, B; see review by Denny et al., 1997). In adult female glands, terminal tubule cells, also called granular intercalated duct cells, retained from prenatal and early postnatal stages, often are observed at the acinar-intercalated duct junction (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik and MaRae, 1975; Hayashi and Sasa, 1989; Yamamoto et al., 2018) (Fig. 1C). These cells contain numerous small dense secretory granules ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.3 μm. In males, the terminal tubule cells undergo androgen-dependent apoptosis and are completely lost by about 1 month of age (Hayashi et al., 2000; Hecht et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2018). The intercalated ducts, consisting of cuboidal cells that occasionally contain a few small granules, connect to a short striated granular duct (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik and MacRae, 1975; Denny et al., 1990) which is confluent with the granular convoluted duct. The granular convoluted ducts consist of tall columnar cells, with basal nuclei, variably infolded basal cell membranes with adjacent mitochondria, and numerous large dense granules in the supranuclear cytoplasm. (Fig. 2) As described by Watson et al. (1985), smaller dense granules often are present in the cytoplasm between the large granules. These ducts are well-developed in adult male glands, constituting about 45% to 60% of the gland parenchyma (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik, 1994; Jayasinghe et al., 1990; Pardini and Taga, 1996) (Fig. 2A). In female glands, the granular convoluted duct cells are smaller than those of males, contain fewer secretory granules (Fig. 2B), and constitute about 25% of the parenchyma. The granular convoluted ducts are confluent with the striated ducts, which become excretory ducts as they enter the connective tissue septa dividing the gland into lobules and lobes.

All of the cellular organelles exhibited a normal appearance, and the acinar and duct cells had a full complement of secretory granules.Immunohistochemistry: In paraffin sections, antibodies to SABPα labeled all of the submandibular gland acinar cells (Fig. 3A), whereas no reactivity was present in duct cells. Antibody to NGF labeled the granular convoluted duct cells (Fig. 3B). In female mice, the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells were labeled with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 3C, D). No labeling was seen in control sections that were incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune serum or IgG substituted for the primary antibody (Fig. 3E).

A few gold particles were also present over the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The labeling density for SABPα in female mice flown on STS-131 and STS-135 was not significantly different than in habitat ground control mice. In male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite, labeling for SABPα was significantly increased in flight mice compared to habitat control mice (Fig. 5). The labeling density for PRP was unchanged from controls in both female and male flight mice. Figure 4: Open in a new tab Electron microscopic immunogold labeling. A, Bion-M1.

Results are expressed as a percentage ± standard error of the mean of the habitat-housed ground control mice. *, p<0.01.In the granular convoluted duct cells, immunogold labeling with antibodies to EGF and NGF resulted in labeling of the secretory granules (Fig. 4C, D). In our samples fixed only in paraformaldehyde, the secretory granules exhibited variable electron density. The immunogold labeling density is reported only for the electron dense and moderately electron dense granules. No differences were seen in the labeling densities for EGF and NGF between female flight and habitat ground control mice in the STS-131 and STS-135 missions. Although the EGF labeling was decreased in STS-135 flight mice, it was not significantly different from the habitat ground control mice due to substantial variability among the individual mice. Labeling for both EGF and NGF, however, was significantly increased in male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite compared to habitat ground control mice (Fig. 5). The labeling of terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells in female mice from the STS-131 and STS-135 missions with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 4E) showed no difference between flight and habitat ground controls (Fig. 5). Ground control vivarium mice were available for study for the STS-135 and Bion-M1 missions. Labeling of female vivarium control mice from the STS-135 mission with antibodies to PRP, EGF, NGF and SMGC was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling for SABPα, however, was greater in vivarium control mice than in flight mice (p<0.01) and habitat control mice (p<0.05). Labeling of male vivarium control mice from the Bion-M1 mission with antibodies to PRP and EGF was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling of vivarium control mice for SABPα and NGF was significantly less than in flight mice (p<0.05), but no different from habitat control mice. Non-specific labeling of sections incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune IgG instead of primary antibody was generally very low, in most cases in the range of 0% to 6% of the specific antibody labeling of secretory granules. Non-specific binding of primary antibodies to plastic in interstitial areas ranged from 0.37% to less than 5%.Discussion In the submandibular gland, as in the parotid and sublingual glands of these mice, spaceflight resulted in specific changes in secretory protein expression. Male mice flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 biosatellite had an increased content of SABPα in acinar cell secretory granules, and EGF and NGF in granular convoluted duct cell secretory granules, when compared to that in the habitat ground control mice. This appears to be a specific effect of microgravity. The shorter 13 d and 15 d flights on the space shuttle, however, did not cause increased expression of these proteins in female glands. This suggests that longer exposure to microgravity may result in more profound changes. Other factors also may play a role, such as the age and sex of the mice, stresses during landing given the different space craft, and the time elapsed between landing and dissection. It is possible that the different diets consumed by the mice on the space shuttle flights compared to those on the Bion-M1 flight could have resulted in differences in protein expression. The comparisons in the present study, therefore, are made between the flight mice and habitat ground control mice that were fed the same diets. SABPα, also known as SCGB1B27, is a member of the secretoglobin protein family. Secretoglobins bind lipophilic ligands and are present in mammals and birds (Laukaitis et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2011). In the mouse submandibular gland, SABPα forms heterotetramers with β and γ subunits; the complex binds androgens and acts as a pheromone involved in mate selection (Laukaitis et al., 1997). Previous studies have shown that its expression is similar in male and female mice (Wickliffe et al., 2002), although some paralogues expressed in the female submandibular gland are not present in the male submandibular gland (Laukaitis et al., 2005). Although the pathways regulating SABPα expression are not known, the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, significantly upregulates its expression in male mice after 30 d in space. The PRPs are expressed in the submandibular and parotid glands of humans, rodents and other species, are secreted into saliva, and have bacterial, calcium, tannin and polyphenol binding functions (Oppenheim et al., 1971; Bennick 1982, 2002; Gibbons and Hay, 1988, 1989; Takano et al., 1993). Their synthesis is enhanced by dietary tannins and by the administration of isoproterenol (Fernandez-Sorensen and Carlson, 1974; Mehansho and Carlson, 1983; Mehansho et al., 1985; Divecha et al., 1989; Matsuura and Hand, 1991). Regulation of PRP gene expression by tannins and β-adrenergic agonists occurs via the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signaling system (Carlson, 1993; Ann and Lin, 1998), whose responses vary with the amount of stress imposed on the system. Long-term spaceflight appears to have minimal effects on components of the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A system (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015; Dagdeviren et al., 2018a, 2018b). Relatively modest changes in the levels of salivary and plasma corticosteroids and catecholamines occur as a result of spaceflight in both animals and humans (Kvetnansky et al., 1981, 1991; Macho et al., 1996, 2001, 2004; Larina et al., 1997; Strollo et al., 1997; Blottner et al., 2009; Buchheim et al., 2019). This suggests that the mice from these missions experienced minimal stress due to the spaceflight environment. Stress associated with landing and post-flight readaptation to gravity potentially could affect the salivary glands. However, the relatively short interval between landing and tissue collection for the STS-131 and STS-135 flights may have minimized such effects. This is supported by the lack of significant changes in PRP expression. SMGC, a secretory protein of unknown function, is produced by the terminal tubule cells of neonatal rats and mice (Ball et al., 1988; Zinzen et al., 2004). As the terminal tubule cells decline in number beyond 20 d of age in females, and disappear in males (Hayashi et al., 2000; Hecht et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2018), the levels of SMGC transcripts and protein detectable in the submandibular gland are greatly diminished (Hecht et al., 2000; Zinzen et al., 2004). SMGC expression in females is decreased after ovariectomy and increased by β-estradiol administration (Kusakabe et al., 2016). No differences in immunogold labeling were observed for the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells present in the submandibular gland of the female mice flown on the two space shuttle missions. This suggests that SMGC expression is not affected by microgravity. Alternatively, the length of exposure to microgravity (13-15 d) may have been insufficient to induce changes in SMGC expression. Numerous studies have demonstrated that granular convoluted duct structure and protein expression are dependent on androgens and thyroid hormones, and that the expression of EGF and NGF is much greater in the adult male submandibular gland than in the female submandibular gland (Caramia, 1966b; Chretien, 1977; Aloe and Levi-Montalcini, 1980; Matsuura et al., 1984; Gubits et al., 1986; Kasayama et al., 1989; Gresik, 1994; Adthapanyawanich et al., 2015; Yamanoto et al., 2018). While plasma levels of androgens and thyroid hormones were not determined in the male mice from the Bion-M1 mission, previous studies have shown decreased plasma testosterone in rats (Amann et al., 1992; Macho et al., 2001), and decreased plasma, salivary and urinary testosterone in astronauts (Strollo et al., 1998; Strollo, 1999). Decreases in thyroid function and plasma levels of thyroid hormones after spaceflight have been observed in rodents and humans (Plakhuta-Plakutina et al., 1990; Strollo, 1999; Macho et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2011). The increase in EGF and NGF expression in the granular convoluted duct cells of the Bion-M1 flight mice thus was unexpected. However, androgens and thyroid hormones also act through non-classic nongenomic pathways (Foradori et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2010; Hammes and Davis, 2015); it is possible that microgravity may influence EGF and NGF expression via signaling intermediates that intersect with these pathways. The increased expression of both EGF and NGF by approximately 60% in flight mice compared to habitat ground control mice suggests that the same regulatory pathway(s) was activated for both genes. Watson et al. (1985), using double labeling with different size gold particles, showed that all moderate to large size granules of the granular convoluted duct cells contain both EGF and NGF. They also observed small unreactive granules and suggested that they may contain other granular convoluted duct cell proteins, or perhaps precursors to EGF and NGF that did not react with their antibodies. Similar small granules, occasionally labeled with EGF and NGF antibodies, were observed in the present study. It was not clear whether these labeled granules represent a separate population from the medium to large size granules, or whether they were tangential sections through the larger granules. Autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic acinar cells were observed more frequently in the parotid glands of the flight mice from these three missions than in the corresponding ground controls (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015). In other studies an increase in autophagy and apoptosis in various tissues and in cultured cells was observed after spaceflight, as well as increased expression of genes involved in these processes (Schatten et al., 2001; Gridley et al., 2013, 2015; Novoselova et al., 2015; Blaber et al., 2017). In contrast, the morphology of the submandibular gland appeared to be unaffected by either the 13-15 d or 30 d flights, and autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic cells were rare in both flight and ground control mice. The basis for the different responses seen in the parotid and submandibular gland is not known. However, the responses of the two glands to spaceflight parallel those seen in rats in experimental conditions such as feeding a liquid diet and streptozotocin diabetes, which result in increased autophagy and apoptosis in the parotid (Hand and Ho, 1981; Hand and Weiss, 1984; Takahashi et al., 2012), but few morphological changes in the submandibular gland (Mednieks et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2014). In conclusion, exposure to the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, results in alterations in secretory protein expression in acinar and granular convoluted duct cells of the mouse submandibular gland. The effects appear to be related to the length of the spaceflight as they were seen after a 30 d flight but not after 13-15 d flights. They also may be influenced by the animal’s sex as they occurred in males but not females. Unlike the response of the parotid gland, no obvious changes in cell structure were observed in the submandibular gland. Our findings suggest that evaluating changes in the levels of specific proteins in saliva may be useful for monitoring astronaut physiology and health during long-term spaceflights.Highlights: Thirty days of spaceflight alters protein expression in the mouse submandibular gland. The effects appear to be age, sex and flight length dependent. The individual major salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Evaluating changes in saliva may be useful for monitoring astronaut physiology and health.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: This study was conducted to determine if the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland is affected by microgravity and the spaceflight environment.Design: Tissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry.Results: In contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen after 30 d in space.Conclusion: These results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva contains proteins secreted from salivary glands and is easily collected, therefore is a useful biofluid for general medical analyses and in particular for monitoring the physiology and health of astronauts.Keywords: salivary glands, microgravity, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry",
    "introduction": "Introduction Spaceflight exposes organisms to numerous environmental stressors, such as gravitational changes, radiation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise, confinement, and disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms. Previous studies of animals and humans after travel in space have documented alterations in several tissues and organ systems, including skeletal, immune, cardiovascular, nervous and gastrointestinal (e.g., Borchers et al., 2002; Hargens and Richardson, 2009; Nagaraja and Risin, 2013; Latchney et al., 2014; Porseva et al., 2017; Demontis et al., 2017; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Early and more recent studies have demonstrated that oral hard and soft tissues, including the mandible (Simmons et al., 1983; Ghosh et al., 2016; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), teeth (Rosenberg et al., 1984; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), salivary glands (Groza et al., 1981, 1983; Mednieks and Hand, 1985, 1987; Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015; Dagdeviren et al., 2018a) and saliva (Brown et al., 1977), are significantly affected by spaceflight. The response of rodent salivary glands to spaceflight varies among glands and cell types. An increase in autophagy and apoptosis occurs in parotid acinar cells (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015). Large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar cell proteins are present in intercalated and striated duct cells. Changes also occur in the expression of several acinar cell secretory proteins. In contrast, the sublingual gland shows few morphological alterations, but changes do occur in serous demilune cell protein expression (Dagdeviren et al., 2018a). The aims of the present study were to determine if spaceflight affects the morphology and secretory protein expression of the mouse submandibular gland. Glands from mice flown on two US space shuttle flights and from the Russian Bion-M1 satellite, along with ground control mice, were examined using transmission electron microcopy, immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling. The findings indicate that the three major salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight and suggest that the age and sex of the animals and the length of the flight affect the response.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals: Eight 16-23 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 15 d on space shuttle Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131), and seven 9 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 13 d on space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135). The mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules, specially designed cages that provide ventilation, lighting, waste collection, food and water (Morey-Holton et al., 2000). Eight mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 15 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-131 flight, and 5 mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 13 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-135 flight. Six 15-16 wk old male C57BL/6N mice were flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 satellite. The mice were housed in “BOS” flight habitats (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). Four age-matched male C57BL/6N mice housed in the same flight habitats served as asynchronous ground controls. The experimental procedures were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Moscow State University Institute of Mitoengineering (Protocol No-35, 1 November, 2012), and the Biomedical Ethics Commission of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (Moscow) (protocol No–319, 4 April, 2013). All procedures conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. The samples were made available through the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the space shuttle missions were provided with NASA rodent food bars (Sun et al., 2014) attached to the sides of the Animal Enclosure Modules and water ad libitum. Five mice housed in standard vivarium cages, with rodent chow and water available ad libitum, served as additional ground control animals for the STS-135 mission. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the Bion-M1 mission were fed a paste diet based on standard rodent chow, with water and casein added as a gelling agent (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). The paste food was available at 4 h intervals. Four additional ground control mice were housed in standard vivarium cages and fed rodent chow and water ad libitum. Pre- and post-flight body weight and food consumption data have been published (Mednieks et al., 2014; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b). Sample Collection: Dissection of the mice from the space shuttle flights began about 3 h after landing of the shuttles at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida; dissection of the habitat ground control mice took place 48 h after the flight mice. The vivarium-housed mice were dissected 48 h prior to dissection of the STS-135 flight mice. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Dissection of the Bion-M1 flight mice took place at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow, beginning about 13 h after landing in the Orenburg region of Russia. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The vivarium control mice were dissected immediately after the flight mice, and the asynchronous habitat ground control mice were dissected 99 days after the flight mice. Submandibular glands were removed, rinsed briefly in cold phosphate buffered saline and prepared for morphological and immunohistochemical examination. Small pieces of tissue for morphologic analysis were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Samples for immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After overnight fixation at 4°C, the samples were rinsed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and stored in either buffer (morphology) or 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (immunohistochemistry). The samples were shipped cold by express service from the dissection sites to UConn Health. Morphologic Analysis: The samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, stained in block with 1% uranyl acetate, and processed by standard methods (Hand, 1995) for embedding in PolyBed epoxy resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). Thin sections (~70-80 nm) were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined and photographed in a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT digital camera. Immunohistochemistry: Paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sections were cut at 5 μm thickness, and immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously (Le et al., 2011), using the Vectastain Elite kits for rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. The sections were observed and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA) equipped with an Accu-Scope Excelis digital camera (Accu-Scope, Commack, NY, USA). Immunogold Labeling: Postfixation was omitted, and the paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were rinsed briefly in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in cold methanol solutions, embedded in LR Gold resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and polymerized in UV light at −20°C. Thin sections from each mouse of the flight and ground control groups from the three missions were collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. Immunolabeling was carried out overnight at 4°C as described previously (Dagdeviren et al., 2018a), using primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in phosphate buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum. Immunolabeling controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Int., Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK, or Aurion, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The labeled grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in the transmission electron microscope. Table 1: Antibodies Used for Immunohistochemistry.

Labeling densities of secretory granules of acinar cells, terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells, and granular convoluted duct cells were calculated for each mouse as the average number of gold particles/μm2. For direct comparison between different immunogold labeling experiments, the labeling densities were converted to percentages of the corresponding ground control averages. Differences in expression of each protein between the flight and ground control groups were evaluated using ANOVA and t-test functions in Microsoft Excel or StatPlus (v.6.1.60, AnalystSoft, Walnut, CA, USA). Antibodies: Primary antibodies used were to salivary androgen binding protein alpha (SABPα), proline-rich protein (PRP), submandibular gland protein C (SMGC), nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Table 1). A rabbit anti-chicken antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat No. ab97136) was used as a secondary antibody with the chicken anti-PRP primary.",
    "results": "Results The flight and habitat ground control mice from both space shuttle missions lost approximately 1-2 g of body weight (Mednieks et al., 2014), but the differences were not statistically significant. Consumption of food and water were similar for the flight and habitat ground control mice. The flight and habitat ground control mice from the Bion-M1 mission gained approximately 2-2.5 g body weight; the differences were significant for the flight mice (p = 0.0010) and habitat ground control mice (p = 0.0456) (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). Food consumption for the flight and habitat ground control mice, determined in preliminary experiments, was identical. Morphology: The acinar cells of the mouse submandibular gland are seromucous in nature, with a basally located nucleus, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the basal cytoplasm, a large Golgi complex, and secretory granules with a granular content of moderate density located in the supranuclear cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A, B; see review by Denny et al., 1997). In adult female glands, terminal tubule cells, also called granular intercalated duct cells, retained from prenatal and early postnatal stages, often are observed at the acinar-intercalated duct junction (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik and MaRae, 1975; Hayashi and Sasa, 1989; Yamamoto et al., 2018) (Fig. 1C). These cells contain numerous small dense secretory granules ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.3 μm. In males, the terminal tubule cells undergo androgen-dependent apoptosis and are completely lost by about 1 month of age (Hayashi et al., 2000; Hecht et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2018). The intercalated ducts, consisting of cuboidal cells that occasionally contain a few small granules, connect to a short striated granular duct (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik and MacRae, 1975; Denny et al., 1990) which is confluent with the granular convoluted duct. The granular convoluted ducts consist of tall columnar cells, with basal nuclei, variably infolded basal cell membranes with adjacent mitochondria, and numerous large dense granules in the supranuclear cytoplasm. (Fig. 2) As described by Watson et al. (1985), smaller dense granules often are present in the cytoplasm between the large granules. These ducts are well-developed in adult male glands, constituting about 45% to 60% of the gland parenchyma (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik, 1994; Jayasinghe et al., 1990; Pardini and Taga, 1996) (Fig. 2A). In female glands, the granular convoluted duct cells are smaller than those of males, contain fewer secretory granules (Fig. 2B), and constitute about 25% of the parenchyma. The granular convoluted ducts are confluent with the striated ducts, which become excretory ducts as they enter the connective tissue septa dividing the gland into lobules and lobes.

All of the cellular organelles exhibited a normal appearance, and the acinar and duct cells had a full complement of secretory granules. Immunohistochemistry: In paraffin sections, antibodies to SABPα labeled all of the submandibular gland acinar cells (Fig. 3A), whereas no reactivity was present in duct cells. Antibody to NGF labeled the granular convoluted duct cells (Fig. 3B). In female mice, the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells were labeled with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 3C, D). No labeling was seen in control sections that were incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune serum or IgG substituted for the primary antibody (Fig. 3E).

Immunogold labeling: In the submandibular gland acinar cells, electron microscopic immunogold labeling with antibodies to SABPα and PRP resulted in labeling of the secretory granules (Fig. 4A, B). A few gold particles were also present over the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The labeling density for SABPα in female mice flown on STS-131 and STS-135 was not significantly different than in habitat ground control mice. In male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite, labeling for SABPα was significantly increased in flight mice compared to habitat control mice (Fig. 5). The labeling density for PRP was unchanged from controls in both female and male flight mice. Figure 4: Open in a new tab Electron microscopic immunogold labeling. A, Bion-M1.

Results are expressed as a percentage ± standard error of the mean of the habitat-housed ground control mice. *, p<0.01.In the granular convoluted duct cells, immunogold labeling with antibodies to EGF and NGF resulted in labeling of the secretory granules (Fig. 4C, D). In our samples fixed only in paraformaldehyde, the secretory granules exhibited variable electron density. The immunogold labeling density is reported only for the electron dense and moderately electron dense granules. No differences were seen in the labeling densities for EGF and NGF between female flight and habitat ground control mice in the STS-131 and STS-135 missions. Although the EGF labeling was decreased in STS-135 flight mice, it was not significantly different from the habitat ground control mice due to substantial variability among the individual mice. Labeling for both EGF and NGF, however, was significantly increased in male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite compared to habitat ground control mice (Fig. 5). The labeling of terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells in female mice from the STS-131 and STS-135 missions with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 4E) showed no difference between flight and habitat ground controls (Fig. 5). Ground control vivarium mice were available for study for the STS-135 and Bion-M1 missions. Labeling of female vivarium control mice from the STS-135 mission with antibodies to PRP, EGF, NGF and SMGC was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling for SABPα, however, was greater in vivarium control mice than in flight mice (p<0.01) and habitat control mice (p<0.05). Labeling of male vivarium control mice from the Bion-M1 mission with antibodies to PRP and EGF was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling of vivarium control mice for SABPα and NGF was significantly less than in flight mice (p<0.05), but no different from habitat control mice. Non-specific labeling of sections incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune IgG instead of primary antibody was generally very low, in most cases in the range of 0% to 6% of the specific antibody labeling of secretory granules. Non-specific binding of primary antibodies to plastic in interstitial areas ranged from 0.37% to less than 5%.",
    "discussion": "Discussion In the submandibular gland, as in the parotid and sublingual glands of these mice, spaceflight resulted in specific changes in secretory protein expression. Male mice flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 biosatellite had an increased content of SABPα in acinar cell secretory granules, and EGF and NGF in granular convoluted duct cell secretory granules, when compared to that in the habitat ground control mice. This appears to be a specific effect of microgravity. The shorter 13 d and 15 d flights on the space shuttle, however, did not cause increased expression of these proteins in female glands. This suggests that longer exposure to microgravity may result in more profound changes. Other factors also may play a role, such as the age and sex of the mice, stresses during landing given the different space craft, and the time elapsed between landing and dissection. It is possible that the different diets consumed by the mice on the space shuttle flights compared to those on the Bion-M1 flight could have resulted in differences in protein expression. The comparisons in the present study, therefore, are made between the flight mice and habitat ground control mice that were fed the same diets. SABPα, also known as SCGB1B27, is a member of the secretoglobin protein family. Secretoglobins bind lipophilic ligands and are present in mammals and birds (Laukaitis et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2011). In the mouse submandibular gland, SABPα forms heterotetramers with β and γ subunits; the complex binds androgens and acts as a pheromone involved in mate selection (Laukaitis et al., 1997). Previous studies have shown that its expression is similar in male and female mice (Wickliffe et al., 2002), although some paralogues expressed in the female submandibular gland are not present in the male submandibular gland (Laukaitis et al., 2005). Although the pathways regulating SABPα expression are not known, the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, significantly upregulates its expression in male mice after 30 d in space. The PRPs are expressed in the submandibular and parotid glands of humans, rodents and other species, are secreted into saliva, and have bacterial, calcium, tannin and polyphenol binding functions (Oppenheim et al., 1971; Bennick 1982, 2002; Gibbons and Hay, 1988, 1989; Takano et al., 1993). Their synthesis is enhanced by dietary tannins and by the administration of isoproterenol (Fernandez-Sorensen and Carlson, 1974; Mehansho and Carlson, 1983; Mehansho et al., 1985; Divecha et al., 1989; Matsuura and Hand, 1991). Regulation of PRP gene expression by tannins and β-adrenergic agonists occurs via the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signaling system (Carlson, 1993; Ann and Lin, 1998), whose responses vary with the amount of stress imposed on the system. Long-term spaceflight appears to have minimal effects on components of the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A system (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015; Dagdeviren et al., 2018a, 2018b). Relatively modest changes in the levels of salivary and plasma corticosteroids and catecholamines occur as a result of spaceflight in both animals and humans (Kvetnansky et al., 1981, 1991; Macho et al., 1996, 2001, 2004; Larina et al., 1997; Strollo et al., 1997; Blottner et al., 2009; Buchheim et al., 2019). This suggests that the mice from these missions experienced minimal stress due to the spaceflight environment. Stress associated with landing and post-flight readaptation to gravity potentially could affect the salivary glands. However, the relatively short interval between landing and tissue collection for the STS-131 and STS-135 flights may have minimized such effects. This is supported by the lack of significant changes in PRP expression. SMGC, a secretory protein of unknown function, is produced by the terminal tubule cells of neonatal rats and mice (Ball et al., 1988; Zinzen et al., 2004). As the terminal tubule cells decline in number beyond 20 d of age in females, and disappear in males (Hayashi et al., 2000; Hecht et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2018), the levels of SMGC transcripts and protein detectable in the submandibular gland are greatly diminished (Hecht et al., 2000; Zinzen et al., 2004). SMGC expression in females is decreased after ovariectomy and increased by β-estradiol administration (Kusakabe et al., 2016). No differences in immunogold labeling were observed for the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells present in the submandibular gland of the female mice flown on the two space shuttle missions. This suggests that SMGC expression is not affected by microgravity. Alternatively, the length of exposure to microgravity (13-15 d) may have been insufficient to induce changes in SMGC expression. Numerous studies have demonstrated that granular convoluted duct structure and protein expression are dependent on androgens and thyroid hormones, and that the expression of EGF and NGF is much greater in the adult male submandibular gland than in the female submandibular gland (Caramia, 1966b; Chretien, 1977; Aloe and Levi-Montalcini, 1980; Matsuura et al., 1984; Gubits et al., 1986; Kasayama et al., 1989; Gresik, 1994; Adthapanyawanich et al., 2015; Yamanoto et al., 2018). While plasma levels of androgens and thyroid hormones were not determined in the male mice from the Bion-M1 mission, previous studies have shown decreased plasma testosterone in rats (Amann et al., 1992; Macho et al., 2001), and decreased plasma, salivary and urinary testosterone in astronauts (Strollo et al., 1998; Strollo, 1999). Decreases in thyroid function and plasma levels of thyroid hormones after spaceflight have been observed in rodents and humans (Plakhuta-Plakutina et al., 1990; Strollo, 1999; Macho et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2011). The increase in EGF and NGF expression in the granular convoluted duct cells of the Bion-M1 flight mice thus was unexpected. However, androgens and thyroid hormones also act through non-classic nongenomic pathways (Foradori et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2010; Hammes and Davis, 2015); it is possible that microgravity may influence EGF and NGF expression via signaling intermediates that intersect with these pathways. The increased expression of both EGF and NGF by approximately 60% in flight mice compared to habitat ground control mice suggests that the same regulatory pathway(s) was activated for both genes. Watson et al. (1985), using double labeling with different size gold particles, showed that all moderate to large size granules of the granular convoluted duct cells contain both EGF and NGF. They also observed small unreactive granules and suggested that they may contain other granular convoluted duct cell proteins, or perhaps precursors to EGF and NGF that did not react with their antibodies. Similar small granules, occasionally labeled with EGF and NGF antibodies, were observed in the present study. It was not clear whether these labeled granules represent a separate population from the medium to large size granules, or whether they were tangential sections through the larger granules. Autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic acinar cells were observed more frequently in the parotid glands of the flight mice from these three missions than in the corresponding ground controls (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015). In other studies an increase in autophagy and apoptosis in various tissues and in cultured cells was observed after spaceflight, as well as increased expression of genes involved in these processes (Schatten et al., 2001; Gridley et al., 2013, 2015; Novoselova et al., 2015; Blaber et al., 2017). In contrast, the morphology of the submandibular gland appeared to be unaffected by either the 13-15 d or 30 d flights, and autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic cells were rare in both flight and ground control mice. The basis for the different responses seen in the parotid and submandibular gland is not known. However, the responses of the two glands to spaceflight parallel those seen in rats in experimental conditions such as feeding a liquid diet and streptozotocin diabetes, which result in increased autophagy and apoptosis in the parotid (Hand and Ho, 1981; Hand and Weiss, 1984; Takahashi et al., 2012), but few morphological changes in the submandibular gland (Mednieks et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2014). In conclusion, exposure to the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, results in alterations in secretory protein expression in acinar and granular convoluted duct cells of the mouse submandibular gland. The effects appear to be related to the length of the spaceflight as they were seen after a 30 d flight but not after 13-15 d flights. They also may be influenced by the animal’s sex as they occurred in males but not females. Unlike the response of the parotid gland, no obvious changes in cell structure were observed in the submandibular gland. Our findings suggest that evaluating changes in the levels of specific proteins in saliva may be useful for monitoring astronaut physiology and health during long-term spaceflights.",

Copyright notice ID: 6981245 MSID: MS1545090 PMID: 31805482 The publisher's version of this article is available at Arch Oral Biol Abstract Objective: This study was conducted to determine if the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland is affected by microgravity and the spaceflight environment.Design: Tissues from female mice flown on the US space shuttle missions Space Transportation System (STS)-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 d, respectively, and from male mice flown on the 30 d Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite, were examined using transmission electron microscopy and light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry.Results: In contrast to the parotid gland, morphologic changes were not apparent in the submandibular gland. No significant changes in protein expression, as assessed by quantitative immunogold labeling, occurred in female mice flown for 13-15 d. In male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha (in acinar cell secretory granules), and epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor (in granular convoluted duct cell granules) was seen after 30 d in space.Conclusion: These results indicate that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland and suggest that the sex of the animals and the length of the flight may affect the response. These findings also show that individual salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Saliva contains proteins secreted from salivary glands and is easily collected, therefore is a useful biofluid for general medical analyses and in particular for monitoring the physiology and health of astronauts.Keywords: salivary glands, microgravity, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistryIntroduction Spaceflight exposes organisms to numerous environmental stressors, such as gravitational changes, radiation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise, confinement, and disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms. Previous studies of animals and humans after travel in space have documented alterations in several tissues and organ systems, including skeletal, immune, cardiovascular, nervous and gastrointestinal (e.g., Borchers et al., 2002; Hargens and Richardson, 2009; Nagaraja and Risin, 2013; Latchney et al., 2014; Porseva et al., 2017; Demontis et al., 2017; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Early and more recent studies have demonstrated that oral hard and soft tissues, including the mandible (Simmons et al., 1983; Ghosh et al., 2016; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), teeth (Rosenberg et al., 1984; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b), salivary glands (Groza et al., 1981, 1983; Mednieks and Hand, 1985, 1987; Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015; Dagdeviren et al., 2018a) and saliva (Brown et al., 1977), are significantly affected by spaceflight. The response of rodent salivary glands to spaceflight varies among glands and cell types. An increase in autophagy and apoptosis occurs in parotid acinar cells (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015). Large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar cell proteins are present in intercalated and striated duct cells. Changes also occur in the expression of several acinar cell secretory proteins. In contrast, the sublingual gland shows few morphological alterations, but changes do occur in serous demilune cell protein expression (Dagdeviren et al., 2018a). The aims of the present study were to determine if spaceflight affects the morphology and secretory protein expression of the mouse submandibular gland. Glands from mice flown on two US space shuttle flights and from the Russian Bion-M1 satellite, along with ground control mice, were examined using transmission electron microcopy, immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling. The findings indicate that the three major salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight and suggest that the age and sex of the animals and the length of the flight affect the response.Materials and Methods Animals: Eight 16-23 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 15 d on space shuttle Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131), and seven 9 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 13 d on space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135). The mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules, specially designed cages that provide ventilation, lighting, waste collection, food and water (Morey-Holton et al., 2000). Eight mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 15 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-131 flight, and 5 mice housed in Animal Enclosure Modules for 13 d served as habitat ground controls for the STS-135 flight. Six 15-16 wk old male C57BL/6N mice were flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 satellite. The mice were housed in “BOS” flight habitats (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). Four age-matched male C57BL/6N mice housed in the same flight habitats served as asynchronous ground controls. The experimental procedures were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Moscow State University Institute of Mitoengineering (Protocol No-35, 1 November, 2012), and the Biomedical Ethics Commission of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (Moscow) (protocol No–319, 4 April, 2013). All procedures conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes. The samples were made available through the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the space shuttle missions were provided with NASA rodent food bars (Sun et al., 2014) attached to the sides of the Animal Enclosure Modules and water ad libitum. Five mice housed in standard vivarium cages, with rodent chow and water available ad libitum, served as additional ground control animals for the STS-135 mission. Flight and habitat ground control mice on the Bion-M1 mission were fed a paste diet based on standard rodent chow, with water and casein added as a gelling agent (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). The paste food was available at 4 h intervals. Four additional ground control mice were housed in standard vivarium cages and fed rodent chow and water ad libitum. Pre- and post-flight body weight and food consumption data have been published (Mednieks et al., 2014; Dagdeviren et al., 2018b).Sample Collection: Dissection of the mice from the space shuttle flights began about 3 h after landing of the shuttles at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida; dissection of the habitat ground control mice took place 48 h after the flight mice. The vivarium-housed mice were dissected 48 h prior to dissection of the STS-135 flight mice. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Dissection of the Bion-M1 flight mice took place at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow, beginning about 13 h after landing in the Orenburg region of Russia. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The vivarium control mice were dissected immediately after the flight mice, and the asynchronous habitat ground control mice were dissected 99 days after the flight mice. Submandibular glands were removed, rinsed briefly in cold phosphate buffered saline and prepared for morphological and immunohistochemical examination. Small pieces of tissue for morphologic analysis were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Samples for immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After overnight fixation at 4°C, the samples were rinsed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and stored in either buffer (morphology) or 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (immunohistochemistry). The samples were shipped cold by express service from the dissection sites to UConn Health.Morphologic Analysis: The samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, stained in block with 1% uranyl acetate, and processed by standard methods (Hand, 1995) for embedding in PolyBed epoxy resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA). Thin sections (~70-80 nm) were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined and photographed in a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT digital camera.Immunohistochemistry: Paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sections were cut at 5 μm thickness, and immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously (Le et al., 2011), using the Vectastain Elite kits for rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. The sections were observed and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA) equipped with an Accu-Scope Excelis digital camera (Accu-Scope, Commack, NY, USA).Immunogold Labeling: Postfixation was omitted, and the paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were rinsed briefly in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in cold methanol solutions, embedded in LR Gold resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and polymerized in UV light at −20°C. Thin sections from each mouse of the flight and ground control groups from the three missions were collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. Immunolabeling was carried out overnight at 4°C as described previously (Dagdeviren et al., 2018a), using primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in phosphate buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum. Immunolabeling controls included omission of the primary antibody and substitution of non-immune serum or non-immune IgG for the primary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected with gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Int., Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK, or Aurion, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The labeled grids were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in the transmission electron microscope. Table 1: Antibodies Used for Immunohistochemistry.

Labeling densities of secretory granules of acinar cells, terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells, and granular convoluted duct cells were calculated for each mouse as the average number of gold particles/μm2. For direct comparison between different immunogold labeling experiments, the labeling densities were converted to percentages of the corresponding ground control averages. Differences in expression of each protein between the flight and ground control groups were evaluated using ANOVA and t-test functions in Microsoft Excel or StatPlus (v.6.1.60, AnalystSoft, Walnut, CA, USA).Antibodies: Primary antibodies used were to salivary androgen binding protein alpha (SABPα), proline-rich protein (PRP), submandibular gland protein C (SMGC), nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Table 1). A rabbit anti-chicken antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat No. ab97136) was used as a secondary antibody with the chicken anti-PRP primary.Results The flight and habitat ground control mice from both space shuttle missions lost approximately 1-2 g of body weight (Mednieks et al., 2014), but the differences were not statistically significant. Consumption of food and water were similar for the flight and habitat ground control mice. The flight and habitat ground control mice from the Bion-M1 mission gained approximately 2-2.5 g body weight; the differences were significant for the flight mice (p = 0.0010) and habitat ground control mice (p = 0.0456) (Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014). Food consumption for the flight and habitat ground control mice, determined in preliminary experiments, was identical. Morphology: The acinar cells of the mouse submandibular gland are seromucous in nature, with a basally located nucleus, abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the basal cytoplasm, a large Golgi complex, and secretory granules with a granular content of moderate density located in the supranuclear cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A, B; see review by Denny et al., 1997). In adult female glands, terminal tubule cells, also called granular intercalated duct cells, retained from prenatal and early postnatal stages, often are observed at the acinar-intercalated duct junction (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik and MaRae, 1975; Hayashi and Sasa, 1989; Yamamoto et al., 2018) (Fig. 1C). These cells contain numerous small dense secretory granules ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.3 μm. In males, the terminal tubule cells undergo androgen-dependent apoptosis and are completely lost by about 1 month of age (Hayashi et al., 2000; Hecht et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2018). The intercalated ducts, consisting of cuboidal cells that occasionally contain a few small granules, connect to a short striated granular duct (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik and MacRae, 1975; Denny et al., 1990) which is confluent with the granular convoluted duct. The granular convoluted ducts consist of tall columnar cells, with basal nuclei, variably infolded basal cell membranes with adjacent mitochondria, and numerous large dense granules in the supranuclear cytoplasm. (Fig. 2) As described by Watson et al. (1985), smaller dense granules often are present in the cytoplasm between the large granules. These ducts are well-developed in adult male glands, constituting about 45% to 60% of the gland parenchyma (Caramia, 1966a; Gresik, 1994; Jayasinghe et al., 1990; Pardini and Taga, 1996) (Fig. 2A). In female glands, the granular convoluted duct cells are smaller than those of males, contain fewer secretory granules (Fig. 2B), and constitute about 25% of the parenchyma. The granular convoluted ducts are confluent with the striated ducts, which become excretory ducts as they enter the connective tissue septa dividing the gland into lobules and lobes.

All of the cellular organelles exhibited a normal appearance, and the acinar and duct cells had a full complement of secretory granules.Immunohistochemistry: In paraffin sections, antibodies to SABPα labeled all of the submandibular gland acinar cells (Fig. 3A), whereas no reactivity was present in duct cells. Antibody to NGF labeled the granular convoluted duct cells (Fig. 3B). In female mice, the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells were labeled with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 3C, D). No labeling was seen in control sections that were incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune serum or IgG substituted for the primary antibody (Fig. 3E).

A few gold particles were also present over the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The labeling density for SABPα in female mice flown on STS-131 and STS-135 was not significantly different than in habitat ground control mice. In male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite, labeling for SABPα was significantly increased in flight mice compared to habitat control mice (Fig. 5). The labeling density for PRP was unchanged from controls in both female and male flight mice. Figure 4: Open in a new tab Electron microscopic immunogold labeling. A, Bion-M1.

Results are expressed as a percentage ± standard error of the mean of the habitat-housed ground control mice. *, p<0.01.In the granular convoluted duct cells, immunogold labeling with antibodies to EGF and NGF resulted in labeling of the secretory granules (Fig. 4C, D). In our samples fixed only in paraformaldehyde, the secretory granules exhibited variable electron density. The immunogold labeling density is reported only for the electron dense and moderately electron dense granules. No differences were seen in the labeling densities for EGF and NGF between female flight and habitat ground control mice in the STS-131 and STS-135 missions. Although the EGF labeling was decreased in STS-135 flight mice, it was not significantly different from the habitat ground control mice due to substantial variability among the individual mice. Labeling for both EGF and NGF, however, was significantly increased in male mice flown on the Bion-M1 biosatellite compared to habitat ground control mice (Fig. 5). The labeling of terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells in female mice from the STS-131 and STS-135 missions with antibody to SMGC (Fig. 4E) showed no difference between flight and habitat ground controls (Fig. 5). Ground control vivarium mice were available for study for the STS-135 and Bion-M1 missions. Labeling of female vivarium control mice from the STS-135 mission with antibodies to PRP, EGF, NGF and SMGC was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling for SABPα, however, was greater in vivarium control mice than in flight mice (p<0.01) and habitat control mice (p<0.05). Labeling of male vivarium control mice from the Bion-M1 mission with antibodies to PRP and EGF was not significantly different from the flight and habitat control mice. Labeling of vivarium control mice for SABPα and NGF was significantly less than in flight mice (p<0.05), but no different from habitat control mice. Non-specific labeling of sections incubated without primary antibody or with non-immune IgG instead of primary antibody was generally very low, in most cases in the range of 0% to 6% of the specific antibody labeling of secretory granules. Non-specific binding of primary antibodies to plastic in interstitial areas ranged from 0.37% to less than 5%.Discussion In the submandibular gland, as in the parotid and sublingual glands of these mice, spaceflight resulted in specific changes in secretory protein expression. Male mice flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 biosatellite had an increased content of SABPα in acinar cell secretory granules, and EGF and NGF in granular convoluted duct cell secretory granules, when compared to that in the habitat ground control mice. This appears to be a specific effect of microgravity. The shorter 13 d and 15 d flights on the space shuttle, however, did not cause increased expression of these proteins in female glands. This suggests that longer exposure to microgravity may result in more profound changes. Other factors also may play a role, such as the age and sex of the mice, stresses during landing given the different space craft, and the time elapsed between landing and dissection. It is possible that the different diets consumed by the mice on the space shuttle flights compared to those on the Bion-M1 flight could have resulted in differences in protein expression. The comparisons in the present study, therefore, are made between the flight mice and habitat ground control mice that were fed the same diets. SABPα, also known as SCGB1B27, is a member of the secretoglobin protein family. Secretoglobins bind lipophilic ligands and are present in mammals and birds (Laukaitis et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2011). In the mouse submandibular gland, SABPα forms heterotetramers with β and γ subunits; the complex binds androgens and acts as a pheromone involved in mate selection (Laukaitis et al., 1997). Previous studies have shown that its expression is similar in male and female mice (Wickliffe et al., 2002), although some paralogues expressed in the female submandibular gland are not present in the male submandibular gland (Laukaitis et al., 2005). Although the pathways regulating SABPα expression are not known, the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, significantly upregulates its expression in male mice after 30 d in space. The PRPs are expressed in the submandibular and parotid glands of humans, rodents and other species, are secreted into saliva, and have bacterial, calcium, tannin and polyphenol binding functions (Oppenheim et al., 1971; Bennick 1982, 2002; Gibbons and Hay, 1988, 1989; Takano et al., 1993). Their synthesis is enhanced by dietary tannins and by the administration of isoproterenol (Fernandez-Sorensen and Carlson, 1974; Mehansho and Carlson, 1983; Mehansho et al., 1985; Divecha et al., 1989; Matsuura and Hand, 1991). Regulation of PRP gene expression by tannins and β-adrenergic agonists occurs via the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signaling system (Carlson, 1993; Ann and Lin, 1998), whose responses vary with the amount of stress imposed on the system. Long-term spaceflight appears to have minimal effects on components of the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A system (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015; Dagdeviren et al., 2018a, 2018b). Relatively modest changes in the levels of salivary and plasma corticosteroids and catecholamines occur as a result of spaceflight in both animals and humans (Kvetnansky et al., 1981, 1991; Macho et al., 1996, 2001, 2004; Larina et al., 1997; Strollo et al., 1997; Blottner et al., 2009; Buchheim et al., 2019). This suggests that the mice from these missions experienced minimal stress due to the spaceflight environment. Stress associated with landing and post-flight readaptation to gravity potentially could affect the salivary glands. However, the relatively short interval between landing and tissue collection for the STS-131 and STS-135 flights may have minimized such effects. This is supported by the lack of significant changes in PRP expression. SMGC, a secretory protein of unknown function, is produced by the terminal tubule cells of neonatal rats and mice (Ball et al., 1988; Zinzen et al., 2004). As the terminal tubule cells decline in number beyond 20 d of age in females, and disappear in males (Hayashi et al., 2000; Hecht et al., 2000; Yamamoto et al., 2018), the levels of SMGC transcripts and protein detectable in the submandibular gland are greatly diminished (Hecht et al., 2000; Zinzen et al., 2004). SMGC expression in females is decreased after ovariectomy and increased by β-estradiol administration (Kusakabe et al., 2016). No differences in immunogold labeling were observed for the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells present in the submandibular gland of the female mice flown on the two space shuttle missions. This suggests that SMGC expression is not affected by microgravity. Alternatively, the length of exposure to microgravity (13-15 d) may have been insufficient to induce changes in SMGC expression. Numerous studies have demonstrated that granular convoluted duct structure and protein expression are dependent on androgens and thyroid hormones, and that the expression of EGF and NGF is much greater in the adult male submandibular gland than in the female submandibular gland (Caramia, 1966b; Chretien, 1977; Aloe and Levi-Montalcini, 1980; Matsuura et al., 1984; Gubits et al., 1986; Kasayama et al., 1989; Gresik, 1994; Adthapanyawanich et al., 2015; Yamanoto et al., 2018). While plasma levels of androgens and thyroid hormones were not determined in the male mice from the Bion-M1 mission, previous studies have shown decreased plasma testosterone in rats (Amann et al., 1992; Macho et al., 2001), and decreased plasma, salivary and urinary testosterone in astronauts (Strollo et al., 1998; Strollo, 1999). Decreases in thyroid function and plasma levels of thyroid hormones after spaceflight have been observed in rodents and humans (Plakhuta-Plakutina et al., 1990; Strollo, 1999; Macho et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2011). The increase in EGF and NGF expression in the granular convoluted duct cells of the Bion-M1 flight mice thus was unexpected. However, androgens and thyroid hormones also act through non-classic nongenomic pathways (Foradori et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2010; Hammes and Davis, 2015); it is possible that microgravity may influence EGF and NGF expression via signaling intermediates that intersect with these pathways. The increased expression of both EGF and NGF by approximately 60% in flight mice compared to habitat ground control mice suggests that the same regulatory pathway(s) was activated for both genes. Watson et al. (1985), using double labeling with different size gold particles, showed that all moderate to large size granules of the granular convoluted duct cells contain both EGF and NGF. They also observed small unreactive granules and suggested that they may contain other granular convoluted duct cell proteins, or perhaps precursors to EGF and NGF that did not react with their antibodies. Similar small granules, occasionally labeled with EGF and NGF antibodies, were observed in the present study. It was not clear whether these labeled granules represent a separate population from the medium to large size granules, or whether they were tangential sections through the larger granules. Autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic acinar cells were observed more frequently in the parotid glands of the flight mice from these three missions than in the corresponding ground controls (Mednieks et al., 2014, 2015). In other studies an increase in autophagy and apoptosis in various tissues and in cultured cells was observed after spaceflight, as well as increased expression of genes involved in these processes (Schatten et al., 2001; Gridley et al., 2013, 2015; Novoselova et al., 2015; Blaber et al., 2017). In contrast, the morphology of the submandibular gland appeared to be unaffected by either the 13-15 d or 30 d flights, and autophagic vacuoles and apoptotic cells were rare in both flight and ground control mice. The basis for the different responses seen in the parotid and submandibular gland is not known. However, the responses of the two glands to spaceflight parallel those seen in rats in experimental conditions such as feeding a liquid diet and streptozotocin diabetes, which result in increased autophagy and apoptosis in the parotid (Hand and Ho, 1981; Hand and Weiss, 1984; Takahashi et al., 2012), but few morphological changes in the submandibular gland (Mednieks et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2014). In conclusion, exposure to the spaceflight environment, and specifically microgravity, results in alterations in secretory protein expression in acinar and granular convoluted duct cells of the mouse submandibular gland. The effects appear to be related to the length of the spaceflight as they were seen after a 30 d flight but not after 13-15 d flights. They also may be influenced by the animal’s sex as they occurred in males but not females. Unlike the response of the parotid gland, no obvious changes in cell structure were observed in the submandibular gland. Our findings suggest that evaluating changes in the levels of specific proteins in saliva may be useful for monitoring astronaut physiology and health during long-term spaceflights.Highlights: Thirty days of spaceflight alters protein expression in the mouse submandibular gland. The effects appear to be age, sex and flight length dependent. The individual major salivary glands respond differently to spaceflight. Evaluating changes in saliva may be useful for monitoring astronaut physiology and health.

    "abstract": "Abstract The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground control and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared to ground control mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Similarly, mucin (Muc19) expression in acinar cells and PKA-RII expression in demilune cells were increased in STS-131 flight mice and decreased in STS-135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and nuclear PKA-RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, cell types and secretory proteins. Additionally, the spaceflight environment, including the effects of microgravity, modifies protein expression. Determining changes in salivary proteins may lead to development of non-invasive methods to assess the physiological status of astronauts.

    "methods": "Material and Methods All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health () Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (16). The samples were made available through the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program. Eight adult C57BL/6 female mice, 16-23 wk old, were flown for 15 d on space shuttle Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs), specially designed cages that provide ventilation, lighting, waste collection, food and water for the rodents used in spaceflight research (17). Eight ground control mice were also housed in AEMs for the same length of time as the flight. Samples also were collected from 7 C57BL/6 female mice, 9 wk old, flown on space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13 d, along with 4 ground control mice housed in AEMs for the same length of time. All mice were provided with food (NASA rodent food bars) (18) and water ad libitum. Tissue dissections of the flight mice began approximately 3 h after landing; samples were collected from the AEM ground control mice 48 h after the flight mice. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Sublingual salivary glands were prepared for morphological and IHC studies. Routine morphology samples were placed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4; samples for IHC were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After fixation, samples for morphological analyses were rinsed several times and stored at 4°C in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4; samples for IHC were stored in 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. All samples were shipped cold by express service from Kennedy Space Center to UConn Health. Samples for EM morphological study were postfixed in OsO4 and processed by standard methods (19) for embedding in PolyBed epoxy resin (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). Thin sections were collected on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined and photographed in a Hitachi H7650 TEM equipped with an AMT digital camera. For IHC, samples were embedded in paraffin, 5-μm sections were collected on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stained as described previously (20) using the Vectastain Elite kit for rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Primary antibodies used were to sublingual gland mucin (Muc19), a product of the mucous acinar cells, parotid secretory protein (PSP), an antibacterial protein of the serous demilune cells, demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP), and the type II regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-RII), an intracellular regulatory protein and stress marker (Table 1). Controls included omission of the primary antibody, and substitution of pre-immune or non-immune serum or immunoglobulin for the primary antibody. The labeled sections were photographed with a Leitz Orthoplan microscope equipped with a Nikon Coolpix 5000 camera. Table 1. Antibodies Used for Immunohistochemistry.

OsO4 postfixation was omitted, the samples were dehydrated in cold methanol solutions, embedded in LR Gold resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and polymerized in UV light at −20°C. Thin sections from each mouse of the ground control and flight groups from each mission were collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. Non-specific binding was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5% normal goat serum (NGS), and the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in blocking solution. After rinsing with PBS, the grids were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with 15 nm gold particles (Amersham, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK, or Aurion, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Wageningen, The Netherlands), diluted in 1% BSA–PBS. The grids were washed with PBS and distilled water and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Electron micrographs of the labeled sections were obtained in an unbiased manner by selecting cells at low magnification so that gold particles were not visible, then photographing the selected field at 10,000×. Photographs of at least 10 fields each of mucous secretory droplets and serous secretory granules, 5-10 fields each of mucous and serous cell nuclei, and 5 fields of empty plastic were photographed in one section from each mouse. Quantitative analyses of the immunogold labeled micrographs were performed in Photoshop (CS2 v. 9.0.2 or CS4 Extended v. 11.0.2, Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA) using a grid overlay method as described previously (13). Labeling densities for each organelle for each mouse were calculated as mean number of gold particles/μm2. For direct comparison between different immunogold labeling experiments, the labeling densities were converted to percentages of the corresponding ground control means. Differences in expression of each protein between the flight and ground control groups were determined using the t-test function in Microsoft Excel or StatPlus (v.6.1.60, AnalystSoft, Walnut, CA, USA).",
    "results": "Results Morphology and IHC reactivity in the sublingual salivary glands of flight animals was determined, quantified and compared with those of ground control animals. In thin sections examined in the TEM, the secretory end pieces, or acini, were composed of mucous cells arranged around the lumen, and serous cells interposed between adjacent mucous cells or forming a demilune of two or three cells (Fig. 1A). The characteristic feature of mucous acinar cells was the presence of electron lucent secretory droplets filling the supranuclear cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). An extensive Golgi complex and rough endoplasmic reticulum were located mainly in the basolateral cytoplasm, along with mitochondria and occasional lysosomes. The nucleus was relatively electron dense and located close to the base of the cell. Serous cells typically contained a few to several moderately electron dense secretory granules in the apical cytoplasm, a well-developed Golgi complex, and abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1C). The nucleus was generally spherical and less dense than the nucleus of mucous cells. An intercellular canaliculus (inset, Fig. 1C) connected the luminal surface of the demilune cells to the main lumen of the mucous acinus. Short intercalated ducts (Fig. 2) consisting of cuboidal cells connected the acini to the striated ducts. Occasionally, a few intercalated duct cells close to the acinus had accumulations of small mucous-like secretory droplets (inset, Fig. 2). The striated ducts consisted of columnar epithelial cells with abundant mitochondria and extensive infoldings of the basal cell membrane. There were no significant differences in the ultrastructure of sublingual mucous cells, serous cells or duct cells of the animals on either flight when compared to those of the corresponding ground control animals. Figure 1. Open in a new tab A, STS-135 ground control. Electron micrograph of sublingual gland acinus.

An intercalated duct cell adjacent to mucous acinar cells contains mucous-like secretory droplets (arrows) of smaller size and different appearance than those of the acinar cells. IHC for mucin (Muc19) showed intense reactivity in the mucous acinar cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PSP (Fig. 3B), DCPP (not shown) and PKA-RII (Fig. 3C) were present in serous demilune cells. No differences in reactivity between flight and ground control mice could be detected at the light microscopic level. Figure 3. Open in a new tab A, STS-131 ground control.

Immunogold labeling for mucin (Muc19) revealed reactivity in the droplets of the mucous acinar cells (Fig. 4A). The labeling density for mucin was slightly greater in glands of STS-131 flight mice and slightly less in STS-135 flight mice than in the corresponding ground controls, although the differences were not significant (Fig. 5).

Results are expressed as a percentage (± SEM) of the AEM-housed ground control mice. *, p<0.05 compared to control. Immunogold labeling for PSP was present in the granules of serous cells (Fig 4B). PSP expression was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the glands of STS-131 flight mice compared to ground control mice (Fig. 5). In contrast, PSP expression appeared decreased in the glands of STS-135 flight mice, although not significantly due to substantial variation in labeling among the ground control mice. However, the difference in PSP labeling densities between the two flight groups was highly significant (p<0.001). Immunogold labeling for DCPP also was present in the granules of serous cells (Fig. 4C). Compared to the corresponding ground control mice, DCPP labeling was slightly, but not significantly, decreased in the glands of mice on both flights (Fig. 5). Immunogold labeling showed that PKA-RII was present in the granules of serous cells (Fig. 4D). The differences between flight and control mice were not significant, however PKA-RII labeling density was increased in the glands of STS-131 mice but decreased in the glands of STS-135 mice (Fig. 5). The difference in labeling densities between the two groups of flight mice showed a trend toward significance (p=0.063). PKA-RII also was present at low levels in the nuclei of the demilune cells (Fig. 6). Labeling of the nuclei of mice on both flights was slightly increased (Fig. 5), but not significantly. Figure 6.

    "discussion": "Discussion Studies to determine whether microgravity affects the morphology of salivary gland secretory and duct cells indicate that no significant changes occurred in the sublngual gland. The parotid glands of the same mice on both flights showed an increase in autophagic vacuoles in the serous acinar cells, an increased incidence of apoptotic acinar cells, and the presence of large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar secretory proteins in intercalated and striated duct cells (12,13). This likely represents differences in the genetic makeup, and metabolic and secretory functions of the two glands. To determine if microgravity affects the expression of sublingual gland secretory proteins, cell type markers or indicators of specific cell functions with known cellular or oral function were selected. Mucins function in oral health maintenance by protecting oral tissues, providing lubrication and antibacterial activity, and forming a barrier to mechanical and chemical insults (25,26). Muc19 is the major product of mouse sublingual mucous acinar cells (27); its expression increases during perinatal development of the sublingual gland (28). The results suggest that microgravity and the spaceflight environment have little or no effect on sublingual gland mucin expression. PSP, a major product of rodent parotid gland acinar cells (29,30), is present at lower levels in rodent sublingual gland serous demilune cells and is transiently present in the developing submandibular gland (22,31). Human genome sequence analysis has revealed that the human homologue of rodent PSP, a member of the PLUNC (palate, lung, nasal clone) family of secretory proteins, is expressed in human parotid as well as submandibular glands (32). Mouse and human PSP have been shown to bind to and agglutinate several types of oral and digestive tract bacteria (33,34). PSP expression was significantly increased in the sublingual glands of flight mice from STS-131, but was decreased, although not significantly, in flight mice from STS-135. The difference in ages of the mice on the two flights (16-23 wk at launch for STS-131 vs. 9 wk for STS-135) may be related to the different responses and in particular to the significant difference in PSP labeling densities between the two flights. Age-related changes in sublingual gland PSP expression have been shown previously (30,35). In the parotid, PSP expression in these mice did not differ from controls (12,13), suggesting that regulation of this protein may differ in the two glands. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) is found mainly in serous demilune cells of mouse sublingual gland and intercalated ducts of parotid glands (36). The structural similarities between the gene sequences of mouse DCPP and its human homologue, HRPE 773, suggest that DCPP may have antibacterial function in the oral cavity (37). Immunogold labeling showed no significant differences in sublingual gland DCPP expression compared to controls for mice on either flight. DCPP expression was significantly increased in the parotid glands of STS-131 flight animals (12) but was not different from controls in STS-135 flight animals (13). This suggests that, as for PSP, the regulation of DCPP expression differs in these two glands. Protein phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) affects many cellular processes, including exocytosis of stored secretory proteins by salivary gland cells (38,39). The regulatory subunits of type II PKA (RII) are polyfunctional proteins that themselves are involved in various cell functions including growth, development and gene expression. Previous studies have shown that RII is present in the secretory granules of parotid acinar cells in rats and mice (12,40), in the secretory granules of human parotid and submandibular serous acinar cells and sublingual demilune cells (41) and is released into saliva (42). The secretory granules of the demilune cells of STS-131 mice exhibited a trend toward a greater RII labeling density than those of STS-135 mice, but the labeling density of the granules of the flight mice was not statistically different from the ground controls. The increased RII in the sublingual gland of STS-131 differs from the results for secretory granules of the parotid glands for the mice on these two flights and on the 30-d Bion-M1 mission. In all three missions, labeling of parotid acinar cell granules of flight animals was slightly, but not significantly, lower than that of the ground control animals (12,13). RII shows a large, transient increase upon acute stress, but a steady decrease upon continued, chronic stress and a trend toward return to baseline after 4 or 5 d (43,44). A decrease during flight therefore might have been obscured by the stress of landing. PKA has an important role in the regulation of gene expression (45,46). RII is present in the nuclei of parotid gland acinar cells (40,47), and the amount of nuclear RII varies in response to changes in physiological status (23,48). RII is present in the nuclei of sublingual demilune cells, but the labeling density of the nuclei was only slightly, and not significantly, greater in flight mice than in controls. Spaceflight, therefore, has relatively little effect on sublingual gland genes regulated by the cyclic AMP-PKA system. Protein expression differences without morphological changes in salivary glands can indicate adaptation to a changed environment. Specific differences in sublingual gland protein expression were found between the 15-d STS-131 flight and the 13-d STS-135 flight. The expression of PSP, PKA-RII, and mucin was greater in the glands of mice from STS-131 than in those from STS-135. It is unlikely that the two-day difference in the length of the flights could account for these observed differences, although GHOSH et al. (8) showed a difference in the response of mandibular bone to microgravity between the STS-131 and STS-135 flight mice. The difference in age of the mice on the two flights, however, is a significant factor. The results also highlight the difference in response of the parotid and sublingual glands to spaceflight. Future studies comparing samples from different flight durations and larger numbers of animals would address these questions. Samples collected during different time frames after landing will help determine if and when the values return to preflight levels. Long lasting alterations may have irreversible physiologic effects. Determining the effects of spaceflight on biological systems will be useful for developing countermeasures as well as providing insight into the unknowns of this unique environment. Gravitational changes, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise and circadian and sleep disturbances are some of the parameters contributing to astronauts’ physical and psychological stress level and resulting in hormonal changes (5). Changes in salivary secretory proteins are reflected in saliva. Easy access to, and non-invasive collection of saliva makes it a convenient medium to measure physiological and pathological changes in humans. Salivary tests have become a more commonly used diagnostic tool in recent years (15,49–51). Data from spaceflight research will be important in developing salivary test kits that can be used to measure human responses to spaceflight.",

Copyright notice ID: 6131065 MSID: MS970068 PMID: 29984852 The publisher's version of this article is available at Eur J Oral Sci Abstract The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground control and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared to ground control mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Similarly, mucin (Muc19) expression in acinar cells and PKA-RII expression in demilune cells were increased in STS-131 flight mice and decreased in STS-135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and nuclear PKA-RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, cell types and secretory proteins. Additionally, the spaceflight environment, including the effects of microgravity, modifies protein expression. Determining changes in salivary proteins may lead to development of non-invasive methods to assess the physiological status of astronauts. Keywords: microgravity, salivary gland structure, protein expression, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry Human history in space began in the 1960s and has expanded since then. Advancements in space technology have made it possible to answer some of the questions about distant planets and have generated interest in possible human missions to explore these worlds. To carry out these missions, however, requires a more complete understanding the effects of spaceflight and microgravity on biological processes. There are a number of ways to obtain microgravity-associated data including actual spaceflight missions and ground-based studies that simulate weightlessness (bed rest models, hindlimb suspension models, clinostats). However, spaceflight is a unique environment which cannot be totally duplicated. Rodents are the most used animal model in space research, although primates as well as cold-blooded vertebrates and invertebrates also have been flown in space (1). Rodents have advantages over other animals due to their small size, structural and functional similarities to humans, ease of maintenance, and less expense. Previous studies revealed that bone loss, decreased immune system function, alterations in gastrointestinal microbial flora and cardiovascular deconditioning are major consequences of weightlessness on biological systems (2–5). Spaceflight also affects oral hard and soft tissues. Limited information is available about the effects of microgravity on oral tissues including the mandible and teeth (6–9), salivary glands (10–13) and saliva (14). Salivary glands and their secretions can be used to study environmentally-induced changes in cellular and molecular processes by measuring secretory proteins that are specific cell type markers or are indicators of specific cell functions. Saliva from the major and minor salivary glands contains proteins that can serve as indicators of an organism’s systemic physiology and pathology (15). Our previous studies of the rodent parotid gland showed specific structural and molecular alterations following spaceflight (10–13). The parotid gland is a pure serous gland, secreting a variety of proteins and glycoproteins with diverse functions. In contrast, the sublingual gland consists predominantly of mucous cells, with a few serous demilune cells. The main product of the sublingual gland is mucin, with a smaller contribution of proteins and glycoproteins from the demilune cells. Based on the working hypothesis that microgravity modifies ultrastructure and protein expression, it should be possible to measure such changes in the sublingual glands of mice flown on two US space shuttle missions. This study was designed to determine structural changes in the mouse sublingual gland using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to determine cellular distribution and expression of selected sublingual gland proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and to compare these changes to those observed in the parotid gland. Material and Methods All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health () Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (16). The samples were made available through the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program. Eight adult C57BL/6 female mice, 16-23 wk old, were flown for 15 d on space shuttle Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs), specially designed cages that provide ventilation, lighting, waste collection, food and water for the rodents used in spaceflight research (17). Eight ground control mice were also housed in AEMs for the same length of time as the flight. Samples also were collected from 7 C57BL/6 female mice, 9 wk old, flown on space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13 d, along with 4 ground control mice housed in AEMs for the same length of time. All mice were provided with food (NASA rodent food bars) (18) and water ad libitum. Tissue dissections of the flight mice began approximately 3 h after landing; samples were collected from the AEM ground control mice 48 h after the flight mice. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Sublingual salivary glands were prepared for morphological and IHC studies. Routine morphology samples were placed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4; samples for IHC were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. After fixation, samples for morphological analyses were rinsed several times and stored at 4°C in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4; samples for IHC were stored in 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. All samples were shipped cold by express service from Kennedy Space Center to UConn Health. Samples for EM morphological study were postfixed in OsO4 and processed by standard methods (19) for embedding in PolyBed epoxy resin (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA).

Controls included omission of the primary antibody, and substitution of pre-immune or non-immune serum or immunoglobulin for the primary antibody. The labeled sections were photographed with a Leitz Orthoplan microscope equipped with a Nikon Coolpix 5000 camera. Table 1. Antibodies Used for Immunohistochemistry.

OsO4 postfixation was omitted, the samples were dehydrated in cold methanol solutions, embedded in LR Gold resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and polymerized in UV light at −20°C. Thin sections from each mouse of the ground control and flight groups from each mission were collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. Non-specific binding was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5% normal goat serum (NGS), and the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies (Table 1) diluted in blocking solution. After rinsing with PBS, the grids were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with 15 nm gold particles (Amersham, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK, or Aurion, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Wageningen, The Netherlands), diluted in 1% BSA–PBS. The grids were washed with PBS and distilled water and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Electron micrographs of the labeled sections were obtained in an unbiased manner by selecting cells at low magnification so that gold particles were not visible, then photographing the selected field at 10,000×. Photographs of at least 10 fields each of mucous secretory droplets and serous secretory granules, 5-10 fields each of mucous and serous cell nuclei, and 5 fields of empty plastic were photographed in one section from each mouse. Quantitative analyses of the immunogold labeled micrographs were performed in Photoshop (CS2 v. 9.0.2 or CS4 Extended v. 11.0.2, Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA) using a grid overlay method as described previously (13). Labeling densities for each organelle for each mouse were calculated as mean number of gold particles/μm2. For direct comparison between different immunogold labeling experiments, the labeling densities were converted to percentages of the corresponding ground control means. Differences in expression of each protein between the flight and ground control groups were determined using the t-test function in Microsoft Excel or StatPlus (v.6.1.60, AnalystSoft, Walnut, CA, USA).Results Morphology and IHC reactivity in the sublingual salivary glands of flight animals was determined, quantified and compared with those of ground control animals. In thin sections examined in the TEM, the secretory end pieces, or acini, were composed of mucous cells arranged around the lumen, and serous cells interposed between adjacent mucous cells or forming a demilune of two or three cells (Fig. 1A). The characteristic feature of mucous acinar cells was the presence of electron lucent secretory droplets filling the supranuclear cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). An extensive Golgi complex and rough endoplasmic reticulum were located mainly in the basolateral cytoplasm, along with mitochondria and occasional lysosomes. The nucleus was relatively electron dense and located close to the base of the cell. Serous cells typically contained a few to several moderately electron dense secretory granules in the apical cytoplasm, a well-developed Golgi complex, and abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1C). The nucleus was generally spherical and less dense than the nucleus of mucous cells. An intercellular canaliculus (inset, Fig. 1C) connected the luminal surface of the demilune cells to the main lumen of the mucous acinus. Short intercalated ducts (Fig. 2) consisting of cuboidal cells connected the acini to the striated ducts. Occasionally, a few intercalated duct cells close to the acinus had accumulations of small mucous-like secretory droplets (inset, Fig. 2). The striated ducts consisted of columnar epithelial cells with abundant mitochondria and extensive infoldings of the basal cell membrane. There were no significant differences in the ultrastructure of sublingual mucous cells, serous cells or duct cells of the animals on either flight when compared to those of the corresponding ground control animals.

An intercalated duct cell adjacent to mucous acinar cells contains mucous-like secretory droplets (arrows) of smaller size and different appearance than those of the acinar cells.IHC for mucin (Muc19) showed intense reactivity in the mucous acinar cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PSP (Fig. 3B), DCPP (not shown) and PKA-RII (Fig. 3C) were present in serous demilune cells. No differences in reactivity between flight and ground control mice could be detected at the light microscopic level. Figure 3. Open in a new tab A, STS-131 ground control.

The labeling density for mucin was slightly greater in glands of STS-131 flight mice and slightly less in STS-135 flight mice than in the corresponding ground controls, although the differences were not significant (Fig. 5).

Results are expressed as a percentage (± SEM) of the AEM-housed ground control mice. *, p<0.05 compared to control.Immunogold labeling for PSP was present in the granules of serous cells (Fig 4B). PSP expression was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the glands of STS-131 flight mice compared to ground control mice (Fig. 5). In contrast, PSP expression appeared decreased in the glands of STS-135 flight mice, although not significantly due to substantial variation in labeling among the ground control mice. However, the difference in PSP labeling densities between the two flight groups was highly significant (p<0.001). Immunogold labeling for DCPP also was present in the granules of serous cells (Fig. 4C). Compared to the corresponding ground control mice, DCPP labeling was slightly, but not significantly, decreased in the glands of mice on both flights (Fig. 5). Immunogold labeling showed that PKA-RII was present in the granules of serous cells (Fig. 4D). The differences between flight and control mice were not significant, however PKA-RII labeling density was increased in the glands of STS-131 mice but decreased in the glands of STS-135 mice (Fig. 5). The difference in labeling densities between the two groups of flight mice showed a trend toward significance (p=0.063). PKA-RII also was present at low levels in the nuclei of the demilune cells (Fig. 6). Labeling of the nuclei of mice on both flights was slightly increased (Fig. 5), but not significantly. Figure 6.

Nuclear envelope (NE); nucleolus (Nu).Discussion Studies to determine whether microgravity affects the morphology of salivary gland secretory and duct cells indicate that no significant changes occurred in the sublngual gland. The parotid glands of the same mice on both flights showed an increase in autophagic vacuoles in the serous acinar cells, an increased incidence of apoptotic acinar cells, and the presence of large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar secretory proteins in intercalated and striated duct cells (12,13). This likely represents differences in the genetic makeup, and metabolic and secretory functions of the two glands. To determine if microgravity affects the expression of sublingual gland secretory proteins, cell type markers or indicators of specific cell functions with known cellular or oral function were selected. Mucins function in oral health maintenance by protecting oral tissues, providing lubrication and antibacterial activity, and forming a barrier to mechanical and chemical insults (25,26). Muc19 is the major product of mouse sublingual mucous acinar cells (27); its expression increases during perinatal development of the sublingual gland (28). The results suggest that microgravity and the spaceflight environment have little or no effect on sublingual gland mucin expression. PSP, a major product of rodent parotid gland acinar cells (29,30), is present at lower levels in rodent sublingual gland serous demilune cells and is transiently present in the developing submandibular gland (22,31). Human genome sequence analysis has revealed that the human homologue of rodent PSP, a member of the PLUNC (palate, lung, nasal clone) family of secretory proteins, is expressed in human parotid as well as submandibular glands (32). Mouse and human PSP have been shown to bind to and agglutinate several types of oral and digestive tract bacteria (33,34). PSP expression was significantly increased in the sublingual glands of flight mice from STS-131, but was decreased, although not significantly, in flight mice from STS-135. The difference in ages of the mice on the two flights (16-23 wk at launch for STS-131 vs. 9 wk for STS-135) may be related to the different responses and in particular to the significant difference in PSP labeling densities between the two flights. Age-related changes in sublingual gland PSP expression have been shown previously (30,35). In the parotid, PSP expression in these mice did not differ from controls (12,13), suggesting that regulation of this protein may differ in the two glands. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) is found mainly in serous demilune cells of mouse sublingual gland and intercalated ducts of parotid glands (36). The structural similarities between the gene sequences of mouse DCPP and its human homologue, HRPE 773, suggest that DCPP may have antibacterial function in the oral cavity (37). Immunogold labeling showed no significant differences in sublingual gland DCPP expression compared to controls for mice on either flight. DCPP expression was significantly increased in the parotid glands of STS-131 flight animals (12) but was not different from controls in STS-135 flight animals (13). This suggests that, as for PSP, the regulation of DCPP expression differs in these two glands. Protein phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) affects many cellular processes, including exocytosis of stored secretory proteins by salivary gland cells (38,39). The regulatory subunits of type II PKA (RII) are polyfunctional proteins that themselves are involved in various cell functions including growth, development and gene expression. Previous studies have shown that RII is present in the secretory granules of parotid acinar cells in rats and mice (12,40), in the secretory granules of human parotid and submandibular serous acinar cells and sublingual demilune cells (41) and is released into saliva (42). The secretory granules of the demilune cells of STS-131 mice exhibited a trend toward a greater RII labeling density than those of STS-135 mice, but the labeling density of the granules of the flight mice was not statistically different from the ground controls. The increased RII in the sublingual gland of STS-131 differs from the results for secretory granules of the parotid glands for the mice on these two flights and on the 30-d Bion-M1 mission. In all three missions, labeling of parotid acinar cell granules of flight animals was slightly, but not significantly, lower than that of the ground control animals (12,13). RII shows a large, transient increase upon acute stress, but a steady decrease upon continued, chronic stress and a trend toward return to baseline after 4 or 5 d (43,44). A decrease during flight therefore might have been obscured by the stress of landing. PKA has an important role in the regulation of gene expression (45,46). RII is present in the nuclei of parotid gland acinar cells (40,47), and the amount of nuclear RII varies in response to changes in physiological status (23,48). RII is present in the nuclei of sublingual demilune cells, but the labeling density of the nuclei was only slightly, and not significantly, greater in flight mice than in controls. Spaceflight, therefore, has relatively little effect on sublingual gland genes regulated by the cyclic AMP-PKA system. Protein expression differences without morphological changes in salivary glands can indicate adaptation to a changed environment. Specific differences in sublingual gland protein expression were found between the 15-d STS-131 flight and the 13-d STS-135 flight. The expression of PSP, PKA-RII, and mucin was greater in the glands of mice from STS-131 than in those from STS-135. It is unlikely that the two-day difference in the length of the flights could account for these observed differences, although GHOSH et al. (8) showed a difference in the response of mandibular bone to microgravity between the STS-131 and STS-135 flight mice. The difference in age of the mice on the two flights, however, is a significant factor. The results also highlight the difference in response of the parotid and sublingual glands to spaceflight. Future studies comparing samples from different flight durations and larger numbers of animals would address these questions. Samples collected during different time frames after landing will help determine if and when the values return to preflight levels. Long lasting alterations may have irreversible physiologic effects. Determining the effects of spaceflight on biological systems will be useful for developing countermeasures as well as providing insight into the unknowns of this unique environment. Gravitational changes, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise and circadian and sleep disturbances are some of the parameters contributing to astronauts’ physical and psychological stress level and resulting in hormonal changes (5). Changes in salivary secretory proteins are reflected in saliva. Easy access to, and non-invasive collection of saliva makes it a convenient medium to measure physiological and pathological changes in humans. Salivary tests have become a more commonly used diagnostic tool in recent years (15,49–51). Data from spaceflight research will be important in developing salivary test kits that can be used to measure human responses to spaceflight.Acknowledgments We thank Ms. Maya Yankova for her expert technical assistance, and UConn Health for the use of the instruments of the Central Electron Microscope Facility.

    "introduction": "1 Introduction The transition from 1 g to the space environment changes not only gravity but also various other conditions such as the circadian rhythm (Otsuka et al., 2018) and exposure to cosmic rays (Zeitlin et al., 2013). It is important to elucidate the medical risks that humans face when living in a space environment, such as the oxidative stress caused by cosmic radiation (Overbey et al., 2019) and mechanical stress caused by microgravity (Dadwal et al., 2019). Artificial imitation of these environments may provide an understanding of gravitational physiology and determine how to avoid space stress. A previous study showed that the gravitational threshold in the space environment provides a platform for exploring the mechanisms controlling the skeletal muscle response to alterations in gravity (Hayashi et al., 2023). Elucidation of the functional changes and molecular mechanisms involved may lead to the development of strategies to maintain human health during future long-term space travel. The musculoskeletal system and muscle movement controlled by somatic nerves have been studied previously in space and artificial gravitational environments (Juhl et al., 2021; Hayashi et al., 2023). Although studies on the heart rate and activity rhythms controlled by the autonomic nervous system in space are addressed (Blaber et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2015), research on the salivary glands, which are representative of local fluid balance regulation by the system, are limited. Saliva maintains the moist environment of oral tissues and is essential not only for feeding, mastication, and swallowing food but also for oral functions such as digestion, and articulation. In addition, saliva has antibacterial properties that help control the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth, contributing to oral hygiene and prevention of dental issues such as cavities and gum disease. Saliva helps maintain pH balance in the mouth and neutralizes the acids produced by bacteria, thereby reducing the risk of tooth decay and erosion. It plays a role in taste perception by dissolving food particles and allowing them to interact with the taste buds in the tongue. Therefore, saliva is a multifunctional fluid that contributes significantly to oral and digestive health. Insufficient saliva production, known as dry mouth or xerostomia, can lead to various oral health problems and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of salivary secretion during spaceflights. In this study, we collected submandibular glands from mice exposed to artificial lunar gravity. Among the major salivary glands, the large amount of saliva secretion comes from the submandibular gland. Therefore, we thought that changes in salivary gland mRNA due to environmental changes might be more clearly observed in the submandibular gland compared to other salivary glands. In addition, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and we considered that it would be a good model to observe the control mechanism and balance of protein secretion and water secretion by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, i.e., under autonomic regulation. Artificial lunar gravity was developed using multiple artificial gravity research systems (MARS) that use a centrifuge to create artificial gravity, enabling comparative studies between the effects of gravity and microgravity in space (Shimbo et al., 2016; Shiba et al., 2017; Okada et al., 2021). This system has contributed to analysis of sulfur metabolomic and transcriptomic changes in the liver (Kurosawa et al., 2021), metabolic effects in adipose tissues (Suzuki et al., 2020; Uruno et al., 2021), blood parameters changes (Shimizu et al., 2023), bone mineralization, blood pressure, and lipid metabolism in mouse kidneys (Suzuki et al., 2022) during space travel. This study investigated the basic foundations for oral clinical medicine under lunar gravity. We sought to understand whether lunar gravity (1/6 g) influence the mRNA expression in salivary glands during space flight. Using the developed MARS, two independent missions (MHU-4 and MHU-5) were conducted in the space. Using the MARS system, we analyzed the mRNA expression of the whole submandibular gland tissue of mice raised under lunar (1/6 g) and Earth gravity (1 g).",

    "results": "3 Results Microarray analysis to examine the changes in mRNA expression of the 22,206 genes found no correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.077052) between the submandibular gland samples obtained from the MHU-4 and -5 missions, even though both missions were conducted under the same lunar surface gravity environments (Figure 1). This may be due to differences in the centrifugal gradient caused by the radius of each MARS and circadian fluctuation between the time points for collecting samples in two missions. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab No correlation of salivary gene expression was observed between the MHU-4 and -5 missions. Microarray analysis revealed no correlation between changes in the mRNA expression of 22,206 genes (correlation coefficient: 0.077052) between the MHU-4 and -5 missions. We then investigated the cells comprising the submandibular glands and surrounding cell populations, based on specific marker, to identify which cell components showed specific mRNA expression changes in the lunar gravity environment in MHU-4 and -5. The heat map in Figure 2A shows signal intensity ratio of mRNA expression in samples at 1 g and 1/6 g environment in both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Red indicates upregulated genes at 1/6 g and green indicates downregulated genes at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. Microarray analysis of whole submandibular glands samples from both MHU-4 and -5 revealed that the overall variation in mRNA expression was more pronounced in the MHU-4 mission than in the MHU-5 mission. Expression of mRNA relating the acinar cells, characterized by Amy1, Bhlha15, Sox10 were more pronounced than those from other cell populations (Figure 2A). The expression of mRNA related to proliferation and apoptosis did not significantly increase at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group (Figure 2B). Therefore, we focused on mature acinar cells that have physiological functions such as protein and water secretion. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Increases of gene expression in acinar cells in lunar gravity environment. (A) Heat map shows representative mRNAs, encoding marker protein for the cells comprising submandibular gland. The map represents the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression increases with significance were more seen in acinar cells. Gene expression increases were more observed in MHU-4 compared with those in MHU-5. (B) Genes relating to cell proliferation and apoptosis showed no upregulation. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. Amy1 encodes salivary amylase secreted by acinar cells, which is an organic component involved in serous saliva. Amy1 showed significant upregulation in the samples in the 1/6 g environment during both MHU missions (Figure 3A). In contrast, Aqp5, which is involved in water secretion in acinar cells, was highly expressed (data not shown), but no significant changes in the mRNA expression were observed between lunar gravity and ground controls in either mission (Figure 3A). Immunofluorescence staining showed that the amylase protein was expressed at a higher level in lunar gravity than in the ground control, which was consistent with the microarray results. Aqp5 protein expression was also consistent with the microarray data (Figure 3B). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Upregulation of salivary Amy1 in 1/6 g lunar gravity environment in both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. (A) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed that salivary protein gene Amy1 was upregulated in 1/6 g lunar gravity in both MHU-4 and -5 missions. No significant increases of Aqp5 were observed. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the increased expression of amylase in 1/6 g lunar gravity in both MHU-4 and -5 but no increase of Aqp5 even though the salivary cells were highly immunopositive for Aqp5. Scale bar: 50 μm. We further examined signal intensity ratio of mRNA for membrane proteins with cytosolic coiled-coil domains, termed SNAREs, which are found in vesicles (v-SNAREs) and organelles (t-SNAREs) in whole submandibular glands. Vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) is a v-SNARE gene involved in protein vesicle secretion mainly by acinar cells and was highly expressed under lunar gravity in both MHU missions; however, there was no increase in t-SNARE (Figure 4A). Based on these results, it was assumed that amylase secretion was promoted through Vamp8 in the 1/6 g lunar gravity environment compared to 1 g. In samples from the both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions, immunostaining revealed that amylase and Vamp8 protein expression was co-localized within acinar cells. We also observed strong expression of Vamp8 protein at apical side of cell membrane in acinar cells at 1/6 g environment, implying enhancement of vesicle-membrane docking to secrete salivary proteins (Figure 4B). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Upregulation of Vamp8 in the lunar gravity group in both MHU-4 and MHU-5. (A) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed changes in expression of the v-SNARE gene, Vamp8. Other v-SNARE genes such as Vamp2, 5, and 7 were upregulated at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g in MHU-4. Upregulation of the t-SNARE gene in lunar gravity was not observed. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the co-localization of amylase and Vamp8 in acinar cells. Co-localized expression of amylase and Vamp8 was higher in lunar gravity compared with ground control for MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Insets (white dotted rectangles) were enlarged from the yellow dotted rectangles. Arrowheads indicate strong expression of Vamp8 protein and amylase at apical side of cell membrane in acinar cells. Scale bar: 20 μm. Microarray analysis showed an increase in the mRNA expression of Rap1b, a subfamily of the Ras family in the 1/6 g lunar gravity of both MHU-4 and -5 groups (Figure 5A). The immunofluorescence staining results showed the upregulation of Rap1 protein, which were similar with the microarray data (Figure 5B). Increases of mRNA expression in samples from PG in both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions were also observed for Rab1, Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27, which are members of the Rab family (Figure 6A). Immunofluorescence staining showed upregulation of Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 protein which were similar with the microarray data (Figure 6B). Upregulation of some mRNAs from the Rho (Figure 7A), Sar/Arf (Figure 7B), and Ran (Figure 7C) families was observed at 1/6 g samples but did not show common expression patterns between MHU-4 and -5 missions, except for GEF/GAP (Figures 7A–C). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Upregulation of Rap1 in lunar gravity in both MHU-4 and MHU-5. (A) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed changes in expression of Rap1 in 1/6 g in both MHU-4 and MHU-5. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the upregulation of Rap1 in lunar gravity compared with ground control for both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Scale bar: 50 μm. FIGURE 6.

Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the upregulation of Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 in lunar gravity compared with ground control for both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Scale bar: 50 μm. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab No common upregulation of Rho, Sar/Arf, and Ran family genes was observed in the lunar gravity groups of the MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. (A–C) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity on small G protein, Rho, Sar/Arf, and Ran family of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed no common upregulation of Rho, Sar/Arf, and Ran family except for GEF/GAP in lunar gravity for both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. We explored upstream signaling pathways, including Gs, Gi, or Gq protein-coupled receptors and their respective second messengers and enzyme-related factors, as well as mRNA related to adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system and acetylcholine receptors in the parasympathetic nervous system. We observed no significant differences in mRNA expression of them between the samples of GC and PG in both the MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions (Figure 8A). In sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve functions, genes related to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors in the submandibular glands were not significantly upregulated in 1/6 g lunar gravity in both the MHU-4 and -5 groups (Figure 8B). Therefore, changes in mRNA expression may occur downstream signals of salivary secretion system involved in vesicular transport and secretion at apical side of acinar cells. FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab No common upregulation of GPCR, including Gs, Gi, or Gq proteins involved in salivary secretion, was observed. (A) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed no common upregulation of GPCR, including Gs, Gi, or Gq, involved in salivary secretion under the lunar gravity environment in MHU-4 and -5 missions. (B) There were no significant upregulation of autonomic nerve related receptor genes, including adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. GSEA results revealed that the gene set involved in oxidative phosphorylation were highly upregulated in submandibular gland samples under 1/6 g lunar gravity in MHU-4 and -5 (Figure 9A). In addition, the gene set involved in ion exchange associated with ATP synthesis was also upregulated at 1/6 g lunar gravity compared to that under 1 g in the MHU-4 and -5 missions (Figure 9B). FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab Enrichment in a set of mRNAs relating oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis coupled electron transport was observed in lunar gravity in both MHU-4 and -5 missions. (A) Gene set enriched analysis (GSEA) revealed the activation of oxidative phosphorylation in lunar gravity for both MHU-4 and -5 missions. (B) GSEA also revealed the activation of ATP synthesis coupled electron transport in lunar gravity for both MHU-4 and -5 missions. We then investigated whether mechanosensitive ion channels in the submandibular glands sense gravity-induced fluid changes. The heat map shows ratio in changes in the mRNA expression of cation channels, especially transient receptor potential (TRP), Piezo, and acid-sensing ion (ASIC) channels. We revealed mechanosensitive ion channel genes, such as Trpv2, Trpv4, Piezo1, Piezo2, and Asic3 were downregulated in the 1/6 g group compared with the 1 g group in MHU-4 and -5 (Figure 10). FIGURE 10. Open in a new tab Downregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels in lunar gravity. Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed downregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels, such as Trpv2, Trpv4, Piezo1, Piezo2, and Asic3, in lunar gravity for both the MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group.",
    "discussion": "4 Discussion In the 1/6 g lunar gravitational environment, Amy1 was upregulated in the submandibular glands, as were Vamp8 and the small G protein Rap1 (Ras family)/Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 (Rab family) which are involved in vesicle secretion. Amylase has been identified as a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews (Ali and Nater, 2020; Ghasemi et al., 2021). Vamp8 acts as a v-SNARE that regulates the secretion of the entire exocrine system (Wang et al., 2007). Salivary proteins are synthesized in acinar cells. Based on the genetic information in acinar cells, salivary proteins are synthesized in ribosomes, pass through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, become vesicles, and are transported to the Golgi apparatus. Intravesicular proteins that undergo modifications, such as glycosylation, in the Golgi apparatus are concentrated and stored in secretory granules. Small G proteins such as Ras and Rab families function salivary secretion, as guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins with a molecular weight of 20–30 kDa. This hydrolysis results in inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP). Small G proteins act as molecular switches that bind specific target molecules and transmit intracellular signals. GDP/GTP exchange proteins (GEF) are regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The combined GTP and GDP states function as molecular switches corresponding to the on/off states. Activity regulation is temporally and spatially controlled and functions as a biotimer. Small G proteins are classified into five families, and regulate various cellular functions. Rap/Rab signaling plays an important role in saliva and amylase secretion (D'Silva et al., 1998; Sabbatini et al., 2008; Gomi et al., 2017). Our study showed no increase in the expression of mRNA related to receptors for noradrenaline secreted from sympathetic nerves involved in protein secretion, where is the upstream of salivary secretion system, while upregulations of Rap/Rab signaling for transporting intracellular vesicles and v-SNARE (Vamp8) to secrete amylase via exocytosis at apical side of acinar cells were observed in the 1/6 g environment. In addition, salivary secretion requires high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) not only for salivary secretion by maintaining intracellular K+ concentration in acinar cells, but also for modification of saliva by reabsorption and secretion in ductal cells of submandibular gland. Our GSEA data show that a set of mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation was highly upregulated under 1/6 g lunar gravity in MHU-4 and -5. Plus, mRNAs in association of ionic transport coupled with ATP synthesis or hydrolysis were also upregulated at 1/6 g lunar gravity compared to that under 1 g in the MHU-4 and -5 missions. We also hypothesized that changes in gravity may induce changes in body fluids, resulting in excessive fluid inflow into the submandibular gland. Our data shows downregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels such as TRP, Piezo, and ASIC channels, however. Fluid balance fluctuates when gravity changes, shifting fluid to the upper body and creating a situation where the astronauts have edema around the salivary glands, which causes mechanical stress. It is possible that the mRNA levels of these mechanosensitive ion channels in the submandibular gland decrease because of a function that restores them to their normal state. In conclusion, our results indicate that changes in the gravitational environment induce qualitative changes in salivary secretion function and that multiple genes may be involved in maintaining salivary secretion homeostasis in the space environment. Overall, our data suggested that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via vesicular transport and exocytosis mediated by Rap/Rab signaling and Vamp8 at apical side of acinar cells (Figure 11). However, we have not shown the functional assay as amylase secretion in this study. To clarify the correlation mechanisms between these mRNAs and amylase secretion, it will need to be verified whether any effect on amylase secretion is caused by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in acinar cells. Further research on salivary secretion signal and gene regulation may contribute to the future monitoring of the physical and mental health of humans living in space as well as the improvement of oral medicine.

The musculoskeletal system and muscle movement controlled by somatic nerves have been studied previously in space and artificial gravitational environments (Juhl et al., 2021; Hayashi et al., 2023). Although studies on the heart rate and activity rhythms controlled by the autonomic nervous system in space are addressed (Blaber et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2015), research on the salivary glands, which are representative of local fluid balance regulation by the system, are limited. Saliva maintains the moist environment of oral tissues and is essential not only for feeding, mastication, and swallowing food but also for oral functions such as digestion, and articulation. In addition, saliva has antibacterial properties that help control the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth, contributing to oral hygiene and prevention of dental issues such as cavities and gum disease. Saliva helps maintain pH balance in the mouth and neutralizes the acids produced by bacteria, thereby reducing the risk of tooth decay and erosion. It plays a role in taste perception by dissolving food particles and allowing them to interact with the taste buds in the tongue. Therefore, saliva is a multifunctional fluid that contributes significantly to oral and digestive health. Insufficient saliva production, known as dry mouth or xerostomia, can lead to various oral health problems and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of salivary secretion during spaceflights. In this study, we collected submandibular glands from mice exposed to artificial lunar gravity. Among the major salivary glands, the large amount of saliva secretion comes from the submandibular gland. Therefore, we thought that changes in salivary gland mRNA due to environmental changes might be more clearly observed in the submandibular gland compared to other salivary glands. In addition, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and we considered that it would be a good model to observe the control mechanism and balance of protein secretion and water secretion by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, i.e., under autonomic regulation. Artificial lunar gravity was developed using multiple artificial gravity research systems (MARS) that use a centrifuge to create artificial gravity, enabling comparative studies between the effects of gravity and microgravity in space (Shimbo et al., 2016; Shiba et al., 2017; Okada et al., 2021). This system has contributed to analysis of sulfur metabolomic and transcriptomic changes in the liver (Kurosawa et al., 2021), metabolic effects in adipose tissues (Suzuki et al., 2020; Uruno et al., 2021), blood parameters changes (Shimizu et al., 2023), bone mineralization, blood pressure, and lipid metabolism in mouse kidneys (Suzuki et al., 2022) during space travel. This study investigated the basic foundations for oral clinical medicine under lunar gravity. We sought to understand whether lunar gravity (1/6 g) influence the mRNA expression in salivary glands during space flight. Using the developed MARS, two independent missions (MHU-4 and MHU-5) were conducted in the space. Using the MARS system, we analyzed the mRNA expression of the whole submandibular gland tissue of mice raised under lunar (1/6 g) and Earth gravity (1 g).2 Materials and methods 2.1 Animals C57BL/6 J male mice (Stock #000664) obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, United States) and Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, United States) were used for the MHU-4 and -5 missions. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) (Protocol Number: No. 018-011D for MHU-4 and No. 018-036D for MHU-5), Explora Biolabs (Study Number: No. EB19-003 for MHU-4 and No. SP19-003 for MHU-5), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (Protocol Number: No. FLT-18-118 for MHU-4 and No. JAXA MHU-5/FLT-19-121 for MHU-5). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and applicable laws of Japan and the United States.2.2 MHU missions The ground control group (GC) comprised of six age-matched (9-week-old) male C57BL/6 J mice per mission, maintained on Earth under the same conditions as those aboard the International Space Station (ISS). A detailed description of the space flight experiments has been previously reported (Hayashi et al., 2023). In the MHU-4 mission, six 9-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice in a transportation cage unit were launched aboard SpX-17 on 7 May 2019, from the NASA Kennedy Space Center and were then transported to the ISS. The MHU-4 partial gravity (PG) group was maintained in an artificial gravity environment of 1/6 g on the bottom floor of the habitat cage unit by centrifugation at 31 rpm in MARS using a short-radius (15 cm) centrifuge (MARS-S). In the MHU-5 mission, six 9-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice in a transportation cage unit were launched aboard SpX-20 on 10 March 2020, from the NASA Kennedy Space Center and were then transported to the ISS. The MHU-5_PG group was maintained in an artificial gravity environment of 1/6 g on the bottom floor of the habitat cage unit by centrifugation at 21 rpm in MARS using a long-radius (35 cm) centrifuge (MARS-L). The lighting in the mouse habitat cage considered the circadian rhythm and used a 12-h cycle according to the ISS and GMT (standard) time, with a light period of 7:00 to 19:00 and a dark period from 19:00 to 7:00 the next day. Cage unit was equipped with a water dispenser and a feeder that can automatically supply water and food. The crew only needed to periodically refill the water and replenish the food, reducing the workload of the crew. The water dispenser was based on a balloon for injecting medicines, and drinking water was supplied by pressurizing the water using the elasticity of the balloon. The amount of water in the balloon was able to be detected by a sensor when it was full and when a certain amount of water had been consumed from full. For feeding, a spring was used to push out integrally molded food to the feeding surface. Food needed to be replenished once a week, but the food in this device was in cartridge form, making it easy for the crew to replace the cartridges. All the mice from each mission were sacrificed on the second day after returning to the Earth.2.3 Sample collection and preparation Submandibular glands were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 1–2 d at 4 °C before replacing the paraformaldehyde with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The MHU-4 mission samples were processed in the United States in June 2019, and the MHU-5 mission samples were processed in the United States in April 2020. After approximately 40 d, the samples were treated with different concentrations of methanol, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, for 30 min each and then maintained in 100% methanol. The MHU-4 mission samples were processed in Japan in July 2019, and the MHU-5 mission samples were processed in Japan in May 2020. Samples from the ground control experiments were treated using the same method as those from the space experiments. The MHU-4 mission, samples were processed in December 2019; and the MHU-5 samples were processed in October 2020.2.4 Total RNA isolation Total RNA from whole submandibular gland in each group (the MHU-4 GC, the MHU-4 PG, the MHU-5 GC, the MHU-5 PG); n = 1 for each was isolated from the cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples were quantified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), and their quality was confirmed using a 2,200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).2.5 Gene expression microarrays The total RNA from whole submandibular gland in each group was amplified using GeneChip® WT Pico Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and hybridized to the Clariom™ S Assay, mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Affymetrix scanner (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative hybridization intensities and background hybridization values were calculated using Affymetrix Expression Console™. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted according to methods previously described (Mootha et al., 2003; Subramanian et al., 2005).2.6 Data analysis and filter criteria The raw signal intensities of all samples were normalized by a quantile algorithm using Affymetrix® Power Tools version 1.15.0 software. To identify up- or downregulated genes, we calculated Z-scores [Z] and ratios (non-log scaled fold-change) from the normalized signal intensities of each probe for comparison between the control and experimental samples. The criteria for upregulated genes was Z-score ≥2.0 and ratio ≥1.5-fold and for downregulated genes was Z-score ≤ −2.0 and ratio ≤0.66. Since there were no replicate samples in this analysis, it was impossible to evaluate the data using p-values. We used intensity-based Z-scores and fold changes to extract differentially expressed mRNAs. This is expected to reduce noise compared to extracting variable mRNAs based only on fold change values (Quackenbush, 2002).2.7 Immunofluorescence analysis We conducted immunofluorescence staining by using the whole submandibular gland in each group (the MHU-4 GC, the MHU-4 PG, the MHU-5 GC, the MHU-5 PG); n = 1 for each. The fixed submandibular glands were embedded in paraffin, and 2 μm sections were prepared using a microtome (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The sections were deparaffinized by immersing in xylene (Wako) for 10 min three times. The sections were then rehydrated using sequential immersion in 100%, 95%, and 70% ethanol for 10 min. After ethanol treatment, the sections were washed three times with PBS. For immunofluorescence analysis, the samples were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) for 5 min before incubating with blocking buffer (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at room temperature for 15 min. To evaluate the protein expression patterns, the samples were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-Amylase (sc-46657; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, United States), rabbit polyclonal anti-Aquaporin5 (ab53212; 1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), mouse monoclonal anti-Rap1 (sc-398755; 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse monoclonal anti-Rab2a (67501-1-Ig; 1:200; Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, United States), rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab10 (11808-1-AP; 1:200; Proteintech), rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab27b (13412-1-AP; 1:200; Proteintech), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Vamp8 (15546-1-AP; 1:200; Proteintech). After washing with PBS, the following secondary antibodies were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature: Alexa Fluor® 568 donkey anti-mouse (#A10037; Thermo Fisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor® 488 donkey anti-rabbit (#A21206, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After washing with PBS, the stained samples were mounted in a mounting reagent with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (ab104139; Abcam) and analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (X710, X800; Keyence, Osaka, Japan).3 Results Microarray analysis to examine the changes in mRNA expression of the 22,206 genes found no correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.077052) between the submandibular gland samples obtained from the MHU-4 and -5 missions, even though both missions were conducted under the same lunar surface gravity environments (Figure 1). This may be due to differences in the centrifugal gradient caused by the radius of each MARS and circadian fluctuation between the time points for collecting samples in two missions. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab No correlation of salivary gene expression was observed between the MHU-4 and -5 missions. Microarray analysis revealed no correlation between changes in the mRNA expression of 22,206 genes (correlation coefficient: 0.077052) between the MHU-4 and -5 missions.We then investigated the cells comprising the submandibular glands and surrounding cell populations, based on specific marker, to identify which cell components showed specific mRNA expression changes in the lunar gravity environment in MHU-4 and -5. The heat map in Figure 2A shows signal intensity ratio of mRNA expression in samples at 1 g and 1/6 g environment in both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Red indicates upregulated genes at 1/6 g and green indicates downregulated genes at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. Microarray analysis of whole submandibular glands samples from both MHU-4 and -5 revealed that the overall variation in mRNA expression was more pronounced in the MHU-4 mission than in the MHU-5 mission. Expression of mRNA relating the acinar cells, characterized by Amy1, Bhlha15, Sox10 were more pronounced than those from other cell populations (Figure 2A). The expression of mRNA related to proliferation and apoptosis did not significantly increase at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group (Figure 2B). Therefore, we focused on mature acinar cells that have physiological functions such as protein and water secretion. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Increases of gene expression in acinar cells in lunar gravity environment. (A) Heat map shows representative mRNAs, encoding marker protein for the cells comprising submandibular gland. The map represents the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression increases with significance were more seen in acinar cells. Gene expression increases were more observed in MHU-4 compared with those in MHU-5. (B) Genes relating to cell proliferation and apoptosis showed no upregulation. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. Amy1 encodes salivary amylase secreted by acinar cells, which is an organic component involved in serous saliva. Amy1 showed significant upregulation in the samples in the 1/6 g environment during both MHU missions (Figure 3A). In contrast, Aqp5, which is involved in water secretion in acinar cells, was highly expressed (data not shown), but no significant changes in the mRNA expression were observed between lunar gravity and ground controls in either mission (Figure 3A). Immunofluorescence staining showed that the amylase protein was expressed at a higher level in lunar gravity than in the ground control, which was consistent with the microarray results. Aqp5 protein expression was also consistent with the microarray data (Figure 3B). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Upregulation of salivary Amy1 in 1/6 g lunar gravity environment in both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. (A) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed that salivary protein gene Amy1 was upregulated in 1/6 g lunar gravity in both MHU-4 and -5 missions. No significant increases of Aqp5 were observed. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the increased expression of amylase in 1/6 g lunar gravity in both MHU-4 and -5 but no increase of Aqp5 even though the salivary cells were highly immunopositive for Aqp5. Scale bar: 50 μm.We further examined signal intensity ratio of mRNA for membrane proteins with cytosolic coiled-coil domains, termed SNAREs, which are found in vesicles (v-SNAREs) and organelles (t-SNAREs) in whole submandibular glands. Vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) is a v-SNARE gene involved in protein vesicle secretion mainly by acinar cells and was highly expressed under lunar gravity in both MHU missions; however, there was no increase in t-SNARE (Figure 4A). Based on these results, it was assumed that amylase secretion was promoted through Vamp8 in the 1/6 g lunar gravity environment compared to 1 g. In samples from the both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions, immunostaining revealed that amylase and Vamp8 protein expression was co-localized within acinar cells. We also observed strong expression of Vamp8 protein at apical side of cell membrane in acinar cells at 1/6 g environment, implying enhancement of vesicle-membrane docking to secrete salivary proteins (Figure 4B). FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Upregulation of Vamp8 in the lunar gravity group in both MHU-4 and MHU-5. (A) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed changes in expression of the v-SNARE gene, Vamp8. Other v-SNARE genes such as Vamp2, 5, and 7 were upregulated at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g in MHU-4. Upregulation of the t-SNARE gene in lunar gravity was not observed. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the co-localization of amylase and Vamp8 in acinar cells. Co-localized expression of amylase and Vamp8 was higher in lunar gravity compared with ground control for MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Insets (white dotted rectangles) were enlarged from the yellow dotted rectangles. Arrowheads indicate strong expression of Vamp8 protein and amylase at apical side of cell membrane in acinar cells. Scale bar: 20 μm.Microarray analysis showed an increase in the mRNA expression of Rap1b, a subfamily of the Ras family in the 1/6 g lunar gravity of both MHU-4 and -5 groups (Figure 5A). The immunofluorescence staining results showed the upregulation of Rap1 protein, which were similar with the microarray data (Figure 5B). Increases of mRNA expression in samples from PG in both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions were also observed for Rab1, Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27, which are members of the Rab family (Figure 6A). Immunofluorescence staining showed upregulation of Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 protein which were similar with the microarray data (Figure 6B). Upregulation of some mRNAs from the Rho (Figure 7A), Sar/Arf (Figure 7B), and Ran (Figure 7C) families was observed at 1/6 g samples but did not show common expression patterns between MHU-4 and -5 missions, except for GEF/GAP (Figures 7A–C). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Upregulation of Rap1 in lunar gravity in both MHU-4 and MHU-5. (A) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed changes in expression of Rap1 in 1/6 g in both MHU-4 and MHU-5. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the upregulation of Rap1 in lunar gravity compared with ground control for both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Scale bar: 50 μm.FIGURE 6.

Microarray analysis revealed that changes in the expression Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 in 1/6 g in both MHU-4 and MHU-5. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group. (B) Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the upregulation of Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 in lunar gravity compared with ground control for both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Scale bar: 50 μm.FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab No common upregulation of Rho, Sar/Arf, and Ran family genes was observed in the lunar gravity groups of the MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. (A–C) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity on small G protein, Rho, Sar/Arf, and Ran family of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed no common upregulation of Rho, Sar/Arf, and Ran family except for GEF/GAP in lunar gravity for both MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group.We explored upstream signaling pathways, including Gs, Gi, or Gq protein-coupled receptors and their respective second messengers and enzyme-related factors, as well as mRNA related to adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system and acetylcholine receptors in the parasympathetic nervous system. We observed no significant differences in mRNA expression of them between the samples of GC and PG in both the MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions (Figure 8A). In sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve functions, genes related to adrenergic and cholinergic receptors in the submandibular glands were not significantly upregulated in 1/6 g lunar gravity in both the MHU-4 and -5 groups (Figure 8B). Therefore, changes in mRNA expression may occur downstream signals of salivary secretion system involved in vesicular transport and secretion at apical side of acinar cells. FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab No common upregulation of GPCR, including Gs, Gi, or Gq proteins involved in salivary secretion, was observed. (A) Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed no common upregulation of GPCR, including Gs, Gi, or Gq, involved in salivary secretion under the lunar gravity environment in MHU-4 and -5 missions. (B) There were no significant upregulation of autonomic nerve related receptor genes, including adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group.GSEA results revealed that the gene set involved in oxidative phosphorylation were highly upregulated in submandibular gland samples under 1/6 g lunar gravity in MHU-4 and -5 (Figure 9A). In addition, the gene set involved in ion exchange associated with ATP synthesis was also upregulated at 1/6 g lunar gravity compared to that under 1 g in the MHU-4 and -5 missions (Figure 9B). FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab Enrichment in a set of mRNAs relating oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis coupled electron transport was observed in lunar gravity in both MHU-4 and -5 missions. (A) Gene set enriched analysis (GSEA) revealed the activation of oxidative phosphorylation in lunar gravity for both MHU-4 and -5 missions. (B) GSEA also revealed the activation of ATP synthesis coupled electron transport in lunar gravity for both MHU-4 and -5 missions.We then investigated whether mechanosensitive ion channels in the submandibular glands sense gravity-induced fluid changes. The heat map shows ratio in changes in the mRNA expression of cation channels, especially transient receptor potential (TRP), Piezo, and acid-sensing ion (ASIC) channels. We revealed mechanosensitive ion channel genes, such as Trpv2, Trpv4, Piezo1, Piezo2, and Asic3 were downregulated in the 1/6 g group compared with the 1 g group in MHU-4 and -5 (Figure 10). FIGURE 10. Open in a new tab Downregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels in lunar gravity. Heat map showing the ratio calculated from the signal intensity of 1/6 g–1 g. Microarray analysis revealed downregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels, such as Trpv2, Trpv4, Piezo1, Piezo2, and Asic3, in lunar gravity for both the MHU-4 and MHU-5 missions. Red in heat map indicates upregulated mRNA at 1/6 g and green in heat map indicates downregulated mRNA at 1/6 g compared to the 1 g group.4 Discussion In the 1/6 g lunar gravitational environment, Amy1 was upregulated in the submandibular glands, as were Vamp8 and the small G protein Rap1 (Ras family)/Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 (Rab family) which are involved in vesicle secretion. Amylase has been identified as a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews (Ali and Nater, 2020; Ghasemi et al., 2021). Vamp8 acts as a v-SNARE that regulates the secretion of the entire exocrine system (Wang et al., 2007). Salivary proteins are synthesized in acinar cells. Based on the genetic information in acinar cells, salivary proteins are synthesized in ribosomes, pass through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, become vesicles, and are transported to the Golgi apparatus. Intravesicular proteins that undergo modifications, such as glycosylation, in the Golgi apparatus are concentrated and stored in secretory granules. Small G proteins such as Ras and Rab families function salivary secretion, as guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins with a molecular weight of 20–30 kDa. This hydrolysis results in inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP). Small G proteins act as molecular switches that bind specific target molecules and transmit intracellular signals. GDP/GTP exchange proteins (GEF) are regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The combined GTP and GDP states function as molecular switches corresponding to the on/off states. Activity regulation is temporally and spatially controlled and functions as a biotimer. Small G proteins are classified into five families, and regulate various cellular functions. Rap/Rab signaling plays an important role in saliva and amylase secretion (D'Silva et al., 1998; Sabbatini et al., 2008; Gomi et al., 2017). Our study showed no increase in the expression of mRNA related to receptors for noradrenaline secreted from sympathetic nerves involved in protein secretion, where is the upstream of salivary secretion system, while upregulations of Rap/Rab signaling for transporting intracellular vesicles and v-SNARE (Vamp8) to secrete amylase via exocytosis at apical side of acinar cells were observed in the 1/6 g environment. In addition, salivary secretion requires high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) not only for salivary secretion by maintaining intracellular K+ concentration in acinar cells, but also for modification of saliva by reabsorption and secretion in ductal cells of submandibular gland. Our GSEA data show that a set of mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation was highly upregulated under 1/6 g lunar gravity in MHU-4 and -5. Plus, mRNAs in association of ionic transport coupled with ATP synthesis or hydrolysis were also upregulated at 1/6 g lunar gravity compared to that under 1 g in the MHU-4 and -5 missions. We also hypothesized that changes in gravity may induce changes in body fluids, resulting in excessive fluid inflow into the submandibular gland. Our data shows downregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels such as TRP, Piezo, and ASIC channels, however. Fluid balance fluctuates when gravity changes, shifting fluid to the upper body and creating a situation where the astronauts have edema around the salivary glands, which causes mechanical stress. It is possible that the mRNA levels of these mechanosensitive ion channels in the submandibular gland decrease because of a function that restores them to their normal state. In conclusion, our results indicate that changes in the gravitational environment induce qualitative changes in salivary secretion function and that multiple genes may be involved in maintaining salivary secretion homeostasis in the space environment. Overall, our data suggested that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via vesicular transport and exocytosis mediated by Rap/Rab signaling and Vamp8 at apical side of acinar cells (Figure 11). However, we have not shown the functional assay as amylase secretion in this study. To clarify the correlation mechanisms between these mRNAs and amylase secretion, it will need to be verified whether any effect on amylase secretion is caused by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in acinar cells. Further research on salivary secretion signal and gene regulation may contribute to the future monitoring of the physical and mental health of humans living in space as well as the improvement of oral medicine.

    "abstract": "Abstract Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 137Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction 1.1. Stressors in a Space Environment In the space environment, astronauts are exposed to multiple stressors such as isolation, confinement, variable gravitational forces, increased radiation, psychosocial stressors, sleep deprivation, noise, physical exertion, deconditioning, and anxiety [1]. Among these stressors, the radiation environment in low-Earth orbit is composed of a complex mixture of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), particles of trapped belts, and secondary particles generated in both the spacecraft and Earth’s atmosphere [2]. Ions of all atomic numbers from hydrogen to uranium are present in GCR, the great majority being protons. Their energies cover a large spectrum extending from a few MeV/n to nearly 1015 MeV/n, peaking at ~1 GeV/n. On Earth, heavy ions are shielded by the Earth’s magnetosphere and atmosphere. In space, many highly charged (Z) and energy (HZE) particles, such as iron ions, are difficult to shield with existing methods. Furthermore, they may collide with nuclei of the atoms they encounter, fragmenting either the target and/or the projectile thereby producing several secondary particles. Therefore, space radiation is a concern for long-duration space missions, such as the three-year Mars mission that would lead to a whole-body dose of about 1 Sievert or more [3]. 1.2. Reactivation of Latent Viruses Immune system dysregulation, defined by altered leukocyte distribution, reduced T and NK cell function, and altered plasma cytokine levels, has been reported in astronauts during short- and long-duration spaceflight [4,5]. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses results as a consequence of decreased immunity in astronauts [6,7,8,9]. A central question is whether the detection of increased levels of viruses in humans during spaceflight is due to immunosuppression associated with travel in space or a direct effect of space environmental factors, such as radiation inducing reactivation of the virus from latency. For example, the primary infection by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) results in varicella (chickenpox), after which the virus becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. When cellular immunity to VZV wanes with age and/or immunosuppression, VZV can reactivate to cause herpes zoster (shingles). The consequences of latent viral reactivation are important as shingles may be complicated by post-herpetic neuralgia, zoster paresis, cranial nerve palsies, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, vasculopathy, or ocular disorders [10]. Similarly, reactivation of Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) may lead to lymphoproliferative disease and may play a role in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, peripheral B and T cell lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [11]. We have studied the effects of four types of radiation, 137Cs gamma, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions on the reactivation of EBV in an EBV-producer line (Akata) in vitro. This cell line was established from a Japanese patient with Burkitt’s lymphoma [12]. There are several reasons for the choice of radiation types. The 137Cs gamma ray is a common source of photons, which are often used in experiments as a reference for low linear energy transfer (LET). Protons are an obvious choice as they are the most important component of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectra. The 150-MeV protons have a low LET and are considered to have a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 for several biological end points [13]. The RBE value of 1.1 for protons is based mostly on cell colony formation data, generally at higher, therapy-type dosages. Although it does not necessarily apply to other biological end points, it is an indication that protons and photons have similar biological effects at the same dose. The carbon ions are present in GCR and are also considered for hadron therapy. The iron ions are a relatively rare occurrence in the GCR, but they have high LET and high RBE for several biological end points [13]. Therefore, by using these ions, which cover a large part of the GCR spectra, the biological effects of representative particle types in space can be determined. In this study, we found that a significant increase in EBV reactivation relative to controls is observed for all radiation types used. However, when equal doses (physical doses not corrected for the RBE) are compared with control, each radiation source induced viral reactivation differently. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation. These findings challenge the common RBE concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points [13]. This difference in viral reactivation may be explained by the differences in the radiation track structure.",

Materials and Methods The current study was approved and sponsored under Research Opportunities in Space Biology Solicitation: NNH12ZTT002N: Proposal Number: 12-12GB_Step2-0014. 4.1. Cell Cultures An Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) producer line, designated Akata (ATCC), was established from a Japanese patient with Burkitt’s lymphoma and used in this study [12]. Akata cells have a t(8q−; 14q+) chromosomal translocation—typical of Burkitt’s lymphoma cells. These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (Gibco®, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (ATCC® 30-2020™, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), 25 U/mL penicillin, 25 µg/mL Streptomycin, and 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco®, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [17]. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with 95% humidity and 5% carbon dioxide. 4.2. Experimental Conditions For all experiments, 102 upright, 75-cm2 (T-75) tissue-culture flasks with vented caps (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) were initially seeded with 1 × 106 Akata cells/mL in 50 mL of fresh medium on day 0. Six flasks of these virus-infected cells were assigned to a control arm, while the remainder were split evenly (24 apiece) between four radiation exposure arms (137Cs gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, and iron ions). After seeding on day 0, the 24 flasks in each radiation type were divided into four irradiation groups of 6 flasks each. Depending on the group, cells were then exposed to an acute dose of either 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 Gy at room temperature. The dose rates in cGY/min for gamma rays, proton ions, carbon ions, and iron ions are shown in Table 1. The six flasks in the controls were not irradiated. Doses of radiation of 5 Gy or more were not studied because all cells were killed at these doses. For all four radiation types, cells were allowed to grow for up to 20 days after each exposure (day 0). Table 1. Dosage rate (cGy/min) for different radiation types. Type LET (keV/µm) 0.1 Gy 0.5 Gy 1.0 Gy 2.0 Gy Gamma Rays 0.30 148.76 148.76 148.76 148.76 Protons 150 MeV 0.54 9.71 44.64 49.76 55.71 Carbon Ions 600 MeV/n 9.18 18.87 29.24 27.55 27.55 Iron Ions 600 MeV/n 172.40 20.00 14.71 38.46 23.53 Open in a new tabCells were aseptically split and harvested from each flask by removing 25 mL of cells and media on day 0, and then on every fourth day for 20 days. In each of the experiments, the first harvest (day 0) was made before irradiation, while all other samples were harvested post-irradiation. The control samples were not irradiated. Except for day 20 (the last day), harvested cells and media were replaced with 25 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 Medium. After each harvest, live cells were split into five aliquots of 1 × 106 cells/mL and then frozen for later assessment of cell size, cell viability, detection of EBV lytic RNA transcripts, and EBV viral load. All measurements were conducted in quadruplicates. Proton, carbon, and iron irradiation experiments were performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at the Brookhaven National Laboratory’s facilities in New York. 137Cesium gamma irradiation was performed at both the NASA Johnson Space Center and the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The energy of protons was 150 MeV/n, of carbon ions was 600 MeV/n, and of iron ions was 600 MeV/n. 4.3. Cell Counts and Viability Cell count, concentration, diameter, and percentage viability of the fresh cells were measured before freezing (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom, Lawrence, MA, USA) in 1 million EBV-positive Akata cells in each condition. Cellometer Auto 2000 gives a clear distribution of live and dead cells when counted. Only live cell counts were accounted for when splitting the cells. 4.4. Analysis of EBV Lytic Gene Transcription Irradiated and control samples were harvested into RNALater™ (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C until extraction. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C, the RNALater™ removed, 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermo Fisher) was added to the pellets, and the pellets homogenized. Chloroform (0.2 mL) was added, the tubes vortexed vigorously, incubated for 3 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000× g at 4 °C. The aqueous layer containing the RNA was removed and the RNA was precipitated by adding 0.5 mL 100% isopropanol and 0.5 µL GlycoBlue™ (Thermo Fisher). RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets were washed three times with 1 mL of 75% ethanol, then vortexed and centrifuged at 7500× g for 5 min at 4 °C between each wash. The pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 45 µL of nuclease free water. The RNAs were prepared for reversed transcription using the TURBO DNA-free™ DNase Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, and the final concentration of RNA determined using a NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer. The RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Omniscript® Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 1 µg RNA and random decamer primers according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For quantification of the cDNAs, qPCR was performed using TaqMan™ Fast Universal Master Mix and the appropriate primers/probes (Applied Biosystems) in a StepOnePlus™ qPCR instrument. The sequences of the primers and probes used were: GAPDH Assay No. Hs02786624_g1 (Applied Biosystems), and Applied Biosystems custom designed BZLF1 forward primer: 5′AAATTTAAGAGATCCTCGTGTAAAACATC3′, reverse primer: 5′CGCCTCCTGTTGAAGCAGAT3′, probe: 5′ATAATGGAGTCAACATCCAGGCTTGGGC3′; BLLF1 forward primer: 5′AGAATCTGGGCTGGGACGTT3′, reverse primer: 5′ACATGGAGCCCGGACAAGT3′, and probe: 5′AGCCCACCACAGATTACGGCGGT3′. Assays, either radiation treatment and no radiation treatment (control), were performed on at least three biological replicates of each treatment and three technical replicates of each cDNA sample. The mean quantity for BLLF1 and BZLF1 qRT-PCR values was divided by the corresponding cellular control (GAPDH) qRT-PCR mean values for a given sample. For example, the mean value for the 0.1 Gy iron, day 0, BLLF1 qRT-PCRs was divided by the mean values for the 0.1 Gy iron, day 0, GAPDH qRT-PCRs to yield the relative quantity value (normalized to the cellular control). Once that normalization was complete, each sample was divided by its corresponding day-0 value to yield a fold change from the day-0 time point. For example, the 0.5 Gy carbon, day 8, BZLF1/GAPDH value was divided by the 0.5 Gy carbon, day 0, BZLF1/GAPDH value to yield a fold change in normalized mean quantity value between day 0 and day 8 for this sample. 4.5. Determination of EBV Load One million EBV-infected Akata cells were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min. DNA was extracted from both cells and supernatant using an ArchivePure DNA Tissue kit (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). EBV BALF5 DNA was quantified by Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) using a TaqMan™ 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). The EBV viral load assay used the primers and probe set as described [18] at a concentration of 150 nM and 200 nM, respectively. The results were normalized to the total DNA concentration obtained via a NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For determining viral load, qPCR was performed in 20 uL reaction mixture containing absolute fast qPCR master mix using the Fast Reaction plates on the TaqMan™ 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). A fluorogenic probe, 5′/6-FAM-TGTACACGCACGAGAAATGCGCC-TAMRA/3′, was synthesized from Integrated DNA Technologies. The primers, 5′CGGAAGCCCTCTCTGGACTTC-3′ and 5′CCCTGTTTATCCGATGGAATG-3′, from the BALF5 gene were also synthesized from IDT DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA). The optimized qPCR reaction mix contained 10% of DNA, 1× TaqMan™ Master Mix, 200 µM each primer, 150 µM probe, and 43.5% water. Amplification conditions consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Florescence from probe degradation was recorded during the 60 °C extension cycle and analyzed by SDS program (Sequence Detector Software; Applied Biosystems). The SDS determined cycle threshold (CT) is defined as the cycle number at which the florescence value intersects the threshold value, which was set 10-fold above the background fluorescence and was within the logarithmic phase of PCR amplification. A standard curve was obtained using a plasmid containing the BALF5 gene as a standard that was serially diluted, and used to calculate the viral copy number for each reaction well that was run. The standards included in the qPCR assay yielded an inverse relationship between CT values and the amount of template DNA. 4.6. Normalizing Data from qPCR For each sample, viral copy numbers from four readings were averaged and then normalized by the DNA concentration determined by NanoDrop™ to produce the main outcome measure of viral load: copies of EBV DNA per nanogram of DNA. 4.7. Data Analysis Statistical analyses of EBV lytic gene transcription data for the Akata cells were performed using the RM two-Way ANOVA Matched Values and Tukey’s Multiple Comparisons Test on GraphPad Prism to determine the significance of these values as compared to other levels of each type of radiation. EBV viral load, viability, and cell size as a function of radiation type, dosage, and day of sample were assessed with quantile regression. Quantile regression was the analysis method of choice for these data because it can accommodate skewness and high variability in the data without assuming any particular statistical distribution. Dependent variables for the regressions were log viral load, logit viability, and cell size (untransformed). For each of these, a separate regression was run for each dose (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy), because dose‒response patterns were generally inconsistent over the various combinations of radiation category and time. Also, in the regression models, time points were treated as discrete conditions because there was an insufficient number or density of these time points immediately after irradiation of samples to formulate continuous time-trend models. This was an exploratory study and, as such, we were seeking to identify combinations of dosages, days, and radiation types that produced median responses sufficiently different from the corresponding control samples to be beyond chance variation. Taking into consideration the 96 possible comparisons (4 radiation types × 4 doses × 6 days) that could be made for each outcome, we used the method of Benjamini and Yekutieli [19] to control the false-discovery rate (FDR) for flagging combinations of interest so that the expected number of false discoveries would be one or less for each outcome variable (see results). Although theoretically there should not be any differences on day 0 (before irradiation) we included all the day-0 comparisons as a check for consistency of samples. 4.8. Simulations of Radiation Tracks To understand the differences in the reactivation of virus by radiation types, it is useful to look at the radiation track structure of the radiation types used in this study. For heavy ions, energy deposition is highly heterogeneous, with a localized contribution along the trajectory of every particle and lateral diffusion of energetic electrons (i.e., gamma rays, the target atom electrons ionized by the incident heavy ion and emitted at high energy) many microns from the path of the ions. These particles are therefore densely ionizing along the primary track (e.g., the track followed by the incident heavy ion, the so-called core). Moreover, they are surrounded by a region (penumbra) comprising the high-energy electrons ejected by ions [20]. The density of the core and penumbra depends mostly on the charge and velocity (energy per nucleon) of the ion. The situation is quite different for gamma rays that interact with the medium mostly by the Compton and photoelectric effects, which result in considerable deflection of the photon after an interaction and the creation of a large number of electron tracks in the medium. In this work, we have simulated the irradiation of a representative volume (10 µm × 10 µm × 5 µm) by gamma rays, protons, carbon and Iron ions using the code RITRACKS (Relativistic Ion Tracks). The code RITRACKS, developed over the last few years at the NASA Johnson Space Center [21], simulates the primary interactions of the radiation and calculates the energy of all electrons produced in the medium. The secondary electrons may lead to further ionizations in the medium, and secondary electron tracks are simulated as well. The detailed algorithms for these simulations have been described [22,23]. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to mimic the contributions of radiation from neighboring volumes to the volume of interest.",

Results We sought to identify any increase in transcription of EBV lytic genes following treatment of Akata cells (that contain a latent EBV episome) with gamma irradiation (as described in the Materials and Methods sections). For these analyses we examined the RNA levels of two key EBV lytic genes, BZLF and BLLF. BZLF1 is an immediate early (IE) gene that codes for ZEBRA or Zta, an important trans-activator that is critical for reactivation. BLLF1 is a late (L) gene that codes for the envelope glycoprotein gp350; this protein complexes with gp220 to bind to the B-cell’s CD21. The results of the qRT-PCR indicate that gamma radiation induces transcription of both BZLF1 and BLLF peaking at day 4. post-gamma-radiation treatment (Figure 1). The irradiation dose of 0.1 Gy did not significantly increase the transcription of BZLF1; however, with 2.0 Gy of gamma radiation, there was a noticeable increase in both gene transcripts. The peak of BZLF1 transcription was at day 4 post-infection, but the increase was not statistically significant due to large standard deviation. At day 8, both 1.0 Gy and 2.0 Gy of gamma radiation resulted in significantly higher levels of BZLF1 (Figure 1A). 0.1 Gy of radiation caused a significant increase in BLLF1 from day 0 to day 16, while 0.5 Gy of radiation caused a significant increase at day 8 (Figure 1B). While gamma radiation increased the transcription in both gene classes, the amount of BLLF1 transcription was on average 3-fold less than BZLF1. Figure 1.

The control flask (light blue) was not irradiated. (A) Fold change of IE gene BZLF1 transcripts normalized to endogenous control GAPDH over time relative to the control. (B) Fold change of L gene BLLF1 transcripts normalized to endogenous control GAPDH over time relative to the control. Statistical significance as compared to no radiation control and (two-tailed t test, * p < 0.05). We next sought to examine the effects of proton and high-energy particle radiations on their ability to induce EBV transcription (as described in detail in the Materials and Methods sections). Flasks of Akata cells were irradiated with high energy proton, carbon, and iron high energy particles. As shown in Figure 2, all three of these radiations induced transcription of BZLF1 and BLLF1. Interestingly, the high-energy proton induced the greatest gene expression of BZLF1 at the 0.1 Gy value at day 4 (Figure 2A), whereas carbon radiation induced the greatest BZLF1 transcription at 0.5 Gy, but this occurred much later, at 16 days post-radiation treatment (Figure 2B). Similar to the case for carbon, iron radiation increased BZLF1 expression at day 12 at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 Gy (Figure 2C). Figure 2.

Statistical significance as compared to no radiation control (two-tailed t test, * p < 0.05). (A) Proton; (B) carbon, (C) Iron. Further analyses reveal that the values for transcription activation for protons at 0.1 Gy is significantly different than 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy at day 4 (Figure 2A). Additionally, at day 4, the value for protons at 0.1 Gy is significantly different than 1.0 Gy and 2.0 Gy. This suggests that a lower dose of radiation is responsible for inducing a greater amount of BZLF1 transcription. For BLLF1 following proton treatment at 1.0 Gy, transcription is significantly different than 0.1 Gy and 0.5 Gy at day 4 for normalized BLLF1, although the actual transcript value is much less than the values for proton irradiation. This suggests that a larger dose of radiation may be required to induce significant transcription of late genes. Carbon ions appears to induce transcription of BZLF1 at days 8 and 12 post-treatment with 1.0 Gy (Figure 2B). For BLLF1, the carbon radiation induced significant transcription at 0.1 Gy at days 8 and 20, with all radiation doses inducing greater transcript values at day 12. Iron ions induced a noticeable peak in transcript values around day 12 for BZLF1, yet none are statistically significant at the p = 0.05 level. When iron irradiation effect on BLLF1 transcription was examined (Figure 2C), there was a wider range of transcript values, with transcription being induced as early as day 4 and continuing to day 12 at some dosages. These data indicate that all forms of radiation tested induced EBV transcription as early as four days post-treatment; however, the effects differ from gamma irradiation in the magnitude of transcript induction as well as the duration of gene activation. Like gamma radiation, high-energy particle radiation induces EBV transcription as early as day 4 post-treatment but suggest that the type of radiation impacts the peak expression of EBV transcription, with protons peaking around day 4 and carbon and iron peaking around day 12. Overall, all of the carbon and iron ions had higher relative levels of gene expression for both the intermediate early and late genes than did either gamma or proton radiation treatments. 2.1. Viral Load Given the increases in viral transcription, we next sought to determine if these radiation treatments induced increases in EBV genomes in the Akata cells, as evidence of productive DNA replication and viral reactivation. Plots over time of the estimated difference from control in median log viral load for all types of radiation are shown in Figure 3A–D for each of the four doses. Error bars in these plots indicate 95% confidence limits as obtained through quantile regression. From these plots, it can be seen that after irradiation, median viral loads were noticeably higher than controls at all post-irradiation time points (days 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20) for all types of radiation. More specifically, after controlling the false-discovery rate to 1%, we found significant increases in median log viral load relative to control in 67 of the possible 96 comparisons (6 time points versus 4 doses × 4 radiation types). The greatest differences were found on day 4 for all four types of radiation at all doses studied. This effect then decreased over the subsequent time points (days 8, 12, 16, and 20), except for the 2 Gy dose, where viral load levels were approximately maintained up to day 8. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Change in viral loads (EBV DNA) compared to control following gamma, proton, carbon, and iron radiation at different dosages, (A); 0.1, (B); 0.5, (C), 1.0 and (D), 2.0 Gy treatments with 95% confidence limits indicated.For the first eight days post-irradiation, gamma radiation produced the highest rates of viral reactivation; however, on day 0 samples from the flasks designated for subsequent gamma radiation at dosages of 0.1 and 1.0 Gy had significantly higher median viral reactivation than controls (Figure 3A–D. Therefore, it is possible that some of the increased viral reactivation in gamma-irradiated samples was not actually due to radiation. However, no such effect was noted for the gamma-irradiated samples designated for irradiation at 0.5 Gy and 2.0 Gy. 2.2. Cell Viability Measured cell viability of EBV infected Akata cells was highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types (Figure 4A–D) for 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy). With FDR control to 1%, the p-value threshold for identifying significant differences from controls was 0.0014. Using this threshold, we found significantly lower viability of these cells on day 8 in seven cases (gamma rays at 0.1 Gy, protons at 0.1, 0.5 1.0, and 2.0 Gy, and iron ions at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy), and on day 4 in two cases (protons at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy). Carbon did not show any significant change in the cell viability at any of the doses tested and at any of the time points in the study. In addition, viability rebounded to exceed that of controls for three cases (gamma rays at 0.5 Gy and protons at 0.5 Gy and 1.0 Gy) on day 12. After day 12, viability declined to approach values seen on day 0, see Figure 4(A–D) for the dosage of 0.5 Gy. Plots for other doses were similar. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Change in cell viability compared to controls following gamma, proton, carbon, and iron radiation treatments at different dosages (A); 0.1, (B); 0.5, (C), 1.0 and (D), 2.0 Gy with 95% confidence limits indicated. 2.3. Cell Size Measurements of cell size were highly variable, making it difficult to discern any effect of radiation for specific dosages and days. For gamma-irradiated samples, cell size was reduced relative to controls for all but the highest dosage, while for the other types of radiation cell sizes were about the same as controls (Figure 5A–D); however, after controlling the FDR to 1%, we were able to identify only one case of a significant increase within radiation types—for iron radiation at the highest dosage on day 16. Accordingly, we noted a significant difference (p < 0.0002) between the radiation types on day 16 at the highest dosage. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Change in cell size compared to controls following gamma, proton, carbon, and iron radiation treatments at different dosages (A); 0.1, (B); 0.5, (C), 1.0 and (D), 2.0 Gy with 95% confidence limits indicated. 2.4. Supplementary Materials Tables of estimates, with standard errors and P values, for all comparisons with controls for viral reactivation, cell viability, and cell size are included in the Supplementary Materials. Simulation of Irradiated Volume The experimental data show that viral reactivation is dependent on the type of radiation used. At the scale of the Akata cells, the track structures of the radiation used for this study differ greatly from one type to another. It might be useful to use the radiation track structure to understand the differences between radiation types in viral reactivation. The simulation of an irradiated volume of 10 µm × 10 µm × 5 µm by gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, and iron ions by RITRACKS is shown in Figure 6. This volume is roughly the size of one Akata cell. The dose to the volume is approximately 0.5 Gy in all cases. This dose was chosen to better illustrate the difference between irradiation by gamma rays and ions. In Figure 6 on the top left, electron tracks corresponding to Compton and photoelectron effects are observed, and on the top right 575 proton tracks are shown. The LET of the proton used for the simulation was 0.3 keV/μm. Therefore, this is often considered sparsely ionizing radiation (as opposed to high-LET radiations). However, the energy distribution and spatial configuration of the tracks are quite different for the same dose of gamma rays and protons. Tracks from higher LET ions are also shown. On the bottom left, 34 tracks from 600 MeV/n carbon ions are shown. On the bottom right, only two tracks for 600-MeV/n iron ions are sufficient to yield a dose of 0.5 Gy. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Simulation of the irradiation of a volume by 137Cs photons, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions. In all cases, the dosage to the irradiated volume is ~0.5 Gy.",
    "discussion": "3. Discussion We studied the effect of four different types of radiation (137Cs gamma rays, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions) on induction of lytic gene transcription and reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line, their cell size and viability at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The doses are physical doses. RBE of 1.1 for protons is referred to other biological endpoints, such as chromosome aberrations or survival, but not for the endpoint of virus activation. The changes in viral load are presented without any corrections. However, by looking at the graphs of the viral reactivation data, a correction by a factor of 1.1 on either the dosage or change in viral load would clearly be insufficient to explain the difference between the protons and gammas. The greatest differences were found on day 4 for all four types of radiation at all doses studied. This effect then decreased over the subsequent time points (days 8, 12, 16, and 20) except for 2 Gy dose where viral load levels were approximately maintained up to day 8. Gamma radiation generally produced the highest rates of viral reactivation when compared to controls followed by protons, carbon ions, and iron ions at all the doses and at all the time points. When the initiation of viral transcription was examined, a prerequisite for EBV DNA replication and reactivation, some interesting trends emerged. Gamma irradiation induced transcription of both the immediate early and late genes, peaking at day 4. In contrast, the high energy particles, while also inducing transcription initially at day 4, in many instances resulted in a second peak of transcription at later times (day 14 and 18). While the mechanism of this second round of transcription is not clear, it could be speculated that it is the result of secondary effects of the initial radiation exposure on the cell, which is translated to the viral genome again at a later time point. However, there is good correspondence between the initial increase in EBV lytic gene transcription at day 4 with increases in EBV genome load. It should be noted though, that initiation of immediate early (IE) gene transcription of the herpesviruses (in this case BZLF1 of EBV) does not necessarily represent progression to reactivation. There are many examples of initiation of IE gene activation that are abortive and do not proceed to productive reactivation. It is for this reason that we also examined a late gene (BLLF1) as well as analyzed changes in amounts of EBV genomes in order to determine whether initial transcriptional activation of an IE gene, followed by a late gene resulted in an increase in EBV genomes, likely reflecting productive reactivation. Considering this, we present strong evidence that all forms of radiation examined both resulted in initiation of E and L gene transcription and in increase in viral genomes at four days post-treatment. Therefore, we feel confident that this reflects productive reactivation at this time point. In contrast, the transcriptional events that we detected at later time points (day 12) did not coincide with a statistically significant increase in viral genomes. Therefore it is unclear whether this transcription reflected abortive reactivation, or if productive reactivation occurred, this happening in only a small number of cells that we were not able to detect. Further studies will be required to determine the mechanism and biological consequences of this second late peak in transcription. Gamma rays and protons are usually considered much alike in radiobiology in terms of cell survival and chromosome aberrations; however, we observed that viral reactivation was induced differently. At this point it is not possible to formally identify the cause of the differences in viral reactivation resulting from proton and gamma irradiation because many factors may be involved, like damage to DNA and/or other biomolecules such as proteins and enzymes, which may be dependent on the type of radiation. The radiation track structure simulations clearly illustrate that for the same dose of gamma rays and protons, the electron tracks are quite different resulting in a different pattern of energy deposition. It would be interesting to try to link simulation results, such as DNA damage induction, with viral reactivation data in future work to investigate how the radiation track structure affects the viral reactivation. Because we were an exploratory study, it was necessary to use the conservative approach of controlling the false discovery rate to 1% in reporting significant effects. For this reason, differences that appear beyond chance variation when taken in isolation were not reported as being significant here. On the other hand, we feel confident that those effects we did flag as significant have an excellent chance of being reproducible. When travelling to Mars, it is estimated that every cell nucleus in an astronaut’s body would be hit by a proton or secondary electron (e.g., electrons of the target atoms ionized by the HZE ion) every few days and by an HZE ion about once a month [3]. Therefore, space radiation is expected to be a very important stressor for astronauts, which may have direct effects on the reactivation of latent viruses that are likely exacerbated by the state of decreased immunity. During spaceflight the immune system is altered, e.g., decreased cellular immunity has been observed in Space Shuttle astronauts after only a few days in orbit [14]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown dysregulation of T-cell function and cytokine production profiles during long-duration spaceflight aboard the International Space Station [15,16]. In this in vitro experiment the immune system was not present thereby providing strong evidence that radiation of latently infected cells alone is likely a major contributor to the reactivation of herpes viruses observed in astronauts. Space radiation is composed of a large number of different types of ions with various energies. There is also the possibility of nontargeted effects in an irradiated tissue. Because the role of ionizing radiation on virus reactivation is not well understood, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of radiation-induced virus reactivation and the effects of dose, dose-rate, ion types, and energies. Another interesting result of our studies is that radiation-induced viral reactivation occurs within days whereas radiation carcinogenesis usually takes months or years to develop. Understanding the molecular events involved in viral reactivation will provide important new insights to radiation-induced human diseases associated with EBV. Our study has also shown that virus reactivation may be an adverse consequence of radiation exposure not necessarily related to spaceflight radiation, but also to other sources such as radiotherapy treatment. The radiation exposure could lead to reactivation of viruses other than EBV, such as VZV resulting in shingles. For example, a recent study has shown that, compared with incidence rates of shingles reported in a general U.S. population, the age- and sex-standardized rates of shingles were 4.8 times higher (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0–5.6) in patients with hematologic malignancies and 1.9 times higher (95% CI, 1.7–2.1) in those with solid tumors (23). It is not clear, however, whether radiotherapy directly reactivates virus in latently infected cells or simply suppresses the immune system to allow viral reactivation to proceed. Thus, a better understanding of radiation-induced reactivation of EBV and other herpes viruses should provide important knowledge for spaceflight as well as terrestrial medicine. In conclusion, four types of radiation (137Cs gamma rays, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions) induced EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This was observed in the absence of any cytokine production or involvement of the immune system. Our finding that gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation challenges the RBE value of 1.1, which is used for protons, and also shows that RBE may be smaller than 1 for carbon ions and iron ions.",

Copyright notice ID: 6213004 PMID: 30274169 Abstract Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 137Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points. Keywords: space radiation, Epstein‒Barr virus, virus reactivation1. Introduction 1.1. Stressors in a Space Environment In the space environment, astronauts are exposed to multiple stressors such as isolation, confinement, variable gravitational forces, increased radiation, psychosocial stressors, sleep deprivation, noise, physical exertion, deconditioning, and anxiety [1]. Among these stressors, the radiation environment in low-Earth orbit is composed of a complex mixture of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), particles of trapped belts, and secondary particles generated in both the spacecraft and Earth’s atmosphere [2]. Ions of all atomic numbers from hydrogen to uranium are present in GCR, the great majority being protons. Their energies cover a large spectrum extending from a few MeV/n to nearly 1015 MeV/n, peaking at ~1 GeV/n. On Earth, heavy ions are shielded by the Earth’s magnetosphere and atmosphere. In space, many highly charged (Z) and energy (HZE) particles, such as iron ions, are difficult to shield with existing methods. Furthermore, they may collide with nuclei of the atoms they encounter, fragmenting either the target and/or the projectile thereby producing several secondary particles. Therefore, space radiation is a concern for long-duration space missions, such as the three-year Mars mission that would lead to a whole-body dose of about 1 Sievert or more [3]. 1.2. Reactivation of Latent Viruses Immune system dysregulation, defined by altered leukocyte distribution, reduced T and NK cell function, and altered plasma cytokine levels, has been reported in astronauts during short- and long-duration spaceflight [4,5]. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses results as a consequence of decreased immunity in astronauts [6,7,8,9]. A central question is whether the detection of increased levels of viruses in humans during spaceflight is due to immunosuppression associated with travel in space or a direct effect of space environmental factors, such as radiation inducing reactivation of the virus from latency. For example, the primary infection by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) results in varicella (chickenpox), after which the virus becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. When cellular immunity to VZV wanes with age and/or immunosuppression, VZV can reactivate to cause herpes zoster (shingles). The consequences of latent viral reactivation are important as shingles may be complicated by post-herpetic neuralgia, zoster paresis, cranial nerve palsies, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, vasculopathy, or ocular disorders [10]. Similarly, reactivation of Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) may lead to lymphoproliferative disease and may play a role in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, peripheral B and T cell lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [11]. We have studied the effects of four types of radiation, 137Cs gamma, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions on the reactivation of EBV in an EBV-producer line (Akata) in vitro. This cell line was established from a Japanese patient with Burkitt’s lymphoma [12]. There are several reasons for the choice of radiation types. The 137Cs gamma ray is a common source of photons, which are often used in experiments as a reference for low linear energy transfer (LET). Protons are an obvious choice as they are the most important component of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectra. The 150-MeV protons have a low LET and are considered to have a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 for several biological end points [13]. The RBE value of 1.1 for protons is based mostly on cell colony formation data, generally at higher, therapy-type dosages. Although it does not necessarily apply to other biological end points, it is an indication that protons and photons have similar biological effects at the same dose. The carbon ions are present in GCR and are also considered for hadron therapy. The iron ions are a relatively rare occurrence in the GCR, but they have high LET and high RBE for several biological end points [13]. Therefore, by using these ions, which cover a large part of the GCR spectra, the biological effects of representative particle types in space can be determined. In this study, we found that a significant increase in EBV reactivation relative to controls is observed for all radiation types used. However, when equal doses (physical doses not corrected for the RBE) are compared with control, each radiation source induced viral reactivation differently. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation. These findings challenge the common RBE concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points [13]. This difference in viral reactivation may be explained by the differences in the radiation track structure. 2. Results We sought to identify any increase in transcription of EBV lytic genes following treatment of Akata cells (that contain a latent EBV episome) with gamma irradiation (as described in the Materials and Methods sections). For these analyses we examined the RNA levels of two key EBV lytic genes, BZLF and BLLF. BZLF1 is an immediate early (IE) gene that codes for ZEBRA or Zta, an important trans-activator that is critical for reactivation. BLLF1 is a late (L) gene that codes for the envelope glycoprotein gp350; this protein complexes with gp220 to bind to the B-cell’s CD21. The results of the qRT-PCR indicate that gamma radiation induces transcription of both BZLF1 and BLLF peaking at day 4. post-gamma-radiation treatment (Figure 1). The irradiation dose of 0.1 Gy did not significantly increase the transcription of BZLF1; however, with 2.0 Gy of gamma radiation, there was a noticeable increase in both gene transcripts. The peak of BZLF1 transcription was at day 4 post-infection, but the increase was not statistically significant due to large standard deviation. At day 8, both 1.0 Gy and 2.0 Gy of gamma radiation resulted in significantly higher levels of BZLF1 (Figure 1A). 0.1 Gy of radiation caused a significant increase in BLLF1 from day 0 to day 16, while 0.5 Gy of radiation caused a significant increase at day 8 (Figure 1B). While gamma radiation increased the transcription in both gene classes, the amount of BLLF1 transcription was on average 3-fold less than BZLF1. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Effects of gamma radiation on Akata cells. Cells were radiated with 0.1 Gy (orange), 0.5 Gy (grey), 1 Gy (yellow) or 2 Gy (dark blue), then incubated for 16 days. The control flask (light blue) was not irradiated. (A) Fold change of IE gene BZLF1 transcripts normalized to endogenous control GAPDH over time relative to the control. (B) Fold change of L gene BLLF1 transcripts normalized to endogenous control GAPDH over time relative to the control. Statistical significance as compared to no radiation control and (two-tailed t test, * p < 0.05).We next sought to examine the effects of proton and high-energy particle radiations on their ability to induce EBV transcription (as described in detail in the Materials and Methods sections). Flasks of Akata cells were irradiated with high energy proton, carbon, and iron high energy particles. As shown in Figure 2, all three of these radiations induced transcription of BZLF1 and BLLF1. Interestingly, the high-energy proton induced the greatest gene expression of BZLF1 at the 0.1 Gy value at day 4 (Figure 2A), whereas carbon radiation induced the greatest BZLF1 transcription at 0.5 Gy, but this occurred much later, at 16 days post-radiation treatment (Figure 2B). Similar to the case for carbon, iron radiation increased BZLF1 expression at day 12 at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 Gy (Figure 2C). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Fold change in EBV BZLF1 and BLLF1 transcripts over time at various amounts of the three types of radiation, relative to the un-irradiated control. The x axis shows the time point, measured in days, -post-radiation treatment. The y axis shows the fold change in BZLF1 and BLLF1 transcripts.

Statistical significance as compared to no radiation control (two-tailed t test, * p < 0.05). (A) Proton; (B) carbon, (C) Iron.Further analyses reveal that the values for transcription activation for protons at 0.1 Gy is significantly different than 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy at day 4 (Figure 2A). Additionally, at day 4, the value for protons at 0.1 Gy is significantly different than 1.0 Gy and 2.0 Gy. This suggests that a lower dose of radiation is responsible for inducing a greater amount of BZLF1 transcription. For BLLF1 following proton treatment at 1.0 Gy, transcription is significantly different than 0.1 Gy and 0.5 Gy at day 4 for normalized BLLF1, although the actual transcript value is much less than the values for proton irradiation. This suggests that a larger dose of radiation may be required to induce significant transcription of late genes. Carbon ions appears to induce transcription of BZLF1 at days 8 and 12 post-treatment with 1.0 Gy (Figure 2B). For BLLF1, the carbon radiation induced significant transcription at 0.1 Gy at days 8 and 20, with all radiation doses inducing greater transcript values at day 12. Iron ions induced a noticeable peak in transcript values around day 12 for BZLF1, yet none are statistically significant at the p = 0.05 level. When iron irradiation effect on BLLF1 transcription was examined (Figure 2C), there was a wider range of transcript values, with transcription being induced as early as day 4 and continuing to day 12 at some dosages. These data indicate that all forms of radiation tested induced EBV transcription as early as four days post-treatment; however, the effects differ from gamma irradiation in the magnitude of transcript induction as well as the duration of gene activation. Like gamma radiation, high-energy particle radiation induces EBV transcription as early as day 4 post-treatment but suggest that the type of radiation impacts the peak expression of EBV transcription, with protons peaking around day 4 and carbon and iron peaking around day 12. Overall, all of the carbon and iron ions had higher relative levels of gene expression for both the intermediate early and late genes than did either gamma or proton radiation treatments. 2.1. Viral Load Given the increases in viral transcription, we next sought to determine if these radiation treatments induced increases in EBV genomes in the Akata cells, as evidence of productive DNA replication and viral reactivation. Plots over time of the estimated difference from control in median log viral load for all types of radiation are shown in Figure 3A–D for each of the four doses. Error bars in these plots indicate 95% confidence limits as obtained through quantile regression. From these plots, it can be seen that after irradiation, median viral loads were noticeably higher than controls at all post-irradiation time points (days 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20) for all types of radiation. More specifically, after controlling the false-discovery rate to 1%, we found significant increases in median log viral load relative to control in 67 of the possible 96 comparisons (6 time points versus 4 doses × 4 radiation types). The greatest differences were found on day 4 for all four types of radiation at all doses studied. This effect then decreased over the subsequent time points (days 8, 12, 16, and 20), except for the 2 Gy dose, where viral load levels were approximately maintained up to day 8. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Change in viral loads (EBV DNA) compared to control following gamma, proton, carbon, and iron radiation at different dosages, (A); 0.1, (B); 0.5, (C), 1.0 and (D), 2.0 Gy treatments with 95% confidence limits indicated.For the first eight days post-irradiation, gamma radiation produced the highest rates of viral reactivation; however, on day 0 samples from the flasks designated for subsequent gamma radiation at dosages of 0.1 and 1.0 Gy had significantly higher median viral reactivation than controls (Figure 3A–D. Therefore, it is possible that some of the increased viral reactivation in gamma-irradiated samples was not actually due to radiation. However, no such effect was noted for the gamma-irradiated samples designated for irradiation at 0.5 Gy and 2.0 Gy.2.2. Cell Viability Measured cell viability of EBV infected Akata cells was highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types (Figure 4A–D) for 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy). With FDR control to 1%, the p-value threshold for identifying significant differences from controls was 0.0014. Using this threshold, we found significantly lower viability of these cells on day 8 in seven cases (gamma rays at 0.1 Gy, protons at 0.1, 0.5 1.0, and 2.0 Gy, and iron ions at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy), and on day 4 in two cases (protons at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy). Carbon did not show any significant change in the cell viability at any of the doses tested and at any of the time points in the study. In addition, viability rebounded to exceed that of controls for three cases (gamma rays at 0.5 Gy and protons at 0.5 Gy and 1.0 Gy) on day 12. After day 12, viability declined to approach values seen on day 0, see Figure 4(A–D) for the dosage of 0.5 Gy. Plots for other doses were similar. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Change in cell viability compared to controls following gamma, proton, carbon, and iron radiation treatments at different dosages (A); 0.1, (B); 0.5, (C), 1.0 and (D), 2.0 Gy with 95% confidence limits indicated.2.3. Cell Size Measurements of cell size were highly variable, making it difficult to discern any effect of radiation for specific dosages and days. For gamma-irradiated samples, cell size was reduced relative to controls for all but the highest dosage, while for the other types of radiation cell sizes were about the same as controls (Figure 5A–D); however, after controlling the FDR to 1%, we were able to identify only one case of a significant increase within radiation types—for iron radiation at the highest dosage on day 16. Accordingly, we noted a significant difference (p < 0.0002) between the radiation types on day 16 at the highest dosage. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Change in cell size compared to controls following gamma, proton, carbon, and iron radiation treatments at different dosages (A); 0.1, (B); 0.5, (C), 1.0 and (D), 2.0 Gy with 95% confidence limits indicated.2.4. Supplementary Materials Tables of estimates, with standard errors and P values, for all comparisons with controls for viral reactivation, cell viability, and cell size are included in the Supplementary Materials. Simulation of Irradiated Volume The experimental data show that viral reactivation is dependent on the type of radiation used. At the scale of the Akata cells, the track structures of the radiation used for this study differ greatly from one type to another. It might be useful to use the radiation track structure to understand the differences between radiation types in viral reactivation. The simulation of an irradiated volume of 10 µm × 10 µm × 5 µm by gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, and iron ions by RITRACKS is shown in Figure 6. This volume is roughly the size of one Akata cell. The dose to the volume is approximately 0.5 Gy in all cases. This dose was chosen to better illustrate the difference between irradiation by gamma rays and ions. In Figure 6 on the top left, electron tracks corresponding to Compton and photoelectron effects are observed, and on the top right 575 proton tracks are shown. The LET of the proton used for the simulation was 0.3 keV/μm. Therefore, this is often considered sparsely ionizing radiation (as opposed to high-LET radiations). However, the energy distribution and spatial configuration of the tracks are quite different for the same dose of gamma rays and protons. Tracks from higher LET ions are also shown. On the bottom left, 34 tracks from 600 MeV/n carbon ions are shown. On the bottom right, only two tracks for 600-MeV/n iron ions are sufficient to yield a dose of 0.5 Gy. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Simulation of the irradiation of a volume by 137Cs photons, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions. In all cases, the dosage to the irradiated volume is ~0.5 Gy.3. Discussion We studied the effect of four different types of radiation (137Cs gamma rays, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions) on induction of lytic gene transcription and reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line, their cell size and viability at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The doses are physical doses. RBE of 1.1 for protons is referred to other biological endpoints, such as chromosome aberrations or survival, but not for the endpoint of virus activation. The changes in viral load are presented without any corrections. However, by looking at the graphs of the viral reactivation data, a correction by a factor of 1.1 on either the dosage or change in viral load would clearly be insufficient to explain the difference between the protons and gammas. The greatest differences were found on day 4 for all four types of radiation at all doses studied. This effect then decreased over the subsequent time points (days 8, 12, 16, and 20) except for 2 Gy dose where viral load levels were approximately maintained up to day 8. Gamma radiation generally produced the highest rates of viral reactivation when compared to controls followed by protons, carbon ions, and iron ions at all the doses and at all the time points. When the initiation of viral transcription was examined, a prerequisite for EBV DNA replication and reactivation, some interesting trends emerged. Gamma irradiation induced transcription of both the immediate early and late genes, peaking at day 4. In contrast, the high energy particles, while also inducing transcription initially at day 4, in many instances resulted in a second peak of transcription at later times (day 14 and 18). While the mechanism of this second round of transcription is not clear, it could be speculated that it is the result of secondary effects of the initial radiation exposure on the cell, which is translated to the viral genome again at a later time point. However, there is good correspondence between the initial increase in EBV lytic gene transcription at day 4 with increases in EBV genome load. It should be noted though, that initiation of immediate early (IE) gene transcription of the herpesviruses (in this case BZLF1 of EBV) does not necessarily represent progression to reactivation. There are many examples of initiation of IE gene activation that are abortive and do not proceed to productive reactivation. It is for this reason that we also examined a late gene (BLLF1) as well as analyzed changes in amounts of EBV genomes in order to determine whether initial transcriptional activation of an IE gene, followed by a late gene resulted in an increase in EBV genomes, likely reflecting productive reactivation. Considering this, we present strong evidence that all forms of radiation examined both resulted in initiation of E and L gene transcription and in increase in viral genomes at four days post-treatment. Therefore, we feel confident that this reflects productive reactivation at this time point. In contrast, the transcriptional events that we detected at later time points (day 12) did not coincide with a statistically significant increase in viral genomes. Therefore it is unclear whether this transcription reflected abortive reactivation, or if productive reactivation occurred, this happening in only a small number of cells that we were not able to detect. Further studies will be required to determine the mechanism and biological consequences of this second late peak in transcription. Gamma rays and protons are usually considered much alike in radiobiology in terms of cell survival and chromosome aberrations; however, we observed that viral reactivation was induced differently. At this point it is not possible to formally identify the cause of the differences in viral reactivation resulting from proton and gamma irradiation because many factors may be involved, like damage to DNA and/or other biomolecules such as proteins and enzymes, which may be dependent on the type of radiation. The radiation track structure simulations clearly illustrate that for the same dose of gamma rays and protons, the electron tracks are quite different resulting in a different pattern of energy deposition. It would be interesting to try to link simulation results, such as DNA damage induction, with viral reactivation data in future work to investigate how the radiation track structure affects the viral reactivation. Because we were an exploratory study, it was necessary to use the conservative approach of controlling the false discovery rate to 1% in reporting significant effects. For this reason, differences that appear beyond chance variation when taken in isolation were not reported as being significant here. On the other hand, we feel confident that those effects we did flag as significant have an excellent chance of being reproducible. When travelling to Mars, it is estimated that every cell nucleus in an astronaut’s body would be hit by a proton or secondary electron (e.g., electrons of the target atoms ionized by the HZE ion) every few days and by an HZE ion about once a month [3]. Therefore, space radiation is expected to be a very important stressor for astronauts, which may have direct effects on the reactivation of latent viruses that are likely exacerbated by the state of decreased immunity. During spaceflight the immune system is altered, e.g., decreased cellular immunity has been observed in Space Shuttle astronauts after only a few days in orbit [14]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown dysregulation of T-cell function and cytokine production profiles during long-duration spaceflight aboard the International Space Station [15,16]. In this in vitro experiment the immune system was not present thereby providing strong evidence that radiation of latently infected cells alone is likely a major contributor to the reactivation of herpes viruses observed in astronauts. Space radiation is composed of a large number of different types of ions with various energies. There is also the possibility of nontargeted effects in an irradiated tissue. Because the role of ionizing radiation on virus reactivation is not well understood, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of radiation-induced virus reactivation and the effects of dose, dose-rate, ion types, and energies. Another interesting result of our studies is that radiation-induced viral reactivation occurs within days whereas radiation carcinogenesis usually takes months or years to develop. Understanding the molecular events involved in viral reactivation will provide important new insights to radiation-induced human diseases associated with EBV. Our study has also shown that virus reactivation may be an adverse consequence of radiation exposure not necessarily related to spaceflight radiation, but also to other sources such as radiotherapy treatment. The radiation exposure could lead to reactivation of viruses other than EBV, such as VZV resulting in shingles. For example, a recent study has shown that, compared with incidence rates of shingles reported in a general U.S. population, the age- and sex-standardized rates of shingles were 4.8 times higher (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0–5.6) in patients with hematologic malignancies and 1.9 times higher (95% CI, 1.7–2.1) in those with solid tumors (23). It is not clear, however, whether radiotherapy directly reactivates virus in latently infected cells or simply suppresses the immune system to allow viral reactivation to proceed. Thus, a better understanding of radiation-induced reactivation of EBV and other herpes viruses should provide important knowledge for spaceflight as well as terrestrial medicine. In conclusion, four types of radiation (137Cs gamma rays, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions) induced EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This was observed in the absence of any cytokine production or involvement of the immune system. Our finding that gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation challenges the RBE value of 1.1, which is used for protons, and also shows that RBE may be smaller than 1 for carbon ions and iron ions.4. Materials and Methods The current study was approved and sponsored under Research Opportunities in Space Biology Solicitation: NNH12ZTT002N: Proposal Number: 12-12GB_Step2-0014. 4.1. Cell Cultures An Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) producer line, designated Akata (ATCC), was established from a Japanese patient with Burkitt’s lymphoma and used in this study [12]. Akata cells have a t(8q−; 14q+) chromosomal translocation—typical of Burkitt’s lymphoma cells. These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (Gibco®, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (ATCC® 30-2020™, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), 25 U/mL penicillin, 25 µg/mL Streptomycin, and 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco®, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [17]. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with 95% humidity and 5% carbon dioxide.4.2. Experimental Conditions For all experiments, 102 upright, 75-cm2 (T-75) tissue-culture flasks with vented caps (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) were initially seeded with 1 × 106 Akata cells/mL in 50 mL of fresh medium on day 0. Six flasks of these virus-infected cells were assigned to a control arm, while the remainder were split evenly (24 apiece) between four radiation exposure arms (137Cs gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, and iron ions). After seeding on day 0, the 24 flasks in each radiation type were divided into four irradiation groups of 6 flasks each. Depending on the group, cells were then exposed to an acute dose of either 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 Gy at room temperature. The dose rates in cGY/min for gamma rays, proton ions, carbon ions, and iron ions are shown in Table 1. The six flasks in the controls were not irradiated. Doses of radiation of 5 Gy or more were not studied because all cells were killed at these doses. For all four radiation types, cells were allowed to grow for up to 20 days after each exposure (day 0). Table 1. Dosage rate (cGy/min) for different radiation types. Type LET (keV/µm) 0.1 Gy 0.5 Gy 1.0 Gy 2.0 Gy Gamma Rays 0.30 148.76 148.76 148.76 148.76 Protons 150 MeV 0.54 9.71 44.64 49.76 55.71 Carbon Ions 600 MeV/n 9.18 18.87 29.24 27.55 27.55 Iron Ions 600 MeV/n 172.40 20.00 14.71 38.46 23.53 Open in a new tabCells were aseptically split and harvested from each flask by removing 25 mL of cells and media on day 0, and then on every fourth day for 20 days. In each of the experiments, the first harvest (day 0) was made before irradiation, while all other samples were harvested post-irradiation. The control samples were not irradiated. Except for day 20 (the last day), harvested cells and media were replaced with 25 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 Medium. After each harvest, live cells were split into five aliquots of 1 × 106 cells/mL and then frozen for later assessment of cell size, cell viability, detection of EBV lytic RNA transcripts, and EBV viral load. All measurements were conducted in quadruplicates. Proton, carbon, and iron irradiation experiments were performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at the Brookhaven National Laboratory’s facilities in New York. 137Cesium gamma irradiation was performed at both the NASA Johnson Space Center and the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The energy of protons was 150 MeV/n, of carbon ions was 600 MeV/n, and of iron ions was 600 MeV/n. 4.3. Cell Counts and Viability Cell count, concentration, diameter, and percentage viability of the fresh cells were measured before freezing (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom, Lawrence, MA, USA) in 1 million EBV-positive Akata cells in each condition. Cellometer Auto 2000 gives a clear distribution of live and dead cells when counted. Only live cell counts were accounted for when splitting the cells. 4.4. Analysis of EBV Lytic Gene Transcription Irradiated and control samples were harvested into RNALater™ (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C until extraction. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C, the RNALater™ removed, 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermo Fisher) was added to the pellets, and the pellets homogenized. Chloroform (0.2 mL) was added, the tubes vortexed vigorously, incubated for 3 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000× g at 4 °C. The aqueous layer containing the RNA was removed and the RNA was precipitated by adding 0.5 mL 100% isopropanol and 0.5 µL GlycoBlue™ (Thermo Fisher). RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets were washed three times with 1 mL of 75% ethanol, then vortexed and centrifuged at 7500× g for 5 min at 4 °C between each wash. The pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 45 µL of nuclease free water. The RNAs were prepared for reversed transcription using the TURBO DNA-free™ DNase Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, and the final concentration of RNA determined using a NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer. The RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Omniscript® Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 1 µg RNA and random decamer primers according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For quantification of the cDNAs, qPCR was performed using TaqMan™ Fast Universal Master Mix and the appropriate primers/probes (Applied Biosystems) in a StepOnePlus™ qPCR instrument. The sequences of the primers and probes used were: GAPDH Assay No. Hs02786624_g1 (Applied Biosystems), and Applied Biosystems custom designed BZLF1 forward primer: 5′AAATTTAAGAGATCCTCGTGTAAAACATC3′, reverse primer: 5′CGCCTCCTGTTGAAGCAGAT3′, probe: 5′ATAATGGAGTCAACATCCAGGCTTGGGC3′; BLLF1 forward primer: 5′AGAATCTGGGCTGGGACGTT3′, reverse primer: 5′ACATGGAGCCCGGACAAGT3′, and probe: 5′AGCCCACCACAGATTACGGCGGT3′. Assays, either radiation treatment and no radiation treatment (control), were performed on at least three biological replicates of each treatment and three technical replicates of each cDNA sample. The mean quantity for BLLF1 and BZLF1 qRT-PCR values was divided by the corresponding cellular control (GAPDH) qRT-PCR mean values for a given sample. For example, the mean value for the 0.1 Gy iron, day 0, BLLF1 qRT-PCRs was divided by the mean values for the 0.1 Gy iron, day 0, GAPDH qRT-PCRs to yield the relative quantity value (normalized to the cellular control). Once that normalization was complete, each sample was divided by its corresponding day-0 value to yield a fold change from the day-0 time point. For example, the 0.5 Gy carbon, day 8, BZLF1/GAPDH value was divided by the 0.5 Gy carbon, day 0, BZLF1/GAPDH value to yield a fold change in normalized mean quantity value between day 0 and day 8 for this sample. 4.5. Determination of EBV Load One million EBV-infected Akata cells were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min. DNA was extracted from both cells and supernatant using an ArchivePure DNA Tissue kit (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). EBV BALF5 DNA was quantified by Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) using a TaqMan™ 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). The EBV viral load assay used the primers and probe set as described [18] at a concentration of 150 nM and 200 nM, respectively. The results were normalized to the total DNA concentration obtained via a NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For determining viral load, qPCR was performed in 20 uL reaction mixture containing absolute fast qPCR master mix using the Fast Reaction plates on the TaqMan™ 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). A fluorogenic probe, 5′/6-FAM-TGTACACGCACGAGAAATGCGCC-TAMRA/3′, was synthesized from Integrated DNA Technologies. The primers, 5′CGGAAGCCCTCTCTGGACTTC-3′ and 5′CCCTGTTTATCCGATGGAATG-3′, from the BALF5 gene were also synthesized from IDT DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA). The optimized qPCR reaction mix contained 10% of DNA, 1× TaqMan™ Master Mix, 200 µM each primer, 150 µM probe, and 43.5% water. Amplification conditions consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Florescence from probe degradation was recorded during the 60 °C extension cycle and analyzed by SDS program (Sequence Detector Software; Applied Biosystems). The SDS determined cycle threshold (CT) is defined as the cycle number at which the florescence value intersects the threshold value, which was set 10-fold above the background fluorescence and was within the logarithmic phase of PCR amplification. A standard curve was obtained using a plasmid containing the BALF5 gene as a standard that was serially diluted, and used to calculate the viral copy number for each reaction well that was run. The standards included in the qPCR assay yielded an inverse relationship between CT values and the amount of template DNA.4.6. Normalizing Data from qPCR For each sample, viral copy numbers from four readings were averaged and then normalized by the DNA concentration determined by NanoDrop™ to produce the main outcome measure of viral load: copies of EBV DNA per nanogram of DNA. 4.7. Data Analysis Statistical analyses of EBV lytic gene transcription data for the Akata cells were performed using the RM two-Way ANOVA Matched Values and Tukey’s Multiple Comparisons Test on GraphPad Prism to determine the significance of these values as compared to other levels of each type of radiation. EBV viral load, viability, and cell size as a function of radiation type, dosage, and day of sample were assessed with quantile regression. Quantile regression was the analysis method of choice for these data because it can accommodate skewness and high variability in the data without assuming any particular statistical distribution. Dependent variables for the regressions were log viral load, logit viability, and cell size (untransformed). For each of these, a separate regression was run for each dose (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy), because dose‒response patterns were generally inconsistent over the various combinations of radiation category and time. Also, in the regression models, time points were treated as discrete conditions because there was an insufficient number or density of these time points immediately after irradiation of samples to formulate continuous time-trend models. This was an exploratory study and, as such, we were seeking to identify combinations of dosages, days, and radiation types that produced median responses sufficiently different from the corresponding control samples to be beyond chance variation. Taking into consideration the 96 possible comparisons (4 radiation types × 4 doses × 6 days) that could be made for each outcome, we used the method of Benjamini and Yekutieli [19] to control the false-discovery rate (FDR) for flagging combinations of interest so that the expected number of false discoveries would be one or less for each outcome variable (see results). Although theoretically there should not be any differences on day 0 (before irradiation) we included all the day-0 comparisons as a check for consistency of samples. 4.8. Simulations of Radiation Tracks To understand the differences in the reactivation of virus by radiation types, it is useful to look at the radiation track structure of the radiation types used in this study. For heavy ions, energy deposition is highly heterogeneous, with a localized contribution along the trajectory of every particle and lateral diffusion of energetic electrons (i.e., gamma rays, the target atom electrons ionized by the incident heavy ion and emitted at high energy) many microns from the path of the ions. These particles are therefore densely ionizing along the primary track (e.g., the track followed by the incident heavy ion, the so-called core). Moreover, they are surrounded by a region (penumbra) comprising the high-energy electrons ejected by ions [20]. The density of the core and penumbra depends mostly on the charge and velocity (energy per nucleon) of the ion. The situation is quite different for gamma rays that interact with the medium mostly by the Compton and photoelectric effects, which result in considerable deflection of the photon after an interaction and the creation of a large number of electron tracks in the medium. In this work, we have simulated the irradiation of a representative volume (10 µm × 10 µm × 5 µm) by gamma rays, protons, carbon and Iron ions using the code RITRACKS (Relativistic Ion Tracks). The code RITRACKS, developed over the last few years at the NASA Johnson Space Center [21], simulates the primary interactions of the radiation and calculates the energy of all electrons produced in the medium. The secondary electrons may lead to further ionizations in the medium, and secondary electron tracks are simulated as well. The detailed algorithms for these simulations have been described [22,23]. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to mimic the contributions of radiation from neighboring volumes to the volume of interest.Acknowledgments The support received from the NASA Space Radiation Program for this work is greatly appreciated.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight.Results Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria which decreased during flight. At the genus level, Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation between Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers.Conclusions This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.

    "introduction": "Introduction The World Health Organization published a surveillance strategy report in 2015 stating that worldwide, non-infectious disease (NIDs) represented 43% of global disease burden and was expected to be responsible for 60% of the disease burden and 73% of all deaths by 2020s [1]. In 2016, 80% of NID deaths were due to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, with the remaining 20% due to immune disorders, digestive issues, genitourinary disease, and oral or dental conditions [2]. The collection of bacteria and less dominant micro-organisms that inhabit our body is termed the human microbiome and plays an integral role in maintaining health. Changes in the composition of one’s microbiome may promote the development of the aforementioned NIDs, as individuals with inflammatory bowel disease [3, 4], asthma [5], diabetes [6], cardiovascular disease [7], colorectal cancer [8], and breast cancer [9] have different bacterial communities than healthy individuals. While it is still unclear whether these microbial differences are a consequence or a cause of disease, there is evidence in favor of the latter, as healthy animals transplanted with feces from those with obesity [10], colitis [11], or colorectal cancer [12] then go on to develop disease. The importance of the human microbiome in health promotion is just as relevant to astronauts and perhaps even more so, as medical procedures and facilities are limited during spaceflight. As of 2018, there have been 557 astronauts/cosmonauts that have flown to outer space with well-documented physiological and immunological issues, such as bone loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue, elevated cortisol levels, nausea, skin/urinary tract/upper-respiratory tract infections, and impaired innate/adaptive immunity [13–15]. However, data is still limited on how the human microbiome, which plays an integral role in human health, is impacted by spaceflight and whether changes in the astronaut microbiome contribute to the conditions experienced by many astronauts. Culture analyses conducted during the Skylab missions suggest that oral microbial populations may change during spaceflight, as increased counts of anaerobic bacteria from intra-oral sites were recorded in-flight compared to pre-flight samples from 18 astronauts studied [16]. The effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiome should be examined in detail as imbalances have been implicated in oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immune regulation, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [17–21], and thus could significantly impact the health of astronauts during long-term spaceflight (i.e., manned missions to Mars). Reactivation of latent herpesviruses has been documented in astronauts for years. Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been observed during both short (10–16 days) [22] and long (60–180 days) [23] duration ISS missions with longer missions producing higher viral titers and prolonged shedding upon return to Earth (shedding for 30 days post-flight [long duration mission] vs shedding for 5 days post flight [shorter duration]) [23]. The impact of EBV shedding, for example, on crew health could be limited to the minor symptoms of infection to an increased risk of lymphoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and mononucleosis [24, 25]. The role of the oral microbiome in viral reactivation during spaceflight has not yet been studied, but may be a key factor in this phenomenon. Its role may be indirect, through immune modulation or directly, through bacterial-viral interactions. Studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids produced by oral bacteria induce reactivation of latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and EBV, by activating viral promotors and/or causing epigenetic modifications in the inserted viral genome [26–29]. The aim of this study was to examine, for the first time, whether and how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and whether there is a microbiome signature that may be influential in preventing or promoting viral reactivation in humans. The data acquired from this study could help inform the NASA medical team about the role of bacterial signatures in maintaining crew health while in space.",
    "methods": "Methods Saliva sample collection and DNA extraction Saliva samples were collected from 10 male astronauts at various time points over the course of their mission. The duration of spaceflight ranged from 2–9 months with an average ISS mission being 4.4 months. Samples were collected (i) two times pre-flight, at 180 days (L-180) and 90 (L-90) days before launch, (ii) three times during flight, at early (1–2 months on ISS) and mid (2–4 months on ISS), and late (10 days before landing) time points and (iii) four times post-flight, on landing day (R + 0), 30 days (R + 30), 60 days (R + 60), and 180 days (R + 180) after return. These time points were adjusted (+/− 30 days) according to the convenience of crew members. The samples were collected by the astronauts themselves by placing a synthetic polymer swab (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA) in one’s mouth and swirling it around for 2–3 min until saturation. The samples were stored at − 80 °C until ready to process. Once all samples from a given subject was collected, they were thawed and then centrifuged at ×1400g for 5 min to separate the fluid from the swab. The separated fluid was stored at − 80 °C until DNA extraction and the swab discarded. DNA isolation The frozen fluid was allowed to thaw on ice and then vortexed and centrifuged at ×16,000g for 20 min to make a cell pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 200 μL PBS. DNA was extracted from this re-suspended pellet with a QIA-Amp DNA kit (Qiagen; Germantown, MD). DNA concentration was determined with the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc. Wilmington, DE). Detection and quantification of EBV, HSV-1, and VZV Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a TaqMan 7900 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) using fluorescence-based amplification. Two microliters of viral DNA was added to 2× TaqManTM Fast Universal PCR master mix (Thermofischer, USA), with primers added to a final concentration of 100 nmol and probes added to a final concentration of 50 nmol. Primer sequences and probes for the herpes viruses (EBV, VZV, and HSV-1) along with the glyceraldehyde 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) DNA sequences are listed in Table 1 and have been described previously [22]. Viral DNA standards generated from each herpes virus ranging from 100 to 106 copies/μl were included in all reactions. Reactions were performed in triplicate and were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s, and 60 °C for 20 s. A sample was considered negative for virus if it had lower than 10 copies of viral DNA. Table 1.

Library preparation and sequencing The V3/V4 region (~ 460 bp) of the isolated genomic DNA was paired-end sequenced (2 × 300 bp) on the Illumina Mi-Seq platform following the protocol outlined by Illumina (https://support.illumina.com/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/16s/16s-metagenomic-library-prep-guide-15044223-b.pdf). To summarize, amplicon PCR was performed by adding 2.5ul of 5 ng/ul of DNA to 5 ul of 1uM Forward primer, 5ul of 1uM reverse primer, and 12.5 ul of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. Forward primer sequences are 5′TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3′. Reverse primer sequences are 5′GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC 3′. The PCR condition were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 30s. A final elongation step was performed at 72 °C for 5 min. Following quality control and PCR clean up, index PCR was set up with the Nextera XT index kit and a limited-cycle amplification (8 cycles) to attach dual indices and adapters to the amplicons. The library was quantified using Qubit and normalized to 4 nM for all samples, after which all samples were pooled together. The pooled library was loaded onto the sequencer at 6pM with 10% phiX spiked in. The Miseq run utilized the v3 chemistry and 2 × 300 cycle sequencing kit (MS-102-3003). Samples were demultiplexed and adaptors removed using bcl2fastq from Illumina. 16S rRNA raw data processing and quality control The DADA2 pipeline [56] (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html) was used for quality control and processing (including chimera removal) of the raw demultiplexed reads resulting in an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table, a “higher resolution analogue of the traditional OTU table.” The filter and trim parameters were truncLen = c (280, 220), trimLeft = c (17, 21), maxN = c (0, 0), maxEE = c (2, 2), truncQ = c (2, 2), and rm.phix = c (TRUE, TRUE). Taxonomy was assigned with the SILVA reference database (version 128) (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html) using both the “nr” and “species assignment” databases. A custom script was used to filter the ASV table to keep only those samples that had greater than 100 reads and to keep only those ASV that were at least 0.01% abundant in a sample. The NTC sequencing control had 170 reads, with none of the ASV shared between the samples. The two kit controls had 6094 and 2969 reads. ASVs that were found exclusively in the kit control were removed from the table, along with 14 ASVs that were found in the kit controls and at least one sample. The average number of reads across all samples was 126,694 (ranging from 6216 to 312,133) totaling 697 ASVs. The positive control that was processed with DADA2 (92,514 reads) validated our pipeline as the sequence was only present in the positive control and had a 100% match with 100% coverage to the reference sequence. Bioinformatics analyses Alpha diversity metrics (Shannon’s diversity, Richness, Phylogenetic diversity) were calculated in QIIME [57]. Multiple rarefactions were performed on the ASV table, with the following arguments: − m 1000 (seq/sample), − x 100000 (seq/sample), and − s 5000 (steps between min/max of seq/sample), with the number of reps being two, − n 2. For alpha diversity of Streptococcus ASVs, the conditions were as followed: − m 1000, − x 50000, − s 4000, and − n 1. The data generated in QIIME was plotted and visualized in Prism (v.7). Significance between pre-flight, flight, and post-flight samples was measured using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, paired design, followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison post-hoc test in Prism. Linear regression analyses were also performed which produced the same results as the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significance was defined as P < 0.05. Phyla and genus level data used in various analyses were summarized from ASV data using QIIME. NMDS, heatmaps, and boxplots were generated in R (http://www.R-project.org/) using centered log ratio (clr) transformed data (transformed using the “compositions” package in R) with a uniform prior of 0.5 added to each value before transformation [58, 59]. The ALDEx2 package in R was used to compare the relative abundances of phyla and genera between the different flights. Significance was based on the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value of the Wilcoxon rank test (significance threshold P < 0.05). Spearman’s rho values and corresponding p values for correlation analyses between phyla (clr transformed data) from samples either positive or negative for virus (Fig. 5 data) were generated in R using the rcorr function. The p.adjust function was used to correct the p values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The heatmaps of rho values were generated using the heatmap.2 function in the “gplots” package. Kendall tau and corresponding p values for correlation analysis between (i) Shannon’s diversity and qPCR viral load and (ii) observed richness and qPCR viral load was performed with the cor.test function in R for each rarefaction, followed by a false discovery rate p value correction using the p.adjust function. Correlation analysis between the microbiome and viral load was performed using the ALDEx2 package as previously described [33]. Briefly, the Spearman’s rank correlation between the relative abundances of each genus (clr transformed) in 128 inferred technical replicates and the EBV and HSV-1 viral load as measured by qPCR was calculated using the aldex.corr function. Spearman’s rho values were converted to p values and corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using the cor.test function in R. The heatmap of Spearman’s rho values was generated using the heatmap.2 function in the “gplots” package. Random forests analysis was performed in R using the “randomForest,” “plyr,” “rfUtilities,” and “caret” packages on clr transformed data. LOOCV and OOB methods were employed using 500 decision trees, 1000 permutations, and 7 features to be randomly sampled at each node in the tree (i.e., mtry = 7).",
    "results": "Results Eighty-nine samples from ten astronauts were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing for microbiome analysis and qPCR for viral titer measurements. The timepoints for each sample collected the viral status, and flight history are presented in Dataset S1. Impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome Alpha diversity of the salivary microbiome was assessed with Shannon’s diversity (measure of richness and evenness), Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic difference between the observed sequences), and community richness (number. of observed amplicon sequence variants [ASVs]). All three metrics showed that microbiome diversity and richness increased during spaceflight (P < 0.05) but then dropped back to pre-flight levels upon return to Earth (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Alpha diversity of salivary microbiome. Saliva samples were collected from 10 astronauts at various time points before flying to the ISS (pre-flight), while on the ISS (Flight) and upon return to Earth (post-flight). Diversity was measured using Shannon’s diversity index (left panel) and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (right panel). Richness was measured by counting the number of unique amplicon sequence variants (ASV) within each sample (middle panel). Reads were rarified to different counts (x-axis) and the values for each rarefied read count plotted (y-axis). For all 3 metrics tested, alpha diversity was the highest in-flight, with post-flight samples decreasing to pre-flight values. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison post-hoc test (Significance threshold P < 0.05).Streptococcus is the most abundant organism in the saliva, and in this dataset consisted of 58 amplicon sequence variants, making up 8% of the total. For this reason, it was of interest to examine how alpha diversity of Streptococcus sequences changed as a result of spaceflight. Unlike the collective microbiome, Shannon’s diversity of Streptococcus was lower in spaceflight samples compared to pre-flight and post-flight samples (P < 0.05), and while diversity did rebound after flight, it did not reach pre-flight values (Figure S1A). On the other hand, while pre-flight and in-flight samples did not show significant differences in richness (though the number of observed Streptococcus sequences did decrease slightly in-flight), there was a significant decrease in the number of streptococcal sequences in samples collected post-flight (Figure S1B). Beta diversity of the salivary microbiome was also compared. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of the centered log ratio (clr) transformed data did not show any distinct clustering, indicating no overall microbiome differences between subjects and based on flight status (Fig. 2). Statistical analyses using ALDEx2 did, however, show that the relative abundances of three phyla changed over time, with Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria increasing in relative abundances during flight and Actinobacteria decreasing (Fig. 3a). While post-flight samples resembled pre-flight values more so than flight values, they were either higher (Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria) or lower (Actinobacteria) than what was observed pre-flight. At the genus level, in more than half of the subjects tested, Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus were absent in saliva collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight (Fig. 3b). In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight (Fig. 3b). The read counts of all genera detected and grouped by subject, and flight status is summarized as a heatmap in Figure S2. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Beta diversity of the salivary microbiome. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination of the salivary microbiome collected from ten astronauts collected pre-flight, in-flight (i.e., on the ISS), and post-flight. Each dot on the graph represents a sample, with the different colors representing a subject, and the different shapes representing a flight status. The closer the dots are to each other on the graph, the more similar the samples are in microbiome composition. The plots represent ASV sequences summarized, based on taxonomy, to the genus level and then clr transformed. No distinct clusters were observed, indicating no overall microbiome difference between subjects and based on flight status. The same analysis was performed at the ASV level and showed the same trends as at the genus level. The data used for analysis was clr transformed and Euclidean distances used.Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Differential abundance of bacteria based on flight status. a ALDEx2 statistically analysis was performed on sequences summarized to the phylum level. Significance was based on the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value of the Wilcoxon rank test (significance threshold P < 0.05). Out of the nine phyla detected in saliva, three showed statistically significant differences as a result of spaceflight. The changes in their relative abundances between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight are shown with boxplots. The box in each graph signifies the 75% (upper) and 25% (lower) quartiles and thus shows the percent abundances for 50% of the samples. The black line inside the box represents the median. The bottom whisker represents the lowest datum still within the 1.5 interquartile range (IQR) of the lower quartile, with the top whisker representing the highest datum still within the 1.5 IQR of the upper quartile. Open circles are outliers. b In half of the subjects tested, three genera, Catonella, Megasphaera, and Actinobacillus were not present in pre-flight samples, but were detected in samples collected during flight. In those that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased in-flight. The read counts for these three organisms in all ten subjects are shown in a heatmap. Gray indicates that no reads were detected while a gradient from green to red shows low counts and high counts, respectivelyWhile NMDS analysis of the salivary microbiome showed no differences based on flight status at the population level (Fig. 2), studies have shown that in some cases, population level analyses may mask microbiome differences that occur at the individual level [30]. For this reason, NMDS ordination was performed for each subject, in order to better understand the impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome. Five out of the 10 subjects clustered based on flight status with pre-flight, flight, and post-flight samples all different from each other (Fig. 4). It is important to note that different taxa were responsible for the differences based on flight status in these five individuals. For the other five subjects, while there was some overlap between samples collected from the different flight groups, pre-flight samples were never similar to post-flight samples. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of salivary microbiome based on flight status at the individual level. NMDS ordination, with Euclidean distances, was generated at the ASV level of centered log ratio (clr) data for each individual. Each dot on the graph represents a sample, with the different colors representing whether the sample was collected pre-flight (red), in-flight (blue), or post flight (green). The closer the dots are to each other on the graph, the more similar the samples are in microbiome composition. The subjects are labeled in the top left end corner of each box and an asterisk (*) beside the subject number indicates microbiome differences based on flight status. Differences are based on ellipses drawn around samples based on a 99% confidence interval. Samples that belong to the same flight status and in the same ellipse, and which do not overlap with other ellipses, are considered distinct groups, thereby having different microbiome profiles Association between viral reactivation and salivary microbiome The correlation between members of the salivary microbiome was examined for saliva samples that were either positive or negative for EBV or HSV-1 (as determined by qPCR). Associations between phyla changed depending on whether samples were negative or positive for virus. In saliva devoid of virus (no viral reactivation), positive correlations were present between (i) Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and (ii) Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria, with an inverse relation between (i) Gracilibacteria and Proteobacteria and (ii) Absconditabacteria and Proteobacteria (Fig. 5a). However, in saliva with viral reactivation, all bacterial correlations disappeared except for the inverse association between Gracilibacteria and Proteobacteria (Fig. 5b). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Microbiome correlations based on viral status. 16S rRNA sequences were summarized to the phylum level, and a Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed to assess correlations between the bacterial communities in the saliva. Two separate correlation tests were performed, one with samples that were negative for either EBV or HSV-1 (as detected by qPCR) (a) and the second, using samples that were positive for virus (based on qPCR) (b). The heatmaps display the Spearman’s rho values, with red boxes indicating rho values above 0.6 (strong positive correlation) and yellow values indicating rho values less than − 0.6 (strong inverse correlation). The maroon boxes represent no correlation. All red and yellow microbiome correlations had Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p values of < 0.05. As observed from these heatmaps, there are more bacterial correlations in saliva that are devoid of EBV and HSV-1 compared to saliva with viral sheddingTo determine which genera were most discriminatory between viral negative and viral positive samples, the machine-learning algorithm random forests (RF) was applied to genus level abundance data. The out-of-bag (OOB) error rate was 24%, and the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) showed our model to be 75% accurate. Taxa that proved most discriminatory between the two groups were ordered according to mean decrease in accuracy (Fig. 6). Gracilibacteria was the most predictive followed by Lactobacillus, Stomatobaculum, and Oribacetrium. RF was also applied to Streptococcus sequences due to their abundance in the samples. With an OOB error rate of 19% and a LOOCV accuracy of 81%, Streptococcus strains were discriminatory between the cohorts with S. mutans being the most predictive of viral status (Fig S3). Fig. 6.

OOB error rate was 24%, and LOOCV accuracy was 75%. Taxa are colored based on whether they were significantly higher in viral positive samples (red), viral negative samples (blue), or not (black) based on the Wilcoxon rank test with a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. Significance P < 0.05Correlations were examined between viral copy numbers (determined by qPCR) and the relative abundances of the microbiome (16S rRNA sequencing). Spearman’s rho correlation values between EBV or HSV-1 viral abundance and relative abundances of the salivary microbiome are shown in the heatmap in Fig. 7. For EBV, the strongest positive correlation was observed for the candidate phyla Gracilibacteria and Absconditabacteria and the genus Abiotrophia. The strongest inverse correlation was observed for Oribacterium, Clostridiales_FamilyXIII, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Haemophilus, Johnsonella, and Stomatobaculum. No significant correlations were, however, observed between HSV-1 viral abundance and microbiome relative abundances, as all Spearman’s rho correlations were under +/− 0.3 (“weak correlations”), and none of the correlations had p values less than 0.05. A summary of Spearman’s rho and p values for all genera for each virus is summarized in Dataset S2. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Correlation between salivary microbiome and viral load. 16S rRNA sequences were summarized to the genus level, and a Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed between qPCR viral copy number and relative abundances of bacteria. The heatmap presented shows the Spearman’s rho values, with red representing the highest positive values (positive correlation) and light yellow representing the lowest negative values (inverse correlation). Of those that did not resolve to the genus level, but only to the family or phylum level, this is identified on the heatmap as “f_” for family level resolution and “p_” for phylum level resolution. A summary of all rho values and their associated Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p values are listed in Dataset S2Correlations were next examined between viral abundance and microbiome diversity and richness. No significant correlations between qPCR viral load and Shannon’s diversity index was observed for EBV (p value 0.35, tau = − 0.03) nor HSV-1 (p value = 0.87, tau = − 0.092). However, when microbiome richness was examined, there was a significant positive correlation for EBV (p value = 0.005, tau = 0.25) but not for HSV-1 (p value = 0.34, tau = 0.09).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Viral reactivation The human microbiome has become a powerful tool to help predict and modulate health and disease. The oral microbiome specifically has been implicated in modulating oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immunity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [17–21]. However, there have been limited studies to date that have explored the possible interplay between the oral microbiome and latent viral reactivation and propagation [26–29]. One of the aims of this study was thus to determine whether there was a salivary microbiome signature that could help predict whether an astronaut would be more prone or better protected against EBV, HSV-1, or VZV reactivation. As none of the 89 saliva samples collected were positive for VZV, the analyses presented in this paper are based on EBV (30% of samples positive) and HSV-1 (22% of samples positive). A positive correlation was found between EBV copy number (qPCR viral data) and bacterial richness (an alpha diversity measure of 16S rRNA observed sequences) which suggests that as the number of bacterial strains increase within a sample, the viral load also increases. In relation to health and disease, high bacterial richness in the saliva has been associated with poor oral health (decayed teeth, periodontitis, and poor oral hygiene) [31, 32], and in the vagina, high bacterial diversity has been linked to bacterial vaginosis [33]. It is unknown how increased bacterial richness may promote EBV reactivation and/or replication, but one possibility is that certain strains, that may be beneficial in maintaining latency and/or curbing viral growth, become diluted in the sample (i.e., relative abundance decreases) and thus do not have as profound an impact on the host. Another hypothesis could be that the additional strains not present in virus negative samples produce metabolites that (i) induce reactivation, (ii) directly interact with the viral particle to increase propagation, and/or (iii) minimize the ability of the host to properly clear viral particles. To note, there is the possibility that weakening of the astronauts’ immune response during spaceflight facilitates EBV reactivation and the growth of bacterial strains that otherwise would be controlled by the immune response, remaining undetected. While there was a correlation between EBV and the microbiome, none existed for HSV-1. Even though EBV and HSV-1 are both members of the herpesvirus family (Herpesviridae), the microbiome-viral interactions may differ and thus varied responses will ensue. The Spearman’s correlation analysis showed an inverse correlation between EBV copy number and the relative abundances of the genera Oribacterium, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Haemophilus, Johnsonella, and Stomatobaculum, which, with the exception of Haemophilus, all belong to the Lachnospiraceae family. These genera could also accurately predict, as indicated by random forests, whether a saliva sample was positive or negative for viral titers. Since this study showed that a decrease in the relative abundances of these bacteria are associated with higher viral titers, it suggests a protective role of these bacteria in maintaining viral latency and/or inhibiting viral growth once the lytic cycle is switched on. Members of the genus Oribacterium are non-spore forming, gram positive, motile, and strict anaerobes that have been isolated from human subgingival plaque [34]. There are very few studies that make reference to it in terms of health and disease, but there is one record of Oribacterium being enriched in saliva samples from healthy control subjects compared to saliva from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma [35]. The major fermentation end product of two of the three species in this genus, which were both found in our dataset, O. parvum and O. sinus, is lactate [34, 36]. Lactate levels in the saliva could control viral titers once reactivation occurs, as physiological levels of lactic acid present in the vaginal tract have shown potency in HIV and Chlamydia inactivation [37, 38]. Lactate also significantly increases the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by Veillonella [39, 40]. H2S has been shown to be protective against pathogenic RNA viruses by decreasing the expression of viral proteins and mRNA during the early stages of replication, [41, 42] though no studies have been published regarding its protective capacity against DNA viruses. Veillonella, one of the major H2S producers in the oral cavity [43], had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher relative abundance in samples that came from subjects that never had a reactivation episode compared to samples that were negative for virus but came from subjects that had a reactivation episode at least once (Figure S4A). It was also the most predictive organism, as assessed by random forests, for these groups (Figure S4C). This raises the question as to whether Veillonella or specifically H2S, which is also produced by all three Lachnoanaerobaculum species [44], could play a role in maintaining viral latency. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potent inducer of latent viral proteins and shown to induce reactivation of EBV [45], Karposi’s sarcoma virus [46], and HIV [47]. In a study involving wild-type and H2S deficient strains of E.coli, H2O2 degradation in the cell was severely hampered in the mutant strains compared to the wild-type (H2S proficient) strains [48]. H2S has the ability to antagonize H2O2 effects on the host [49], scavenge reactive oxygen species [50], and induce the expression of catalases and peroxidases [50], all leading to lower amounts of H2O2 in the host. The ability of Haemophilus to utilize H2O2 could be one of the ways it may protect the host against reactivation. In addition to its aforementioned inverse correlation with viral load and its predictive potential in random forests, Haemophilus, like Veillonella, had a higher relative abundance in samples that came from subjects that never had a reactivation episode compared to samples that were negative for virus but that came from subjects that had a reactivation episode at least once (Figure S4B). In a study examining production and utilization of H2O2 by salivary bacteria, three species from the Streptococcus mitis group produced high levels of H2O2 when grown aerobically (2–9.8 mM) and anaerobically (1.1- 3.9 mM) which was rapidly cleared (within minutes) by Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. segnis (as well as Neisseria sicca and Staphylococcus epidermidis). When these pure cultures were incubated with as high as 295 mM of H2O2, it was completely catabolized within 15 min [51]. There are also bacteria that may play a role in promoting viral reactivation and/or propagation. Strong positive correlations were found between EBV viral load and Gracilibacteria and Abiotrophia relative abundances, with Gracilibacteria being the most predictive taxa for whether a sample was positive or negative for virus. Gracilibacteria (a.k.a. GN02) is a candidate phylum, meaning that no cultured representatives have been found but it is known to exist through 16S rRNA amplicon or shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses. It was first described in a study of the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat [52] and since then at least 13 clones have been detected from the human oral cavity [53]. In 2013, single cell genomics was performed on 2 clones from this candidate phylum and a re-coding of the opal stop codon UGA for glycine was discovered [54]. Abiotrophia, on the other hand, is more dominant in the oral cavity than Gracilibacteria, and one species, A. defectiva, is most known for its role in infective endocarditis [55]. There is no information available, as yet, on how these two taxa could promote viral reactivation and/or replication. While points have been made as to how the bacteria that were predictive or correlative could play a role in preventing or promoting viral reactivation/replication, there is also the possibility that differences observed between the groups were a byproduct of viral reactivation and replication changing the microbiome. A future study with a larger sample size of astronauts that (i) never had viral reactivation, (ii) were always positive for viral titers, and (iii) at some time point experienced latency and at other points experiencing shedding, which could help answer the above question. A larger dataset would also help determine whether a signature microbiome that protects against or promotes reactivation/replication is different depending on whether the astronaut is on Earth or in space. Based on the above data, the organisms that appear to play a role in viral reactivation or propagation and which in vitro studies may be useful, are Gracilibacteria, Abiotrophia, Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. Impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome This study examined how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight. Alpha diversity (richness, Shannon’s diversity, phylogenetic diversity) changed during flight but beta diversity (differences between samples based on what is there and their abundances) did not. While there were no population level differences as a result of spaceflight, 5 out of the 10 subjects did have distinct microbial communities pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. It is interesting to note that for the five subjects that had a significant difference in their microbiome, this was their first space mission, while the five subjects that did not have microbiome differences, had previously flown to the ISS. This may suggest that a person’s microbiome is able to adapt to spaceflight and is less recalcitrant to microbiome effects during spaceflight upon re-exposure. For those five subjects whose microbiome was not impacted by flight, it was evident that their post-flight samples were never similar to the pre-flight samples, even after 6 months, suggesting that the act of flying to the ISS causes either an irreversible change in the oral microbiome or a change that takes longer than 6 months to rebound. Further studies would need to be done to examine the consequence of these changes on the long-term health of the astronaut. Since each subject had different microbes influencing the microbial communities, a focus on a personalized astronaut microbiome to maintain health and prevent disease would be necessary.",

Copyright notice ID: 7171750 PMID: 32312311 Abstract Background Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight.Results Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria which decreased during flight. At the genus level, Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation between Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers.Conclusions This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.

In 2016, 80% of NID deaths were due to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, with the remaining 20% due to immune disorders, digestive issues, genitourinary disease, and oral or dental conditions [2]. The collection of bacteria and less dominant micro-organisms that inhabit our body is termed the human microbiome and plays an integral role in maintaining health. Changes in the composition of one’s microbiome may promote the development of the aforementioned NIDs, as individuals with inflammatory bowel disease [3, 4], asthma [5], diabetes [6], cardiovascular disease [7], colorectal cancer [8], and breast cancer [9] have different bacterial communities than healthy individuals. While it is still unclear whether these microbial differences are a consequence or a cause of disease, there is evidence in favor of the latter, as healthy animals transplanted with feces from those with obesity [10], colitis [11], or colorectal cancer [12] then go on to develop disease. The importance of the human microbiome in health promotion is just as relevant to astronauts and perhaps even more so, as medical procedures and facilities are limited during spaceflight. As of 2018, there have been 557 astronauts/cosmonauts that have flown to outer space with well-documented physiological and immunological issues, such as bone loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue, elevated cortisol levels, nausea, skin/urinary tract/upper-respiratory tract infections, and impaired innate/adaptive immunity [13–15]. However, data is still limited on how the human microbiome, which plays an integral role in human health, is impacted by spaceflight and whether changes in the astronaut microbiome contribute to the conditions experienced by many astronauts. Culture analyses conducted during the Skylab missions suggest that oral microbial populations may change during spaceflight, as increased counts of anaerobic bacteria from intra-oral sites were recorded in-flight compared to pre-flight samples from 18 astronauts studied [16]. The effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiome should be examined in detail as imbalances have been implicated in oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immune regulation, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [17–21], and thus could significantly impact the health of astronauts during long-term spaceflight (i.e., manned missions to Mars). Reactivation of latent herpesviruses has been documented in astronauts for years. Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been observed during both short (10–16 days) [22] and long (60–180 days) [23] duration ISS missions with longer missions producing higher viral titers and prolonged shedding upon return to Earth (shedding for 30 days post-flight [long duration mission] vs shedding for 5 days post flight [shorter duration]) [23]. The impact of EBV shedding, for example, on crew health could be limited to the minor symptoms of infection to an increased risk of lymphoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and mononucleosis [24, 25]. The role of the oral microbiome in viral reactivation during spaceflight has not yet been studied, but may be a key factor in this phenomenon. Its role may be indirect, through immune modulation or directly, through bacterial-viral interactions. Studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids produced by oral bacteria induce reactivation of latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and EBV, by activating viral promotors and/or causing epigenetic modifications in the inserted viral genome [26–29]. The aim of this study was to examine, for the first time, whether and how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and whether there is a microbiome signature that may be influential in preventing or promoting viral reactivation in humans. The data acquired from this study could help inform the NASA medical team about the role of bacterial signatures in maintaining crew health while in space.Results Eighty-nine samples from ten astronauts were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing for microbiome analysis and qPCR for viral titer measurements. The timepoints for each sample collected the viral status, and flight history are presented in Dataset S1. Impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome Alpha diversity of the salivary microbiome was assessed with Shannon’s diversity (measure of richness and evenness), Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic difference between the observed sequences), and community richness (number. of observed amplicon sequence variants [ASVs]). All three metrics showed that microbiome diversity and richness increased during spaceflight (P < 0.05) but then dropped back to pre-flight levels upon return to Earth (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Alpha diversity of salivary microbiome. Saliva samples were collected from 10 astronauts at various time points before flying to the ISS (pre-flight), while on the ISS (Flight) and upon return to Earth (post-flight). Diversity was measured using Shannon’s diversity index (left panel) and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (right panel). Richness was measured by counting the number of unique amplicon sequence variants (ASV) within each sample (middle panel). Reads were rarified to different counts (x-axis) and the values for each rarefied read count plotted (y-axis). For all 3 metrics tested, alpha diversity was the highest in-flight, with post-flight samples decreasing to pre-flight values. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison post-hoc test (Significance threshold P < 0.05).Streptococcus is the most abundant organism in the saliva, and in this dataset consisted of 58 amplicon sequence variants, making up 8% of the total. For this reason, it was of interest to examine how alpha diversity of Streptococcus sequences changed as a result of spaceflight. Unlike the collective microbiome, Shannon’s diversity of Streptococcus was lower in spaceflight samples compared to pre-flight and post-flight samples (P < 0.05), and while diversity did rebound after flight, it did not reach pre-flight values (Figure S1A). On the other hand, while pre-flight and in-flight samples did not show significant differences in richness (though the number of observed Streptococcus sequences did decrease slightly in-flight), there was a significant decrease in the number of streptococcal sequences in samples collected post-flight (Figure S1B). Beta diversity of the salivary microbiome was also compared. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of the centered log ratio (clr) transformed data did not show any distinct clustering, indicating no overall microbiome differences between subjects and based on flight status (Fig. 2). Statistical analyses using ALDEx2 did, however, show that the relative abundances of three phyla changed over time, with Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria increasing in relative abundances during flight and Actinobacteria decreasing (Fig. 3a). While post-flight samples resembled pre-flight values more so than flight values, they were either higher (Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria) or lower (Actinobacteria) than what was observed pre-flight. At the genus level, in more than half of the subjects tested, Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus were absent in saliva collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight (Fig. 3b). In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight (Fig. 3b). The read counts of all genera detected and grouped by subject, and flight status is summarized as a heatmap in Figure S2. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Beta diversity of the salivary microbiome. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination of the salivary microbiome collected from ten astronauts collected pre-flight, in-flight (i.e., on the ISS), and post-flight. Each dot on the graph represents a sample, with the different colors representing a subject, and the different shapes representing a flight status. The closer the dots are to each other on the graph, the more similar the samples are in microbiome composition. The plots represent ASV sequences summarized, based on taxonomy, to the genus level and then clr transformed. No distinct clusters were observed, indicating no overall microbiome difference between subjects and based on flight status. The same analysis was performed at the ASV level and showed the same trends as at the genus level. The data used for analysis was clr transformed and Euclidean distances used.Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Differential abundance of bacteria based on flight status. a ALDEx2 statistically analysis was performed on sequences summarized to the phylum level. Significance was based on the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value of the Wilcoxon rank test (significance threshold P < 0.05). Out of the nine phyla detected in saliva, three showed statistically significant differences as a result of spaceflight. The changes in their relative abundances between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight are shown with boxplots. The box in each graph signifies the 75% (upper) and 25% (lower) quartiles and thus shows the percent abundances for 50% of the samples. The black line inside the box represents the median. The bottom whisker represents the lowest datum still within the 1.5 interquartile range (IQR) of the lower quartile, with the top whisker representing the highest datum still within the 1.5 IQR of the upper quartile. Open circles are outliers. b In half of the subjects tested, three genera, Catonella, Megasphaera, and Actinobacillus were not present in pre-flight samples, but were detected in samples collected during flight. In those that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased in-flight. The read counts for these three organisms in all ten subjects are shown in a heatmap. Gray indicates that no reads were detected while a gradient from green to red shows low counts and high counts, respectivelyWhile NMDS analysis of the salivary microbiome showed no differences based on flight status at the population level (Fig. 2), studies have shown that in some cases, population level analyses may mask microbiome differences that occur at the individual level [30]. For this reason, NMDS ordination was performed for each subject, in order to better understand the impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome. Five out of the 10 subjects clustered based on flight status with pre-flight, flight, and post-flight samples all different from each other (Fig. 4). It is important to note that different taxa were responsible for the differences based on flight status in these five individuals. For the other five subjects, while there was some overlap between samples collected from the different flight groups, pre-flight samples were never similar to post-flight samples. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of salivary microbiome based on flight status at the individual level. NMDS ordination, with Euclidean distances, was generated at the ASV level of centered log ratio (clr) data for each individual. Each dot on the graph represents a sample, with the different colors representing whether the sample was collected pre-flight (red), in-flight (blue), or post flight (green). The closer the dots are to each other on the graph, the more similar the samples are in microbiome composition. The subjects are labeled in the top left end corner of each box and an asterisk (*) beside the subject number indicates microbiome differences based on flight status. Differences are based on ellipses drawn around samples based on a 99% confidence interval. Samples that belong to the same flight status and in the same ellipse, and which do not overlap with other ellipses, are considered distinct groups, thereby having different microbiome profilesAssociation between viral reactivation and salivary microbiome The correlation between members of the salivary microbiome was examined for saliva samples that were either positive or negative for EBV or HSV-1 (as determined by qPCR). Associations between phyla changed depending on whether samples were negative or positive for virus. In saliva devoid of virus (no viral reactivation), positive correlations were present between (i) Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and (ii) Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria, with an inverse relation between (i) Gracilibacteria and Proteobacteria and (ii) Absconditabacteria and Proteobacteria (Fig. 5a). However, in saliva with viral reactivation, all bacterial correlations disappeared except for the inverse association between Gracilibacteria and Proteobacteria (Fig. 5b). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Microbiome correlations based on viral status. 16S rRNA sequences were summarized to the phylum level, and a Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed to assess correlations between the bacterial communities in the saliva. Two separate correlation tests were performed, one with samples that were negative for either EBV or HSV-1 (as detected by qPCR) (a) and the second, using samples that were positive for virus (based on qPCR) (b). The heatmaps display the Spearman’s rho values, with red boxes indicating rho values above 0.6 (strong positive correlation) and yellow values indicating rho values less than − 0.6 (strong inverse correlation). The maroon boxes represent no correlation. All red and yellow microbiome correlations had Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p values of < 0.05. As observed from these heatmaps, there are more bacterial correlations in saliva that are devoid of EBV and HSV-1 compared to saliva with viral sheddingTo determine which genera were most discriminatory between viral negative and viral positive samples, the machine-learning algorithm random forests (RF) was applied to genus level abundance data. The out-of-bag (OOB) error rate was 24%, and the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) showed our model to be 75% accurate. Taxa that proved most discriminatory between the two groups were ordered according to mean decrease in accuracy (Fig. 6). Gracilibacteria was the most predictive followed by Lactobacillus, Stomatobaculum, and Oribacetrium. RF was also applied to Streptococcus sequences due to their abundance in the samples. With an OOB error rate of 19% and a LOOCV accuracy of 81%, Streptococcus strains were discriminatory between the cohorts with S. mutans being the most predictive of viral status (Fig S3). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Salivary microbiome can predict viral status. Results from the random forest classifier showing the bacterial genera that are the most discriminatory between viral positive (qPCR detection of EBV or HSC-1) and viral negative samples, in descending order. OOB error rate was 24%, and LOOCV accuracy was 75%. Taxa are colored based on whether they were significantly higher in viral positive samples (red), viral negative samples (blue), or not (black) based on the Wilcoxon rank test with a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. Significance P < 0.05Correlations were examined between viral copy numbers (determined by qPCR) and the relative abundances of the microbiome (16S rRNA sequencing). Spearman’s rho correlation values between EBV or HSV-1 viral abundance and relative abundances of the salivary microbiome are shown in the heatmap in Fig. 7. For EBV, the strongest positive correlation was observed for the candidate phyla Gracilibacteria and Absconditabacteria and the genus Abiotrophia. The strongest inverse correlation was observed for Oribacterium, Clostridiales_FamilyXIII, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Haemophilus, Johnsonella, and Stomatobaculum. No significant correlations were, however, observed between HSV-1 viral abundance and microbiome relative abundances, as all Spearman’s rho correlations were under +/− 0.3 (“weak correlations”), and none of the correlations had p values less than 0.05. A summary of Spearman’s rho and p values for all genera for each virus is summarized in Dataset S2. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Correlation between salivary microbiome and viral load. 16S rRNA sequences were summarized to the genus level, and a Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed between qPCR viral copy number and relative abundances of bacteria. The heatmap presented shows the Spearman’s rho values, with red representing the highest positive values (positive correlation) and light yellow representing the lowest negative values (inverse correlation). Of those that did not resolve to the genus level, but only to the family or phylum level, this is identified on the heatmap as “f_” for family level resolution and “p_” for phylum level resolution. A summary of all rho values and their associated Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p values are listed in Dataset S2Correlations were next examined between viral abundance and microbiome diversity and richness. No significant correlations between qPCR viral load and Shannon’s diversity index was observed for EBV (p value 0.35, tau = − 0.03) nor HSV-1 (p value = 0.87, tau = − 0.092). However, when microbiome richness was examined, there was a significant positive correlation for EBV (p value = 0.005, tau = 0.25) but not for HSV-1 (p value = 0.34, tau = 0.09).Discussion Viral reactivation The human microbiome has become a powerful tool to help predict and modulate health and disease. The oral microbiome specifically has been implicated in modulating oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immunity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [17–21]. However, there have been limited studies to date that have explored the possible interplay between the oral microbiome and latent viral reactivation and propagation [26–29]. One of the aims of this study was thus to determine whether there was a salivary microbiome signature that could help predict whether an astronaut would be more prone or better protected against EBV, HSV-1, or VZV reactivation. As none of the 89 saliva samples collected were positive for VZV, the analyses presented in this paper are based on EBV (30% of samples positive) and HSV-1 (22% of samples positive). A positive correlation was found between EBV copy number (qPCR viral data) and bacterial richness (an alpha diversity measure of 16S rRNA observed sequences) which suggests that as the number of bacterial strains increase within a sample, the viral load also increases. In relation to health and disease, high bacterial richness in the saliva has been associated with poor oral health (decayed teeth, periodontitis, and poor oral hygiene) [31, 32], and in the vagina, high bacterial diversity has been linked to bacterial vaginosis [33]. It is unknown how increased bacterial richness may promote EBV reactivation and/or replication, but one possibility is that certain strains, that may be beneficial in maintaining latency and/or curbing viral growth, become diluted in the sample (i.e., relative abundance decreases) and thus do not have as profound an impact on the host. Another hypothesis could be that the additional strains not present in virus negative samples produce metabolites that (i) induce reactivation, (ii) directly interact with the viral particle to increase propagation, and/or (iii) minimize the ability of the host to properly clear viral particles. To note, there is the possibility that weakening of the astronauts’ immune response during spaceflight facilitates EBV reactivation and the growth of bacterial strains that otherwise would be controlled by the immune response, remaining undetected. While there was a correlation between EBV and the microbiome, none existed for HSV-1. Even though EBV and HSV-1 are both members of the herpesvirus family (Herpesviridae), the microbiome-viral interactions may differ and thus varied responses will ensue. The Spearman’s correlation analysis showed an inverse correlation between EBV copy number and the relative abundances of the genera Oribacterium, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Haemophilus, Johnsonella, and Stomatobaculum, which, with the exception of Haemophilus, all belong to the Lachnospiraceae family. These genera could also accurately predict, as indicated by random forests, whether a saliva sample was positive or negative for viral titers. Since this study showed that a decrease in the relative abundances of these bacteria are associated with higher viral titers, it suggests a protective role of these bacteria in maintaining viral latency and/or inhibiting viral growth once the lytic cycle is switched on. Members of the genus Oribacterium are non-spore forming, gram positive, motile, and strict anaerobes that have been isolated from human subgingival plaque [34]. There are very few studies that make reference to it in terms of health and disease, but there is one record of Oribacterium being enriched in saliva samples from healthy control subjects compared to saliva from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma [35]. The major fermentation end product of two of the three species in this genus, which were both found in our dataset, O. parvum and O. sinus, is lactate [34, 36]. Lactate levels in the saliva could control viral titers once reactivation occurs, as physiological levels of lactic acid present in the vaginal tract have shown potency in HIV and Chlamydia inactivation [37, 38]. Lactate also significantly increases the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by Veillonella [39, 40]. H2S has been shown to be protective against pathogenic RNA viruses by decreasing the expression of viral proteins and mRNA during the early stages of replication, [41, 42] though no studies have been published regarding its protective capacity against DNA viruses. Veillonella, one of the major H2S producers in the oral cavity [43], had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher relative abundance in samples that came from subjects that never had a reactivation episode compared to samples that were negative for virus but came from subjects that had a reactivation episode at least once (Figure S4A). It was also the most predictive organism, as assessed by random forests, for these groups (Figure S4C). This raises the question as to whether Veillonella or specifically H2S, which is also produced by all three Lachnoanaerobaculum species [44], could play a role in maintaining viral latency. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potent inducer of latent viral proteins and shown to induce reactivation of EBV [45], Karposi’s sarcoma virus [46], and HIV [47]. In a study involving wild-type and H2S deficient strains of E.coli, H2O2 degradation in the cell was severely hampered in the mutant strains compared to the wild-type (H2S proficient) strains [48]. H2S has the ability to antagonize H2O2 effects on the host [49], scavenge reactive oxygen species [50], and induce the expression of catalases and peroxidases [50], all leading to lower amounts of H2O2 in the host. The ability of Haemophilus to utilize H2O2 could be one of the ways it may protect the host against reactivation. In addition to its aforementioned inverse correlation with viral load and its predictive potential in random forests, Haemophilus, like Veillonella, had a higher relative abundance in samples that came from subjects that never had a reactivation episode compared to samples that were negative for virus but that came from subjects that had a reactivation episode at least once (Figure S4B). In a study examining production and utilization of H2O2 by salivary bacteria, three species from the Streptococcus mitis group produced high levels of H2O2 when grown aerobically (2–9.8 mM) and anaerobically (1.1- 3.9 mM) which was rapidly cleared (within minutes) by Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. segnis (as well as Neisseria sicca and Staphylococcus epidermidis). When these pure cultures were incubated with as high as 295 mM of H2O2, it was completely catabolized within 15 min [51]. There are also bacteria that may play a role in promoting viral reactivation and/or propagation. Strong positive correlations were found between EBV viral load and Gracilibacteria and Abiotrophia relative abundances, with Gracilibacteria being the most predictive taxa for whether a sample was positive or negative for virus. Gracilibacteria (a.k.a. GN02) is a candidate phylum, meaning that no cultured representatives have been found but it is known to exist through 16S rRNA amplicon or shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses. It was first described in a study of the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat [52] and since then at least 13 clones have been detected from the human oral cavity [53]. In 2013, single cell genomics was performed on 2 clones from this candidate phylum and a re-coding of the opal stop codon UGA for glycine was discovered [54]. Abiotrophia, on the other hand, is more dominant in the oral cavity than Gracilibacteria, and one species, A. defectiva, is most known for its role in infective endocarditis [55]. There is no information available, as yet, on how these two taxa could promote viral reactivation and/or replication. While points have been made as to how the bacteria that were predictive or correlative could play a role in preventing or promoting viral reactivation/replication, there is also the possibility that differences observed between the groups were a byproduct of viral reactivation and replication changing the microbiome. A future study with a larger sample size of astronauts that (i) never had viral reactivation, (ii) were always positive for viral titers, and (iii) at some time point experienced latency and at other points experiencing shedding, which could help answer the above question. A larger dataset would also help determine whether a signature microbiome that protects against or promotes reactivation/replication is different depending on whether the astronaut is on Earth or in space. Based on the above data, the organisms that appear to play a role in viral reactivation or propagation and which in vitro studies may be useful, are Gracilibacteria, Abiotrophia, Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus.Impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome This study examined how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight. Alpha diversity (richness, Shannon’s diversity, phylogenetic diversity) changed during flight but beta diversity (differences between samples based on what is there and their abundances) did not. While there were no population level differences as a result of spaceflight, 5 out of the 10 subjects did have distinct microbial communities pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. It is interesting to note that for the five subjects that had a significant difference in their microbiome, this was their first space mission, while the five subjects that did not have microbiome differences, had previously flown to the ISS. This may suggest that a person’s microbiome is able to adapt to spaceflight and is less recalcitrant to microbiome effects during spaceflight upon re-exposure. For those five subjects whose microbiome was not impacted by flight, it was evident that their post-flight samples were never similar to the pre-flight samples, even after 6 months, suggesting that the act of flying to the ISS causes either an irreversible change in the oral microbiome or a change that takes longer than 6 months to rebound. Further studies would need to be done to examine the consequence of these changes on the long-term health of the astronaut. Since each subject had different microbes influencing the microbial communities, a focus on a personalized astronaut microbiome to maintain health and prevent disease would be necessary.Conclusions This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.Methods Saliva sample collection and DNA extraction Saliva samples were collected from 10 male astronauts at various time points over the course of their mission. The duration of spaceflight ranged from 2–9 months with an average ISS mission being 4.4 months. Samples were collected (i) two times pre-flight, at 180 days (L-180) and 90 (L-90) days before launch, (ii) three times during flight, at early (1–2 months on ISS) and mid (2–4 months on ISS), and late (10 days before landing) time points and (iii) four times post-flight, on landing day (R + 0), 30 days (R + 30), 60 days (R + 60), and 180 days (R + 180) after return. These time points were adjusted (+/− 30 days) according to the convenience of crew members. The samples were collected by the astronauts themselves by placing a synthetic polymer swab (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA) in one’s mouth and swirling it around for 2–3 min until saturation. The samples were stored at − 80 °C until ready to process. Once all samples from a given subject was collected, they were thawed and then centrifuged at ×1400g for 5 min to separate the fluid from the swab. The separated fluid was stored at − 80 °C until DNA extraction and the swab discarded.DNA isolation The frozen fluid was allowed to thaw on ice and then vortexed and centrifuged at ×16,000g for 20 min to make a cell pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 200 μL PBS. DNA was extracted from this re-suspended pellet with a QIA-Amp DNA kit (Qiagen; Germantown, MD). DNA concentration was determined with the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc. Wilmington, DE).Detection and quantification of EBV, HSV-1, and VZV Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a TaqMan 7900 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) using fluorescence-based amplification. Two microliters of viral DNA was added to 2× TaqManTM Fast Universal PCR master mix (Thermofischer, USA), with primers added to a final concentration of 100 nmol and probes added to a final concentration of 50 nmol. Primer sequences and probes for the herpes viruses (EBV, VZV, and HSV-1) along with the glyceraldehyde 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) DNA sequences are listed in Table 1 and have been described previously [22]. Viral DNA standards generated from each herpes virus ranging from 100 to 106 copies/μl were included in all reactions. Reactions were performed in triplicate and were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s, and 60 °C for 20 s. A sample was considered negative for virus if it had lower than 10 copies of viral DNA. Table 1.

To summarize, amplicon PCR was performed by adding 2.5ul of 5 ng/ul of DNA to 5 ul of 1uM Forward primer, 5ul of 1uM reverse primer, and 12.5 ul of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. Forward primer sequences are 5′TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3′. Reverse primer sequences are 5′GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC 3′. The PCR condition were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 30s. A final elongation step was performed at 72 °C for 5 min. Following quality control and PCR clean up, index PCR was set up with the Nextera XT index kit and a limited-cycle amplification (8 cycles) to attach dual indices and adapters to the amplicons. The library was quantified using Qubit and normalized to 4 nM for all samples, after which all samples were pooled together. The pooled library was loaded onto the sequencer at 6pM with 10% phiX spiked in. The Miseq run utilized the v3 chemistry and 2 × 300 cycle sequencing kit (MS-102-3003). Samples were demultiplexed and adaptors removed using bcl2fastq from Illumina.16S rRNA raw data processing and quality control The DADA2 pipeline [56] (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html) was used for quality control and processing (including chimera removal) of the raw demultiplexed reads resulting in an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table, a “higher resolution analogue of the traditional OTU table.” The filter and trim parameters were truncLen = c (280, 220), trimLeft = c (17, 21), maxN = c (0, 0), maxEE = c (2, 2), truncQ = c (2, 2), and rm.phix = c (TRUE, TRUE). Taxonomy was assigned with the SILVA reference database (version 128) (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html) using both the “nr” and “species assignment” databases. A custom script was used to filter the ASV table to keep only those samples that had greater than 100 reads and to keep only those ASV that were at least 0.01% abundant in a sample. The NTC sequencing control had 170 reads, with none of the ASV shared between the samples. The two kit controls had 6094 and 2969 reads. ASVs that were found exclusively in the kit control were removed from the table, along with 14 ASVs that were found in the kit controls and at least one sample. The average number of reads across all samples was 126,694 (ranging from 6216 to 312,133) totaling 697 ASVs. The positive control that was processed with DADA2 (92,514 reads) validated our pipeline as the sequence was only present in the positive control and had a 100% match with 100% coverage to the reference sequence.Bioinformatics analyses Alpha diversity metrics (Shannon’s diversity, Richness, Phylogenetic diversity) were calculated in QIIME [57]. Multiple rarefactions were performed on the ASV table, with the following arguments: − m 1000 (seq/sample), − x 100000 (seq/sample), and − s 5000 (steps between min/max of seq/sample), with the number of reps being two, − n 2. For alpha diversity of Streptococcus ASVs, the conditions were as followed: − m 1000, − x 50000, − s 4000, and − n 1. The data generated in QIIME was plotted and visualized in Prism (v.7). Significance between pre-flight, flight, and post-flight samples was measured using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, paired design, followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison post-hoc test in Prism. Linear regression analyses were also performed which produced the same results as the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significance was defined as P < 0.05. Phyla and genus level data used in various analyses were summarized from ASV data using QIIME. NMDS, heatmaps, and boxplots were generated in R (http://www.R-project.org/) using centered log ratio (clr) transformed data (transformed using the “compositions” package in R) with a uniform prior of 0.5 added to each value before transformation [58, 59]. The ALDEx2 package in R was used to compare the relative abundances of phyla and genera between the different flights. Significance was based on the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p value of the Wilcoxon rank test (significance threshold P < 0.05). Spearman’s rho values and corresponding p values for correlation analyses between phyla (clr transformed data) from samples either positive or negative for virus (Fig. 5 data) were generated in R using the rcorr function. The p.adjust function was used to correct the p values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The heatmaps of rho values were generated using the heatmap.2 function in the “gplots” package. Kendall tau and corresponding p values for correlation analysis between (i) Shannon’s diversity and qPCR viral load and (ii) observed richness and qPCR viral load was performed with the cor.test function in R for each rarefaction, followed by a false discovery rate p value correction using the p.adjust function. Correlation analysis between the microbiome and viral load was performed using the ALDEx2 package as previously described [33]. Briefly, the Spearman’s rank correlation between the relative abundances of each genus (clr transformed) in 128 inferred technical replicates and the EBV and HSV-1 viral load as measured by qPCR was calculated using the aldex.corr function. Spearman’s rho values were converted to p values and corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using the cor.test function in R. The heatmap of Spearman’s rho values was generated using the heatmap.2 function in the “gplots” package. Random forests analysis was performed in R using the “randomForest,” “plyr,” “rfUtilities,” and “caret” packages on clr transformed data. LOOCV and OOB methods were employed using 500 decision trees, 1000 permutations, and 7 features to be randomly sampled at each node in the tree (i.e., mtry = 7).Supplementary information 40168_2020_830_MOESM1_ESM.pdf (941.7KB, pdf) Additional file 1: Figure S1. Alpha diversity of Streptococcus sequences in the saliva. Saliva samples were collected from 10 astronauts at various timepoints before flying to the ISS (pre-flight), while on the ISS (flight) and upon return to Earth (post-flight). Streptococcal diversity was measured using Shannon’s diversity index (A) and richness was measured by counting the number of unique Staphylococcus amplicon sequence variants within each sample (B) Reads were rarified to different counts (x- axis) and the values for each rarefied read count plotted (y-axis). Shannon’s diversity was lowest during flight compared to pre-flight and post-flight samples. Richness, on the other hand, was lowest during post-flight, with pre-flight and in-flight having similar number of observed Streptococcus sequences. Figure S2. Heatmap of read counts of genera detected in the saliva. ASVs were summarized, based on taxonomy, to the genus level and all those that could be assigned to a genus were included in this heatmap. Multiple samples were collected from each astronaut but were averaged for a given flight status. The data was then clr transformed. Clr values that are positive are higher than the geometric mean (and thus can be considered more abundant) and those that are negative are lower than the geometric mean (and can be considered less abundant). The heatmap is separated by subject and by flight status (i.e. pre-flight, in-flight or post-flight samples). In the heatmap, red represents the highest clr value and light green the lowest.

Saliva samples were collected from 10 astronauts at various timepoints before flying to the ISS (pre-flight), while on the ISS (flight) and upon return to Earth (post-flight). Streptococcal diversity was measured using Shannon’s diversity index (A) and richness was measured by counting the number of unique Staphylococcus amplicon sequence variants within each sample (B) Reads were rarified to different counts (x- axis) and the values for each rarefied read count plotted (y-axis). Shannon’s diversity was lowest during flight compared to pre-flight and post-flight samples. Richness, on the other hand, was lowest during post-flight, with pre-flight and in-flight having similar number of observed Streptococcus sequences. Figure S2. Heatmap of read counts of genera detected in the saliva. ASVs were summarized, based on taxonomy, to the genus level and all those that could be assigned to a genus were included in this heatmap. Multiple samples were collected from each astronaut but were averaged for a given flight status. The data was then clr transformed. Clr values that are positive are higher than the geometric mean (and thus can be considered more abundant) and those that are negative are lower than the geometric mean (and can be considered less abundant). The heatmap is separated by subject and by flight status (i.e. pre-flight, in-flight or post-flight samples). In the heatmap, red represents the highest clr value and light green the lowest.

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+-ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+-ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip. Research organism: A. thaliana",
    "introduction": "Introduction Plants colonize soil by the growth of their roots. Because plant cells are non-motile, mechanically coupled by their cell walls and symplastically connected by plasmodesmata, the extent and direction of root growth is driven by the elongation of cells that can differ across the organ (Braidwood et al., 2014). The balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the root apex is controlled by several phytohormone and peptide signaling pathways, among which auxin plays a specific role, thanks to its long-distance intercellular transport that serves as the information carrier between distant plant tissues (Grieneisen et al., 2007; Wisniewska et al., 2006). The root apex is divided in several zones fulfilling various roles in root development. At the tip of the root, the root cap covers and protects the meristem, and is the center of gravity perception. In the meristem, stem cells produce transit-amplifying cells that populate the root tip (Dolan et al., 1993; Campilho et al., 2006). In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the root cap reaches up to the transition zone, where cells stop dividing and prepare for elongation; the transition zone is characterized by a distinct physiology and shows a high responsiveness to external factors (Verbelen et al., 2006). Further in the shootward direction, cells rapidly elongate in the elongation zone, propelling the root tip through the soil (Beemster and Baskin, 1998). After reaching their final length, cells differentiate in the maturation zone, where the root hairs emerge presumably to increase the absorptive root surface. To elongate, cells must expand their cell walls, increase turgor pressure or both (Lintilhac, 2014). Proton extrusion into the apoplast by the plasma membrane (PM) H+ ATPases is crucial for both cell wall expansion and turgor maintenance. Acidic pH leads to activation of cell wall remodeling enzymes, and the H+ gradient at the PM drives the transport of most nutrients and ions, and as such is required for turgor pressure generation (Falhof et al., 2016). It is therefore not surprising that root zones of numerous species show a distinct pattern of surface proton fluxes and cell wall pH (Siao et al., 2020). In general, the tip of the root and the late elongation and maturation zones show outward H+ fluxes, while the transition zone and early elongation zones show inward H+ fluxes (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997). Several studies showed that this battery-like system, with positive charges flowing out of the maturation zone and entering at the transition zone, is mainly driven by H+ fluxes without completely excluding calcium and chloride ions (Weisenseel et al., 1979; Björkman and Leopold, 1987; Behrens et al., 1982; Iwabuchi et al., 1989). Similar pattern of H+ fluxes was determined in A. thaliana, where the fluxes also correlated with root surface pH: an alkaline domain was observed at the border between meristematic and transition zones (Staal et al., 2011). Other works have attempted to determine the pH of the epidermal cell walls, and show a general decrease of pH toward the maturation zone of the root (Barbez et al., 2017; Moreau et al., 2022; Großeholz et al., 2022). It is important to keep in mind that changes in proton fluxes and membrane potential are not always correlated with change in pH. For example, a simultaneous leak of protons and uptake through H+/K+ symporter in the cytoplasm can lead to apoplast acidification with a relatively stable membrane potential (Stanković, 2006). In general, the relationship between H+ fluxes, cell wall pH, and the growth rate in the particular zones remains unclear: the highest pH is observed in the transition and early elongation zones, while the lowest pH and highest outward H+ fluxes are observed in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. In particular, the mechanism of the alkaline domain formation and its physiological significance remain unclear. The apoplastic pH is largely controlled by the activity of the proton pump H+ ATPases, encoded by 11 genes in the A. thaliana genome; in roots, the dominant paralogs are AHA1 and AHA2 (Haruta et al., 2010). While their activity is mainly regulated by phosphorylation (Falhof et al., 2016), the expression and membrane localization of AHAs along the longitudinal root axis seems to be important for the zonation of the A. thaliana root. Haruta et al., 2018, showed that under conditions of dim light, the AHA2-mCitrine was less abundant in the membranes of transition zone cells, and this partially correlated with higher surface pH of the transition zone cells. Under conditions of light, the AHA2-mCitrine localizes to the membranes in the transition zone. Pacifici et al., 2018, presented a model where cytokinin signaling regulates root meristem size by controlling the expression of AHA1 and AHA2. Increased cytokinin signaling led to shortening of the meristem, similarly to an inducible relocalization of AHA2 fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. Finally, Großeholz et al., 2022, quantified the AHA2-GFP signal and demonstrated an increasing AHA2-GFP membrane abundance toward the maturation zone of A. thaliana root, which correlated with increased acidification of the root surface. Still, the observed patterns of proton fluxes along the root zones (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997), and in particular the existence of the alkaline domain around the transition zone of the root, cannot be simply explained by the expression or abundance of AHA proton pumps. Roots use the gravity vector as the reference for the direction of their growth. A general pattern was shown in various plant species: during the gravitropic response, ion fluxes change rapidly, leading to increased proton secretion on the upper and decreased secretion on the lower side, where it correlates with growth inhibition, and results in bending of the root (Mulkey and Evans, 1981; Behrens et al., 1982; Iwabuchi et al., 1989; Collings et al., 1992; Weisenseel et al., 1992). In A. thaliana, the root surface and cell wall alkalinization of lower side upon gravistimulation has also been clearly demonstrated (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Barbez et al., 2017), and it was shown that this alkalinization requires functional auxin transport (Monshausen et al., 2011) and the CNGC14 calcium channel acting downstream of auxin signaling (Shih et al., 2015). Alkalinization of the lower root side is thus triggered by the redirection of auxin flux toward the lateral root cap and epidermal cells on the lower side of the root (Brunoud et al., 2012). Analogously, apoplast alkalinization can be triggered by the application of auxin to the roots (Evans et al., 1980; Lüthen and Böttger, 1988; Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Barbez et al., 2017). The root surface pH increases almost immediately upon auxin application, and this process requires the activity of the CNGC14 calcium channel; in the mutant, surface alkalinization as well as the auxin-induced growth inhibition are delayed (Shih et al., 2015). The rapid root growth inhibition as well as the membrane depolarization and surface alkalinization triggered by auxin depend on the rapid branch of the TIR1/AFB signaling branch; auxin influx by AUX1 and the AFB1 auxin co-receptor paralogue play a prominent role in the rapid auxin response (Fendrych et al., 2018; Dindas et al., 2018; Prigge et al., 2020; Serre et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Dubey et al., 2021). The molecular mechanism of surface alkalinization is, however, not understood. It was proposed that auxin plays a dual role in regulation of root apoplastic pH: auxin alkalinizes the apoplast by the activity of an unknown ion channel downstream of the TIR1/AFB signaling, and, at the same time, auxin upregulates the activity of AHA H+ ATPases through TMK1 signaling (Li et al., 2021). It is not clear how auxin activates the TMK kinases. On the other hand, the connection between TIR1/AFB auxin signaling and activity of AHAs has been clarified: the auxin-induced SAUR proteins inhibit the PP2C-D clade of protein phosphatases that act as negative regulators of AHAs, leading to the activation of proton secretion. This pathway was studied mainly in shoots, but seems also to operate in roots, as the Arabidopsis lines with manipulated SAUR or PP2C-D expression show root phenotypes that are consistent with the expected changes in AHA activities (Spartz et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2018). In summary, the connection between auxin signaling, regulation of the activity of AHA H+ ATPases, and the longitudinal zonation of the root surface pH profile during normal growth and during gravitropic responses remains unclear. Here, by employing an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, we focus on the molecular actors involved in the establishment of the longitudinal surface pH zonation. In particular, we show that the alkaline domain around the transition zone is not caused by the lack of AHA H+ ATPases activity. Further, we demonstrate that the alkaline domain at the transition zone is controlled by the components of the rapid auxin response pathway. Finally, we address the significance of the dynamic surface pH profile for the gravitropic response of the roots.",

    "results": "Results The Arabidopsis root shows distinct acidic and alkaline root surface pH domains To monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of root ion fluxes and apoplastic pH in vertically growing roots of A. thaliana, we re-evaluated the available fluorescence staining methods to visualize pH in roots. Cell wall staining by 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) (Barbez et al., 2017) was not satisfactory in our setup, due to the very high background signal and probably due to the absence of the optimal 458 nm excitation in our vertical stage spinning disk microscope (Serre et al., 2021). However, at the transition zone of the root, we could observe an alkaline domain on the root surface (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a). Further, we attempted to visualize root surface pH using Fluorescein Dextran and Oregon Green Dextran (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a) pH reporters (Monshausen et al., 2011; Geilfus and Mühling, 2011), but the results were not satisfactory due to an artifact when roots were imaged on solid medium (Figure 1—figure supplement 1d). We therefore searched for alternative pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes, and discovered Fluorescein-5-(and-6)-Sulfonic Acid, Trisodium Salt (FS) (Invitrogen F1130; Seksek et al., 1995; Rosario and Rojas, 1986) as an excellent reporter of root surface pH. The F488/405 excitation ratio of FS efficiently reported pH when dissolved in liquid or solid medium (Figure 1a–d, Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,c). The F488/405 excitation ratio of FS is insensitive to the redox state of the medium but influenced by cation concentration (Figure 1—figure supplement 1e). FS allows to visualize pH of the root surface and the surrounding rhizosphere, without penetrating the root tissues (Figure 1e). The pH imaging with FS highlighted the previously described relatively alkaline domain in the transition zone/early elongation zone of the root (Monshausen et al., 2011; Staal et al., 2011). In addition, we observed two relatively acidic pH domains, one located in the late elongation/root hair zone and the other in the proximity of the root tip (Figure 1e). To unbiasedly quantify the root surface pH, we developed a Python-based program to determine the F488/405 ratio of the root surface (Figure 1—figure supplement 1f). The quantification highlighted the presence of the observed relatively alkaline and acidic domains (Figure 1f). Throughout the text, we will refer to these domains as alkaline and acidic domains, by which we mean values relatively acidic or relatively alkaline in comparison with the pH of the medium. The surface pH profile of roots shown by FS is in agreement with the data obtained using numerous electrode and microscopy measurements in several species including A. thaliana (Zieschang et al., 1993; Staal et al., 2011; Monshausen et al., 1996; Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997). The FS pH detection range thus reveals both the alkaline and acidic domains of the root surface and allows direct and dynamic visualization of proton concentration on the root surface and its close surroundings.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig1-figsupp1-data1.xlsx (133.4KB, xlsx) Open in a new tab The alkaline domain in the transition zone is not directly determined by AHA activation or localization We first hypothesized that the observed spatial surface pH gradients might originate from gradients of AHA ATPase abundance or activity (Großeholz et al., 2022). We therefore immunolocalized endogenous AHAs using the antibody which recognizes multiple AHA ATPases paralogs in multiple plant species (Agrisera AS07260). To test the specificity of the antibody in Arabidopsis roots, we imaged Col-0 roots, aha2-4 mutants lacking the dominant AHA2 paralogue, and lines inducibly expressing a dominant version of AHA2 (AHA2-d95-mScarlet). The antibody showed signal in the PM in Col-0 and aha2-4 roots (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b). When we inducibly overexpressed the AHA2-d95-mScarlet, we detected colocalization of the mScarlet signal with the antibody signal (Figure 2—figure supplement 1c). These results indicate that the antibody recognized multiple plasma membrane localized AHAs in Arabidopsis roots. The immunolocalization of endogenous AHAs, however, didn’t reveal any obvious absence of AHAs in the transition zone (Figure 2a, Figure 2—figure supplement 1d) that would explain the presence of the alkaline domain. To overcome the hypothetical lack of AHA activation in the TZ, we treated seedlings with fusicoccin (FC), a fungal toxin that stimulates the AHA’s activity (Ballio et al., 1964) and thus increases proton efflux. FC lowered the surface pH of the root acidic domains but, surprisingly, did not affect the alkaline domain (Figure 2b and c). This partial acidification was correlated with the known FC-induced stimulation of root growth (Figure 2—figure supplement 2a). Figure 2.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig2-figsupp2-data1.xlsx (318.1KB, xlsx) Open in a new tabTo exclude an FC-independent regulation of AHAs in the TZ, we created A. thaliana lines inducibly expressing a fluorescently tagged hyperactive version of AHA2 (Pacheco-Villalobos et al., 2016) - AHA2-d95-mScarlet, and lines expressing an inhibitor of AHAs PP2CD1-mScarlet (Ren et al., 2018) under the control of the epidermal/cortex PIN2 promoter (Figure 2d). Expression of hyperactive AHA2 increased the acidic domain in the root tip, slightly reduced the alkaline domain, but did not prevent its formation (Figure 2e and f). This restricted acidification led to a tendency to stimulate root growth (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b). Inhibition of AHA activity by overexpression of PP2C-D1 raised the overall root tip surface pH, but did not prevent the formation of the alkaline domain in the TZ (Figure 2e and f). Alkalinization of the root tip surface correlated with a statistically insignificant reduction of root growth (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b). We further measured the root surface pH profile of aha2 and pp2c-d triple mutants that showed decreased (Haruta and Sussman, 2012) and increased (Ren et al., 2018) AHA activity, respectively. Plants lacking the expression of PP2CDs showed a significantly acidified root tip surface, however, the alkaline halo remained unaffected (Figure 2—figure supplement 2f and h). On the other hand, plants lacking the expression of AHA2 were slightly impaired in the alkaline halo domain formation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2f and h). aha2-4 roots were growing slower than Col-0 while pp2c-d triple root growth was stimulated (Figure 2—figure supplement 2g). The manipulation of the AHA proton pump activity resulted in the expected outcome of influencing the overall root surface pH and root growth. However, the spatial organization of the root surface pH profile with the alkaline domain of the TZ does not appear to be simply controlled by the activation or abundance of AHAs, as the alkaline domain cannot be fully removed by genetic or pharmacological modulation of the proton pumping activity. The establishment of the alkaline pH domain requires AUX1 It is well established that the application of auxin to roots causes an increase in apoplastic and root surface pH (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Li et al., 2021). To investigate the effect of auxin application on surface pH profile and formation of the TZ alkaline domain, we analyzed surface pH in response to the native auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). With the increasing IAA concentration, the alkaline domain pH rose and the domain expanded toward the elongation zone of the root, which resulted in disappearance of the acidic domain (Figure 3a and b). The extent of the surface alkalinization correlated with IAA-induced root growth inhibition; the response was detectable at 1 nM IAA and was saturated between 100 and 1000 nM IAA (Figure 3c). This implies that the entire root surface is capable of alkalinization upon external auxin treatment, and that the alkaline domain is the hotspot of auxin response. Figure 3. Auxin influx by AUX1 is essential for the initiation of the alkaline domain. (a–c) Surface pH correlates with growth rate-dose response of Col-0 roots to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) auxin.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig3-figsupp1-data1.xlsx (158.6KB, xlsx) Open in a new tabWe further analyzed the root surface pH response to IAA in line with altered AHA activity. The PIN2>>AHA2-d95 and PIN2>>PP2 CD1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2c and d) as well as the pp2c-d triple mutant responded to IAA treatment by alkalinization of the root surface pH (Figure 2—figure supplement 2h and i). The alkalinization factors (a measure of IAA-induced alkalinization) were similar to Col-0 with the exception of the very root tip of pp2c-d triple which responded slightly less (Figure 2—figure supplement 2e and j). These results were correlated with control level IAA-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b and g). On the other hand, knockout mutation of AHA2 led to reduced IAA-induced root surface alkalinization (Figure 2—figure supplement 2h, i and j), but strong enough to observe an auxin-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2g). The alkaline domain does not seem to be caused by the lack of proton efflux in the TZ, and the amplitude of the alkaline domain can be increased by auxin application. We therefore tested how auxin transport, perception, and response contribute to the spatial determination of root surface pH. First, we tested the mutant in the PIN2 auxin efflux carrier, in which the shootward auxin flux through the outer root tissues is perturbed (Luschnig et al., 1998; Müller et al., 1998). The pin2 mutant root showed a reduced alkaline domain that was shifted toward the root tip (Figure 3d and e). Upon application of 10 nM IAA to pin2 mutant, the alkaline domain position and amplitude were partially restored (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b), the pin2 roots also responded to auxin by growth inhibition (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c). Upon treatment with 100 nM IAA, the alkaline domain and the overall IAA-induced root alkalinization were fully restored (Figure 3d and f and Figure 3—figure supplement 1d and e). The auxin influx carrier AUX1 is essential for auxin uptake and transport during root gravitropism (Swarup et al., 2005; Band et al., 2014), and the null aux1 mutant was shown to have a more acidic surface with an altered root tip pH profile (Monshausen et al., 2011). We determined the root surface pH profile in the aux1 mutant, and found that its pH showed a gradual decrease from the tip toward the root hair zone. While the acidic zone in the elongation zone was comparable to control roots, aux1 mutants displayed a complete absence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 3d and e). Application of 10 nM IAA on aux1 mutants did not affect root elongation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c) and did not trigger a root surface alkalinization in contrast to the control Col-0 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b). However, at 100 nM IAA, when IAA diffusion compensates for AUX1 function (Evans et al., 1994), aux1 mutant showed a clear IAA-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 3—figure supplement 1e) as well as an increased root surface pH beyond the TZ (Figure 3d and f and Figure 3—figure supplement 1d). The wild-type (WT)-like root surface pH profile was, however, not restored by IAA application, demonstrating that AUX1 is essential for creating the alkaline surface domain in the transition zone. As the immunolocalization pattern of AHAs in the aux1 mutant was comparable to the Col-0 control (Figure 2—figure supplement 1d), we treated the mutant with FC to investigate the activation status of AHAs in the aux1 mutant. Interestingly, this treatment resulted in the establishment of a small alkaline domain also in the aux1 mutant (Figure 3—figure supplement 1f and h), likely caused by AHA-mediated acidification in the root tip and the distal elongation zone that did not affect the TZ surface pH. The partial acidification was again correlated with a significant root growth stimulation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1g). This experiment showed that AHAs are not fully activated in aux1 mutant and implies a specific surface pH response of the cells of the TZ. In summary, we have shown that the distinctive alkaline domain at the transition zone of the root depends on AUX1-mediated auxin influx. Without auxin influx, the root shows a linear acidification gradient from the root tip to the maturation zone. The components of the rapid auxin response pathway steer the transition zone root surface pH Once in the cytoplasm, auxin triggers responses either through the canonical auxin signaling pathway or the auxin rapid response pathway (Dubey et al., 2021). We examined the involvement of these pathways in the establishment of the surface pH profile of the root. First, we investigated the components of the canonical auxin signaling by using the tir1,afb2,3 (tir triple) mutant which lacks the expression of three of the six known auxin receptors (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). The tir triple mutant displayed a more acidic surface pH, particularly in the elongation and maturation zone (Figure 4a and b). However, it was still displaying an alkaline domain, albeit less pronounced than the control. In response to IAA, tir triple was critically impaired in whole root IAA-induced surface pH alkalinization (Figure 4—figure supplement 1b and c). As a result, tir triple was also impaired in the IAA-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a). These results confirm that the canonical auxin signaling is involved in the auxin-induced apoplastic alkalinization (Li et al., 2021) and also partially in the longitudinal surface pH zonation. Next, to test the role of the TMK1-ABP1 apoplastic auxin perception pathway (Li et al., 2021; Friml et al., 2022) in the establishment of root surface pH profile, we analyzed the root surface pH profiles of tmk1, tmk4, and abp1 mutants. The surface pH profile of the mutants was, however, comparable to the Col-0 controls (Figure 4—figure supplement 1d, e and f). Figure 4. Rapid auxin signaling steers root surface pH.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig4-figsupp2-data1.xlsx (278.9KB, xlsx) Open in a new tabWe further explored the role of the recently discovered molecular actors of the auxin rapid response - AFB1 and CNGC14. AFB1 is the paralogue of the TIR1 receptor; AFB1 has been shown to be crucial for the rapid growth inhibition upon auxin treatment, rapid auxin-induced membrane depolarization, and for the early response to gravistimulation (Prigge et al., 2020; Serre et al., 2021). Similarly, the mutant in the calcium channel CNGC14 lacks the auxin-induced calcium transient, membrane depolarization, and shows a delay in the early gravitropic response (Shih et al., 2015; Dindas et al., 2018). We analyzed the root surface pH of both mutants and found a more acidic root surface with a critically flat alkaline domain in the afb1 mutant (Figure 4c and d and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a) as well as in the cngc14 mutant (Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b). We confirmed the similar result in additional alleles of afb1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2c) and cngc14 mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 2d). This shows that these proteins, apart from controlling the rapid auxin response, steer the pH profile of the root during normal steady-state growth by controlling the alkaline domain in the transition zone. The lack of the alkaline domain was not caused by mislocalization or absence of AUX1 protein in the afb1 or cngc14 mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 2e). Similarly to the aux1 mutant, the localization of AHA H+ ATPases in both mutants was not obviously different from the Col-0 control (Figure 2—figure supplement 1d). We further tested how the afb1 and cngc14 mutants respond to IAA and found an overall alkalinization of the root surface with a partial rescue of the alkaline domain (Figure 4d and f) and partially impaired growth inhibition (Figure 4—figure supplement 2f–h). What makes the TZ zone surface pH different from the other domains of the roots? A plausible explanation is the localization of relevant molecular components in this region of the root. The auxin transporters AUX1 and PIN2 have been shown to localize to the lateral root cap and epidermis (Müller et al., 1998; Swarup et al., 2004, Figure 4g). Prigge et al., 2020, showed that AFB1 is expressed in the root tip and we could see an enrichment of the protein in the root epidermis (Figure 4g). To determine the localization of CNGC14, we expressed its fluorescently C-terminally tagged version under the control of its native promoter. The expression of CNGC14 fusion protein was rather weak, and localized to the PM of root epidermal cells, with an enrichment in the transition zone (Figure 4g and h). The expression of AFB1-mCitrine and CNGC14-GFP in the respective mutants recovered the presence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 4c, d, e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a, b and d). Interestingly, the expression of CNGC14-GFP in cngc14 caused an exaggerated TZ alkaline domain (Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b and d), which underlines the importance of the CNGC14 calcium channel in the establishment of root surface pH profile. These results show that the signaling components so far associated with the rapid auxin response are expressed in the root epidermis and contribute to the longitudinal zonation of root surface pH profile. The alkaline domain of the TZ represents a site of a constant rapid auxin response that is triggered by the internal auxin fluxes mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 transporters. On the other hand, the overall increase of root surface pH upon auxin treatment can be attributed to the TIR1 canonical signaling pathway. The AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module facilitates root navigation It was shown that auxin induces alkalinization of the apoplastic pH and that this alkalinization correlates and is required for the inhibition of root growth. The same process occurs during the gravitropic response - the lower root side responds to the internal auxin by alkalinization, resulting in root bending (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Barbez et al., 2017). We reanalyzed the root surface pH using our pH imaging and quantifications, as it enables us to monitor alkalinization, as well as acidification of the root surface. Upon gravistimulation, the TZ alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified (Figure 5a, Video 1). This led to a gradient of surface pH across the root that was established within 5 min of the gravistimulation which correlated with initiation of bending of the root (Figure 5a). The disappearance of the alkaline halo on the upper root surface indicates that the TZ domain might act as a zone of stalled growth which is rapidly activated upon gravistimulation. We further analyzed the gravitropic responses of the mutants with altered root surface pH zonation. As expected, the agravitropic aux1 mutant did not create a pH gradient across the root and did not bend (Figure 5b). Manipulation of the AHA activity by the application of FC or by genetic means did not prevent the formation of a gradient of surface pH and rapid bending of the root (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a and b). Finally, the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a slower gravitropic response, as reported before (Serre et al., 2021; Shih et al., 2015; Figure 5c and d). As both mutants have a diminished alkaline domain in the TZ, upon gravistimulation, this zone could not rapidly react to change in auxin fluxes; instead, a shallow gradient of surface pH slowly develops in the mutants (Figure 5c and d).

In the aux1, afb1, and cngc14 mutants, the alkaline domain was absent or less prominent during vertical growth (Video 3). This result and the fact that the components of the rapid auxin response pathway are involved in the formation of the alkaline domain indicates that, in this zone, the cells continuously rapidly respond to the internal auxin fluxes, and that this pathway is active not only upon gravistimulation. We hypothesized that the significance of this process is to constantly correct the growth rate fluctuations and to enable the root to quickly regulate the growth direction of the root tip. This would be particularly relevant in the soil environment, where the root tip penetrates the soil particles and constantly corrects growth direction using the gravity vector. To test this hypothesis, we tested the ability of WT and aux1, afb1, and cngc14 mutants to navigate through artificial obstacles, approximated by tilted agar plates covered with a rectangular nylon grid. We scored the efficiency of the roots in penetrating the grids with varying pore sizes (Figure 5f). WT plants penetrated the meshes more efficiently as the pore size increased, whereas the agravitropic aux1 mutant failed to penetrate in all conditions. Interestingly, both the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a significant decrease in penetration efficiency compared to the WT (Figure 5g). Video 2.

    "discussion": "Discussion In this work, we present a new method to determine the root surface pH of A. thaliana. Its advantage is the sensitivity of FS in lower pH range that enables a spectacular visualization of root surface pH, including the acidic domain surrounding the late elongation and maturation zones of roots, which was not detected with the previously published methods (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015). FS is an inexpensive dye which can be excited by the common 405 and 488 nm laser lines. In this work, we avoided measuring absolute pH values; instead, we determined the relative pH compared to internal controls observed on the same medium. Absolute pH determination would be possible, if extensive pH calibration was performed during each imaging session. This approach would be very laborious, and, in addition, absolute fluorescence intensities might depend on the thickness of the layer of medium and many other parameters. Therefore, we recommend using FS to determine relative pH changes compared to internal controls, that is WT plants or mock controls imaged together with mutants or treated roots. We showed that apart from pH, FS can also react to other ions, however, given that the surface pH profile visualized by FS staining is in full accordance with the previously published works (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997; Weisenseel et al., 1979; Björkman and Leopold, 1987; Behrens et al., 1982; Iwabuchi et al., 1989; Staal et al., 2011), we conclude that in the growth media, FS reflects primarily the root surface pH. According to the acid growth theory, acidic pH enables cell wall extension (Rayle and Cleland, 1992; Hager, 2003). We observed the lowest pH values in the very tip of the root and in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. On the other hand, the alkaline domain partially covers the early elongation zone. The surface pH therefore does not fully correlate with the local growth rates (Beemster and Baskin, 1998; Shih et al., 2015). In addition, it remains to be resolved to what extent the surface pH correlates with the pH of the cell walls and the apoplastic space of the root epidermal cells, as previous work has reported a correlation between cell length and cell wall pH (Barbez et al., 2017; Moreau et al., 2022). It is possible that rather than driving cell elongation, the acidic domain in the maturation zone plays a role in nutrient acquisition and absorption by the root hairs (Martín-Barranco et al., 2021). The cytokinin-mediated cell wall stiffening may become the dominant growth-regulating mechanism in this root zone, leading to growth cessation despite low extracellular pH (Liu et al., 2022). Based on genetic and pharmacological experiments we concluded that the longitudinal surface pH zonation is not based solely on the activity and abundance of PM AHA H+ ATPases, but instead, the alkaline domain in the transition zone is driven by AUX1-mediated auxin influx and AFB1 signaling. The surface pH might be determined solely by AHA activity in the specific case of the aux1 mutant, where the pH progressively decreases in the shootward direction, and might then reflect the AHA activity gradient that is determined by the abundance of the proton pumps and their regulation by brassinosteroid signaling, as suggested by Großeholz et al., 2022. Interestingly, even in the aux1 mutant, a residual AHA-independent alkaline domain is present and can be visualized when AHAs are hyperactivated by the application of FC. In agreement with these results, the ectopic AHA ATPases activation also cannot prevent the auxin-induced growth inhibition and the gravitropic bending of roots. Inhibition of AHA activity led to slower growth, a tendency of slower gravitropic response, and the aha2-4 mutation caused a reduced auxin-induced surface alkalinization. In addition to controlling membrane potential and apoplastic pH, AHA activity influences auxin signaling by regulating auxin influx and diffusion into cells (Rubery and Sheldrake, 1973; Yang et al., 2006). These results might thus be caused by the reduced proton motive force that in turn might interfere with IAA uptake into the cells. What is the cause of the alkaline domain at the transition zone, if not the inhibition of AHA ATPase activity? It was shown that the auxin-induced apoplast and root surface alkalinization is accompanied by a decrease in cytosolic pH (Monshausen et al., 2011; Li et al., 2021), indicating that the alkaline domain visualized by the FS is caused by a proton influx into cells. The phenotype of the aux1 mutant hints to the possibility that the AUX1-mediated auxin symport with protons (Lomax et al., 1985) might cause the observed root surface alkalinization. Also supporting this hypothesis, the transition zone of maize roots is the site of the highest auxin influx, as measured by an auxin-specific electrode (Mancuso et al., 2005). On the other hand, the aux1 mutant was capable of surface alkalinization when higher concentrations of IAA were added, demonstrating that the AUX1-mediated influx per se is not required for surface alkalinization. Further, the afb1 mutants show a defect in the alkaline domain formation, which favors the explanation that the auxin-induced alkalinization is triggered from the AFB1 receptor. Given that the mutant in CNGC14 is defective in establishing root surface pH profile, auxin-induced alkalinization and auxin-induced calcium influx (Shih et al., 2015), and calcium influx and pH changes are tightly coupled (Behera et al., 2018), we conclude that CNGC14 functions downstream of AFB1. Similarly, Li et al., 2021, suggested that auxin-induced alkalinization of the apoplast is mediated by a yet unknown mechanism. It is intriguing to speculate that the signaling pathway might operate via the adenylate cyclase activity of TIR1/AFB auxin receptors (Qi et al., 2022). We show that the rapid auxin response pathway, so far connected with the reaction to auxin application (Fendrych et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021; Monshausen et al., 2011) or the gravitropic response (Serre et al., 2021; Shih et al., 2015), operates constantly in the growing A. thaliana root. Even though the other TIR1/AFB co-receptors partially contribute to the longitudinal surface pH zonation, AFB1 plays the most important role. The other TIR1/AFB receptors seem to be more important for the overall pH rise upon the application of IAA, in agreement with the results of Li et al., 2021. The localization of the alkaline zone seems to be determined by the intersection of the PIN2-mediated shootward auxin flux (Luschnig et al., 1998; Müller et al., 1998), localization of the AUX1-mediated auxin influx (Swarup et al., 2005; Band et al., 2014), and the enrichment of the AFB1 and CNGC14 proteins. We propose that the dynamic nature of the surface alkalinization observed by us and others (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015) results from the interaction of the intensity of the auxin flux and the constant rapid response that occurs in the alkaline domain of the root tip. In addition, the auxin-induced alkalinization is constantly being counterbalanced by the TMK-mediated AHA ATPase activation and apoplast acidification (Li et al., 2021; Friml et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2021). Upon gravistimulation, the alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified, which is consistent with previous pH measurements done by electrodes (Zieschang et al., 1993; Monshausen et al., 1996), indicating that the alkaline domain corresponds to a zone of a stalled cell elongation that can be rapidly regulated upon gravistimulation. In addition to the gene expression changes that occur during obstacle avoidance (Jacobsen et al., 2021) and the FERONIA-mediated mechanoperception (Shih et al., 2014), the rapid auxin response module in the root decreases the reaction time of the root to the changes of root growth direction, and thus increases the efficiency of root soil penetration.",

See commentary \"Orchestrating pH levels in plants\", e91025. Abstract Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+-ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+-ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip. Research organism: A. thalianaIntroduction Plants colonize soil by the growth of their roots. Because plant cells are non-motile, mechanically coupled by their cell walls and symplastically connected by plasmodesmata, the extent and direction of root growth is driven by the elongation of cells that can differ across the organ (Braidwood et al., 2014). The balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the root apex is controlled by several phytohormone and peptide signaling pathways, among which auxin plays a specific role, thanks to its long-distance intercellular transport that serves as the information carrier between distant plant tissues (Grieneisen et al., 2007; Wisniewska et al., 2006). The root apex is divided in several zones fulfilling various roles in root development. At the tip of the root, the root cap covers and protects the meristem, and is the center of gravity perception. In the meristem, stem cells produce transit-amplifying cells that populate the root tip (Dolan et al., 1993; Campilho et al., 2006). In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the root cap reaches up to the transition zone, where cells stop dividing and prepare for elongation; the transition zone is characterized by a distinct physiology and shows a high responsiveness to external factors (Verbelen et al., 2006). Further in the shootward direction, cells rapidly elongate in the elongation zone, propelling the root tip through the soil (Beemster and Baskin, 1998). After reaching their final length, cells differentiate in the maturation zone, where the root hairs emerge presumably to increase the absorptive root surface. To elongate, cells must expand their cell walls, increase turgor pressure or both (Lintilhac, 2014). Proton extrusion into the apoplast by the plasma membrane (PM) H+ ATPases is crucial for both cell wall expansion and turgor maintenance. Acidic pH leads to activation of cell wall remodeling enzymes, and the H+ gradient at the PM drives the transport of most nutrients and ions, and as such is required for turgor pressure generation (Falhof et al., 2016). It is therefore not surprising that root zones of numerous species show a distinct pattern of surface proton fluxes and cell wall pH (Siao et al., 2020). In general, the tip of the root and the late elongation and maturation zones show outward H+ fluxes, while the transition zone and early elongation zones show inward H+ fluxes (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997). Several studies showed that this battery-like system, with positive charges flowing out of the maturation zone and entering at the transition zone, is mainly driven by H+ fluxes without completely excluding calcium and chloride ions (Weisenseel et al., 1979; Björkman and Leopold, 1987; Behrens et al., 1982; Iwabuchi et al., 1989). Similar pattern of H+ fluxes was determined in A. thaliana, where the fluxes also correlated with root surface pH: an alkaline domain was observed at the border between meristematic and transition zones (Staal et al., 2011). Other works have attempted to determine the pH of the epidermal cell walls, and show a general decrease of pH toward the maturation zone of the root (Barbez et al., 2017; Moreau et al., 2022; Großeholz et al., 2022). It is important to keep in mind that changes in proton fluxes and membrane potential are not always correlated with change in pH. For example, a simultaneous leak of protons and uptake through H+/K+ symporter in the cytoplasm can lead to apoplast acidification with a relatively stable membrane potential (Stanković, 2006). In general, the relationship between H+ fluxes, cell wall pH, and the growth rate in the particular zones remains unclear: the highest pH is observed in the transition and early elongation zones, while the lowest pH and highest outward H+ fluxes are observed in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. In particular, the mechanism of the alkaline domain formation and its physiological significance remain unclear. The apoplastic pH is largely controlled by the activity of the proton pump H+ ATPases, encoded by 11 genes in the A. thaliana genome; in roots, the dominant paralogs are AHA1 and AHA2 (Haruta et al., 2010). While their activity is mainly regulated by phosphorylation (Falhof et al., 2016), the expression and membrane localization of AHAs along the longitudinal root axis seems to be important for the zonation of the A. thaliana root. Haruta et al., 2018, showed that under conditions of dim light, the AHA2-mCitrine was less abundant in the membranes of transition zone cells, and this partially correlated with higher surface pH of the transition zone cells. Under conditions of light, the AHA2-mCitrine localizes to the membranes in the transition zone. Pacifici et al., 2018, presented a model where cytokinin signaling regulates root meristem size by controlling the expression of AHA1 and AHA2. Increased cytokinin signaling led to shortening of the meristem, similarly to an inducible relocalization of AHA2 fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. Finally, Großeholz et al., 2022, quantified the AHA2-GFP signal and demonstrated an increasing AHA2-GFP membrane abundance toward the maturation zone of A. thaliana root, which correlated with increased acidification of the root surface. Still, the observed patterns of proton fluxes along the root zones (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997), and in particular the existence of the alkaline domain around the transition zone of the root, cannot be simply explained by the expression or abundance of AHA proton pumps. Roots use the gravity vector as the reference for the direction of their growth. A general pattern was shown in various plant species: during the gravitropic response, ion fluxes change rapidly, leading to increased proton secretion on the upper and decreased secretion on the lower side, where it correlates with growth inhibition, and results in bending of the root (Mulkey and Evans, 1981; Behrens et al., 1982; Iwabuchi et al., 1989; Collings et al., 1992; Weisenseel et al., 1992). In A. thaliana, the root surface and cell wall alkalinization of lower side upon gravistimulation has also been clearly demonstrated (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Barbez et al., 2017), and it was shown that this alkalinization requires functional auxin transport (Monshausen et al., 2011) and the CNGC14 calcium channel acting downstream of auxin signaling (Shih et al., 2015). Alkalinization of the lower root side is thus triggered by the redirection of auxin flux toward the lateral root cap and epidermal cells on the lower side of the root (Brunoud et al., 2012). Analogously, apoplast alkalinization can be triggered by the application of auxin to the roots (Evans et al., 1980; Lüthen and Böttger, 1988; Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Barbez et al., 2017). The root surface pH increases almost immediately upon auxin application, and this process requires the activity of the CNGC14 calcium channel; in the mutant, surface alkalinization as well as the auxin-induced growth inhibition are delayed (Shih et al., 2015). The rapid root growth inhibition as well as the membrane depolarization and surface alkalinization triggered by auxin depend on the rapid branch of the TIR1/AFB signaling branch; auxin influx by AUX1 and the AFB1 auxin co-receptor paralogue play a prominent role in the rapid auxin response (Fendrych et al., 2018; Dindas et al., 2018; Prigge et al., 2020; Serre et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Dubey et al., 2021). The molecular mechanism of surface alkalinization is, however, not understood. It was proposed that auxin plays a dual role in regulation of root apoplastic pH: auxin alkalinizes the apoplast by the activity of an unknown ion channel downstream of the TIR1/AFB signaling, and, at the same time, auxin upregulates the activity of AHA H+ ATPases through TMK1 signaling (Li et al., 2021). It is not clear how auxin activates the TMK kinases. On the other hand, the connection between TIR1/AFB auxin signaling and activity of AHAs has been clarified: the auxin-induced SAUR proteins inhibit the PP2C-D clade of protein phosphatases that act as negative regulators of AHAs, leading to the activation of proton secretion. This pathway was studied mainly in shoots, but seems also to operate in roots, as the Arabidopsis lines with manipulated SAUR or PP2C-D expression show root phenotypes that are consistent with the expected changes in AHA activities (Spartz et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2018). In summary, the connection between auxin signaling, regulation of the activity of AHA H+ ATPases, and the longitudinal zonation of the root surface pH profile during normal growth and during gravitropic responses remains unclear. Here, by employing an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, we focus on the molecular actors involved in the establishment of the longitudinal surface pH zonation. In particular, we show that the alkaline domain around the transition zone is not caused by the lack of AHA H+ ATPases activity. Further, we demonstrate that the alkaline domain at the transition zone is controlled by the components of the rapid auxin response pathway. Finally, we address the significance of the dynamic surface pH profile for the gravitropic response of the roots.Results The Arabidopsis root shows distinct acidic and alkaline root surface pH domains To monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of root ion fluxes and apoplastic pH in vertically growing roots of A. thaliana, we re-evaluated the available fluorescence staining methods to visualize pH in roots. Cell wall staining by 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) (Barbez et al., 2017) was not satisfactory in our setup, due to the very high background signal and probably due to the absence of the optimal 458 nm excitation in our vertical stage spinning disk microscope (Serre et al., 2021). However, at the transition zone of the root, we could observe an alkaline domain on the root surface (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a). Further, we attempted to visualize root surface pH using Fluorescein Dextran and Oregon Green Dextran (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a) pH reporters (Monshausen et al., 2011; Geilfus and Mühling, 2011), but the results were not satisfactory due to an artifact when roots were imaged on solid medium (Figure 1—figure supplement 1d). We therefore searched for alternative pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes, and discovered Fluorescein-5-(and-6)-Sulfonic Acid, Trisodium Salt (FS) (Invitrogen F1130; Seksek et al., 1995; Rosario and Rojas, 1986) as an excellent reporter of root surface pH. The F488/405 excitation ratio of FS efficiently reported pH when dissolved in liquid or solid medium (Figure 1a–d, Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,c). The F488/405 excitation ratio of FS is insensitive to the redox state of the medium but influenced by cation concentration (Figure 1—figure supplement 1e). FS allows to visualize pH of the root surface and the surrounding rhizosphere, without penetrating the root tissues (Figure 1e). The pH imaging with FS highlighted the previously described relatively alkaline domain in the transition zone/early elongation zone of the root (Monshausen et al., 2011; Staal et al., 2011). In addition, we observed two relatively acidic pH domains, one located in the late elongation/root hair zone and the other in the proximity of the root tip (Figure 1e). To unbiasedly quantify the root surface pH, we developed a Python-based program to determine the F488/405 ratio of the root surface (Figure 1—figure supplement 1f). The quantification highlighted the presence of the observed relatively alkaline and acidic domains (Figure 1f). Throughout the text, we will refer to these domains as alkaline and acidic domains, by which we mean values relatively acidic or relatively alkaline in comparison with the pH of the medium. The surface pH profile of roots shown by FS is in agreement with the data obtained using numerous electrode and microscopy measurements in several species including A. thaliana (Zieschang et al., 1993; Staal et al., 2011; Monshausen et al., 1996; Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997). The FS pH detection range thus reveals both the alkaline and acidic domains of the root surface and allows direct and dynamic visualization of proton concentration on the root surface and its close surroundings.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig1-figsupp1-data1.xlsx (133.4KB, xlsx) Open in a new tabThe alkaline domain in the transition zone is not directly determined by AHA activation or localization We first hypothesized that the observed spatial surface pH gradients might originate from gradients of AHA ATPase abundance or activity (Großeholz et al., 2022). We therefore immunolocalized endogenous AHAs using the antibody which recognizes multiple AHA ATPases paralogs in multiple plant species (Agrisera AS07260). To test the specificity of the antibody in Arabidopsis roots, we imaged Col-0 roots, aha2-4 mutants lacking the dominant AHA2 paralogue, and lines inducibly expressing a dominant version of AHA2 (AHA2-d95-mScarlet). The antibody showed signal in the PM in Col-0 and aha2-4 roots (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b). When we inducibly overexpressed the AHA2-d95-mScarlet, we detected colocalization of the mScarlet signal with the antibody signal (Figure 2—figure supplement 1c). These results indicate that the antibody recognized multiple plasma membrane localized AHAs in Arabidopsis roots. The immunolocalization of endogenous AHAs, however, didn’t reveal any obvious absence of AHAs in the transition zone (Figure 2a, Figure 2—figure supplement 1d) that would explain the presence of the alkaline domain. To overcome the hypothetical lack of AHA activation in the TZ, we treated seedlings with fusicoccin (FC), a fungal toxin that stimulates the AHA’s activity (Ballio et al., 1964) and thus increases proton efflux. FC lowered the surface pH of the root acidic domains but, surprisingly, did not affect the alkaline domain (Figure 2b and c). This partial acidification was correlated with the known FC-induced stimulation of root growth (Figure 2—figure supplement 2a). Figure 2.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig2-figsupp2-data1.xlsx (318.1KB, xlsx) Open in a new tabTo exclude an FC-independent regulation of AHAs in the TZ, we created A. thaliana lines inducibly expressing a fluorescently tagged hyperactive version of AHA2 (Pacheco-Villalobos et al., 2016) - AHA2-d95-mScarlet, and lines expressing an inhibitor of AHAs PP2CD1-mScarlet (Ren et al., 2018) under the control of the epidermal/cortex PIN2 promoter (Figure 2d). Expression of hyperactive AHA2 increased the acidic domain in the root tip, slightly reduced the alkaline domain, but did not prevent its formation (Figure 2e and f). This restricted acidification led to a tendency to stimulate root growth (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b). Inhibition of AHA activity by overexpression of PP2C-D1 raised the overall root tip surface pH, but did not prevent the formation of the alkaline domain in the TZ (Figure 2e and f). Alkalinization of the root tip surface correlated with a statistically insignificant reduction of root growth (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b). We further measured the root surface pH profile of aha2 and pp2c-d triple mutants that showed decreased (Haruta and Sussman, 2012) and increased (Ren et al., 2018) AHA activity, respectively. Plants lacking the expression of PP2CDs showed a significantly acidified root tip surface, however, the alkaline halo remained unaffected (Figure 2—figure supplement 2f and h). On the other hand, plants lacking the expression of AHA2 were slightly impaired in the alkaline halo domain formation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2f and h). aha2-4 roots were growing slower than Col-0 while pp2c-d triple root growth was stimulated (Figure 2—figure supplement 2g). The manipulation of the AHA proton pump activity resulted in the expected outcome of influencing the overall root surface pH and root growth. However, the spatial organization of the root surface pH profile with the alkaline domain of the TZ does not appear to be simply controlled by the activation or abundance of AHAs, as the alkaline domain cannot be fully removed by genetic or pharmacological modulation of the proton pumping activity.The establishment of the alkaline pH domain requires AUX1 It is well established that the application of auxin to roots causes an increase in apoplastic and root surface pH (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Li et al., 2021). To investigate the effect of auxin application on surface pH profile and formation of the TZ alkaline domain, we analyzed surface pH in response to the native auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). With the increasing IAA concentration, the alkaline domain pH rose and the domain expanded toward the elongation zone of the root, which resulted in disappearance of the acidic domain (Figure 3a and b). The extent of the surface alkalinization correlated with IAA-induced root growth inhibition; the response was detectable at 1 nM IAA and was saturated between 100 and 1000 nM IAA (Figure 3c). This implies that the entire root surface is capable of alkalinization upon external auxin treatment, and that the alkaline domain is the hotspot of auxin response. Figure 3. Auxin influx by AUX1 is essential for the initiation of the alkaline domain. (a–c) Surface pH correlates with growth rate-dose response of Col-0 roots to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) auxin.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig3-figsupp1-data1.xlsx (158.6KB, xlsx) Open in a new tabWe further analyzed the root surface pH response to IAA in line with altered AHA activity. The PIN2>>AHA2-d95 and PIN2>>PP2 CD1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2c and d) as well as the pp2c-d triple mutant responded to IAA treatment by alkalinization of the root surface pH (Figure 2—figure supplement 2h and i). The alkalinization factors (a measure of IAA-induced alkalinization) were similar to Col-0 with the exception of the very root tip of pp2c-d triple which responded slightly less (Figure 2—figure supplement 2e and j). These results were correlated with control level IAA-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b and g). On the other hand, knockout mutation of AHA2 led to reduced IAA-induced root surface alkalinization (Figure 2—figure supplement 2h, i and j), but strong enough to observe an auxin-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2g). The alkaline domain does not seem to be caused by the lack of proton efflux in the TZ, and the amplitude of the alkaline domain can be increased by auxin application. We therefore tested how auxin transport, perception, and response contribute to the spatial determination of root surface pH. First, we tested the mutant in the PIN2 auxin efflux carrier, in which the shootward auxin flux through the outer root tissues is perturbed (Luschnig et al., 1998; Müller et al., 1998). The pin2 mutant root showed a reduced alkaline domain that was shifted toward the root tip (Figure 3d and e). Upon application of 10 nM IAA to pin2 mutant, the alkaline domain position and amplitude were partially restored (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b), the pin2 roots also responded to auxin by growth inhibition (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c). Upon treatment with 100 nM IAA, the alkaline domain and the overall IAA-induced root alkalinization were fully restored (Figure 3d and f and Figure 3—figure supplement 1d and e). The auxin influx carrier AUX1 is essential for auxin uptake and transport during root gravitropism (Swarup et al., 2005; Band et al., 2014), and the null aux1 mutant was shown to have a more acidic surface with an altered root tip pH profile (Monshausen et al., 2011). We determined the root surface pH profile in the aux1 mutant, and found that its pH showed a gradual decrease from the tip toward the root hair zone. While the acidic zone in the elongation zone was comparable to control roots, aux1 mutants displayed a complete absence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 3d and e). Application of 10 nM IAA on aux1 mutants did not affect root elongation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c) and did not trigger a root surface alkalinization in contrast to the control Col-0 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b). However, at 100 nM IAA, when IAA diffusion compensates for AUX1 function (Evans et al., 1994), aux1 mutant showed a clear IAA-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 3—figure supplement 1e) as well as an increased root surface pH beyond the TZ (Figure 3d and f and Figure 3—figure supplement 1d). The wild-type (WT)-like root surface pH profile was, however, not restored by IAA application, demonstrating that AUX1 is essential for creating the alkaline surface domain in the transition zone. As the immunolocalization pattern of AHAs in the aux1 mutant was comparable to the Col-0 control (Figure 2—figure supplement 1d), we treated the mutant with FC to investigate the activation status of AHAs in the aux1 mutant. Interestingly, this treatment resulted in the establishment of a small alkaline domain also in the aux1 mutant (Figure 3—figure supplement 1f and h), likely caused by AHA-mediated acidification in the root tip and the distal elongation zone that did not affect the TZ surface pH. The partial acidification was again correlated with a significant root growth stimulation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1g). This experiment showed that AHAs are not fully activated in aux1 mutant and implies a specific surface pH response of the cells of the TZ. In summary, we have shown that the distinctive alkaline domain at the transition zone of the root depends on AUX1-mediated auxin influx. Without auxin influx, the root shows a linear acidification gradient from the root tip to the maturation zone.The components of the rapid auxin response pathway steer the transition zone root surface pH Once in the cytoplasm, auxin triggers responses either through the canonical auxin signaling pathway or the auxin rapid response pathway (Dubey et al., 2021). We examined the involvement of these pathways in the establishment of the surface pH profile of the root. First, we investigated the components of the canonical auxin signaling by using the tir1,afb2,3 (tir triple) mutant which lacks the expression of three of the six known auxin receptors (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). The tir triple mutant displayed a more acidic surface pH, particularly in the elongation and maturation zone (Figure 4a and b). However, it was still displaying an alkaline domain, albeit less pronounced than the control. In response to IAA, tir triple was critically impaired in whole root IAA-induced surface pH alkalinization (Figure 4—figure supplement 1b and c). As a result, tir triple was also impaired in the IAA-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a). These results confirm that the canonical auxin signaling is involved in the auxin-induced apoplastic alkalinization (Li et al., 2021) and also partially in the longitudinal surface pH zonation. Next, to test the role of the TMK1-ABP1 apoplastic auxin perception pathway (Li et al., 2021; Friml et al., 2022) in the establishment of root surface pH profile, we analyzed the root surface pH profiles of tmk1, tmk4, and abp1 mutants. The surface pH profile of the mutants was, however, comparable to the Col-0 controls (Figure 4—figure supplement 1d, e and f). Figure 4. Rapid auxin signaling steers root surface pH.

AFB1 is the paralogue of the TIR1 receptor; AFB1 has been shown to be crucial for the rapid growth inhibition upon auxin treatment, rapid auxin-induced membrane depolarization, and for the early response to gravistimulation (Prigge et al., 2020; Serre et al., 2021). Similarly, the mutant in the calcium channel CNGC14 lacks the auxin-induced calcium transient, membrane depolarization, and shows a delay in the early gravitropic response (Shih et al., 2015; Dindas et al., 2018). We analyzed the root surface pH of both mutants and found a more acidic root surface with a critically flat alkaline domain in the afb1 mutant (Figure 4c and d and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a) as well as in the cngc14 mutant (Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b). We confirmed the similar result in additional alleles of afb1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2c) and cngc14 mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 2d). This shows that these proteins, apart from controlling the rapid auxin response, steer the pH profile of the root during normal steady-state growth by controlling the alkaline domain in the transition zone. The lack of the alkaline domain was not caused by mislocalization or absence of AUX1 protein in the afb1 or cngc14 mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 2e). Similarly to the aux1 mutant, the localization of AHA H+ ATPases in both mutants was not obviously different from the Col-0 control (Figure 2—figure supplement 1d). We further tested how the afb1 and cngc14 mutants respond to IAA and found an overall alkalinization of the root surface with a partial rescue of the alkaline domain (Figure 4d and f) and partially impaired growth inhibition (Figure 4—figure supplement 2f–h). What makes the TZ zone surface pH different from the other domains of the roots? A plausible explanation is the localization of relevant molecular components in this region of the root. The auxin transporters AUX1 and PIN2 have been shown to localize to the lateral root cap and epidermis (Müller et al., 1998; Swarup et al., 2004, Figure 4g). Prigge et al., 2020, showed that AFB1 is expressed in the root tip and we could see an enrichment of the protein in the root epidermis (Figure 4g). To determine the localization of CNGC14, we expressed its fluorescently C-terminally tagged version under the control of its native promoter. The expression of CNGC14 fusion protein was rather weak, and localized to the PM of root epidermal cells, with an enrichment in the transition zone (Figure 4g and h). The expression of AFB1-mCitrine and CNGC14-GFP in the respective mutants recovered the presence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 4c, d, e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a, b and d). Interestingly, the expression of CNGC14-GFP in cngc14 caused an exaggerated TZ alkaline domain (Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b and d), which underlines the importance of the CNGC14 calcium channel in the establishment of root surface pH profile. These results show that the signaling components so far associated with the rapid auxin response are expressed in the root epidermis and contribute to the longitudinal zonation of root surface pH profile. The alkaline domain of the TZ represents a site of a constant rapid auxin response that is triggered by the internal auxin fluxes mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 transporters. On the other hand, the overall increase of root surface pH upon auxin treatment can be attributed to the TIR1 canonical signaling pathway.The AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module facilitates root navigation It was shown that auxin induces alkalinization of the apoplastic pH and that this alkalinization correlates and is required for the inhibition of root growth. The same process occurs during the gravitropic response - the lower root side responds to the internal auxin by alkalinization, resulting in root bending (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015; Barbez et al., 2017). We reanalyzed the root surface pH using our pH imaging and quantifications, as it enables us to monitor alkalinization, as well as acidification of the root surface. Upon gravistimulation, the TZ alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified (Figure 5a, Video 1). This led to a gradient of surface pH across the root that was established within 5 min of the gravistimulation which correlated with initiation of bending of the root (Figure 5a). The disappearance of the alkaline halo on the upper root surface indicates that the TZ domain might act as a zone of stalled growth which is rapidly activated upon gravistimulation. We further analyzed the gravitropic responses of the mutants with altered root surface pH zonation. As expected, the agravitropic aux1 mutant did not create a pH gradient across the root and did not bend (Figure 5b). Manipulation of the AHA activity by the application of FC or by genetic means did not prevent the formation of a gradient of surface pH and rapid bending of the root (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a and b). Finally, the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a slower gravitropic response, as reported before (Serre et al., 2021; Shih et al., 2015; Figure 5c and d). As both mutants have a diminished alkaline domain in the TZ, upon gravistimulation, this zone could not rapidly react to change in auxin fluxes; instead, a shallow gradient of surface pH slowly develops in the mutants (Figure 5c and d).

In the aux1, afb1, and cngc14 mutants, the alkaline domain was absent or less prominent during vertical growth (Video 3). This result and the fact that the components of the rapid auxin response pathway are involved in the formation of the alkaline domain indicates that, in this zone, the cells continuously rapidly respond to the internal auxin fluxes, and that this pathway is active not only upon gravistimulation. We hypothesized that the significance of this process is to constantly correct the growth rate fluctuations and to enable the root to quickly regulate the growth direction of the root tip. This would be particularly relevant in the soil environment, where the root tip penetrates the soil particles and constantly corrects growth direction using the gravity vector. To test this hypothesis, we tested the ability of WT and aux1, afb1, and cngc14 mutants to navigate through artificial obstacles, approximated by tilted agar plates covered with a rectangular nylon grid. We scored the efficiency of the roots in penetrating the grids with varying pore sizes (Figure 5f). WT plants penetrated the meshes more efficiently as the pore size increased, whereas the agravitropic aux1 mutant failed to penetrate in all conditions. Interestingly, both the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a significant decrease in penetration efficiency compared to the WT (Figure 5g). Video 2.

This response enables the roots to rapidly react to gravity vector changes and to adjust the root tip growth direction.Discussion In this work, we present a new method to determine the root surface pH of A. thaliana. Its advantage is the sensitivity of FS in lower pH range that enables a spectacular visualization of root surface pH, including the acidic domain surrounding the late elongation and maturation zones of roots, which was not detected with the previously published methods (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015). FS is an inexpensive dye which can be excited by the common 405 and 488 nm laser lines. In this work, we avoided measuring absolute pH values; instead, we determined the relative pH compared to internal controls observed on the same medium. Absolute pH determination would be possible, if extensive pH calibration was performed during each imaging session. This approach would be very laborious, and, in addition, absolute fluorescence intensities might depend on the thickness of the layer of medium and many other parameters. Therefore, we recommend using FS to determine relative pH changes compared to internal controls, that is WT plants or mock controls imaged together with mutants or treated roots. We showed that apart from pH, FS can also react to other ions, however, given that the surface pH profile visualized by FS staining is in full accordance with the previously published works (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997; Weisenseel et al., 1979; Björkman and Leopold, 1987; Behrens et al., 1982; Iwabuchi et al., 1989; Staal et al., 2011), we conclude that in the growth media, FS reflects primarily the root surface pH. According to the acid growth theory, acidic pH enables cell wall extension (Rayle and Cleland, 1992; Hager, 2003). We observed the lowest pH values in the very tip of the root and in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. On the other hand, the alkaline domain partially covers the early elongation zone. The surface pH therefore does not fully correlate with the local growth rates (Beemster and Baskin, 1998; Shih et al., 2015). In addition, it remains to be resolved to what extent the surface pH correlates with the pH of the cell walls and the apoplastic space of the root epidermal cells, as previous work has reported a correlation between cell length and cell wall pH (Barbez et al., 2017; Moreau et al., 2022). It is possible that rather than driving cell elongation, the acidic domain in the maturation zone plays a role in nutrient acquisition and absorption by the root hairs (Martín-Barranco et al., 2021). The cytokinin-mediated cell wall stiffening may become the dominant growth-regulating mechanism in this root zone, leading to growth cessation despite low extracellular pH (Liu et al., 2022). Based on genetic and pharmacological experiments we concluded that the longitudinal surface pH zonation is not based solely on the activity and abundance of PM AHA H+ ATPases, but instead, the alkaline domain in the transition zone is driven by AUX1-mediated auxin influx and AFB1 signaling. The surface pH might be determined solely by AHA activity in the specific case of the aux1 mutant, where the pH progressively decreases in the shootward direction, and might then reflect the AHA activity gradient that is determined by the abundance of the proton pumps and their regulation by brassinosteroid signaling, as suggested by Großeholz et al., 2022. Interestingly, even in the aux1 mutant, a residual AHA-independent alkaline domain is present and can be visualized when AHAs are hyperactivated by the application of FC. In agreement with these results, the ectopic AHA ATPases activation also cannot prevent the auxin-induced growth inhibition and the gravitropic bending of roots. Inhibition of AHA activity led to slower growth, a tendency of slower gravitropic response, and the aha2-4 mutation caused a reduced auxin-induced surface alkalinization. In addition to controlling membrane potential and apoplastic pH, AHA activity influences auxin signaling by regulating auxin influx and diffusion into cells (Rubery and Sheldrake, 1973; Yang et al., 2006). These results might thus be caused by the reduced proton motive force that in turn might interfere with IAA uptake into the cells. What is the cause of the alkaline domain at the transition zone, if not the inhibition of AHA ATPase activity? It was shown that the auxin-induced apoplast and root surface alkalinization is accompanied by a decrease in cytosolic pH (Monshausen et al., 2011; Li et al., 2021), indicating that the alkaline domain visualized by the FS is caused by a proton influx into cells. The phenotype of the aux1 mutant hints to the possibility that the AUX1-mediated auxin symport with protons (Lomax et al., 1985) might cause the observed root surface alkalinization. Also supporting this hypothesis, the transition zone of maize roots is the site of the highest auxin influx, as measured by an auxin-specific electrode (Mancuso et al., 2005). On the other hand, the aux1 mutant was capable of surface alkalinization when higher concentrations of IAA were added, demonstrating that the AUX1-mediated influx per se is not required for surface alkalinization. Further, the afb1 mutants show a defect in the alkaline domain formation, which favors the explanation that the auxin-induced alkalinization is triggered from the AFB1 receptor. Given that the mutant in CNGC14 is defective in establishing root surface pH profile, auxin-induced alkalinization and auxin-induced calcium influx (Shih et al., 2015), and calcium influx and pH changes are tightly coupled (Behera et al., 2018), we conclude that CNGC14 functions downstream of AFB1. Similarly, Li et al., 2021, suggested that auxin-induced alkalinization of the apoplast is mediated by a yet unknown mechanism. It is intriguing to speculate that the signaling pathway might operate via the adenylate cyclase activity of TIR1/AFB auxin receptors (Qi et al., 2022). We show that the rapid auxin response pathway, so far connected with the reaction to auxin application (Fendrych et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021; Monshausen et al., 2011) or the gravitropic response (Serre et al., 2021; Shih et al., 2015), operates constantly in the growing A. thaliana root. Even though the other TIR1/AFB co-receptors partially contribute to the longitudinal surface pH zonation, AFB1 plays the most important role. The other TIR1/AFB receptors seem to be more important for the overall pH rise upon the application of IAA, in agreement with the results of Li et al., 2021. The localization of the alkaline zone seems to be determined by the intersection of the PIN2-mediated shootward auxin flux (Luschnig et al., 1998; Müller et al., 1998), localization of the AUX1-mediated auxin influx (Swarup et al., 2005; Band et al., 2014), and the enrichment of the AFB1 and CNGC14 proteins. We propose that the dynamic nature of the surface alkalinization observed by us and others (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015) results from the interaction of the intensity of the auxin flux and the constant rapid response that occurs in the alkaline domain of the root tip. In addition, the auxin-induced alkalinization is constantly being counterbalanced by the TMK-mediated AHA ATPase activation and apoplast acidification (Li et al., 2021; Friml et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2021). Upon gravistimulation, the alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified, which is consistent with previous pH measurements done by electrodes (Zieschang et al., 1993; Monshausen et al., 1996), indicating that the alkaline domain corresponds to a zone of a stalled cell elongation that can be rapidly regulated upon gravistimulation. In addition to the gene expression changes that occur during obstacle avoidance (Jacobsen et al., 2021) and the FERONIA-mediated mechanoperception (Shih et al., 2014), the rapid auxin response module in the root decreases the reaction time of the root to the changes of root growth direction, and thus increases the efficiency of root soil penetration.Materials and methods Plant material used We used the Col-0 ecotype and the following mutant and transgenic lines. The PIN2>>AHA2delta95, PIN2>>PP2C-D1 originate from this study, see Molecular cloning. Further, we used the aha2-4 (SALK_082786), pp2c-d2/5/6 triple mutant (Ren et al., 2018) (pp2c-d2 WsDsLOX493G12, pp2c-d5GABI_330E08, and pp2c-d6 SAIL_171H03), aux1-100 (SALK_020355), pin2 (NASC_N16706). The afb1-3 and AFB1::AFB1-mCitrine in afb1-3 originate from Prigge et al., 2020. The afb1-1s (SALK_144884C) was genotyped using the following primers SALK_LBb1.3, AACGGAAGACTAGGAAGCGAG, GCAACAGCTTCAAGACCTTTG. The cngc14-1 (SALK_206460) was genotyped by SALK_LBb1.3, CACCTGCTTGTAAAGCAAAGG, TCGGAACAATTGGCAGAATAC; cngc14-2 (wiscDsLox437E09) by WisDsLox_LBP (AACGTCCGCAATGTGTTATTAAGTTGTC), TGTTTCACGTAAAGTCAAACCC, TAAGAATCCAAGTGGCCACAC. The CNGC14::CNGC14-GFP (see Molecular cloning) was transformed into the cngc14-1 and cngc14-2 homozygous lines. The tir triple is the tir1,afb2,3 mutant (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). We used the tmk1-1 (SALK_016360), tmk4-1 (GABI_348E01) (Li et al., 2021), and the abp1-TD1 (SK21825) (Gao et al., 2015). AUX1::AUX1-YFP (Swarup et al., 2004) was introduced into afb1-3 and cngc14-2 by crossing. AUX1::AUX1-YFP was crossed with PIN::PIN2-mCherry (Retzer et al., 2019). Seeds were surface-sterilized by chlorine gas for 2 hr. Seeds were sown on 1% (wt/vol) plant agar (Duchefa) with ½ Murashige Skoog salts (MS, Duchefa), 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, adjusted to pH 5.8 with KOH, and stratified for 2 days at 4°C. Seedlings were vertically grown for 5 days in a growth chamber at 23°C by day (16 hr), 18°C by night (8 hr), 60% humidity, and light intensity of 120 µmol photons/m2/s.Molecular cloning The tissue-specific estradiol-inducible lines were prepared as follows. For PIN2>>AHA2delta95, we cloned the CDS 1-886 of AHA2 (AT4G30190) lacking the last 95 amino acids as in Pacheco-Villalobos et al., 2016, and fused mScarlet-I (Bindels et al., 2017) to the C-terminal part. For PIN2>>PP2C-D1, we cloned the CDS of PP2C-D1 (AT5G02760) and fused mScarlet-I to the C-terminal part. Both constructs were cloned downstream of the 4xLexA Operon fused to CaMV 35S minimal promoter (Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013) and the transcriptional units were terminated by the 35S terminator and cloned into the alpha1-3 vectors (Dusek et al., 2020). XVE (Zuo et al., 2000) was cloned under the control of the PIN2 promoter (1.4 kb upstream of the AT5G57090), terminated by the RuBisCo terminator from Pisum sativum and the resulting transcriptional unit was cloned into alpha1-1 vector. The alpha transcriptional units were then interspaced with matrix attachment regions (Dusek et al., 2020), combined with a Basta resistance cassette and introduced into the pDGB3omega1 binary vector (Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013). The CNGC14::CNGC14-GFP construct contains the CNCG14 promoter (1.5 kb upstream of the start codon) and the CNGC14 coding sequence (the AT2G24610.1 splice variant) with the GFP fused to the C-terminus and 35S terminator. This transcriptional unit was combined with a kanamycin resistance cassette and FastRed marker for rapid selection of transgenic seeds into the pDGB3omega1 binary vector. All cloning steps were performed using the GoldenBraid methodology (Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013; https://gbcloning.upv.es/). Col-0 ecotype (PIN2>>AHA2delta95, PIN2>>PP2C-D1) or cngc14-1 and cngc14-2 lines (CNGC14-mVenus) were transformed using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998).Pharmacological treatments and dyes Treatments were prepared using the following chemicals: IAA (10 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich), FC (1 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich), estradiol (20 mM stock in DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescein Dextran 10,000 MW, Anionic (D1821, Thermo Fisher) - 10 mg/ml stock in miliQ H2O, final concentration in media is 29 µg/ml. Oregon Green 488 Dextran, 10,000 MW (D7170, Invitrogen) - 1 mg/ml stock in miliQ H2O, final concentration in media is 2.5 µg/ml. HPTS (H1529, Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mM stock in H2O, final concentration in media is 1 mM. FS (F1130, Thermo Fisher), 100 or 50 mM stock in H2O, final concentration in media is 50 µM. Induction of PIN2>>AHA2delta95 and PIN2>>PP2C-D1 lines was done by incubating 5-day-old seedlings for 2.5 hr in 1/2 MS MES buffered media (g/l), 1% sucrose, pH 5.8 containing 2 µM estradiol before experiments.Measurement of FS excitation and emission spectra For measurement of fluorescent spectra of FS, ½ MS media with 1% sucrose were prepared with pH 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 (adjusted with KOH). FS stock (50 mM in H2O) was added to the media to achieve a final concentration of 50 µM. For the measurement, 200 µl of this media was pipetted into a 96-well plate, five wells per each pH value and the spectras were measured using Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). The values for each pH were averaged and plotted.Measurement of FS range and effects of salts and redox status on FS signal To demonstrate the wide pH-reporting range of FS (Figure 1c), citric acid and sodium citrate were mixed in various ratios and water was added to obtain citrate buffers with a range of pH values. The pH of citrate buffers was measured, the buffers were mixed with agar (0.8% final concentration), boiled and FS was added (50 µM final concentration). The mixture was poured into a Petri dish. After cooling down, slabs of the solidified buffers were cut out, and placed into imaging chambers. To measure the effects of ions and redox status (according to Martinière et al., 2013) on FS fluorescence (Figure 1—figure supplement 1e), MES buffer (1 g/l) was prepared and boiled with agar (1% final concentration), supplied with salts, H2O2, DTT, and FS was added (50 µM final concentration). The mixture was poured into a Petri dish. After cooling down, slabs of the solidified buffers were cut out, placed into imaging chambers and imaged using a spinning disk microscope, see Imaging of root surface pH. The signal intensity was measured in both 405 and 488 nm excitation channels and F488/405 ratio was calculated.Imaging of root surface pH For imaging of surface pH, 5-day-old seedlings were transferred to unbuffered ½ MS, 1% sucrose, pH 5.7 (adjusted with KOH) containing 50 µM of FS +/-treatments and allowed for recovery 25 min before imaging. The medium was prepared as follows: For 100 ml of medium, 1 g of plant agar and 1 g sucrose (wt/vol) were added to 100 ml of unbuffered ½ MS in a 250 ml reagent bottle. The media was boiled until the agar was completely dissolved. Note: we always prepared a fresh solid medium for each experiment from a stock of liquid ½ MS, sucrose and agar, as re-boiling the medium might affect the results. The medium was cooled to a temperature of 45–50°C and FS was added to achieve 50 μM concentration. This pre-solution was then divided into two equal volumes to make control and treatment medium. For the gravitropic experiments, the seedlings were rotated ±90°. Only roots with a starting angle of 90°±10° were selected for analysis to obtain homogeneous gravitropic stimulations. Surface pH imaging was performed using a vertical stage Zeiss Axio Observer 7 with Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10×/0.8, coupled to a Yokogawa CSU-W1-T2 spinning disk unit with 50 µm pinholes and equipped with a VS401 HOM1000 excitation light homogenizer (Visitron Systems). Images were acquired using the VisiView software (Visitron Systems). FS was sequentially excited with a 488 and 405 nm laser and the emission was filtered by a 500–550 nm bandpass filter. Signal was detected using a PRIME-95B Back-Illuminated sCMOS Camera (1200×1200 pixels; Photometrics). The Flat field correction mode was used for image acquisition. For vertical growth experiments, seedlings were imaged every 10 min for 30 min. The profiles shown correspond to the first time frame while the root elongation was calculated over the whole experiment. Imaging to observe oscillations of the root surface pH was conducted by imaging every 5 s. For gravitropic experiments, seedlings were imaged using the sandwich method (https://doi.org/10.1017/qpb.2022.4) every 2 min for 42 min. The profile shown corresponds to the last time frame except specified otherwise. The angles were quantified over the entire duration of the experiment. The images in Figure 4g were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope, with a 25×/0.8 water immersion objective using settings appropriate for the respective fluorophores.Immunolabeling of AHAs Whole mount immunolocalization of 5-day-old A. thaliana seedlings was performed as described previously in Sauer et al., 2006, with the following modifications. The protocol was adapted to the InSituPro VS liquid-handling robot (Intavis AG, Germany). Prior to immunolocalization, seedlings were fixed 1 hr with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in MTSB (50 mM PIPES, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgSO4·7H2O pH 7, adjusted with KOH) at room temperature. In the robot, procedure started with 5×15 min washes with MTSB-T (MTSB+0.01% Triton X-100) then the cell wall was digested by 30 min treatment at 37°C with 0.05% Pectolyase Y-23 supplemented with 0.4 M mannitol in MTSB-T, followed by 2×30 min membrane permeation with 10% DMSO and 3% Igepal in MTSB-T. The samples were blocked 1 hr with BSA (blocking solution: 2% BSA in MTSB-T) and incubated 4 hr at 37°C with primary (antiAHA rabbit antibody, Agrisera AS07260, RRID:AB_1031584) and 3 hr at 37°C with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 555 goat, anti-rabbit, Abcam ab150078, RRID:AB_2722519). The antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA in MTSB-T in concentration: 1:500 for primary and 1:1000 for secondary antibody. Between the all described steps the seedlings were washed 5×15 min with MTSB-T. For the final step, MTSB-T was exchanged by deionized water. From the robot seedlings were transferred to microscopy slides into 50% glycerol in deionized water and fluorescence signal was imaged by Zeiss LSM 880 inverted confocal scanning microscope equipped with Airyscan detector with 40×/1.2 C-Apochromat objective.Mesh penetration test Four-day-old seedlings were transferred on ½ MS, 1% (wt/vol) plant agar, 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, pH 5.8, covered with sterilized nylon meshes of pore sizes of 109, 119, 139 µm (polyamide mesh UHELON). Plates were grown overnight vertically and then were tilted to 45° and grown 24 hr. After that, the root penetration through the mesh was scored using a binocular microscope. The penetration efficiency was calculated by normalizing each variant (genotype × pore size) to the Col-0 efficiency in the 139 µm variant in the particular repetition. In addition, the reference Col-0 was normalized to the Col-0 average over all repeats.Image analysis We determined root elongation by measuring the total root length increment between the first and last time frame divided by the number of minutes. The root length increment was measured with the segmented line in ImageJ/Fiji v1.53f51 (Schindelin et al., 2012). The pH along the root was automatically measured from 10 to 25 pixels off the root surface using custom Python scripts (ATR v5,https://sourceforge.net/projects/atr-along-the-root, see Figure 1—figure supplement 1f) averaging bins of 15*20 pixels from the fluorescence intensity of both 405 and 488 nM channels. Root angles over time were automatically measured using ACORBA v1.2 (Serre and Fendrych, 2022). Fluorescence intensity of AFB1-mCitrine and CNGC14-GFP was measured as the signal intensity along a segmented line that covered the epidermal cell file using Fiji; the intensities were then binned to 10 µm bins and plotted.Statistical analysis and graphics The averages and SD of surface pH or alkalinization factor in function of the distance from the root tip were plotted using the Sourcecode1.py Python script. The root elongation boxplots and the associated statistics were performed using the Sourcecode2.R: R script. Statistical analyses were performed using the R software (R v4.0.2 and RStudio v1.3.1073). Boxplots represent the median and the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers extend to data points <1.5 interquartile range away from the first or third quartile; all data points are shown as individual dots. The results of the statistical tests are compiled in Supplemental statistics. The pH surface profiles and data represented as boxplots were statistically analyzed from genotype to genotype or condition to condition using the nparcomp package (Konietschke et al., 2015). For two conditions or two genotypes comparisons, we used a non-parametric Student’s test. For multiple comparisons, we used a non-parametric multi comparison test. For the pH surface profiles, each independent data point (a bin of pixels at a defined distance from the root tip) for the control genotype or condition were compared the same data point from the other(s) genotype(s) or condition(s) using the Sourcecode3.R or Sourcecode4.R R scripts. The results of the statistical tests for all the figures are compiled in Source data 1. Sample size and biological replicates were determined as the maximum number of roots fitting the microscopy chamber, this number being influenced by the number of conditions and genotypes for a given experiment. Experiment technical replicates were arbitrarily set to three replicates. Fluorescence values were measured blindly by fully automated scripts. Data depicted in this publication represent a pool of technical and biological replicates. No technical or biological replicates were excluded from this publication. Graphics were created with the R software or in Python (v3.8) with the Seaborn plugin (v0.11.2, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03021) and aesthetic modifications of the graphs (fonts, size) were modified in Inkscape (v1.0).Acknowledgements We would like to thank Mark Estelle for sharing the seeds; Karel Müller and Tomáš Moravec for help with molecular cloning; Mayuri Sadoine and Wolf Frommer for access to their spectrofluorometer and technical guidance.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"The AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module establishes longitudinal root surface pH profile\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Herman Höfte (Reviewer #1); Elke Barbez (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: 1) Please answer point by point the reviewers' comments below, and make the necessary changes in the manuscript. Some experiments are suggested to strengthen the results. If these can not be carried out, we request justification why. 2) A critical point highlighted by reviewers 1 and 2 is the Immunolabeling result with anti-AHA2. The experiment lacks good negative and positive controls (see reviewer 1) and quantification of the signal. Also, reviewer 2 indicates that the nature and specificity of the antibody have not been properly described. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): A few remarks: Figure 2A and S2A: the immunolabeling with the anti-AHA2 antibody is not convincing since good negative (aha mutants?) and positive controls (AHA overexpressor?) are lacking. Also, some quantification of the signal in WT and mutants should be provided. line 341: Please provide evidence for the dependence of FS fluorescence on other ions. line 301ff: Would be nice to give an idea of the time scale of the pH variations in vertically growing roots? It appears that the fluorescence intensity variation on each side of the root also may show some periodicity. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): – Improve the presentation of the more acidic and alkaline domains. In Figures 1e, and f it would be beneficial to highlight the three regions. In connection with the following point, measurements could be binned within these three areas and serve as a base for comparing treatments or genotypes. – Visualisation of pH profile and statistical analysis. The profiles presented are great, but I am puzzled by how the quantitative comparisons between treatments/genotypes were computed and which statistical methods were used. Colored bars extend above regions of the profile and are marked as 'ns'. Does that mean that the profiles do not differ in these regions only but do in the other? I assume the color refers to the genotype/treatment that does not differ from the control. In any case, I wonder whether, in addition (or in replacement) to these profiles, the authors could not bin the measurement in three regions (apical, TZ, elongation zone) and present box plots of the ratio measurement. – There are few details about the nature of the AHA antibody used to detect the AHA. Was it used in previous studies? Is it specific to the AHAs? – Figure 4 pH profile in tir triple, cngc14, and afb1: move S4B, D, E and F to main figure. – Figure 4G: enrichment of AFB1 and CNGC14 signal should be quantified. Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): Maybe the authors can still give it a try to provide a few complementary experiments with previously published tools. (Gjetting et al., doi: 10.1093/jxb/ers040., Barbez et al., as cited). Especially since Barbez et al., report a slight apoplast acidification in the transition zone shortly before cell elongation, it would be very interesting to read the authors' view on that A suggestion regarding HPTS. When a suitable 458 or white light laser is absent, one could try to calibrate the HPTS detection only with the 405 lasers. The pH unit resolution is lower but it may be appropriate for the authors' needs. In addition, HPTS provides, upon staining and mounting, a very strong background signal. Zeiss confocal setups often have signal overload detector protection which does not allow to image the stained roots as such. Therewith, it helps to detect the root in the DIC channel and crop the ROI in a way that no background (free medium) signal is visible in the channel. Therewith, one can increase the gain without risking damaging the detectors. My favorite finding of this manuscript is the role of CNGC14 in the establishment of the alkalic root surface patch. It would be very interesting to see whether the authors can establish the patch elsewhere in the root by mis-expressing CNGC14 in the cngc14 background.eLife. 2023 Jul 14;12:e85193. doi: 10.7554/eLife.85193.sa2 Author response Article notes Copyright and License information Collection date 2023.  Copyright notice Essential revisions: Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): A few remarks: Figure 2A and S2A: the immunolabeling with the anti-AHA2 antibody is not convincing since good negative (aha mutants?) and positive controls (AHA overexpressor?) are lacking. Also, some quantification of the signal in WT and mutants should be provided. We have modified the text to specify which AHA paralogs the antiAHA antibody recognizes (it recognizes multiple AHAs from multiple plant species), and we have performed additional controls: (A) omitting the primary antibody results in no PM staining. (B) in the aha2-4 mutant that lacks the AHA2 paralog, we can still detect plasma membrane signal. (C) in the inducible overexpression lines, the signal colocalizes with the AHA2-d95-mScarlet signal. These results confirm the antibody manufacturer specification – the antibody recognizes multiple AHA paralogs in Arabidopsis. We have included these results as Supplemental figures Figure S2-1. We prefer not to compare the signal intensities between different immunostained roots, as the fluorescence intensity levels are quite variable. Instead, we included several examples of the immunostained mutants in the new Figure S2-1d for comparison. We also ‘softened’ the statements in the text where we refer to the comparison of immunostaining pattern of the aux1, afb1 and cngc14 mutants to the Col-0 control. line 341: Please provide evidence for the dependence of FS fluorescence on other ions. This data is shown as Figure S1e. line 301ff: Would be nice to give an idea of the time scale of the pH variations in vertically growing roots? It appears that the fluorescence intensity variation on each side of the root also may show some periodicity. The surface pH on the two sides of the root growing downward seem to be correlated – as is shown on the figure 5e. The pH seems to oscillate on the timescale of minutes, as is shown in Figure 5e and the Video 2. We have tried to characterize the oscillations using several methods (such as Fourier transformation of the signal), but we were unable obtain convincing results, the reason is that the oscillations are very variable and very likely depend on the growth patterns of the roots – we think that the roots is constantly correcting the growth directionality. We have added additional movies of vertically growing roots, so the readers can observe the dynamics of the surface pH patterns. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): – Improve the presentation of the more acidic and alkaline domains. In Figures 1e, and f it would be beneficial to highlight the three regions. In connection with the following point, measurements could be binned within these three areas and serve as a base for comparing treatments or genotypes. We have included the domain highlight into the Figure 1. We have tried to explain the statistic comparison more clearly in the new version of the manuscript, and we have modified the figures to make to comparison clearer. We have put a lot of effort to measure and plot the longitudinal pH profiles of the roots (including a dedicated program to analyze the pH profiles). We are convinced that showing the full pH profiles is the best way how to show the results. The binning, albeit simpler to compare between treatments and genotypes, would have to be arbitrary and would hide a lot of information. We hope that the new explanation and marking the statistical significance improved the readability of our results. – Visualisation of pH profile and statistical analysis. The profiles presented are great, but I am puzzled by how the quantitative comparisons between treatments/genotypes were computed and which statistical methods were used. Colored bars extend above regions of the profile and are marked as 'ns'. Does that mean that the profiles do not differ in these regions only but do in the other? I assume the color refers to the genotype/treatment that does not differ from the control. In any case, I wonder whether, in addition (or in replacement) to these profiles, the authors could not bin the measurement in three regions (apical, TZ, elongation zone) and present box plots of the ratio measurement. We admit that we have not explained the statistical comparison well in the previous version of the manuscript, and that the visualization was quite confusing. We added clarifications in the text (figure legends and the material and methods) regarding how the statistics were done for profile comparisons: In the graphics, we quantified bins of fluorescence over the distance from the root tip. As these datapoints are independent (in contrary to e.g., timepoints) we used non-parametric Student test (2 conditions or genotypes) or multi comparison test (>2 conditions or genotypes) (nparcomp package for R). We compared every datapoints corresponding to all the biological/technical replicates for the control condition or genotype to the datapoints from another condition or genotype. To make the plots more readable, we modified all the pH profile plots in the manuscript and added graphical representation of the statistical results directly above the curves. – There are few details about the nature of the AHA antibody used to detect the AHA. Was it used in previous studies? Is it specific to the AHAs? We have added more information about the antiAHA antibody into the text and we performed additional control experiments that confirm what the producer claims: this antibody recognizes multiple AHA paralogs, including AHA2. These results are now part of the Figure S2-1. – Figure 4 pH profile in tir triple, cngc14, and afb1: move S4B, D, E and F to main figure. – Figure 4G: enrichment of AFB1 and CNGC14 signal should be quantified. We have reorganized the Figure 4 for better readability; the pH profiles of afb1, cngc14 and tir triple mutants are part of the main figure. In the supplemental figure, the comparison between the mutant profile and Col-0 is shown, while the main figure depicts the responses of the profile to application of IAA (reflecting the auxin responsiveness of the surface pH). We have quantified the AFB1 and CNGC14 intensities along the longitudinal axis of the root, the data is now included as Figure 4h. Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): Maybe the authors can still give it a try to provide a few complementary experiments with previously published tools. (Gjetting et al., doi: 10.1093/jxb/ers040., Barbez et al., as cited).

Therewith, it helps to detect the root in the DIC channel and crop the ROI in a way that no background (free medium) signal is visible in the channel. Therewith, one can increase the gain without risking damaging the detectors. We thank the reviewer for the suggestions regarding the other pH imaging tools. We have included the HPTS image into the supplementary Figure 1 – excited with 405 and 488 lasers. It is obvious that HPTS also demonstrates a similar pattern as FS: HPTS visualizes the strong alkaline domain around the transition zone (Figure S1a). However, the problem is that our vertical imaging system is a spinning disk microscope, and it is impossible to detect the cell wall signal due to the extremely strong HPTS signal around the root, which overshines the cell wall signal. Unlike the classical confocal, the spinning disk system illuminates the entire sample and regions of interest of illumination cannot be performed. We would therefore have to perform the imaging on a different vertical laser scanning confocal microscope that we do not have. We are intensively working with other apoplastic pH staining methods and sensors (apophluorin, apohusion, SYP122-pHusion, acidins) and we are developing further rootoptimized pH sensors. So far, none of the published sensors was satisfactory in our hands. We, however, would prefer not to include this ‘negative’ data in this manuscript, as it seems beyond the scope of this work. We are aware that determining the correlation between cell wall pH, apoplastic pH and cell expansion is an important un-answered question. We have modified the discussion to include the comment of the reviewer: “…, it remains to be resolved to what extent the surface pH correlates with the pH of the cell walls and the apoplastic space of the root epidermal cells, as previous work has reported a correlation between cell length and cell wall pH”. My favorite finding of this manuscript is the role of CNGC14 in the establishment of the alkalic root surface patch. It would be very interesting to see whether the authors can establish the patch elsewhere in the root by mis-expressing CNGC14 in the cngc14 background. This is an intriguing idea – we have tried to overexpress CNCG14 using a strong constitutive 35S promoter, but unfortunately, we were unable to obtain lines with strong CNGC14 signal (probably due to technical/cloning issues), we therefore do not have the results that could answer this question. We would need to target the expression into other domains of the root, and probably we would have to co-express AFB1 in this region as well.
