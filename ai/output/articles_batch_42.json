    "abstract": "Abstract The first genome sequenced of a eukaryotic organism was for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as reported in 1996, but it was more than 10 years before any of the zygomycete fungi, which are the early-diverging terrestrial fungi currently placed in the phyla Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota, were sequenced. The genome for Rhizopus delemar was completed in 2008; currently, more than 1000 zygomycete genomes have been sequenced. Genomic data from these early-diverging terrestrial fungi revealed deep phylogenetic separation of the two major clades—primarily plant—associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizal Mucoromycota versus the primarily mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in the Zoopagomycota. Genomic studies provide many valuable insights into how these fungi evolved in response to the challenges of living on land, including adaptations to sensing light and gravity, development of hyphal growth, and co-existence with the first terrestrial plants. Genome sequence data have facilitated studies of genome architecture, including a history of genome duplications and horizontal gene transfer events, distribution and organization of mating type loci, rDNA genes and transposable elements, methylation processes, and genes useful for various industrial applications. Pathogenicity genes and specialized secondary metabolites have also been detected in soil saprobes and pathogenic fungi.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction The first “land” fungi retained their flagella for motility and remained adapted to life in water, and several diverging lineages switched to multicellularity while exploiting new environments [1]. A hallmark of the process of adapting to terrestrial life was the loss of the flagellum, which occurred independently several times during fungal evolution, giving rise to fungi with a hyphal growth form [2]. Prominent among early-divergent fungi is a group of lineages historically known as the zygomycetes, which are unified by similarities in reproductive biology (e.g., the formation of sexual zygospores via undifferentiated gametangia) and mostly do not form macroscopic fruiting bodies, making them more difficult to study than Dikarya [3]. Zygomycetes have also been challenging to study because many species are involved in obligate symbiotic interactions and have not been successfully grown in pure culture [4]. However, subsequent molecular studies have shown that the zygomycete fungi are paraphyletic [5]. Today, zygomycetes are recognized as two independent monophyletic groups divided into six subphyla [6]. Terrestrial environments posed novel challenges to early fungi, and the adaptive solutions that these lineages evolved can today be gleaned from the vast library of genes contained within their genomes [7,8]. While these first land colonizers are now extinct, many of their features are preserved in the genomes of extant zygomycetes. One instance, in which whole-genome data have proven useful, is in understanding the origin and evolution of fungi. About 450 million years ago, combined activities of fungi and plants placed the terrestrial world on a trajectory toward its current state, setting the stage for subsequent evolutionary transitions. Primitive mycorrhiza-like relationships and other forms of fungal–plant associations helped facilitate the successful colonization of land by the first terrestrial plants, and the genes responsible for such interactions are still preserved in fungal genomes [9]. Hence, zygomycete genomes have and will continue to play an integral role in our current understanding of the initial transition of organisms to land [10]. The number of sequenced fungal genomes continues to grow exponentially, and genomic data have become widely and freely accessible. While most sequenced genomes are from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (Dikarya) species, there have been concerted efforts to sequence genomes of early-diverging and underrepresented lineages [11,12,13,14,15]. Since 2014, the number of zygomycete genomes has grown from a dozen [16] to nearly a thousand. However, 70% of these genomes are still in the draft stage, and not all of them are available. While the number of species with sequenced genomes for all organisms is on the rise, the available pool of zygomycete genomes is exceptional due to its diversity, i.e., one-third of ca. 1000 known zygomycete species have already been sequenced (Supplementary Table S1 [17]). The sequencing efforts have not been uniform among different groups of Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota; for most species, only a single representative genome is available. While several major clades lack a single published genome (e.g., Eryniopsis and Neozygites in Entomophthoromycotina, and several genera in Zoopagomycotina), numerous isolates of several other species have been sequenced (Figure 1). This discrepancy can be largely explained by practical interests since focal species are sometimes chosen for their relevance to human health or biotechnology [18]. In addition, some taxa are common in culture collections whereas other taxa are challenging to grow in vitro or presumably uncultivable [4,11]. The goal of this review is to (1) provide background into the methods that have been used to sequence zygomycete genomes and which genomes have been sequenced, and (2) consider insights into the genomic architecture, gene content, and evolutionary history gained from these data.

    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions There has been renewed research interest in the zygomycete fungi during the last decade, and this is reflected in the rapidly increasing number of genome sequences from this group of fungi. While the quality of the genomes varies according to the sequencing platform and starting materials available, the genomes are sufficient for phylogenomic reconstructions, as well as for the discovery of functional genes and gene clusters of interest. Much of the work has focused on several key topics, including the evolution and phylogeny of the group, adaptation, and transition to a terrestrial habitat (e.g., light and gravity sensors, and reinforcement of cell-wall structure to tolerate a nonaquatic environment), genome duplication, endosymbionts and horizontal gene transfer, genome architecture, pathogenicity, and coevolution with host species. The number of genomes has grown rapidly over the past decade, and we expect that the next decade will bring increased taxon sampling (e.g., new genomes for taxa that have not yet been sampled) and improvements in genome quality due to advances in long-read sequencing technologies and bioinformatics approaches. In the future, we expect that genomic analyses of these fungi will take new directions, including a detailed comparison of the genomes of aquatic vs. terrestrial lineages, structural studies, a comparison of the zygomycete vs. Dikarya genomes, experimental manipulations of host/parasite interactions to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning pathogenesis, and building links among genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data.",

While most sequenced genomes are from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (Dikarya) species, there have been concerted efforts to sequence genomes of early-diverging and underrepresented lineages [11,12,13,14,15]. Since 2014, the number of zygomycete genomes has grown from a dozen [16] to nearly a thousand. However, 70% of these genomes are still in the draft stage, and not all of them are available.

Sequencing the Zygomycetes Axenic cultures remain the preferred and most straightforward method of obtaining high-molecular-weight genomic DNA for sequencing projects [19]. Typically, the easier a species is to grow in culture, the easier it is to obtain pure, unfragmented DNA of high quality. In some cases, however, DNA from a single cell or even nuclei can be extracted and sequenced. This technique has been especially successful for the mycoparasites or fungal parasites of animals (e.g., Piptocephalis, Stylopage, and Zoopage [11,20,21]) or for resolving questions on genetic diversity of the nuclei in Glomeromycotina, such as Rhizophagus [22]. When neither culturing nor single-cell genomics is possible, fungal DNA can be extracted along with that of the host organism. The two genomes can be distinguished bioinformatically (e.g., in the case of Entomopthorales pathogens of insects [23]). In rare cases, high-quality tissue from field-collected fruiting bodies can be used to generate genomes (e.g., Endogone, Jimgerdemannia, and Modicella [12,14,24]). The diversity of DNA sequencing technologies allows researchers to select the tools that are most appropriate for addressing specific questions but also requires setting minimal reporting standards for each type of sequencing technology. During sequence processing, genomic DNA is cut and sequenced in length spans from 100–300 base pairs (short reads, Illumina) to 1000–60,000 base pairs (long reads, PacBio, or MinION). Illumina short-read sequencing remains the dominant technology used to generate fungal genomes, while long-read technologies such as PacBio and Oxford nanopore are being used with increased frequency, especially for larger genomes (Supplementary Table S1). Illumina sequencing generally provides the greatest sequencing quality and accuracy, although millions of short raw reads (150–300 bp) are produced; as a result, genome assembly can be challenging especially with genomes featuring large amounts of repetitive DNA. Assembly quality might be adjusted by combining the use of short reads from Illumina with long reads from another sequencing platform. The use of longer reads (up to 60,000 bp) facilitates read alignment and/or mapping, often achieving the length of the chromosome [25] and allows precise resolution of repetitive sequences of rDNA [26]. However, PacBio and other long-read technologies typically demand higher quality and quantity of DNA than Illumina. On the other hand, these technologies are changing rapidly as different companies compete for the market share and make efforts to increase the number and length of reads and to maintain and improve sequence accuracy [27]. The majority of zygomycete genomes are assembled de novo, even when assemblies of closely related species are already available. Choice of assembly software usually depends on the data type. For example, AllPaths-LG works best for assembling Illumina short-read sequences, while Falcon is preferred for longer PacBio reads (Supplementary Table S1) [28]. The most widely used genome assemblers for zygomycetes include gsAssembler (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA), Newbler [18], Velvet [29], Arachne, Celera [30], HGAP [31], JGI Jazz (especially among earlier assemblies from 2001–2014) [32], Ray [33], CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0 (https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com, accessed on 10 July 2023), MaSuRCA [34], Falcon, AllPaths-LG [35], SOAPdenovo [36], SPAdes [37], SOLiD [38], Canu [39], FinisherSC [40], Flye [41], and MEGAHIT [42] (Figure 2). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Approaches used in the generation of zygomycete genomes: sequencing (upper panel) and assembly (lower panel) technologies. Different shades of green and brown—Mucoromycota; purple and blue—Zoopagomycota.Most zygomycete genome assemblies are similar in size to the average fungal genome: 30–50 Mb (Supplementary Table S1). Notable exceptions include species in Entomophthoromycotina, Glomeromycotina, and Mucoromycotina, whose large genomes compare in size to Arabidopsis thaliana (135 Mb), Caenorhabditis elegans (100 Mb), or Drosophila melanogaster (140 Mb) [43,44]. However, there are still far smaller than the genomes of some of the Basidiomycete fungi that cause rust diseases on plants, which includes the largest fungal genome sequenced to date (Austropuccinia psidii, 1 Gb) [45]. Most zygomycete genomes contain over 10,000 predicted genes. Rhizophagus spp. (Glomeromycotina) are a notable exception; they contain more than double the typical number with 26–30 K predicted genes (Figure 3). The smallest numbers of genes are found in Zoopagomycotina (4–8 K), followed by 6–11 K in Kickxellomycotina, 9–16 K in Entomophthoromycotina, Mucoromycotina and Mortierellomycotina, and 20–30 K in Glomeromycotina (Supplementary Table S1). However, these numbers may change for Entomophthoromycotina and Zoopagomycotina since there are only a few representative genomes available for those lineages. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Genome statistics for zygomycete sequences. Sizes of the genomes and number of the genomes sequenced since 2005 (upper left), number of contigs in assemblies (upper right), estimated sequencing depth coverage relative to the single genome (lower left), and the number of the predicted genes (lower right). Different shades of green and brown—Mucoromycota; purple and blue—Zoopagomycota.During the assembly process DNA sequences are combined into contigs, which are sometimes merged to form scaffolds (if sufficient evidence exists to support these merges). These scaffolds of assembled DNA sequences should ideally equal the number of chromosomes [46]. In practice, the number of scaffolds rarely matches exactly the number of chromosomes and, for most species, the exact number of chromosomes is unknown [47]. Many genomes of easily culturable Mucoromycota with small genomes have the lowest number of scaffolds (e.g., 12 in Actinomortierella wolfii), while the genomes of species with larger genomes (e.g., taxa in Glomeromycotina and Entomophthoromycotina) are more fragmented such as 210 contigs in Rhizophagus irregularis [26], or 373,021 in Massospora cicadina [48]. These larger assemblies are due to larger overall genomes (e.g., larger number of chromosomes) and because of the difficulties with assembly caused by polyploidy, numerous repeats, and transposons [49]; these aspects are prevalent in many Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota genomes (Supplementary Table S1). However, the sequenced genomes with hundreds of thousands of scaffolds often reflect low sequence coverage relative to the size of the genome, resulting in highly fragmented assemblies. All these factors contribute to the number of the scaffolds, not reflecting the actual numbers of chromosomes. Genome quality is also improved by increasing the sequence coverage. Some zygomycete genomes have been sequenced at a depth of 500–700× and many genome projects aim for a mean depth of ca. 100× coverage (Supplement Table S1). High-quality genome assemblies rely on increased sequencing depth, particularly in cases of high intraspecific polymorphism or variable genome architecture, e.g., species of Glomeromycotina and many noncoding regions and transposons, as in the genomes of Entomophthoromycotina species. However, some researchers have used low-coverage genome sequencing (ca. 10× coverage) as a cheap and efficient method to obtain a smaller number of orthologous gene regions for phylogenomic analyses [12,15,24].3. Genomes and the Evolution of the Zygomycetes The first genome sequence of a zygomycete fungus was from a clinical strain of Rhizopus delemar that was isolated from a patient with mucormycosis—a highly destructive and lethal infection that is typically seen in immunocompromised hosts. Sequencing of the R. delemar genome was driven from the clinical perspective, but it also provided the first genome of a fungus outside of the Dikarya [18]. Moving forward a decade, a landmark project generated genomic sequences of all species known to cause mucoromycosis in humans. Thirty zygomycete genomes were sequenced and assembled for this project [50]. Another substantial advance in zygomycete genomics was made by the ZyGoLife team, comprising the efforts of 12 mycological labs across the USA and Canada in collaboration with the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [14]. The phylogenomic study by Spatafora et al. [6] found that the former Zygomycota phylum was not monophyletic but instead comprised two distinct lineages—the primarily plant-associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizal Mucoromycota versus the primarily mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in the Zoopagomycota. However, further analyses using phylogenomics data to resolve the evolutionary relationships of zygomycetes have yielded slightly conflicting results. Although Zoopagomycota and Mucoromycota are maintained as monophyletic lineages, a recent study by Li et al. [51] found that Zoopagomycota and Mucoromycota formed one larger monophyletic clade in some (but not all) of their analyses. In contrast, other recent phylogenomic studies by Strassert and Monaghan [52] and Galindo et al. [53] recovered a topology that was similar to Spatafora et al. [6], where the Zoopagomycota were resolved as the sister group to all terrestrial fungi. In many of the studies, the position of Glomeromycotina has been problematic, suggesting that more work will be needed to resolve the placement of this clade [51,54]. One of the greatest debates in early-diverging fungal evolution was the ploidy of the dominant life form given the predominantly haploid nature seen in the Dikarya. One outcome of the analysis of genome sequences of zygomycetes species is that diploids are more common than expected [9,55,56,57]. 3.1. Mucoromycota Mucoromycota comprises many critically important plant symbionts, including the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycotina) [58], Endogonales (Mucoromycotina) [24], “fine root endophytes” (Mucoromycotina) [59], and putative root endophytic species including Mortierella (Mortierellomycotina) [60], Pygmaeomycetaceae (Mucoromycotina) [61], and Umbelopsis (Mucoromycotina) [62]. On the other hand, many fungi within this group are also noted plant pathogens (e.g., Rhizopus microsporus, which causes rice seedling blight, and various Choanephora, Gilbertella, and Mucor species that cause post-harvest rots) as well as numerous species (Actinomucor, Apophysomyces, Cokeromyces, Cunninghamella, Lichtheimia, Mucor, Rhizomucor, Rhizopus, Saksenea, Syncephalastrum) that can cause the disease mucormycosis in humans and other animals [63]. Most zygomycete genomes are of species within Mucoromycota (Figure 1); as a result, much of what we know about genome evolution among early-diverging fungi comes from this phylum. Genome duplication appears to have played a significant role in their evolution, as first described for Rhizopus delemar and Mucor circinelloides [18,64]. Genome sequencing has also revealed a diversity of endobacteria that may be found as symbionts in the Mucoromycota, e.g., in Rhizopus microsporus and Endogone pisiformis (Mucoromycotina), Linnemannia elongata and Mortierella alpina (Mortierellomycotina), and Rhizophagus irregularis (Glomeromycotina) [65,66,67,68,69,70]. Many plant-associated fungal lineages contain endobacteria, but the potential role of these symbionts in the land colonization process remain to be characterized. “Foreign” DNA in the form of diverse mycoviruses has also been frequently detected during genome sequencing of zygomycetes [30,71]. Genomics enabled the systematic study of genome architecture [72,73,74], genetic manipulations [75], and intra-isolate genomic variations [76]. Genome-wide searches and comparisons have also detected evidence for transposon spread through genomes [77,78,79] and uniquely high 6-methyladenine DNA modifications in zygomycete fungi as compared to Dikarya [80]. Studies on metabolic patterns across the fungal kingdom, the search for the mating gene loci and protein families [81,82,83], and the phylogenies of certain taxonomic groups [84,85] have also been conducted using-whole genome sequencing data. Genome-based research has also provided insights into the trophic modes of zygomycete fungi, including the evolution of mycorrhizae [24,86] and commonalities in the pathogenicity of Mucoralean fungi [50,87].3.2. Mucoromycotina Genome sequencing of this subphylum has been the most comprehensive among all the basal fungal lineages although genomes are still unavailable for several genera, including species of Siepmannia, Chlamydoabsidia, and Utharomyces, as well as for two new root-associated species of Pygmaeomyces of the new genus and family Pygmaeomycetaceae [61]. Furthermore, the plant-associated order Endogonales remains highly undersampled despite recent advances [24,88]. Some of its “fine root endophytes” colonize early-diverging plants, and sometimes co-occur with AMF [89,90]. The average genome size in Mucoromycotina species ranges from 35 to 50 Mbp, with species of Umbelopsis at the low end of the spectrum (22–30 Mbp) and Endogonales such as Jimgerdemannia species at the higher end (240 Mbp) (Supplementary Table S1). For some genera, several hundred genomes have already been sequenced. For example, there are >220 genomes available for species of Rhizopus, mostly of R. arrhizus (syn. R. oryzae) and its varieties and synonyms, and of R. microsporus, R. delemar, and R. stolonifer (Supplement Table S1). Rhizopus is increasingly studied as a model organism thanks to its availability in culture collections and to its important role in biotechnology and human health. Genomic information might be helpful for future studies of pathogenicity in Rhizopus species since infections by members of this genus are the leading cause of human mucormycosis [50,84]. Phylogenomic data suggest that species of Rhizopus are part of a well resolved monophyletic group. However, this is in stark contrast to the situation among members of the genus Mucor (>150 genomes), which is incredibly diverse and is likely polyphyletic (Figure 4). The additional Mucoromycotina genomes consist mostly of saprotrophic species that are relevant to human health (species of Lichtheimia and Cunninghamella) and biotechnology (Phycomyces blakesleeanus) [91,92,93]. Genomes of Endogonales (as well as Glomeromycotina) contain effectors to facilitate plant–fungus interactions, which apparently aided in the terrestrialization of Earth by early land plants. Genome information helped to describe and clarify the phylogenetic placement of new lineages and species, such as Bifiguratus [94] and Calcarisporiella [95]. Figure 4.

Mortierellomycotina This subphylum contains an estimated 170 species [96] and was recently circumscribed into 13 monophyletic genera using multi-locus and low-coverage genome sequencing [12]. Reference genome sequences of both low quality and high quality are now available for representatives for most genera, including Actinomortierella, Benniella, Dissophora, Entomortierella, Gamsiella, Gryganskiella, Linnemannia, Lobosporangium, Lunasporangiospora, Mortierella, Necromortierella, Podila, and the sporocarpic genus Modicella [12,97]. A high diversity of Mortierellomycotina species can be isolated from soil, but it appears that genera may differ in their ecological roles. For example, Necromortierella species appear to be necrotrophic, whereas Actinomortierella spp. are often associated with millipedes, and Entomortierella spp. are often associated with arthropods [98]. Many genera, such as Linnemannia and Podila, have been recovered as rhizosphere associates and endophytes of plant roots [99,100], and they appear to improve plant growth and impact flower and seed production [101]. Several species such as Mortierella alpina have been sequenced due to their use in industry and biotechnology for lipid production [102].3.4. Glomeromycotina Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs) are arguably the most common and oldest symbionts of terrestrial plants [58], credited with the role in the facilitation of plant transition to the terrestrial habitat [103]. AMFs supply their plant hosts with mineral nutrients translocated from the soil in return for plant-assimilated carbon [104]. Yet, there are not many genomic sequences of these organisms available due to historical impediments hampering sequencing projects, including multinucleate spores with different genotypes, obligate biotrophy of AMFs, and the initial uncertainty concerning their genome sizes, with conflicting size estimates in Rhizophagus irregularis ranging from 14.1 [105] to 154.8 Mb [106]. Once these obstacles were surmounted, genomic data confirmed that AMFs have unusually large genomes, ranging from 153 Mb in R. irregularis [26] to 773.1 Mb in Gigaspora margarita [107]. This size enhancement relative to other Mucoromycota is driven by lineage-specific expansions of gene families and massive proliferation of transposable elements [26,86,107]. Genomic data also revealed that AMFs display several other features that differentiate them not only from Mucoromycota but also from other fungi. For example, despite the lack of morphological evidence of sexual reproduction, the R. irregularis genome harbors a candidate mating-type locus with two genes encoding homeodomain-like transcription factors [108]. If these homeodomain-like genes indeed control sex, then regulation of the reproductive processes in AMFs would resemble mating in Dikarya rather than in Mucoromycota, which rely on HMG domain proteins for sex determination [109]. Rhizophagus irregularis differs also from other fungi in the organization of its rRNA operons. Instead of being tandemly arrayed as they are in other fungi, the rRNA operons in Glomeromycotina are dispersed individually across the genome [26]. This important discovery put an end to a long-lasting debate on whether intraindividual rRNA gene variation typical for AMFs is distributed among dissimilar nuclei [110] or contained in each nucleus [111], supporting the latter scenario. Lastly, genome-based inferences of metabolic capacity revealed that AMFs lack the gene encoding fatty acid synthase [112,113,114], which makes them obligately dependent on plant hosts for lipids [115,116,117,118]. As in other fastidious organisms, this information is important for devising cultivation strategies that complement fatty acid auxotrophy of AMF [119,120]. Even though accumulation of genomic data for AMF has lagged behind other Mucoromycota, the insights gathered so far have been critical for resolving several puzzles in the biology of these unique organisms. PacBio HiFi and Hi-C sequencing of all available AMF heterokaryons helped to discover the two sets of coexisting homologous chromosomes in one heterokaryon. Genes required for plant colonization were found in gene-sparse, repeat-reach compartments [121]. Another important question that remains to be addressed is which genomic features of AMFs contribute to superior yield outcomes in agronomic crop species, as AMFs do not universally benefit all plant hosts.3.5. Zoopagomycota In contrast to Mucoromycota, most species of Zoopagomycota are parasites or pathogenes of animals and fungi. This includes the insect pathogenic group Entomophthoromycotina (some members of which exhibit behavioral control over their hosts) [122], the Kickxellomycotina that includes a mixture of ecologies (including commensalistic arthropods gut fungi) [15], and Zoopagomycotina, which are parasites of fungi (mainly in Mucoromycota) and microinvertebrates (e.g., amoebae, nematodes, rotifers) [20]. There are also opportunistic human pathogens in this phylum, including species of Basidiobolus and Conidiobolus [123]. Axenic culturing of some fungi in Zoopagomycota is possible [124,125] but extracting high-quality genomic DNA from many species remains difficult. Sometimes there is a need to extract genomic material of the parasite together with the host (often another fungus or insect) and separate their genomes during assembly, which creates additional challenges. Small amounts of available DNA have necessitated the use of single-cell DNA extraction in some cases, especially in species with dramatically reduced vegetative mycelial structures. Much greater success has been achieved for putative saprotrophic fungi such as dung-inhabiting species of Kickxellales (Supplementary Table S1). Genomes and transcriptomes have been used primarily to resolve various evolutionary questions, including the monophyletic origin of Zoopagales [20], evolution of ploidy from a diploid ancestral stage [11], and loss of a large number of pectinases and other plant cell-wall-degrading enzymes in Zoopagomycota [126]. Genome data were also successfully used to resolve evolutionary relationships within particular taxonomic groups, such as Massospora [98], to track other evolutionary events such as horizontal gene transfer events in gut fungi [127], and to reveal the genetic toolbox in insect symbionts [128]. These studies help us to understand the evolutionary trajectories of genome size, namely, a dramatic increase in genome size for the insect pathogens and insect endosymbionts as compared to the genome size in the saprobes and mycoparasites. Genome data have also helped to clarify fundamental differences among Zoopagomycota lineages in their production of secondary metabolites [129], as well as metabolic pathways in general [11]. Mating genetics in this phylum is still not well understood, and that is a question that remains to be addressed with genomic data.3.6. Kickxellomycotina This subphylum contains an interesting mix of mycoparasites (Dimargaritales), putative saprotrophs (Kickxellales), and obligate insect endobionts (Asselariales, Barbatosporales, Harpellales, and Orphellales). The Dimargaritales are similar to mycoparasites in the Zoopagales in that they form penetration hyphae (haustoria) and mostly attack similar host species in the Mucoromycota. In contrast to the Zoopagales mycoparasites, species of Dimargaritales appear to be rare in the environment and have mostly been isolated from dung rather than soil. Recent genomic analyses have also highlighted that members of the Dimargaritales that have larger genomes and more predicted secondary metabolite genes compared to their close relatives [15,129]. Furthermore, single-cell genome data have suggested that Dimargaris cristalligena may be nonhaploid and missing certain enzymes from metabolic pathways (e.g., thiamine biosynthesis and biotin metabolism) [11]. Identifying such genomic features of symbiotic species can provide targets for further experimental tests to understand the molecular interactions between hosts and parasites. On the other hand, the Kickxellales is the only group of Zoopagomycota containing mostly saprotrophic species, and many appear to be rare in the environment, having only been reported in the literature one or a few times. An exception is the genus Coemansia, the species of which are commonly isolated from soil and dung samples [4,130]. Genome sequencing efforts have demonstrated that Kickxellales species have small genomes (less than 40 MB) and variability in their predicted secondary metabolite genes, with Coemansia and Linderina, along with more polyketide synthases than other Kickxellales and D. cristalligena having more nonribosomal peptide synthetases than other Kickxellales [129]. A preliminary rDNA phylogeny showed polyphyly among Kickxellales [130], and a large-scale sequencing project that utilized low-coverage genome data from >100 isolates to test these hypotheses, as well as explore the diversity of Coemansia species, resolved many of these relationships [15]. The gut fungi (Trichomycetes) include arthropod symbionts for which several draft genomes have been available since 2016 [131]. These fungi are distinct from the saprotrophic and coprophilic relatives (i.e., Kickxellales) and belong to four distinct phylogenetic lineages—Asellariales, Barbatosporales, Harpellales, and Orphellales [132]. Asellariales are associated with isopods and spring tails (Collembola) [133]. Species within the three genera (Asellaria, Baltomyces, and Orchesellaria) have been recovered from the both terrestrial and aquatic hosts [133], but their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear, as sequence data have only been obtained from Asellaria [132], and no cultures are available for this group. Harpellales species are usually found in lower Diptera insect larvae and have coevolved with their hosts for over 200 million years [134]. Species of Orphellales are stonefly nymph symbionts with unusual morphological characters (i.e., asexual and sexual spore shapes, and thalli protruding beyond the anus of insect hosts) [135], which cluster together with other Trichomycetes and the Spiromycetales for a sister clade to Kickxellales [15]. Smittium is a well-studied genus within Harpellales with approximately 100 described species [136]. However, there are only nine whole-genome sequences available for these insect gut-dwelling fungi, and all were made from culturable Harpellales species, with the best assembly—Capniomyces stellatus—having 72 scaffolds [131]. Barbatosporales are monotypic, and the single species (Barbatospora ambicaudata) has only been recorded from black fly larvae collected in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, obtained in axenic culture [137]. Although we only have a handful of Harpellales genomes, they have already expanded our knowledge and understanding of these enigmatic microbial fungi in multiple ways. For example, a mosquito-like polyubiquitin gene has been identified in Zancudomyces culisetae (Harpellales), which was presumably acquired via a horizontal gene transfer event [127]. Comparative genomics revealed a fungus–insect symbiotic core gene toolbox (FISCoG) that is shared among the insect-associated fungi (e.g., Harpellales, Basidiobolus, and Conidiobolus) and higher-ranked Hypocreales (Ascomycota). However, the insect pathogens (Hypocreales and Entomophthoromycotina members) tend to have genomes enriched in genes that are useful for pathogenic processes such as the platelet-activating factor acetyl-hydrolase coding genes, whereas the gut commensals have genomes enriched in cell adhesion genes for a successful gut-dwelling lifestyle [128]. In addition, Harpellales genomes also facilitated a kingdom-wide study to confirm the production of selenoproteins in early-diverging fungal lineages [138]. As a major group of early-diverging fungi, representing seven of the nine fungal species that utilize selenoproteins, Harpellales may take the advantages of selenocysteine over cysteine for specific oxidoreductase functions. Unfortunately, no efforts have been successful in obtaining genome information of the Asellariales, Barbatosporales, and Orphellales, which colonize different host types. However, multigene analyses incorporating low-coverage genome data (along with data from Asellariales and Orphellales) suggested an alternate hypothesis for the evolution of fungal–insect associations. Contrary to previous topologies that suggested multiple events [132], the larger dataset showed a possible single origin of gut fungi [15]. Further evolutionary evidence may be identified with the help of their genome sequences to understand how these gut-dwelling microbial fungi interact with various aquatic insect hosts and evaluate the origins of the symbiosis.3.7. Zoopagomycotina Zoopagomycotina species are fascinating, partially due to their cryptic ecological niches and ability to parasitize various hosts such as amoebae, nematodes, rotifers, and other fungi. It is still challenging to culture most of the Zoopagomycotina isolates. Thus, it is not surprising to see that the Zoopagomycotina has the lowest number of available genomes, the qualities of which are not comparable to other lineages, especially the well-sequenced Mucoromycotina. Recently developed single-cell genomic techniques have provided an alternative, culture-independent method to obtain their genomic information [11]. On the basis of single-cell or multiple-cell libraries, the completeness of genome assemblies can be as high as 89.6% (Piptocephalis tieghemiana RSA 1565) [20]. The assembled Zoopagomycotina genomes indicate that this clade of fungi is characterized by small genome size, but the numbers of protein-coding genes are not necessarily low. Some of the genomes can encode close to 10,000 genes (e.g., Zoophagus insidians, a predator of rotifers and nematodes (Supplement Table S1). It seems likely that these completely microscopic fungi are capable of more complicated and yet-to-be identified interactions with their animal and/or fungal hosts, but more work will be needed to explore these interactions. Two additional Zoopagales have remarkably small genomes: a species of Acaulopage (11 Mbp) and a species of Zoopage (14 Mbp). No genomes have yet been published for the following genera: Amoebophilus, Aplectosoma, Bdellospora, Brachymyces, Cystopage, Endocochlus, Euryancale, Helicocephalum, Reticulocephalis, and Sigmoideomyces.3.8. Entomophthoromycotina This lineage remains the most insufficiently sequenced fungal group at the subphylum level. Despite many genomes from the genus Conidiobolus, there are only a few other species (all from the key family Entomophthoraceae) for which genomes are available. The genus Conidiobolus is a polyphyletic assemblage of multiple lineages. This group of Conidiobolus-like fungi was recently phylogenetically divided into three new families, using a combined multi-gene and phylogenomic approach, revealing that the ballistic conidia arose prior to their transition to a parasitic lifestyle [85,139]. Difficulties with culturing and, therefore, obtaining enough high-molecular-weight genomic DNA represent a reason why some species only have transcriptomes available. Alternatively, in some cases, the fungal pathogen is sequenced together with its host, and then the reads are separated bioinformatically. Aside from the polyphyletic genus Conidiobolus and entomophthoroid-like Basidiobolus, genome or transcriptome data are available only for a few species of Entomophaga, Entomophthora, Massospora, Pandora, and Zoophthora. No genomes yet exist for Ancylistes, Apterivorax, Batkoa, Erynia, Eryniopsis, Furia, Macrobiotophthora, Meristacrum, Neozygites, Orthomyces, Tabanomyces, Thaxterosporium, Schizangiella, and Strongwellsea. The largest genomes recovered are over 2000 Mbp in Massospora and 650 Mbp in Zoophthora, with possibly similar genome sizes in Entomophthora and Entomophaga (Supplementary Table S1). Phylogenetic analysis recently demonstrated that Basidiobolus, a genus of amphibian gut-dwelling fungi, does not belong to Entomophthorales, where it was traditionally placed, mostly on the basis of its production of forcibly discharged conidia that are morphologically similar to those in other entomophthoralean fungi [140]. The genus was difficult to place with rDNA data [141], but was inferred either as a separate clade sister to the Mucoromycota [51] or as the earliest diverging lineage within Zoopagomycota [128], on the basis of phylogenomic data. The ballistic spore dispersal mechanism, which differs structurally from that found in the Entomophthorales, is likely an example of convergent evolution among fungi that appear to be similar but are distantly related. In addition to being evolutionarily enigmatic, the genomes of B. meristosporus and B. heterosporus are larger than most other basal fungi and contained a much higher proportion of secondary metabolite-encoding genes than other Zoopagomycota species that have been studied thus far. Furthermore, Basidiobolus genomes contain numerous genes that putatively originated from horizontal gene transfer events from bacteria [129].4. Insights from Genomics 4.1. Adaptation to Terrestrial Life Inferred from Genomes The transition to a terrestrial environment placed novel constraints on species of early-diverging fungi, especially in terms of their resistance to desiccation and solar radiation. Genomes have been essential to studying which zygomycete genes made this transition possible. Sensing of and response to light have been explored in the model Mucorales species Phycomyces blakesleeanus. Mutants impaired in photoresponses, especially phototropism, were isolated as reported in the 1970s [142]. However, the first genes related to photoresponses were not reported until 2006 [143]. These were identified using a candidate gene approach in which P. blakesleeanus was assumed to have similar blue light sensors as the Dikarya species [143,144], wherein a two-protein complex was first identified in Neurospora crassa, defining a sensing and signaling system that uses a light-sensing domain coupled to transcription factor roles for signal transmission. With the release of the P. blakesleeanus genome sequence in 2010, identifying a candidate gene for madB as encoding the interacting protein was achieved using BLAST against the genome sequence [145]. The genome sequence was performed along with that of M. circinelloidies and revealed an expansion of this pair of genes required for light responses (3–4 copies of each). Being able to make targeted gene mutations in M. circinelloides of these homologs, as based of genome sequence information, provided a clear example of subfunctionalization after gene duplication [146]. The identification of the mutations in madI and madC mutants in P. blakesleeanus used traditional genetic mapping with molecular markers derived from the comparison of the genomes between two strains. With the regions narrowed, candidate genes could be identified and confirmed by sequencing [64,147]. These genes play conserved roles in photobiology in the Dikarya species, suggesting that this innovation for terrestrial life had already evolved in early-diverging fungal lineages. For instance, phenotypic analysis of the P. blakesleeanus madA and madB mutants indicated that this pair of genes has a conserved function in protecting fungi from harmful ultraviolet light [148]. In addition to responding to light, many Mucorales species can sense gravity. This has been correlated with the formation of vacuolar crystals in P. blakesleeanus [149]. Through purification of such crystals, followed by mass spectrometry of the associated proteins using the mass database derived from the genome sequence, the OCTIN protein was identified. A gravity-insensitive mutant had a mutation within the corresponding gene. Remarkably, phylogenetic comparison revealed that the origin of the gravity-sensing gene OCTIN in the Mucorales was most likely via a horizontal gene transfer from a bacterial species [150]. Other challenges associated with terrestrial life, such as fluctuations in temperature and desiccation, have yet to explored from a genomic standpoint among zygomycetes. Some of the early diverging lineages such as Glomeromycotina and Mortierellomycotina lack ergosterol, what can increase their membrane stiffness [77,112]. Ergosterol has long been considered as one of the regulators of dry–wet cycles [151].4.2. Endobacteria Symbiotic associations with highly coevolved endocellular bacteria stand out among the most prominent features differentiating Mucoromycota from other fungi, including the Dikarya [152,153,154]. Thus far, most of these endosymbionts have been identified as representatives of two bacterial families, Burkholderiaceae and Mycoplasmataceae. While some of the Mucoromycota associations with bacteria are mutually beneficial for both partners, in others, the fungi appear to be negatively impacted by their endosymbionts. The application of “omics” tools has been essential in elucidating the molecular underpinnings of the mutualism between Glomeromycotina and their ancient and uncultivable endosymbiont “Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum” (CaGg, Burkholderiaceae) [155]. In this symbiosis, CaGg improves hyphal proliferation in the presymbiotic growth stage of the host fungus [156], which can be attributed to endobacteria-mediated reprograming of the fungal metabolism [157,158]. “Omics” approaches were also critical in understanding the biology and devising a cultivation strategy for Mycoavidus cysteinexigens (Burkholderiaceae) [159], a cysteine auxotroph and ancient antagonistic endosymbiont of Mortierellomycotina [69,160,161]. Comparative genomics also revealed that “Candidatus Mycoavidus necroximicus” produces several nematocidal metabolites that protect the fungal host Mortierella verticillata from feeding by nematodes [162]. Endobacteria have also been shown to regulate and control mating and asexual reproduction in Rhizopus microsporus [163], produce toxins (rhizoxin) that enable pathogenicity on plants, and provide protection from predators [164], as well as potentially protect fungal spores from the human immune system via anti-phagocyte activity [165]. The ease of partner manipulation in the mutualism between R. microsporus and Mortierellaceae (Mucoromycotina) and Mycetohabitans spp. (formerly Burkholderia) [166,167] elevated this association to a model system for studying fungal-bacterial symbioses [163,168]. While the symbioses of Mucoromycota with Burkholderiaceae endobacteria are well characterized for some species, Mucoromycota associations with Mycoplasmataceae, referred to as Mollicutes- or mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MREs) [169,170], are only beginning to be unraveled. MREs have been detected in all three subphyla of Mucoromycota: Glomeromycotina [169], Mortierellomycotina [171], and Mucoromycotina [24,172]. MREs of Glomeromycotina are classified as “Candidatus Moeniiplasma glomeromycotorum” (CaMg) [173]. Genomic features of CaMg have been examined in depth [66,174], including evidence of gene acquisition from fungal hosts. However, the role of CaMg in the biology of Glomeromycotina remains uncertain. Naito et al. [174] speculated that CaMg is an antagonist of Glomeromycotina. If this is confirmed, then CaMg would resemble the lifestyle of the MREs associated with Mortierellomycotina [171]. Moreover, bacterial–fungal interactions seem to be much more common and diverse than previously thought [175], and Mucoromycota representatives are no exception. Telagathoti et al. [176] showed recently that 30% of Mortierellales isolates were associated with different groups of bacteria. Another survey of Mucoromycota cultures from soil indicated diverse Paraburkholderia-related sequences detected with 20% frequency from Mortierella and Umbelopsis strains [154]. The ecological meaning of these interactions remains to be described. Outside of the Mucoromycota, however, the importance or prevalence of endosymbiotic bacteria remains less clear. Despite bacterial sequences always present in the environmental samples of entomophthoralean fungi (A.P. Gryganskyi, personal observation), nothing is known about their connection to the entomopathogens and their role in pathogenic processes that impact insects. However, six recently constructed metagenome assemblies of four various bacterial species in connection with Massospora cicadina might indicate their symbiotic relationship to this entomopathogenic species [177]. Among Zoopagomycotina, Davis et al. [20] detected 16S sequences with close matches to Mycoavidus cysteinexexigens in the genome of Stylopage hadra (nematode parasitic fungus). A recent genomic assessment of Kickxellomycotina fungi did not reveal any obvious colonization by endosymbiotic bacteria [15], suggesting that these bacterial associations might be less important or prevalent in Zoopagomycota than in Mucoromycota.4.3. Secretomes, Gene Clusters, and Secondary Metabolites All fungi explore and exploit their environment by secreting various substances. The secretome composition of basal fungal lineages was shaped by diversification early in their evolution. Characterization of secretome compositions of 132 zygomycete genomes revealed that current trophic mode plays a less significant role as compared to the phylogenetic relationships of the fungi [178]. This is in part because Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota each had their own unique lineage-specific expansion of secreted digestive enzymes, according to their historical substrate differences and their different evolutionary trajectories [178]. Genomic screenings of available genomes for novel natural compounds also show promising potential [179,180,181]. These screenings discovered the presence of gene clusters harboring polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptides, terpenoids, and L-tryptophan dimethylallyl transferases with transcription factor coding genes in proximity to some of the gene clusters. Since then, NRPS clusters have been detected in some Mortierellomycotina and Mucoromycotina. For example, the mycelium of Mortierella alpina produces diverse novel compounds [182]. Similarly, the transcripts corresponding to PKS and NRPS were recently described in transcriptomes of five Mucor species [183]. Mucor circinelloides was shown to produce carotenoids and terpenoids [180], and the genes associated with terpene biosynthesis were identified recently in Mucor and Rhizopus genomes [74]. Siderophore production has been reported from Glomus [184], Apophysomyces [185], Rhizopus [186], and Basidiobolus [129]. Rhizoferrin from Rhizopus delemar has been further characterized and showed a glycosylation pattern [187] that was classified as a member of the sodium (Na)–iodide symporter gene family [186]. The best-studied compound isolated from early diverging fungi is an antimitotic agent called rhizoxin produced by an endosymbiotic bacterium (Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica) and encoded by a huge NRPS–PKS cluster [166]. The genome of amphibian gut symbiont Basidiobolus is enriched with the genes and gene clusters involved in the production of secondary metabolites through horizontal gene transfer from bacteria [129]. Genomes of mycoparasitic Dimargaritales (Kickxellomycotina) are also enriched for secondary metabolites [15], especially when compared to mycoparasitic Zoopagomycotina (Piptocephalis and Syncephalis) whose genomes appear depauperate in these genes [129]. These groups of mycoparasites are very similar in their morphology and ecology; thus, the reasons underpinning the observed difference in metabolite genes remain unclear.4.4. Transposable Elements Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant in zygomycete genomes [79]. Genomes of Entomophtorales, Basidiobolales [129], and Endogonales [24] are particularly rich in TEs, while species of Umbelopsidales [188] and Zoopagomycotina [11] have very few. Genomes of Rhizopus species comprised approximately 40% repetitive sequences with only ~10% potentially active elements [84]. In taxa with more compact genomes such as Umbelopsis isabellina, transposons account for as little as 5% of their genome size. In contrast, Jimgerdemannia flammicorona can have more than 77% of its genome occupied by repetitive elements and transposons [24]. In most of the analyzed genomes, long terminal repeat retrotransposons from the Ty3/Gypsy family dominate the TE landscape [84]. Mucoromycotina, Kickxellomycotina, and Blastocladiomycota possess transposons with a tyrosine recombinase from a gene family which seem to be lost in Dikarya [78]. While the function of mobile elements in zygomycete genomes is not well understood, in Ascomycota, large mobile elements (termed “starships”) may carry a variety of genes (e.g., secondary metabolites, virulence factors, and heavy-metal tolerance) and contribute to the overall variation in genome structure [189,190].5. Conclusions There has been renewed research interest in the zygomycete fungi during the last decade, and this is reflected in the rapidly increasing number of genome sequences from this group of fungi. While the quality of the genomes varies according to the sequencing platform and starting materials available, the genomes are sufficient for phylogenomic reconstructions, as well as for the discovery of functional genes and gene clusters of interest. Much of the work has focused on several key topics, including the evolution and phylogeny of the group, adaptation, and transition to a terrestrial habitat (e.g., light and gravity sensors, and reinforcement of cell-wall structure to tolerate a nonaquatic environment), genome duplication, endosymbionts and horizontal gene transfer, genome architecture, pathogenicity, and coevolution with host species. The number of genomes has grown rapidly over the past decade, and we expect that the next decade will bring increased taxon sampling (e.g., new genomes for taxa that have not yet been sampled) and improvements in genome quality due to advances in long-read sequencing technologies and bioinformatics approaches. In the future, we expect that genomic analyses of these fungi will take new directions, including a detailed comparison of the genomes of aquatic vs. terrestrial lineages, structural studies, a comparison of the zygomycete vs. Dikarya genomes, experimental manipulations of host/parasite interactions to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning pathogenesis, and building links among genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data.Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms11071830/s1: Supplementary Table S1.

    "title": "The interaction of vortical flows with red cells in venous valve mimics.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8896891/",
    "abstract": "Abstract The motion of cells orthogonal to the direction of main flow is of importance in natural and engineered systems. The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing microfluidic devices. Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.",

Copyright notice ID: 8896891 PMID: 35282036 Abstract The motion of cells orthogonal to the direction of main flow is of importance in natural and engineered systems. The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing microfluidic devices. Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.INTRODUCTION Red blood cells (RBCs) or erythrocytes are the most abundant cells in blood with 5 × 109 cells/ml accounting for 40%–50% (known as hematocrit or HCT) by volume in a healthy individual. RBCs are highly deformable, and the unique deformability characteristics of a RBC are key in the fluid and mass transport processes in the vasculature.1 Although RBCs have mostly been appreciated in the context of tissue oxygenation, ischemia, and vaso-occlusion, several epidemiological studies have detected varying associations between hematocrit levels and thrombosis.2–5 The RBC composition in the blood clots depends on local flow rates—venous thrombi, which are typically associated with low flow conditions or blood stasis, are richer in red cells than arterial thrombi, which are typically associated with high flow conditions.6 In addition, flow-induced hemolysis and device-related thrombosis are causal to complications associated with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenators (ECMOs).7 Therefore, it is important to understand how blood flow dictates local RBC distribution. Numerous and excellent experimental and computational studies have investigated the role of RBC concentration, deformability, shape, and hydrodynamic interactions, mostly in straight, stenosed, or bifurcating channels in the context of hemostasis or thrombosis.8–13 However, relatively little effort has been expended in understanding blood flows inside a cavity or a sudden expansion, which is of relevance to flows in artificial devices (LVADs and ECMOs) and physiological systems (aortic aneurysms and venous valves). Of interest, a growing body of evidence points to the important contribution of RBCs in the pathophysiology of venous thrombosis.14,15 Venous thrombosis (VT) originates in the sinuses of venous valves, which are layered flaps in peripheral veins that prevent the backflow of blood.16 The venous valve sinuses are regions of low flow, and flow stasis in the valve sinus is long considered to be a major factor triggering venous thrombosis.17–19 The presence of a large cavity immediately distal to sudden expansion gives rise to unique flow patterns in the venous valve sinuses as observed in ex vivo fixed valves,20 in vivo ultrasound studies,21 and in vitro biomimetic valves.22,23 Experimental flow visualization studies show that these unique flow patterns due to sudden expansion result in differential RBC distribution in the distal pockets vs the center of the channel.24,25 However, there is insufficient information how these flow patterns determine RBC transport and local hematocrit distribution in the venous valve sinuses. This information on the interaction of recirculating flows with red cells can also be valuable for the growing interest in predicting thrombotic risks from patient-specific flow patterns determined by the vessel geometry. In this work, we seek to determine experimentally the effect of venous valve hydrodynamics on local RBC distribution. Using microfluidics, micro-particle image velocimetry (μPIV), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and microscopy, we resolve the impact of local velocity fields and shear rates on RBC distributions in venous valve mimics. We use a dilute suspension of RBCs so that the individual cells could be discriminated without overcrowding, minimizing the confinement effects in the scale-down microfluidic model, and the role of fluid–cell interactions in RBC distribution may be studied without the confounding effects of cell–cell interactions that are prominent at physiological hematocrit levels.26 From the images of RBC distribution at various flow rates, we demonstrate that the local RBC concentrations in the valve sinuses are dramatically different from bulk flow due to vortical flows in the sudden expansion. We also determine the minimum shear rates necessary to drive the RBCs into the vortex and show that entrapment leads to a long residence time.METHODS The experimental system consisted of an infusion pump for positive pressure driven flow through the microfluidic chip, which was mounted on a microscope objective for the visualization of both RBC distribution and μPIV (Fig. 1). The dimensions of the microfluidic channels are designed to mimic venous valves that are partially closed, leading to sudden expansion, and the channel Reynolds number (Re) was matched with what has been reported previously in in vivo flows.20,27 FIG. 1. Open in a new tab Schematic of the full experimental setup used for RBC distribution and μPIV measurements. The cutout window shows the microfluidic geometry, including the 30–300 μm with a valve angle of 135°. The white arrow indicates the direction of flow. RBC or bead suspension was perfused through the device at constant pressure using a syringe pump and analyzed either by microscopy or by μPIV, respectively. When acquiring bright field images for RBC distribution measurements, the laser and synchronizer were not used; the high-speed camera took direct images of the flow device.Microfluidic device A microfluidic device was designed to mimic venous valves using CAD software (AutoCAD, San Rafael, CA).50 To simulate the sudden expansion in the valves, the main channel suddenly expands from a narrow constriction of 30 to 300 μm. The walls of the valve pockets are angled at 135° relative to the direction of flow. The design was printed on a bright field mask, and using this mask, a silicon wafer was fabricated by soft lithography. A wafer was coated with SU-8 2035 to create a mold with a height of 35 μm. The mold was salinized with 95%–100% trichlorosilane (Gelest, Morrisville, PA) to preserve the design and prevent adhesion to the elastomer. The silicone base (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) was mixed with the curing agent at a ratio of 10:1 by weight to create polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Dow Corning, Midland, MI). The solution was poured onto the wafer and cured for 2.25 h at 90 °C (Precision Oven, Model 658, Thermo Scientific). The required design was cut and the inlet and outlet holes were punched using a 1 -mm biopsy punch (Miltex, York, PA). The PDMS designs were sonicated in a bath sonicator (Model 75HT, LabX) for 10 min at room temperature in 35% ethanol solution to remove any debris. They were then rinsed in DI water and left to dry for 1 h at 90 °C. After cooling, PDMS and the microscope glass slide (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were activated by exposure to oxygen plasma (Basic Plasma Cleaner, Model PDC-32G, Harrick Plasma). These surfaces were immediately pushed together firmly to create an airtight seal. The chips were left to cure for 2 h at 90 °C to make the binding irreversible. The chips were prepared 24 h before the experiment to provide enough time for hydrophilic decay of PDMS to baseline levels.Cell preparation Venous blood was freshly drawn from healthy volunteers after signing an informed consent and obtaining written ethics approval in accordance with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol (IRB F16134, Office of Research, SJSU). The red blood cells (RBCs) were separated from whole blood by spinning at 250 RCF with 7 acceleration and no breaks for 25 min at 22 °C (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The top plasma layer and the middle buffy coat were discarded. A dilute RBC suspension at a desired hematocrit concentration was prepared by diluting the appropriate volume of RBCs in a modified PBS buffer at physiological pH. This modified PBS buffer consisted of 1% dextrose and 0.5% BSA to prevent fast settling and nonspecific aggregation, respectively; and this was filtered using a 0.22-micron filter (Millipore PES Membrane) to remove dust and reduce clogging of the channel. The chip was primed right before running the experiment with 0.1% F-127 (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) diluted in PBS. Once the buffer and PDMS device were prepared, the diluted RBC suspension was mixed gently with a pipette and drawn into a syringe using a 21 G needle, a 750 μm ID tube to keep the seal tight and connect the needle to the inlet of the chip. Flow rates of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 ml/min corresponding to the Reynolds numbers of 0.6, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, respectively, were used. All flow conditions were allowed to stabilize for 1 min before commencing the video recording.Image acquisition The RBC movement within the microfluidic channel was monitored with a 20× objective/aperture 7 (Leica Dmi8 and LAS-X). Microscope settings also included 255 brightness intensity. The images were captured using a high-speed camera (Phantom VEO 410-L). The images were captured at 10 068 fps at a resolution of 1024 × 512 with an exposure time of 1 μs. The RBC distribution was averaged from 100 ms duration of frames for lower Re and from 10 ms duration of frames for higher Re.Image analysis The images were analyzed offline using ImagePro 10 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD). Using inbuilt background subtraction and contrast enhancement algorithms, the RBCs were isolated from the background based on an intensity histogram. Using a custom MATLAB code, each image was binarized. To quantify RBC distribution from the binarized images, the images were divided into zones using grids 15.19 × 20.21 μm2. The percentage of white pixels was calculated for each grid; these numbers were the 2D area density at that grid location. These values corresponded to specific HCT values on the calibration curve relating area density to HCT. μPIV experiments and analysis μPIV image acquisition To trace fluid streamlines, we used micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (μPIV). Red fluorescent beads of 1 μm (Dyed Red Aqueous trace fluid streamlinesFluorescent Particles, Thermo Scientific) were used as tracer particles. The stock solution was sonicated and vortexed before preparing a 1:20 dilution of the working solution, corresponding to a final concentration of 0.05% w/v. The optical system was coupled with Nd: YAG double-pulse (YAG200-15-QTL) with an emission wavelength of 532 nm and a synchronizer (LaserPulse Model 610036). This μPIV system was controlled using Insight 4G software (TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN). The images were obtained at a repetition rate between 2500 and 18 754 Hz to obtain optimal images for further analysis. During acquisition, an in situ point processing was performed as a quick check to ensure that the PIV image pair obtained had suitable Δt and adequate spot size. It was also necessary to verify that the particle displacement lies within the interrogation region for one spot analysis by using the quick point processing tool. This analysis compares the signal-to-noise ratio to the threshold. μPIV image analysis The detailed image analysis was performed offline, and it consisted of three steps: (1) Pre-processing: The quality of the image was improved by using image subtraction and removing noise using a minimum intensity operator; (2) Processing: A static mask was drawn as a boundary around the walls of the channel. The correlation between two spots was obtained using Fast Fourier Transform, and the image match within a displacement range was provided using the correlation function for each pixel. The peaks in the correlation values were obtained using the Gaussian peak function to determine the displacement of the particles within the spot pair. This information, along with Δt between the two frames, was used to calculate the vector direction and magnitude; (3) Post-processing: The data obtained were further processed to remove sporadic vectors using the vector validation process. The validation pipeline involved the use of a reference vector in global validation, local validation, and vector conditioning. The reference vector was calculated using the median of the 5 × 5 neighborhood vectors. The difference between the vector velocities was used as tolerance to remove invalid vectors. Then, the removed vectors were replaced with the local median values. Global vector validation applied a range filter to the whole vector field, which was then used to eliminate vectors with a velocity magnitude outside the user-defined range. The spaces in the vector field due to failed SNR were filled using the local mean of the 3 × 3 neighborhood. Vector smoothing was performed by replacing them with a Gaussian-weighted mean of the vectors in a 3 × 3 neighborhood. Computational fluid dynamic software was used for visualization and presentation of the data (Tecplot 360, Bellevue, WA).Computational fluid dynamics A computational fluid dynamics study was performed to simulate flow behavior in the channels using COMSOL Multiphysics software (Version 5.5). The simulations were performed in 3D geometry. The material properties of water were used for the simulations. Since the bead suspension was dilute (0.05%), it was assumed that these particles do not impact the streamlines. No slip condition was applied at the walls, and normal flow and suppressed backflow were set at the outlet. Automatic meshing yielded a total of 589 105 domain elements, 78 386 boundary elements, and 2901 edge elements. Water was perfused through the channel at the flow rates corresponding to the experimental values, and the Navier–Stokes equations were solved with flow boundary conditions. The local velocities and streamlines were computed to compare with the experimental results.Statistical analysis All experiments were performed at least three independent times on different days, and each experiment was performed using at least two different channels. RBC experiments were performed on different days with blood drawn from three to six different donors. The data were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test to establish significance. A P < 0.05 was deemed as a statistically significant difference.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Visualization of local hematocrit in the channel We perfused a 5% hematocrit (HCT) suspension through the valve at the channel Reynolds (Re) numbers of 0.6, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24. The Re was calculated as Re=Wvρ/μ, where W is the channel height, v is the average velocity, and ρ and μ are the fluid density and dynamic viscosity, respectively. For a femoral vein of ∼6 mm diameter, these Re numbers correspond to a wall shear rate of ∼10–400 s−1. The diameters of, and flow velocities in, the femoral and saphenous veins are of the order of 0.5–12 mm and 1–40 cm/s, respectively, and varies depending on the posture.20,27,28 Therefore, the Re in venous flow is of the order of 1–75, which is comparable to our experimental system. RBC distributions, visualized by brightfield microscopy, are shown in Fig. S1 in the supplementary material. In order to quantify these qualitative observations from the images, we prepared a calibration curve to map the image data to hematocrit estimations. To this end, in a separate experiment, for various hematocrits ranging between 0.1% and 20%, images of slowly moving RBCs were collected, and the intensity of the RBCs over the background was quantified. As shown in Fig. S2 in the supplementary material, the pixel intensities linearly correlated between 0.1% and 15% and saturated as the hematocrit was increased beyond 15%. Based on this calibration, relating 2D pixel densities to 3D hematocrit values, we computed the local hematocrit throughout the channel at different Re numbers (Fig. 2), with the color scale shown on the right corresponding to the hematocrit value obtained from the calibration curve. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Heat maps showing the RBC distribution for different Reynolds numbers as indicated (a)–(f). The black arrows indicate the direction of flow in the channel marked with dashed lines at the indicated Reynolds numbers. The color scale on the right depicts the hematocrit obtained by matching RBC distributions shown in Fig. S1 in the supplementary material, with the calibration curve shown in Fig. S2 in the supplementary material. The arrows at Re = 12 highlight the presence of RBCs in vortices.Figure 2 shows local hematocrit distributions that result from flowing a feed solution of 5% hematocrit through the venous valve with the Re numbers of 0.6, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24. At low Re (Re = 0.6, 3, and 6), hematocrit distribution was uniform through most of the channel at a value comparable to that of feed hematocrit [Figs. 2(a)–2(c)]. The actual values vary slightly on either side of 5% because the suspension is dilute and the averaging process during image analysis. The asymmetry observed particularly at Re = 0.6 is due to the inevitable settling of RBCs at near zero flow rates. At these Re numbers (Re = 0.6, 3, and 6), no RBCs were seen in the valve sinus regions, which are the angled wing regions behind the sudden expansion. However, as the flow rate was increased, at Re = 12, an RBC vortex on either side of the main flow appeared. The vortex comprised less than ten cells on each side of the channel entering the valve sinus regions from the main channel flow. These vortices correspond to a local hematocrit of <2%. At Re = 18 and 24, the RBC density increased in the vortex regions significantly compared with that of Re = 12. We observed that the local hematocrit levels in the vortices increased more than the feed hematocrit levels to ∼8% at Re = 18, which increased to as high a value as closer to 15% at Re = 24.RBC distribution profiles To compare the RBC distributions at different Re numbers and different locations along the channel, we quantified the RBC distribution along the cross sections at three locations, at the entrance (140 μm before the constriction), at the expansion (70 μm after the constriction), and at the exit (380 μm after the constriction) (Fig. 3). At the entrance to the channel, the positions of the RBCs were similar at all Re numbers, with the maximum hematocrit of ∼6% right in the middle of the channel. At the exit, the positions of the RBCs at all Re numbers, except the highest (Re = 18 and 24), show similar plateau shapes. This represents a fully developed flow at the exit that has an even distribution of RBCs across the width of the channel. At Re = 18 and 24, the distributions differ from those at lower Re by remaining flat through the channel cross section, indicating flow that is still developing at the exit location. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab Hematocrit profiles along the microchannel. (a) Hematocrit distributions across the channel cross section were estimated at the indicated locations entry (−140 μm from constriction), expansion (+70 μm from constriction), and exit locations (+380 μm from constriction). (b) Local hematocrit was estimated at these locations for a feed of 5% hematocrit and represented as mean ±SEM (n = 3–6).The RBC distributions near the expansion of the channel (blue line) capture the transition in distributions that occur with the increase in Re. We observe that at a low Re of 0.6, nearing creeping flows, the RBC distribution is fully developed ∼50 μm after exiting the constriction, resulting in a distribution at the expansion that matches that of exit [Fig. 3(b)]. As the Re is increased to 6 and 12, the RBC distribution width at the expansion resembles that of the entry more than the exit (narrow distribution at the entry vs wide distribution at the exit). At these Re numbers (6 and 12), the flow is no more creeping, and the effects of the expansion are carried further downstream, and hence, the cells are concentrated in a ∼100 μm region at the center of the channel. As the Re is increased further to 18 and 24, we observe a sudden increase in the RBC concentrations in the expansion region (blue line). Unlike at Re = 0.6 or 12 where RBC distribution along the cross section was uniform, the distributions at Re = 18 and 24 showed non-uniform patterns. At Re = 18, the distributions ranged between 3% and 9%, while at Re = 24, the maximum hematocrit was ∼12%, which was almost double the hematocrit at the center of the channel. The local decrease and increase in hematocrit levels are well visualized in the heatmap distributions shown in Figs. 2(e) and 2(g). Feed or bulk hematocrit is operationally used to define the effects of RBCs on the formation and properties of venous thrombi.14 Emerging evidence shows that RBCs directly modulate thrombosis through several mechanisms, including thrombin generation, platelet activation, and clot strength.15 Our results from Figs. 2 and 3 show that the valve hematocrit is higher than the bulk hematocrit. It is likely that the difference in hematocrit between the vortex and the bulk flow observed in dilute suspension in this work will be more pronounced at physiological levels: for instance, a feed hematocrit of 25% has a greater RBC concentration than the feed near the channel walls in a sudden expansion when compared with a feed of 5% hematocrit.25,29 Therefore, local hematocrit rather than bulk hematocrit should be taken into consideration while evaluating the effects of RBCs on venous thrombosis.Entrapment of RBCs in vortices As described in Figs. 2 and 3, RBC vortices were observed at Re = 12, 18, and 24. We observed from high speed video microscopy (Movie M1 in the supplementary material) that, at a steady state, the RBCs remained within the vortex region for the entire duration of the analysis (2–5 s, at a frame rate of 10 068 fps). As a representative analysis of vortex dynamics, we tracked the position and velocities of individual RBCs in the vortex at Re = 18. Figure 4(a) shows the position and velocity magnitudes of cells in the outer, middle, and inner limit cycles of the vortex region. These trajectories and instantaneous RBC velocities were obtained by frame-by-frame tracking of the centroid of single cells. As Fig. 4(a) shows, at the bottom of the vortex, as the cells travel with the jetting stream, the velocity is as high as 1000 μm/s, and at the top of the vortex and closer to the wall, the velocities drop to as low as 10–20 μm/s in the direction opposite to the main flow. Between these velocity changes, the RBCs decelerate when they travel toward the wall and accelerate when they join the forward flow. The near zero velocities of the RBCs close to the wall may have consequences in modulating the interaction and adhesion to the endothelial lining of the blood vessels. This analysis shows that RBCs, once entrapped in the vortices, follow their limit cycles with a long residence time. The average hematocrit in the vortices increased linearly and rapidly with increasing the Re beyond Re = 12 [Fig. 4(b)]. We also quantified the total RBCs that are trapped in the vortices by summing up over the entire vortex region at each Re. At a Re below 6, this value was nearly zero but increased rapidly at a higher Re due to an increase in both the hematocrit and the size of the vortex: at Re = 12, 18, and 24, the total RBCs were 10.2 ± 5.3, 75.1 ± 12.1, and 140.1 ± 5.3, respectively. FIG. 4. Open in a new tab RBCs in vortical flows. (a) Trajectories and velocities of RBCs within the vortices at Re = 18. The centroid of RBCs in the vortices was tracked frame by frame at 10 068 fps, and their velocities were computed. The RBCs were seen to be in continuous motion upon entering the vortices and followed a limit cycle. The data are based on the average of five RBCs for each limit cycle; (b) average of local HCT within the vortex during steady circulation in vortical flows, obtained by summing over local hematocrits in the vortices, represented as mean ± SD (n = 3–6, *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01).Development of microflows and vortices with increase in Re To understand the RBC distribution in vortex flows at Re = 12, 18, and 24, and an anomalous increase in hematocrit levels at Re = 18 and 24, we sought to analyze the flow patterns in the channels that drive the RBC movement. Fluorescent beads were used to track the flow patterns independent of and distinct from RBC distribution patterns. μPIV was used to obtain the velocity profiles from bead locations captured using high speed video microscopy. We visualized and quantified streamlines through the channels at Re = 3, 6, 12, and 18, noting that no RBC vortices were seen at Re = 3 and 6. In Fig. 5, we show the streamlines and vorticity computed from μPIV analysis at these four Re numbers. At a low Re (Re = 3), a small amount of backflow was detected in the valve pockets (velocity on the order of 10−3 m/s compared with 10−2 m/s in the main channel). As the Re increased to 6, 12, and 18, we observed an increase in the separation of the streamlines, and more backflow into the valve pockets was seen. FIG. 5. Open in a new tab Streamlines and vorticity distribution in vortical flows. From the μPIV measurements of instantaneous velocities, streamlines and vorticities were computed at the indicated locations at the various Re numbers (a)–(d). RBC distributions from high speed imaging are also shown. The images show that although there is a significant vorticity as seen at Re = 3 and 6, the recirculation of RBCs does not begin until the Reynolds number reaches 12. The point of flow separation advances downstream with an increase in Re. At Re = 12 and 18, particle tracking was possible only at locations where the flows were not too high.To quantify the location of flow separation leading to backflows, we computed the vorticity throughout the channel from the local velocity vectors estimated by μPIV using the equation ω=∇×v. The vorticity distribution is shown as a heat map overlay on the streamlines in Fig. 5. At Re = 3, we observe small microvortices at the entrance to the channel. At Re = 6, the strength of the vortices increases twofold and the location of flow separation moves further downstream. At higher Re (=12 and 18), the strength of the vortices increases further by several folds, and the point of flow separation is pushed further downstream from the entrance. However, the extremely high flow velocities closer to the center of the channel precluded particle tracing at these locations. The presence of fluid vortices without any RBC at Re = 3 and 6 suggests that other blood components may be transported into the venous valve sinuses. Unlike other studies where RBCs were used to follow fluid streamlines, in this work, the fluid vortices were tracked with smaller particles of size similar to that of platelets (1 μm) and stiffer than the RBCs. Our observation at Re = 3 and 6 implies that while RBCs may not enter the valve pockets at these low flow rates, smaller platelets may preferentially enter the valve regions. Computational and experimental studies have shown the margination of platelets driven by cell–cell collision or volume exclusion, wherein more deformable RBCs drive less deformable platelets toward the wall.24,30,31 Our results show that platelet margination can be a flow-driven phenomenon by transport along the streamlines and can happen independent of volume exclusion or due to collisions with RBCs.22,32,33Flow separation results in atypical wall shear stress The presence of forward and reversing velocity profiles due to flow separation shown in Fig. 5 suggests that there are regional variations in shear stress on channel walls. The shear rate distribution is computed from the velocity vectors, using the equation εxy=1/2(∂v/∂x+∂u/∂y), where u and v are instantaneous local velocities in the x and y directions, respectively. Based on the μPIV measurements, we estimated the shear stresses along the outer walls at the various Re numbers (Fig. 6). At a low Re, Re = 0.6 (orange line), the wall shear rates are low due to unidirectional creeping flows. At Re = 3 and 6, the flow separation and vortices result in a stagnation point [as shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)], and the wall experiences both flow reversal and forward flow. Correspondingly, the wall shear stress shows a non-monotonic profile with zero shear stress stagnation point at a location less than one channel width (∼200 μm). As the Re was increased further to Re = 12 and 18 (green and gray), the large backflow near the wall resulted in a high reverse shear stress at the wall, with the stagnation point moving further downstream. These data suggest that even at Re as low as 3, the walls may experience reversal of shear stress. Such regional variations in wall shear stresses may have important consequences on endothelial mechanotransduction and hence on its phenotype. Low flows in the venous valve region drive endothelial cells to a low grade inflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype. This phenotype supports the adhesion of monocytes, which, in turn, is a rich source of tissue factor and initiation of intrinsic pathway of coagulation.34 The hypoxia induced by low flows may also play a role in initiating thrombus development due to its effects on endothelial cells.35 FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Wall shear rate distribution. The shear rate distributions near the wall in the recirculation regions were obtained from the μPIV measurements of instantaneous velocities at the indicated Re. For the chosen coordinate system, on the right wall, the shear rates are negative for forward flows and positive for reverse flows; and zero shear indicates stagnation point. The data are mean and SEM (n = 3).Estimation of threshold shear rates that drive RBC distribution in valve pockets using μPIV and 3D CFD simulations Since no RBCs were seen in the vortices till Re = 12, the cell trajectories do not follow the fluid streamlines in the vortex. When Re < 12, the cells do not cross streamlines to enter the vortices, suggesting that only at Re = 12, the energy necessary to drive the RBCs from the main flow to the vortex is realized. In a bounded Poiseuille flow, particles migrate toward the wall and occupy an equilibrium position due to the balance between the shear-gradient-induced lift force, which pushes the particles toward the wall, drag force due to the motion, deformation-induced lift force, and the wall-effect-induced lift force due to the wall, which act in the opposite direction, pushing the cells away from the wall.36 For straight channel flows with a rigid particle, the shear-gradient-induced lift force expression is given as FL=CρG2a4, where C, ρ, G,anda are the lift coefficient, fluid density, local shear rate, and particle radius, respectively.37 Although the numerical validity of this expression may not be accurate for suddenly expanding flow with deformable cells, the scaling laws have been found to be applicable and used for vortex-based fractionation of cells based on their sizes.36,38–40 Next, the deformation-induced lift force is dependent on RBC deformability, which is a function of shear rate through the Capillary number (Ca) of a RBC, which is defined by Ca=μγ˙a/σ, where μ,γ˙,a,andσ are the fluid viscosity, shear rate, RBC radius, and shear modulus of the RBC membrane, respectively.41 Finally, the cell–cell interactions also depend on shear rate.42 Therefore, for a given particle size, the net lift force on a RBC will be determined by the local shear rate. To obtain further insights into this lift phenomenon on RBC motion in vortical flows, we sought to estimate the shear strain acting locally on the cells. Although at low Re (Re = 0.6 and 3), we were able to obtain the complete velocity profile from μPIV in the flow separation regions, at higher Re (Re = 12 and 18), the high velocities near the center of the channel precluded the tracking of particles and hence local velocities, which could only be obtained farther from the center, and farther from the regions where flow actually separates. Therefore, we used 3D CFD simulations to obtain velocity profiles in regions that were not feasible to obtain experimentally. We used COMSOL to solve the Navier–Stokes equation to obtain three-dimensional (3D) velocity vectors and compared it with μPIV measurements (Fig. 7). These computations faithfully confirm the velocity profiles estimated using μPIV including creeping flows at Re = 0.6; development and growth of microvortices at Re = 3 and Re = 6, respectively; and the formation of vortices and stagnation points near the wall at higher Re (Re = 12 and 18) (compare with Fig. 5). In particular, we note that the velocity vectors from CFD simulations match well at the various locations where experimental data were available and the local velocities were within the sensitivity limits of μPIV [Fig. 7(e)]. FIG. 7. Open in a new tab Comparison between velocity distributions obtained from μPIV measurements (right) with 3D CFD simulations (left) at the indicated locations and at the indicated Re (a)–(d). The dotted line in the velocity profiles (E) indicates discrepancy between experiment and simulation.Having matched the experimental and computational velocity fields either fully, at low Re, or partially at higher Re, we computationally determined the shear strain acting on the RBCs near the entrance to the channel from where cells enter the valve pockets [Fig. 8(a)]. Figure 8(b) shows the shear rate perpendicular to the direction of main flow, plotted along the direction of flow at the y-location corresponding to the edge of the constriction at the inlet [within the white-bounded region in Fig. 8(a)]. We profiled the strain rates because the inertial boundary layer separates along this line to form laminar vortices (i.e., Moffatt corner eddy flow) in the sudden expansion. As expected, the strains continue to decrease as the fluid enters the sudden expansion, and at any given location, increases with an increase in Re. FIG. 8. Open in a new tab (a) Shear rate distributions computed by 3D CFD simulations at the indicated Re. The white box indicates the location where the flow separation was noticed and, hence, was used in estimating location shear rates; (b) shear rates along at different Y-coordinates moving with the flow in the white box indicated in (a). The filled circles indicate the shear rates computed by the simulations at any given Y-coordinate, and the curves indicate the best fit. The red dotted line indicates the maximum shear rate corresponding to Re = 6, below which no RBC entered the vortical flows.Since we observed flow separation at Re = 3 and 6, but RBCs do not enter the vortices at these flow rates, we propose that a shear rate lower than the maximum value at Re = 6 (∼1.8 × 105 s−1) is not sufficient to drive the RBC into the vortex [Fig. 8(b), dotted line]. But at Re = 12, when the shear rate increases to 2.5 × 105 s−1 or ∼200–250 Pa (for a viscosity of 1 cP), a few RBCs enter into the vortices, suggesting that this value represents the necessary sideward momentum to drive RBCs into the valve pockets. The increase in Re to 18 and 24 increases the shear rate linearly but the lift force by square of the shear rate, thus resulting in driving many RBCs into the vortices, resulting in a vortex hematocrit instead of a feed hematocrit. The scale-down experimental system is appropriate to investigate the transport phenomena of RBCs isolated from small volumes of fresh human blood without relying on a substitute. Yet, it places certain limitations in translating the results to larger, actual venous valves. As mentioned previously, by matching the Re, we maintained flow patterns and regime in the scale-down model similar to those in femoral and saphenous veins. This means that the flow velocity and shear rates in the smaller microchannels are larger than those in in vivo veins. Hence, compared with the model, RBCs in venous valves will not only travel at lower velocity but will also experience different levels of lift forces. Another inherent constraint in the scale down model is the confinement-related effects since RBC deformability is known to be altered in cell-sized channels.43 Although we do not expect confinement effects at a single cell level in our microchannels since they are ∼6× larger than the hydrodynamic diameter of RBCs, it is plausible that these effects may be felt due to cell–cell interactions. Therefore, the shear rate–vortical dynamics relationship in venous valves may be different from what is observed in our model microchannels due to the aforementioned scaling effects.44,45 Nonetheless, the experimental flow patterns and RBC distribution data presented in this work, together with our recent report on RBC deformability,50 can be valuable for understanding RBC entrapment in venous valves, such as through computationally intensive multiscale simulations.46 It is appropriate to note some of the experimental adaptations in this in vitro study that limit the applicability of our conclusions directly to the pathophysiology of venous thrombosis. We have used dilute red cell suspensions which are ∼10× lower than physiological RBC concentrations so as to isolate fluid–cell interactions on RBC distribution. However, at higher RBC concentrations, cell–cell interactions may dominate fluid–cell interactions, and the local changes in hematocrit may be even more pronounced than what is reported in this study. We have used steady flow that does not capture pulsations, which are believed to be prominent due to muscle contraction, and can affect the dynamics of RBC entry and exit from the vortex.47,48 Furthermore, we have used stiff valves with an elastic modulus that is tenfold higher than healthy valve tissues; and we have used a valve expansion ratio of 1:10, while the expansion ratio for a healthy valve is 1:4. Of interest, the valve tissue becomes stiffer with aging due to fibrotic tissue formation, and the stiff valve does not open fully in response to pressure drop. Future work will extend to μPIV measurements to investigate the impact of pliable valves and expansion ratios on RBC transport while accounting for RBC deformability, RBC distribution, confinement effects, and cell–cell interactions.CONCLUSION In summary, we have shown that vortical flows in microchannels of geometry similar to venous valve pockets result in anomalous local RBC distribution, which can be significantly different from the feed or bulk hematocrit. We have also shown that shear rates determine whether RBC trajectories follow fluid streamlines into the microchannel pockets. The μPIV-based quantification shows small recirculating flow regions that do not contain RBCs and regions with RBCs that are trapped in infinite limit cycles.49 Finally, the vortical flows also result in stasis and reversal of shear rate directions on the vessel walls. These findings illustrate that vortical flows due to sudden expansion can alter the local composition of cellular components and also local shear rates, thus influencing all three vertices of Virchow's triad implicated in mural or device-related thrombosis. Beyond relevance to venous thrombosis, our findings also provide experimental insights into inertial flow of dilute suspensions in sudden expansions, which has applications in microfluidics-based flow focusing for the separation of cells based on size or deformability. Our data provide shear rate thresholds for inertial focusing of cells into the expansions and increasing the separation efficiency by trapping them into the micro-vortices based on their size.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL See the supplementary material for bright field images at Re 0.6–24, the calibration curve, and an experimental video showing RBC entrapment.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors acknowledge the financial support from NASA (No. 80NSSC21K0272), National Science Foundation (NSF) (No. 1727072), and volunteer blood donors, and technical assistance from Dr. Alfred Renaldo at MPEL, SJSU.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bioinformatics approaches have proven useful in understanding biological responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal signaling. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on Earth. Spaceflight responses of C. elegans were more similar to EDL. Discrete life stages of D. melanogaster have distinct utility in anticipating EDL and soleus responses. In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies. Keywords: spaceflight, muscle, transcriptomics, bedrest, hindlimb unloading, microgravity, animal models, cross-species comparison",
    "introduction": "1. Introduction Exposure to the unique set of spaceflight environmental conditions, including microgravity, cosmic radiation, isolation, and confinement, has been shown to induce significant physiological changes in all studied species to date [1,2,3]. These physiological responses, such as skeletal muscle atrophy, can negatively impact the health of astronauts and may also compromise mission success if left unabated [4]. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying physiological deconditioning in spaceflight have yet to be fully described, and advancement of this mechanistic understanding is essential for the development of molecularly rationalized countermeasures [5]. Such countermeasures can help maintain astronaut health during future spaceflight missions, including long duration voyages to Mars in which current countermeasures are likely to prove insufficient [6]. Studies leveraging data from omics disciplines, including transcriptomics, allow for a detailed study of the complex interactions between the molecular landscape of biological systems and spaceflight environmental conditions. Despite the scientific potential of omics datasets captured in spaceflight, only a relatively small number have been collected, mainly due to the resource-intensive nature of spaceflight experiments. NASA GeneLab was established to maximize the use of the limited number of spaceflight omics datasets. The datasets made publicly available via the GeneLab repository represent a variety of omics data types and a range of model organisms, including microbes, plants, cell cultures, vertebrates, and invertebrates [7,8]. Additionally, datasets from ground-based studies that are relevant to the spaceflight environment can be accessed via public repositories, including GeneLab and  Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [9]. Although physiological and other functional data is required to establish clear relationships between omics changes and physiological changes, independent analysis of omics datasets is still useful for hypothesis generation, which can be used to inform future research directions. There remain numerous opportunities to use publicly available omics datasets to elucidate knowledge gaps in the field of space biology. One such knowledge gap that currently requires further investigation is that of shared and discrete transcriptomic responses across biological tissue types, such as different muscles. Addressing this knowledge gap can prove useful for designing countermeasures that can target multiple tissues, or for providing evidence for the need to employ multiple countermeasures to provide comprehensive protection to a variety of tissues. Aside from its role in locomotion and posture, skeletal muscle plays other vital roles in whole-body health. Skeletal muscle physically shields organs and helps maintain temperature homeostasis. Additionally, as the body’s largest store of amino acids, skeletal muscle engages in crosstalk with other organs, to synthesize organ-specific proteins [10]. When the body is threatened by starvation or disease, skeletal muscle is broken down to provide other organs with energy [11]. To date, antigravity muscles in the limbs have been the main focus for studying the skeletal muscle response to spaceflight. These muscles are key to maintaining posture under 1G conditions, and are thus highly susceptible to atrophy when unloaded [12]. Certain antigravity muscles in the lower limb, such as the soleus and gastrocnemius, are also important for circulation, as upon contraction they pump venous blood back to the heart, preventing pooling and stagnation [13]. Alongside reduced muscle mass, strength, and endurance, it has been found that the mechanical unloading associated with microgravity induces a shift from type I slow twitch fibers to type II fast twitch fibers [14,15]. Previous spaceflight and ground studies in rodents and humans have also observed that antigravity muscles consisting of mainly type I (slow-twitch) fibers, which are designed for slow and sustained contraction, such as the soleus tend to be more susceptible to atrophy compared to antigravity muscles with more type II (fast-twitch) fibers [16]. Recently, Choi and colleagues reported findings from NASA’s Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission, in which mice were flown onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and exposed to microgravity for 37 days. They found that the weight of the soleus in space flown mice was reduced by ~19% compared to ground control mice [17]. In addition, they reported that the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and quadriceps did not show significant atrophy compared to ground control mice [17]. While significant atrophy of the soleus is consistent with findings from similar studies, the finding of non-significant atrophy in the gastrocnemius is contrary to previous space flown mouse studies [18,19,20]. Similarly, previous transcriptomic analyses of RR-1 data have reported that the soleus showed the greatest number of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [21,22] compared to other muscle tissues. However, all muscle tissues did show significant gene expression changes, and hierarchical clustering of these changes indicated that the muscle tissues can be divided into two distinct groups. Group 1 consisted of plantar flexor muscles, soleus, and gastrocnemius, while group 2 consisted of dorsiflexors EDL and TA and knee extensors, quadriceps. In addition, microgravity responsive changes in immune-related pathway regulation appeared to be more prevalent in group 1 muscles compared to group 2 [21]. A different analysis of RR-1 data highlighted that changes in the expression of clock genes were fairly uniform across the muscle tissues, and yet distinct compared to other tissues such as the liver [22]. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that while certain muscles may not undergo significant atrophy in spaceflight, they still undergo molecular changes that may require intervention. Additionally, these findings support the hypothesis that in certain cases, the response to spaceflight is not identical between muscle tissues, due to their distinct morphologies and locomotive functions [16]. Further investigation is required to establish precise differences and similarities between the molecular responses of different muscle tissues. Hence in this study, we compared transcriptomic data from the fast-twitch enriched EDL, and the representative slow-twitch muscle soleus [23], collected during the RR-1 mission. We made use of two analysis approaches, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and overrepresentation analysis (ORA) to determine the impact of the analysis approach on outcomes and to better anticipate the array of biological responses to spaceflight. Subsequently, to better understand the analogous nature of ground-based studies, transcriptomic data from the RR-1 quadriceps was compared to the vastus lateralis from a human bed rest study [24], and transcriptomic data from the gastrocnemius from a different space flown mouse study was compared to matching HU samples from that same study [25]. In addition to rodents, invertebrates, including C. elegans and D. melanogaster, have been established as important model organisms for understanding biological responses to the space environment [26]. While it is possible to isolate muscles in ground laboratories via dissection when the sample size of fresh animals is sufficient [27], whole organism or composite structures such as the head are typically extracted for analysis in spaceflight experiments due to logistical challenges of dissecting samples in orbit. However, insights related to muscle can still be uncovered. For example, reproducible downregulation of muscle-related genes has been observed across the “International C. elegans Experiment FIRST” (ICE-FIRST) and “C. elegans RNA Interference in Space Experiment” (CERISE) microarray experiments [28,29]. Leandro and colleagues performed a comparative analysis of space flown C. elegans from the ICE-FIRST experiment and space flown D. melanogaster from the GENE experiment [3,30]. Three analysis approaches were tested on the small subset of orthologous genes between the two organisms. Only six genes were found to have a common transcriptomic response in both experiments, with these genes all downregulated and associated with metabolic and neuromuscular signaling [3,31]. Terrestrial studies have set a strong precedent for using invertebrate models to develop tools [13,32,33] and study conserved pathways in mammalian biological processes such as aging [34,35,36,37,38]. However, the utility of omics data from space flown invertebrate studies, in anticipating aspects of mammalian responses to spaceflight, has yet to be fully investigated. With large, low cost cohorts of genetic mutants, interventional invertebrate studies are useful for establishing correlational relationships between molecular pathways and spaceflight phenotypes, with functional measures needed for causation [29]. We reason that if certain mechanisms are shared between mammals and invertebrate models, invertebrate datasets can potentially augment the limited quantity of vertebrate spaceflight omics datasets. This in turn may prove useful in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight. To test these concepts, we compared the abovementioned RR-1 EDL and soleus muscle datasets with transcriptomic datasets of C. elegans and D. melanogaster that were flown in the ICE-FIRST experiment and STS-121 mission, respectively. We found that spaceflight results in discrete transcriptomic signatures between representative slow and fast twitch muscles (soleus and EDL respectively), consistent with their opposing roles in flexion and differential sensitivities to unloading. In addition, transcriptomic analysis revealed that invertebrate models share select aspects of mammalian responses to spaceflight. The life stage of invertebrate models appears to impact the degree by which they recapitulate the responses of mammalian tissues to spaceflight.",
    "methods": "4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Datasets Used in This Study Table 1 lists the various datasets used in this study. These datasets can be found in NASA GeneLab and are cited in these references [24,25,37,38,39,40,41]. The datasets involving mice flown on the ISS make use of the NASA Rodent Research notation for the various experimental groups. Specifically, NASA RR-1 validation mice consisted of four groups to also enable assessment of the contributions of age and cage configuration. These include Spaceflight (FLT) and Ground Control (GC) groups, which both make use of the NASA rodent habitat. The GC group was run with a 4-day delay to allow for replication of actual temperature, gas partial pressures, and humidity conditions of the FLT group. In addition, a baseline (Basal) group was euthanized on Earth one day after launch to compare changes in both the FLT and GC groups. Lastly, a Vivarium (Viv) control comprising mice maintained in standard housing was also included to determine the impact of the mouse habitat hardware in the results obtained from the FLT and GC groups. Refer to [17] for further details. NASA GeneLab generated omics data from the following comparisons: Basal vs Viv controls, GC vs Viv controls, FLT vs GC [17]. In this work, we focus on the GC and FLT groups. A number of bedrest studies focusing on muscle have been published, with a variety of assay approaches (coding and non-coding RNA), main experimental variables, and tissue collection schemes [24,141,142]. For this current analysis, we selected a transcriptomic dataset from a previous bedrest study [24] based on availability of raw expression data from coding RNA. 4.2. Processed RNAseq Data Differential expression data of RNA-seq datasets (GLDS-99, 103 and 104) were downloaded from NASA GeneLab. The NASA GeneLab online database describes the standard analysis pipeline used to generate this processed data. Briefly, the percentage of rRNA in raw fastq files was assessed using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and then filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). The quality of both raw and trimmed reads was evaluated with FastQC [143] (version 0.118), while MultiQC [144] (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Indexes for Mus musculus genome were generated with genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf using STAR [145] (version 2.7.1a). Processed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were then quantified using RSEM [146] (version 1.3.1). Quantification data was imported to R [147] (version 3.6.0) with tximport [148] (version 1.14.0) and normalized with DESeq2 [149] (version 1.26.0). Differential expression analysis was conducted in R (version 3.6.0) using DESeq2 (version 1.26.0). All groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb [150], PANTHER.db [151], and org.Mm.eg.db [152]. Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 [153] was performed on expression data from space flown subjects against ground controls to assess gene level changes in these muscles and use in downstream pathway analysis. 4.3. Processing of Microarray Data For Affymetrix microarray datasets (GLDS-3 and GLDS-21), the raw expression data were downloaded from NASA GeneLab database. The data were normalized using the ‘affyNormQC.R’ r script applying the RMA algorithm through the oligo R package with default parameters. The ‘affyNormQC.R’ r script was also used to generate quality control with parameter ‘do.logtranspaceflightorm’ set to TRUE. The microarray experiments were annotated with the r script ‘annotateProbes.R’, which employed Annotation-Db class probe annotations specific to the chip used in each experiment from the Bioconductor repository. In cases where multiple probes mapped to the same gene ID, representative probes were selected with the highest mean normalized intensity across all samples. The limmaDiffExp.R r script was used to perform differential gene expression analysis on normalized expression data to perform pair-wise comparisons for all groups. For each probe set, the variance of mean signal intensities was estimated, improved by an empirical Bayes method for combining variances of probes showing similar variability, and the significance of the difference between the means was evaluated with a t-test to obtain p values. p values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate [154,155]. Raw Agilent microarray data (GLDS-113 and GLDS-370) were downloaded from NASA GeneLab. Data were analyzed using Gene Spring software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Background correction was performed using the ‘normexp’ method (with offset = 50), and between array normalization was performed utilizing the quantile normalization method with a log2 transformation. Control probes and those without a RefSeq ID were removed, while probes mapping to the same RefSeq ID were collapsed by mean expression (leaving ~20,700 genes for analysis). All datasets used are outlined in Table 1 and anatomical locations of mammalian muscles are shown in Figure 1. 4.4. Pathway Analysis First, differential expression analysis (DEA) was performed to reveal DEGs, the top 10 of which sorted by fold change values were used to pinpoint central players that orchestrate the response to spaceflight. ORA using WebGestalt [156] was then performed on DEGs to determine enriched gene ontology terms (Log2 FC > 0.32 or < -0.32, FDR adjusted p < 0.05). A variance stabilizing transformation was applied to the count data from datasets GLDS-99 and GLDS-104, and a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed with FDR threshold of < 0.1 using Cytoscape [157]. The EnrichmentMap and Autoannotate Cytoscape plugins were used to visualize and annotate clusters of overlapping gene sets to help identify overarching enriched functional themes and aid in the interpretation of the effects of spaceflight in distinct muscle types. A comparative analysis was performed on the results from each muscle.",

Comparative Analysis Reveals Key Differences in Space Flown Slow and Fast Twitch Muscle We first characterized the effects of spaceflight on fast and slow twitch muscle types (EDL and soleus, respectively) from the RR-1 Mission (Figure 1). Differential expression analysis (DEA) of EDL and soleus from space flown mice compared with ground controls along with ORA and GSEA are found in Supplementary Tables S1–S6, Networks S1 and S2 and Figures S1 and S2, respectively. Genes with the largest changes to their expression can provide insight on important biological processes that underlie spaceflight responses. Included in the top 10 upregulated genes in the EDL was the long non-coding RNA (Lncbate10) that has been shown to protect Pgc1α from repression [44], as well as Mettl21e which inhibits proteasomes [45]. We also observed upregulation of the cell cycle-related gene Cdk1 and Mmp12, which play a role in ECM remodeling. The top downregulated genes included Pde2a, a phosphodiesterase (PDE), which controls degradation of cAMP and cGMP; the downregulation of Pde2a suggests increased cAMP/cGMP signaling. Downregulated as well was Lep, involved in energy homeostasis, and Pck1, a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Additionally, we found downregulation of Stum, which functions in mechanotransduction. Enriched results for the EDL show a response to radiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the induction of apoptosis. In addition, there was enrichment of inflammatory pathways including Stat and Nf-κb, a response to wound healing and immune-related gene sets (GO:0045087, GO:0034097) involving the production of cytokines TGFβ, IL4, IL10, and type 1 interferon. Enrichment of genes related to glucocorticoid (GC) signaling, a stress response pathway, was also observed. We found overrepresentation of gene sets involved in the circadian rhythm (GO:0048511, GO:0007623) as reported previously [22,46,47,48], including downregulation of Dbp, a key circadian rhythm gene involved in inducing the transcription of other clock genes such as mPer1 [49]. GSEA results also show enrichment of carbohydrate metabolism, consistent with previous studies reporting a greater reliance on glucose and a shift away from lipid metabolism [50]. In addition, we found downregulation of lipid metabolism (GO:0006631) based on ORA of downregulated genes Lep, Lpl, and Pparγ [51,52,53]. Analysis also revealed enrichment of lipid transport and sequestration in the EDL, consistent with previously reported lipid accumulation in atrophied muscles [50]. ORA of upregulated DEGs in the EDL show proliferation-related gene sets (GO:0008283, GO:0000278) suggesting an increase in proliferation. Conversely, GSEA revealed enrichment of mitogenic signaling pathways (MAPK), which correspond to the upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression (Cdk1). GSEA also revealed regulation of proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells and angiogenesis (Supplementary Network 1, Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting spaceflight-induced changes to muscle vasculature. Results also show the enrichment of muscle cell development, and differentiation as well as upregulation of Fos, Mettl21e and Prnd, genes involved in differentiation and the upregulation of Pax3, a stem cell marker expressed in activated satellite cells. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Anatomical positions of the various mouse and human muscles used in this study, grouped by function. The right panel shows the percentage of slow and fast twitch fibers for each muscle.In the soleus, the top upregulated genes consist of keratins, known to be important structural proteins in muscle as well as Mettle21e, involved in ECM remodeling, also found to be upregulated in the EDL. Dhrs9, involved in vitamin A biosynthesis, was downregulated, consistent with the observation of a reduction in retinol in lipid droplets in the liver of space flown mice [54]. Analyses also revealed downregulation of Gcat, which plays a role in threonine metabolism. Similarly, we found downregulation of C9, which functions in the innate immune response. Enriched results for the soleus suggest stress signaling with the enrichment of a response to GCs (GO:0051384) and the downregulation of Ciart, a circadian gene with a role in the transcriptional repression of Clock and Bmal1 [55]. There were fewer immune related results in the soleus compared to the EDL (sole enrichment of interferon gamma and downregulation of Il8 in the soleus). These results may suggest that the EDL has a more robust immune response than soleus, consistent with findings from a previous spaceflight study [56]. Further, GSEA indicated negative regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), suggesting downregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in the soleus. Metabolic changes also differ in comparison to the EDL, with results indicating an increase in protein metabolism (GO:0006082, GO:0019752, GO:0072330) using upregulated genes in ORA. This is accompanied by negative correlation of ribosome biogenesis and negative nucleotide biosynthesis with spaceflight, all consistent with a decrease in muscle mass. While mixed results were reported for the regulation of lipid metabolism, the results suggest a decrease in glucose metabolism (GO:0005975). We also found enrichment of growth related gene sets such as upregulation of growth hormones including Igf1 and its receptor, Igf1r. However, findings also included negative cell growth (GO:0016049) and proliferation (GO:0008283). The presence of positive and negative growth pathways may suggest remodeling of the muscles as they respond to the need to replenish and remove old or damaged cells in response to spaceflight. Similarly, results using up- and downregulated genes in ORA also indicate both positive and negative developmental cues including the enrichment of negative tissue development (GO:0009888) and cell differentiation (GO:0045595). A cross comparison of the biological processes shared between the EDL and soleus is shown in Figure 2, and shared DEGs are presented in Supplementary Table S7. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Shared upregulated and downregulated biological processes in soleus and EDL in response to spaceflight. The resulting gene ratio and p values from Webgestalt analysis of DEGs are shown. 2.3. Molecular Signatures of C. elegans in Comparison with Fast and Slow Twitch Muscles during Spaceflight 2.3.1. Shared Increase in Proliferation between Space Flown C. Elegans and Mouse Fast Twitch EDL We next asked whether invertebrate models can be used to gain insight into mammalian responses to spaceflight. To address this question, we performed ORA on space flown C. elegans and utilized Ensembl orthology [57] to perform a cross-species comparison with mouse muscles to assess whether the transcriptional responses to spaceflight found in mammalian muscle are also observed in nematodes. DEGs and ORA can be found in Supplementary Tables S8 and S9. Differential expression analysis of space flown C. elegans revealed 106 DEGs (FDR < 0.05). Initial inspection of the enriched biological processes of C. elegans revealed that most upregulated biological processes (BP) are related to cell division (GO:0007049, GO:0051301) and development (GO:0032502), processes akin to the phenotype defined in the EDL. We also found upregulation of genes related to cytoskeleton organization (GO:0000226, GO:0007010), chitin metabolism (GO:0006030), and downregulation of ECM organization (GO:0030198). A cross-comparison between C. elegans and EDL enriched biological processes, shown in Figure 3, also indicates the shared overrepresentation of proliferation-related gene sets (GO:0008283, GO:0000278, GO:0022402). Gene sets related to the immune response (GO:0006955), synaptic signaling (GO:0098916) and the ECM (GO:0030198) were upregulated in the EDL but downregulated in C. elegans. A comparison of C. elegans and EDL DEGs revealed seven shared genes. These include an oncogene with a role in cell polarity (Cab39) [58] and a gene involved in base excision repair (Ung) [59]. An early development gene Zcchc24 [60] was downregulated in both datasets. In addition, we found downregulation of Rab20, a gene involved in cell trafficking in the Golgi apparatus [61], consistent with downregulation of cell-cell signaling (GO:0007267). Genes upregulated in C. elegans but downregulated in the EDL have roles in uracil methylation (Trmt44), calcium-mediated synaptic transmission (Syt12), and thrombin degradation (Thbd). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Shared upregulated and downregulated biological processes in C. elegans compared with soleus and the EDL in response to spaceflight. The resulting gene ratio and P values from Webgestalt analysis of DEGs are shown.2.3.2. Comparison between C. elegans and Mouse Slow Twitch Muscle, Soleus Similar to findings from comparisons with EDL, we also found shared biological processes between C. elegans and soleus (Figure 3), namely downregulation of cell proliferation. However, other processes were regulated in opposite directions. Specifically, transmembrane transport (GO:0055085), defense response (GO:0006952, GO:0098542), and cell adhesion (GO:0007155) were downregulated in C. elegans, yet upregulated in the soleus. We found 16 shared DEGs in C. elegans and soleus (Table 2). Upregulated in both C. elegans and soleus are mitochondrial genes involved in mtDNA repair (Mpv17), branched chain amino acid metabolism (Ppm1k) [62], and the DNA helicase gene Mcm2. Shared downregulated genes include Thbd, involved in thrombin degradation as well as Rab20, previously described. Genes that were upregulated in C. elegans but downregulated in the soleus include those involved in DNA repair (Nsmce1) [63], and the unfolded protein response (Shq1), suggesting increased damage response in C. elegans. Genes that are downregulated in C. elegans but upregulated in the soleus are involved in muscle excitability (Ric3) [64] and synaptic signaling (Syt12, Ric3, Htr7) [64,65,66] which may impact muscle contraction if globally upregulated in neurons. Downregulated in C. elegans were Dpp4, a gene encoding a multi-functional transmembrane protein involved in glucose uptake [67], and Plce1 involved in growth and differentiation [68]. Pde4b, which codes for an enzyme that degrades cAMP to AMP, was downregulated, suggesting increased cAMP signaling in C. elegans, which is more akin to the EDL response. Table 2.

Cross-Comparison between Space Flown D. melanogaster and Mouse Muscles 2.4.1. Shared Stress Response in EDL and Larval D. melanogaster We also determined whether space flown D. melanogaster share any similarities with mammalian muscle responses spaceflight. To determine this, we individually compared EDL with larvae and adult D. melanogaster. We reasoned that doing such may provide insight into any life-stage dependencies in our findings. DEA of space flown D. melanogaster larvae revealed 439 orthologous mouse genes (Supplementary Table S10), which were subjected to ORA (Supplementary Table S11). Genes were compared with mouse EDL, revealing 18 shared DEGs shown in Table 3. Shared upregulated genes include the circadian rhythm gene Noct, consistent with previous observations in space flown D. melanogaster [69]. Stress-induced molecular chaperones (Hsp90aa1) were also upregulated as well as genes involved in the biosynthesis of carnitine and fatty acid transport (Tmlhe). Shared downregulated genes include Mettl26, a methyltransferase. Genes with opposing patterns of regulation reveal key differences in metabolism including D2hgdh, upregulated in D. melanogaster, involved in D2-HG metabolism in the mitochondria, and Cth, involved in cysteine biosynthesis. Genes that were upregulated in the EDL but downregulated in D. melanogaster suggest differential regulation of glycosylation (Gmppb), the cytoskeleton (Tubb4b) and ECM organization (Hspg2, Prcp), blood pressure (Prcp), and protein ubiquitination (Plaa).

Shared Responses of Larval D. melanogaster and Soleus from Space Flown Mice A comparison of larval D. melanogaster DEGs revealed 61 shared genes with the soleus (Supplementary Table S12). ORA of the 38 upregulated orthologs (Supplementary Table S13) suggested a shared increase in protein metabolism (GO:0006520, GO:0000096, GO:0006534). Notably, both datasets include the downregulation of Pdia6, which promotes proliferation [70,71] and a mitochondrial gene, Gtpbp3, for which studies involving its knockdown reported reduced ATP generation, increased ROS, and apoptosis [72]. The molecular chaperones Hspa5 and Hspb6 were also downregulated, suggesting a reduction of UPR signaling and consistent with increased protein metabolism, features observed in the soleus. Scarb1 was downregulated in both soleus and D. melanogaster larvae. SCARB1 has been shown to play an important role in muscle regeneration [73]. Similarly, Crym was downregulated, knockout of which in mice leads to hypertrophy of fast glycolytic fibers [74]. Pnf4, important for actin polymerization [75] was also downregulated in both soleus and D. melanogaster larvae.2.4.3. Comparison of Space Flown Adult D. melanogaster and Fast Twitch Mammalian Muscles We next compared adult D. melanogaster to the mouse muscles. Spaceflight led to 459 DEGs (FDR<0.05) in adult D. melanogaster (Supplementary Table S14). Of these, we found 101 that are orthologous to mouse genes, which were used for ORA (Supplementary Table S15). Four of the DEGs were found to be shared with the mouse EDL dataset. Genes that showed upregulation of expression in the two datasets were found to be involved in chromatin scaffolding (Ppp1r10) and replication (Mcm6). Ppm1l, downregulated in both datasets, is a negative regulator of stress and inflammatory cytokines. Hence, its downregulation in the EDL is consistent with an increased immune response [76]. Also dysregulated was Hspg2, which encodes an ECM protein.2.4.4. Comparison of Space Flown Adult D. melanogaster with Mouse Soleus A comparison of adult D. melanogaster DEGs with soleus DEGs (FDR < 0.1) revealed 12 shared genes shown in Table 4. Genes that are upregulated in both datasets include a myosin protein ligase (Mylip) involved in muscle atrophy, previously reported to be induced by glucocorticoids [77]. Also upregulated were genes encoding a helicase protein Mcm2 involved in replication and the pro-survival gene, Ppm11, which negatively regulates SAPK-mediated apoptosis. However, Jarid2 was also upregulated in both, which represses pro-cell cycle genes [78]. Additionally, Cbs which takes part in the transulfuration pathways in cysteine production, is also upregulated. Genes that are downregulated in both datasets encode a nucleoporin (Nup37), a polymerase (Polr2e) and Dnajb4, the suppression of which has been linked to decreased growth [79]. Genes upregulated in D. melanogaster but downregulated in mouse soleus include the helicase subunit (Mcm6) and genes involved in cysteine production (Gnmt), calcium signaling (Inpp5a), and limb development (Fjx1).

Comparison between Ground-Based Unloading Models and Muscles from Space Flown Mice 2.5.1. Comparison between Gastrocnemius from Hindlimb Unloaded and Space Flown Mice To gain insight on shared transcriptomic signatures of ground-based unloading models and space flown mice, a transcriptomic analysis was conducted on RNA of gastrocnemius from space flown mice and a time and age-matched HU study (GLDS-21). Analyses revealed 75 DEGs (p < 0.05) in the gastrocnemius from hindlimb unloading (HU) mice (Supplementary Table S16) and 115 DEGs (p < 0.05) in the gastrocnemius from space flown mice (Supplementary Table S17). The top upregulated genes in the HU model have roles in UPR (Hspa1b, Hspa1a, Atsf3), and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism (Fasn, Ppargc1a). Proto-oncogenes Fos and Jun were also upregulated in HU mice. In contrast, a previous study reported upregulation of Fos and Jun in human muscle after exercise [80]. Additionally, the top 10 most downregulated genes include mitochondrial genes such as Idh2, which takes part in the electron transport chain, Bdh1 involved in ketone metabolism, and Ldhb, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. ORA performed on DEGs from gastrocnemius of HU mice (Supplementary Table S18) revealed differential regulation of stress responses (GO:0033554, GO:0009628), as well as muscle tissue proliferation (GO:0048659), differentiation (GO:0035914) and development (GO:0007519). Conversely, the top upregulated genes in the gastrocnemius from space flown mice include Mt1 and Mt2, genes that have antioxidant activity and glucocorticoid response elements [81]. We also found upregulation of a number of tumor suppressor genes such as Btg2, Cebpd, Gadd45g, Cdkn1a and Tp53inp1 [82,83,84,85,86], suggesting reduced growth and proliferation. Cidec, which codes for a protein that promotes lipid droplet formation in adipocytes [87], was also upregulated. ORA of upregulated DEGs in spaceflight gastrocnemius (Supplementary Table S18) suggests a stress response as shown by differential regulation of GC signaling (GO:0071385). ORA also revealed upregulation of glucose metabolism (GO:0032868) in the gastrocnemius from space flown mice, suggesting alterations in energy homeostasis. A comparison of DEGs in HU and spaceflight gastrocnemius revealed five shared genes with similar patterns of regulation. DEGs upregulated in both datasets suggest that HU and spaceflight both lead to altered circadian rhythm (Nfil3), regulation of proliferation (Btg2) and changes to endothelial adhesion (Cyr61), and scaffolding of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (Musk), which may potentially alter muscle function. Additionally, Bdh1, a gene involved in metabolism of ketone bodies, is downregulated in both datasets. This is consistent with a previous study showing an increase in ketone bodies such as 3-hydroxybutyrate in liver of mice flown on STS-135 [54].2.5.2. Comparison of Muscles from Bed Rest Study and Space Flown Mice Next, we investigated shared transcriptomic responses between representative mixed fiber type muscles, and vastus lateralis muscles (VL) obtained from a bedrest study ( GEO GSE24215/GLDS-370) (349 DEGs, ± 1.5 FC, p < 0.05, Supplementary Table S19) versus quadriceps of space flown mice (887 DEGs, p < 0.05), Supplementary Table S20). Eight genes were shared between these datasets (Table 5). Upregulated in both datasets was Tbc1d12 involved in increasing glucose uptake [88], whereas the shared downregulated genes included Ptp4a3, the downregulation of which increases expression of ECM genes [89], and Fbxo40, the downregulation of which has been observed in muscular dystrophy [90]. Additionally, Ssmpx, a gene induced by stretching of muscles, was downregulated in the human VL but upregulated in mouse quadriceps [91]. ORA of DEGs in human VL (Supplementary Table S21) revealed downregulation of nucleotide metabolism (GO:0009117, GO:0006753) and oxidation-reduction processes usually associated with oxidative phosphorylation (GO:0055114). Conversely, ORA results for mouse quadriceps (Supplementary Table S22) showed downregulation of protein metabolism (GO:0030163, GO:0044257, GO:0051603, and GO:0006511) and a response to stress (GO:0033554).

    "discussion": "3. Discussion 3.1. Mechanisms of Muscle Atrophy Resistance Skeletal muscles are highly adaptive to changes in mechanical forces and display a robust regenerative capacity. In response to weight-bearing or cell damage, cells can initiate pro-survival signaling pathways that increase cell viability and growth, maintain cell number homeostasis, and allow proliferation to meet functional needs. Analysis of the transcriptomic response in the EDL from space flown animals reveals enrichment and overrepresentation of gene sets involved in necrosis, wound healing, immune response, and proliferation, which altogether may suggest a compensatory proliferation in reaction to cell damage. Since mature muscles cells do not divide, the enrichment of proliferative terms may represent the recruitment of satellite cells, which then differentiate into new myofibers [92] to achieve muscle regeneration after cellular insult [93]. This hypothesis is supported by enrichment of developmental GO terms and the upregulation of genes such as Fos and Pax3 known to be expressed in activated satellite cells during muscle cell development and in early muscle regeneration post trauma [94,95]. Previous studies also show tissue regeneration markers of satellite cell activation in murine quadriceps during spaceflight [96]. Spaceflight and its analogs can lead to impaired immunity [97,98,99,100,101,102]. A more robust immune response in the EDL may also indicate damage and repair events in this muscle, given the role the immune system plays in the regeneration process [103,104]. In the EDL, the upregulation of Il15, which codes for an immune modulating cytokine previously noted to confer hypertrophic effects. Increased Il15 expression may contribute to regeneration and prevent excessive atrophy in response to unloading [105]. Additionally, these results also suggest changes to vasculature, which may impact nutrient availability and therefore growth. Previous work on the HU model revealed impaired vasodilation [106] and vasoconstriction [107] in feed arteries of weight bearing plantar flexors. Similarly, radiation exposure has been shown to impact development in human vessel models [108]. The involvement of the above mentioned differentially expressed genes in skeletal muscle atrophy can be tested in future spaceflight experiments. A genetic mechanism that may contribute to the difference in sensitivity to atrophy between the EDL and soleus may involve regulation of PDEs, which hydrolyze and tightly control cAMP/cGMP. cAMP/cGMP are ubiquitous second messenger signaling molecules known to protect against atrophy, increase myofiber size, and promote conversion to faster glycolytic fibers [109]. Our results showed downregulation of phosphodiesterase genes (Pde2a) in the EDL suggesting increased cAMP/gAMP signaling. In contrast, the upregulation of Pde2a, along with five other phosphodiesterase genes (Pde3a, Pde4a, Pde4b, Pde4c, Pde9a) in the soleus suggests decreased cAMP/cGMP signaling. Further work is needed to define levels of cAMP signaling in different muscle types during spaceflight and whether this pathway can be exploited to prevent muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Additionally, in the EDL, a long non-coding RNA (Lncbate10) was upregulated, which is known to protect Pgc1α from repression in adipose tissues [44]. This coincides with the upregulation of Pgc1α, a gene whose expression is also known to protect against atrophy [110]. The expression of Lncbate10 has been shown to be induced by high cAMP concentrations, consistent with the downregulation of the cAMP regulator, Pde2a [44]. Spaceflight is known to induce slow-to-fast muscle fiber conversion [111]. In addition to Pgc1α upregulation in the EDL, we also observed the upregulation of Mettl21e, both of which are known to drive hypertrophy of type II myofibers [45,112]. Additionally, we observed the downregulation of Vegfa in the soleus, which was not observed in the EDL. This suggests opposing regulation of a key growth signal in vasculature of the two muscle types, which influence nutrient availability and ultimately, the propensity for muscle growth. 3.2. Glucocorticoids and the Circadian Rhythm The enrichment of glucocorticoid (GC) signaling suggests that spaceflight led to upregulation of the stress response. This is consistent with the reported rise in plasma and urine cortisol levels observed in certain but not all of spaceflight studies [113,114]. GCs are steroidal signaling molecules with many roles including the regulation of energy homeostasis. They can cause the breakdown of amino acids and a decrease in insulin sensitivity, which were previously observed in the soleus [115]. GCs can also induce expression of clock genes via GC response elements and may therefore have a role in perturbing the circadian rhythm and sleep cycles during spaceflight [22,116,117,118]. The disturbance of the circadian rhythm in both muscles (EDL and soleus) may also negatively impact muscle mass. For example, knockout of a key circadian gene, Bmal in mice led to premature aging including sarcopenia [119]. Perturbations in GC and the circadian signaling have been implicated in disorders such as metabolic syndrome, [120,121,122], sleep disturbances [123,124], immune dysregulation [100,125,126] and cataracts [127]. Hence, these signaling pathways may potentially represent therapeutic targets for the detrimental effects of spaceflight. 3.3. Spaceflight Alters Mechanosensing and Neuronal Signaling in Mouse Muscle Transcriptomic analysis of muscles from space flown mice revealed alterations in signaling pathways involved in mechanotransduction and neuromuscular communication. For example, results showed downregulation of Stum in the EDL, which encodes a protein important for the sensing of mechanical stimuli in proprioceptive neurons [128]. This finding is consistent with the effects of unloading and reduced proprioception observed during spaceflight [128,129]. Similarly, we observed enrichment of genes involved in Rho signaling, one of the pathways that can promote stress fiber formation [130]. Contractility changes in stress fibers is thought to be one the mechanisms by which mechanical forces exerted on the extracellular matrix (ECM) can be sensed by a cell [131]. We also found differential expression of a number of genes involved in neuron excitability such as Grin2b, the dysregulation of which leads to decreased muscle tone [132]. In the soleus, the enrichment of gene sets involved in nervous system development and negative axon extension and the downregulation of neurogenesis (GO:0022008) suggest changes to motor neuron signaling. 3.4. C. elegans Shows Similarity to Mouse Fast Twitch Muscle Responses to Spaceflight Rodents have been widely used to extrapolate human responses to spaceflight due to their significant genetic, physiological, and anatomical similarities. C. elegans, however, have been widely used to study developmental processes since at least 83% of the proteome has a human homologue and ~8000 of its proteins have matching human gene transcripts [133]. The use of C. elegans as a spaceflight model has advantages over rodent models such as their relatively simpler maintenance requirements and smaller body size that allows for a larger number of individuals to be flown in space. In addition, C. elegans allows the use of genetic and molecular tools to dissect specific pathways and can be used for the analysis of potential countermeasures. A caveat of our comparison is that the transcriptomics was performed on a population of animals of mixed ages, and that nematodes contain multiple tissues—neurons, gut, reproductive tissue, in addition to muscles. Understanding how responses in C. elegans mirror mammalian responses to spaceflight may allow for better extrapolation to mammalian results. While the comparison between C. elegans and mouse muscles revealed differences in spaceflight-induced regulation of developmental genes, there was a shared increase in proliferation-related terms with the more atrophy resistant EDL. Similarly, we posit that C. elegans may resist muscle atrophy through shared increased cAMP signaling as indicated by the downregulation of Pde4b, encoding a cAMP regulatory enzyme, variants of which were upregulated in the soleus. The more proliferative transcriptomic signature in C. elegans is more similar to that of the EDL, suggesting shared mechanisms of resistance and may point to a utility for the organism in anticipating responses of fast twitch muscle fibers. Additionally, while C. elegans have been used for uncovering mechanisms of innate immunity analogous to humans, their immune response to spaceflight was not comparable to that seen in fast or slow twitch muscle. This may be due to the lack of an adaptive immune system in C. elegans [134]. 3.5. Discrete Life Stages of D. melanogaster May Have Distinct Utility for Studying Muscle Types Establishing shared responses to spaceflight between D. melanogaster and mammalian muscles also may be of value in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight. D. melanogaster are desirable as flight payloads due to their relatively small experimental footprint and their ease of maintenance. A comparison between different life stages of D. melanogaster and mammalian fast and slow twitch muscles revealed that discrete fly life stages may have differing utility for modeling certain features of the response to spaceflight in these mammalian muscle types. For example, an increase in protein metabolism as well as the downregulation of the UPR, two key features of the soleus response, were observed in D. melanogaster larvae. Conversely, protein metabolism was downregulated in adult D. melanogaster and not observed in the fast twitch EDL. This may suggest stage-dependent differences in metabolism. Moreover, other features of mature adult D. melanogaster are more akin to the fast twitch muscle, including an increase in amino acid production, calcium signaling and limb morphogenesis suggesting an environment with more growth signals. With regards to metabolism, the increase in expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport in adult D. melanogaster is akin to that of the EDL. However, adult D. melanogaster also shows a shared degradation of myosin protein with slow twitch muscle EDL. Furthermore, we also found a similar stress response between space flown adult D. melanogaster and mouse fast twitch muscle as indicated by differential regulation of circadian rhythm and antioxidant response genes. Spaceflight and analog studies using D. melanogaster may allow for greater mechanistic insight on muscle gene regulation under spaceflight conditions. To date, on-orbit sampling of invertebrate models has mostly involved whole animals due to the logistical challenges of performing microdissections of tissues. Transcriptomic signatures can vary across muscle types and such differences may not be captured when analyzing the overall transcriptome from the whole organism. For example, each muscle type in D. melanogaster has a discrete pattern of isoform expression of Troponin, which regulates thin filament contraction [30,135]. We found that these isoforms are also differentially expressed in both spaceflight and analog experiments, consistent with a previous report [30]. Advances in sample preservation and in situ dissections on orbit will greatly improve our ability to gain mechanistic knowledge from smaller model organisms. 3.6. Differential Regulation of ECM in Spaceflight across Organismal Models Our results indicate differential regulation of ECM-related processes in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and rodent EDL in response to spaceflight. Specifically, C. elegans showed downregulation of ECM organization and cell adhesion gene sets while these were upregulated in the EDL. Similarly, there was downregulation of ECM genes Hspg2, Prcp in larval D. melanogaster, while these genes were upregulated in the EDL. Hspg2 encodes Perlecan, which is involved in ECM organization [135]. PRCP activates Prekallikrein, which cleaves fibronectin, a component of the ECM [136]. Hspg2 was also differentially regulated in adult D. melanogaster. Comparison of vastus lateralis from bedrest and quadriceps from space flown mice also revealed a shared upregulation of Ptp4a3, the downregulation of which increases expression of ECM genes [89]. These results suggest a general trend of increased expression of ECM-related genes in rodents and humans compared to downregulation in smaller model organisms such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans. The ECM plays important roles in a plethora of biological processes ranging from growth, migration, structural organization, barrier formation, and the immune response [137]. It is also impacted by spaceflight or simulated microgravity, as part of the mechanotransduction pathways involving integrins and mechanically activated ion channels [138]. The differences in the direction of regulation of ECM-related genes may be due to differences in body or tissue structure (hence differing ECM composition) and the differences in the timing of sampling and duration of flight. However, differential expression of ECM-related genes in all spaceflight models and analogs tested in this study suggest that ECM remodeling is likely to be a universal response to spaceflight. 3.7. Transcriptomic Signatures of Spaceflight Models and Analogs Exhibit Similarities and Key Differences Ground-based analogs such as HU have proven useful in anticipating many aspects of the musculoskeletal response to microgravity. Analysis of the transcriptome of the gastrocnemius from space flown rodents and a time-matched HU study revealed differences in transcriptomic signatures between these two models, particularly in the direction of regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, circadian rhythm, endothelial cell adhesion, and motor neuron signaling. These changes are consistent with musculoskeletal atrophy, gait changes, sleep disturbances, and altered vascular function in humans that experienced spaceflight. However, we recognize that experimental limitations may impact comparative analysis of ground-based and spaceflight studies in rodents. Specifically, differences in animal handling and housing of space and ground-based rodent models can potentially affect the results. The use of appropriate housing controls and introduction of manipulations in controls that consider the additional handling associated with sending payloads to space (e.g., transport in ground vehicles, landing forces, light-dark cycle changes) may minimize the confounding factors when comparing findings from ground-based versus spaceflight rodent studies. We also compared muscles from a rodent spaceflight and human bedrest study, two of the relatively resource intensive approaches to modeling human responses to spaceflight. Both have key advantages relative to ground-based rodent models. The former is expected to reflect mammalian responses to actual spaceflight and the later, actual human physiological responses to unloading. We found that representative mixed fiber type muscles in HU mice and humans on bedrest (quadriceps and VL, respectively) share similarities in differential expression of Tbc1d12, a gene involved in glucose uptake. In addition, Fbxo40, a gene that is also upregulated in a denervation model for muscle atrophy [90] is similarly responsive to both spaceflight in rodents and bedrest. Further, FBXO40 functions as a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that is regulated by activated STAT3, thereby increasing insulin resistance in mice under 1G conditions [139]. Upregulation of both Tbc1d12 and Fbxo40 in bedrest and rodent spaceflight models is consistent with reported perturbations in glucose metabolism observed in humans in space [140]. These findings provide a rationale for testing whether targeting Fbxo40 and its signaling partners will be useful in mitigating muscle atrophy and altered glucose metabolism in both spaceflight and Earth-based scenarios.",
    "conclusion": "5. Conclusions This study aimed to determine the effects of spaceflight on the transcriptome of distinct mammalian muscle types and to define shared transcriptomic signatures across a variety of model organisms. Our analyses revealed that spaceflight elicited both shared and discrete responses in representative slow and fast twitch muscle types (soleus and EDL respectively). The shared responses between these muscle types include altered expression of genes involved in GC stress responses and the circadian rhythm. These two muscle types displayed differences in transcriptomic signatures pertaining to immune function and cellular growth, with the EDL exhibiting greater degree of differential regulation of these processes based on the number of differentially expressed genes between spaceflight and ground samples. Additionally, EDL and soleus showed differences in the transcriptomic response of genes involved in ER stress mechanisms. Our findings also highlight the possible role of Pde2a as a key molecule that may confer the atrophy resistance seen in the EDL. We also found that the muscle specific Ubiquitin E ligase Fbxo40 was downregulated across models for muscle atrophy (bedrest and spaceflight), suggesting a possible target for countermeasures development. These results were also used as a backdrop for the comparison to spaceflight responses of non-mammalian models. The molecular signature of C. elegans in response to spaceflight showed greater similarity to that of the EDL. Furthermore, the transcriptomic signature of the larval stage of D. melanogaster showed more similarity to the slow twitch muscle soleus. In contrast, the response of adult D. melanogaster was more akin to that of fast twitch muscle EDL. Muscles from rodent spaceflight and human bedrest studies indicate alterations in glucose homeostasis and circadian rhythm which are consistent with findings in humans that experienced spaceflight. As expected for a highly resource intensive data collection endeavor, spaceflight omics datasets are rare and can have differences in experiment designs. One of the advantages of applying unbiased bioinformatics analyses of gene expression data is that patterns, differences, or similarities in the regulation of biological processes can be observed from a relatively small number of datasets. We have demonstrated that such an approach can be used to continue to gain insight on the shared responses across model organisms and also between ground and flight analogs for microgravity. However, we recognize limitations in this study, including the possibility that differing experiment designs across datasets such as duration of flight, relative life stage and gender and sex can impact the results obtained. In addition, several datasets yielded a relatively small number of differentially expressed genes, which can limit the ability to find shared molecular signatures across multiple datasets. As more spaceflight and analog datasets become available from the various model organisms, follow-up analyses can be conducted using the approach we have employed. We anticipate that doing so will reveal additional shared mechanisms across the model organisms of spaceflight. Although the use of invertebrate models such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans show promise in anticipating select spaceflight responses of specific muscles, our findings also confirm the marked differences in molecular signatures across these model organisms when dissections are not possible. Hence, the use of rodents to extrapolate human responses to spaceflight continue to have major advantages from a physiology perspective versus classic non-mammalian genetic model systems such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans. However, our findings raise the possibility of using invertebrate models as a first step toward conducting precision animal research in future deep space missions.",

Copyright notice ID: 8430797 PMID: 34502375 Abstract Bioinformatics approaches have proven useful in understanding biological responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal signaling. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on Earth. Spaceflight responses of C. elegans were more similar to EDL. Discrete life stages of D. melanogaster have distinct utility in anticipating EDL and soleus responses. In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies. Keywords: spaceflight, muscle, transcriptomics, bedrest, hindlimb unloading, microgravity, animal models, cross-species comparison1. Introduction Exposure to the unique set of spaceflight environmental conditions, including microgravity, cosmic radiation, isolation, and confinement, has been shown to induce significant physiological changes in all studied species to date [1,2,3]. These physiological responses, such as skeletal muscle atrophy, can negatively impact the health of astronauts and may also compromise mission success if left unabated [4]. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying physiological deconditioning in spaceflight have yet to be fully described, and advancement of this mechanistic understanding is essential for the development of molecularly rationalized countermeasures [5]. Such countermeasures can help maintain astronaut health during future spaceflight missions, including long duration voyages to Mars in which current countermeasures are likely to prove insufficient [6]. Studies leveraging data from omics disciplines, including transcriptomics, allow for a detailed study of the complex interactions between the molecular landscape of biological systems and spaceflight environmental conditions. Despite the scientific potential of omics datasets captured in spaceflight, only a relatively small number have been collected, mainly due to the resource-intensive nature of spaceflight experiments. NASA GeneLab was established to maximize the use of the limited number of spaceflight omics datasets. The datasets made publicly available via the GeneLab repository represent a variety of omics data types and a range of model organisms, including microbes, plants, cell cultures, vertebrates, and invertebrates [7,8]. Additionally, datasets from ground-based studies that are relevant to the spaceflight environment can be accessed via public repositories, including GeneLab and  Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [9]. Although physiological and other functional data is required to establish clear relationships between omics changes and physiological changes, independent analysis of omics datasets is still useful for hypothesis generation, which can be used to inform future research directions. There remain numerous opportunities to use publicly available omics datasets to elucidate knowledge gaps in the field of space biology. One such knowledge gap that currently requires further investigation is that of shared and discrete transcriptomic responses across biological tissue types, such as different muscles. Addressing this knowledge gap can prove useful for designing countermeasures that can target multiple tissues, or for providing evidence for the need to employ multiple countermeasures to provide comprehensive protection to a variety of tissues. Aside from its role in locomotion and posture, skeletal muscle plays other vital roles in whole-body health. Skeletal muscle physically shields organs and helps maintain temperature homeostasis. Additionally, as the body’s largest store of amino acids, skeletal muscle engages in crosstalk with other organs, to synthesize organ-specific proteins [10]. When the body is threatened by starvation or disease, skeletal muscle is broken down to provide other organs with energy [11]. To date, antigravity muscles in the limbs have been the main focus for studying the skeletal muscle response to spaceflight. These muscles are key to maintaining posture under 1G conditions, and are thus highly susceptible to atrophy when unloaded [12]. Certain antigravity muscles in the lower limb, such as the soleus and gastrocnemius, are also important for circulation, as upon contraction they pump venous blood back to the heart, preventing pooling and stagnation [13]. Alongside reduced muscle mass, strength, and endurance, it has been found that the mechanical unloading associated with microgravity induces a shift from type I slow twitch fibers to type II fast twitch fibers [14,15]. Previous spaceflight and ground studies in rodents and humans have also observed that antigravity muscles consisting of mainly type I (slow-twitch) fibers, which are designed for slow and sustained contraction, such as the soleus tend to be more susceptible to atrophy compared to antigravity muscles with more type II (fast-twitch) fibers [16]. Recently, Choi and colleagues reported findings from NASA’s Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission, in which mice were flown onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and exposed to microgravity for 37 days. They found that the weight of the soleus in space flown mice was reduced by ~19% compared to ground control mice [17]. In addition, they reported that the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and quadriceps did not show significant atrophy compared to ground control mice [17]. While significant atrophy of the soleus is consistent with findings from similar studies, the finding of non-significant atrophy in the gastrocnemius is contrary to previous space flown mouse studies [18,19,20]. Similarly, previous transcriptomic analyses of RR-1 data have reported that the soleus showed the greatest number of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [21,22] compared to other muscle tissues. However, all muscle tissues did show significant gene expression changes, and hierarchical clustering of these changes indicated that the muscle tissues can be divided into two distinct groups. Group 1 consisted of plantar flexor muscles, soleus, and gastrocnemius, while group 2 consisted of dorsiflexors EDL and TA and knee extensors, quadriceps. In addition, microgravity responsive changes in immune-related pathway regulation appeared to be more prevalent in group 1 muscles compared to group 2 [21]. A different analysis of RR-1 data highlighted that changes in the expression of clock genes were fairly uniform across the muscle tissues, and yet distinct compared to other tissues such as the liver [22]. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that while certain muscles may not undergo significant atrophy in spaceflight, they still undergo molecular changes that may require intervention. Additionally, these findings support the hypothesis that in certain cases, the response to spaceflight is not identical between muscle tissues, due to their distinct morphologies and locomotive functions [16]. Further investigation is required to establish precise differences and similarities between the molecular responses of different muscle tissues. Hence in this study, we compared transcriptomic data from the fast-twitch enriched EDL, and the representative slow-twitch muscle soleus [23], collected during the RR-1 mission. We made use of two analysis approaches, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and overrepresentation analysis (ORA) to determine the impact of the analysis approach on outcomes and to better anticipate the array of biological responses to spaceflight. Subsequently, to better understand the analogous nature of ground-based studies, transcriptomic data from the RR-1 quadriceps was compared to the vastus lateralis from a human bed rest study [24], and transcriptomic data from the gastrocnemius from a different space flown mouse study was compared to matching HU samples from that same study [25]. In addition to rodents, invertebrates, including C. elegans and D. melanogaster, have been established as important model organisms for understanding biological responses to the space environment [26]. While it is possible to isolate muscles in ground laboratories via dissection when the sample size of fresh animals is sufficient [27], whole organism or composite structures such as the head are typically extracted for analysis in spaceflight experiments due to logistical challenges of dissecting samples in orbit. However, insights related to muscle can still be uncovered. For example, reproducible downregulation of muscle-related genes has been observed across the “International C. elegans Experiment FIRST” (ICE-FIRST) and “C. elegans RNA Interference in Space Experiment” (CERISE) microarray experiments [28,29]. Leandro and colleagues performed a comparative analysis of space flown C. elegans from the ICE-FIRST experiment and space flown D. melanogaster from the GENE experiment [3,30]. Three analysis approaches were tested on the small subset of orthologous genes between the two organisms. Only six genes were found to have a common transcriptomic response in both experiments, with these genes all downregulated and associated with metabolic and neuromuscular signaling [3,31]. Terrestrial studies have set a strong precedent for using invertebrate models to develop tools [13,32,33] and study conserved pathways in mammalian biological processes such as aging [34,35,36,37,38]. However, the utility of omics data from space flown invertebrate studies, in anticipating aspects of mammalian responses to spaceflight, has yet to be fully investigated. With large, low cost cohorts of genetic mutants, interventional invertebrate studies are useful for establishing correlational relationships between molecular pathways and spaceflight phenotypes, with functional measures needed for causation [29]. We reason that if certain mechanisms are shared between mammals and invertebrate models, invertebrate datasets can potentially augment the limited quantity of vertebrate spaceflight omics datasets. This in turn may prove useful in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight. To test these concepts, we compared the abovementioned RR-1 EDL and soleus muscle datasets with transcriptomic datasets of C. elegans and D. melanogaster that were flown in the ICE-FIRST experiment and STS-121 mission, respectively. We found that spaceflight results in discrete transcriptomic signatures between representative slow and fast twitch muscles (soleus and EDL respectively), consistent with their opposing roles in flexion and differential sensitivities to unloading. In addition, transcriptomic analysis revealed that invertebrate models share select aspects of mammalian responses to spaceflight. The life stage of invertebrate models appears to impact the degree by which they recapitulate the responses of mammalian tissues to spaceflight.2. Results 2.1.

Comparative Analysis Reveals Key Differences in Space Flown Slow and Fast Twitch Muscle We first characterized the effects of spaceflight on fast and slow twitch muscle types (EDL and soleus, respectively) from the RR-1 Mission (Figure 1). Differential expression analysis (DEA) of EDL and soleus from space flown mice compared with ground controls along with ORA and GSEA are found in Supplementary Tables S1–S6, Networks S1 and S2 and Figures S1 and S2, respectively. Genes with the largest changes to their expression can provide insight on important biological processes that underlie spaceflight responses. Included in the top 10 upregulated genes in the EDL was the long non-coding RNA (Lncbate10) that has been shown to protect Pgc1α from repression [44], as well as Mettl21e which inhibits proteasomes [45]. We also observed upregulation of the cell cycle-related gene Cdk1 and Mmp12, which play a role in ECM remodeling. The top downregulated genes included Pde2a, a phosphodiesterase (PDE), which controls degradation of cAMP and cGMP; the downregulation of Pde2a suggests increased cAMP/cGMP signaling. Downregulated as well was Lep, involved in energy homeostasis, and Pck1, a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Additionally, we found downregulation of Stum, which functions in mechanotransduction. Enriched results for the EDL show a response to radiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the induction of apoptosis. In addition, there was enrichment of inflammatory pathways including Stat and Nf-κb, a response to wound healing and immune-related gene sets (GO:0045087, GO:0034097) involving the production of cytokines TGFβ, IL4, IL10, and type 1 interferon. Enrichment of genes related to glucocorticoid (GC) signaling, a stress response pathway, was also observed. We found overrepresentation of gene sets involved in the circadian rhythm (GO:0048511, GO:0007623) as reported previously [22,46,47,48], including downregulation of Dbp, a key circadian rhythm gene involved in inducing the transcription of other clock genes such as mPer1 [49]. GSEA results also show enrichment of carbohydrate metabolism, consistent with previous studies reporting a greater reliance on glucose and a shift away from lipid metabolism [50]. In addition, we found downregulation of lipid metabolism (GO:0006631) based on ORA of downregulated genes Lep, Lpl, and Pparγ [51,52,53]. Analysis also revealed enrichment of lipid transport and sequestration in the EDL, consistent with previously reported lipid accumulation in atrophied muscles [50]. ORA of upregulated DEGs in the EDL show proliferation-related gene sets (GO:0008283, GO:0000278) suggesting an increase in proliferation. Conversely, GSEA revealed enrichment of mitogenic signaling pathways (MAPK), which correspond to the upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression (Cdk1). GSEA also revealed regulation of proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells and angiogenesis (Supplementary Network 1, Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting spaceflight-induced changes to muscle vasculature. Results also show the enrichment of muscle cell development, and differentiation as well as upregulation of Fos, Mettl21e and Prnd, genes involved in differentiation and the upregulation of Pax3, a stem cell marker expressed in activated satellite cells. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Anatomical positions of the various mouse and human muscles used in this study, grouped by function. The right panel shows the percentage of slow and fast twitch fibers for each muscle.In the soleus, the top upregulated genes consist of keratins, known to be important structural proteins in muscle as well as Mettle21e, involved in ECM remodeling, also found to be upregulated in the EDL. Dhrs9, involved in vitamin A biosynthesis, was downregulated, consistent with the observation of a reduction in retinol in lipid droplets in the liver of space flown mice [54]. Analyses also revealed downregulation of Gcat, which plays a role in threonine metabolism. Similarly, we found downregulation of C9, which functions in the innate immune response. Enriched results for the soleus suggest stress signaling with the enrichment of a response to GCs (GO:0051384) and the downregulation of Ciart, a circadian gene with a role in the transcriptional repression of Clock and Bmal1 [55]. There were fewer immune related results in the soleus compared to the EDL (sole enrichment of interferon gamma and downregulation of Il8 in the soleus). These results may suggest that the EDL has a more robust immune response than soleus, consistent with findings from a previous spaceflight study [56]. Further, GSEA indicated negative regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), suggesting downregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in the soleus. Metabolic changes also differ in comparison to the EDL, with results indicating an increase in protein metabolism (GO:0006082, GO:0019752, GO:0072330) using upregulated genes in ORA. This is accompanied by negative correlation of ribosome biogenesis and negative nucleotide biosynthesis with spaceflight, all consistent with a decrease in muscle mass. While mixed results were reported for the regulation of lipid metabolism, the results suggest a decrease in glucose metabolism (GO:0005975). We also found enrichment of growth related gene sets such as upregulation of growth hormones including Igf1 and its receptor, Igf1r. However, findings also included negative cell growth (GO:0016049) and proliferation (GO:0008283). The presence of positive and negative growth pathways may suggest remodeling of the muscles as they respond to the need to replenish and remove old or damaged cells in response to spaceflight. Similarly, results using up- and downregulated genes in ORA also indicate both positive and negative developmental cues including the enrichment of negative tissue development (GO:0009888) and cell differentiation (GO:0045595). A cross comparison of the biological processes shared between the EDL and soleus is shown in Figure 2, and shared DEGs are presented in Supplementary Table S7. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Shared upregulated and downregulated biological processes in soleus and EDL in response to spaceflight. The resulting gene ratio and p values from Webgestalt analysis of DEGs are shown.2.3. Molecular Signatures of C. elegans in Comparison with Fast and Slow Twitch Muscles during Spaceflight 2.3.1. Shared Increase in Proliferation between Space Flown C. Elegans and Mouse Fast Twitch EDL We next asked whether invertebrate models can be used to gain insight into mammalian responses to spaceflight. To address this question, we performed ORA on space flown C. elegans and utilized Ensembl orthology [57] to perform a cross-species comparison with mouse muscles to assess whether the transcriptional responses to spaceflight found in mammalian muscle are also observed in nematodes. DEGs and ORA can be found in Supplementary Tables S8 and S9. Differential expression analysis of space flown C. elegans revealed 106 DEGs (FDR < 0.05). Initial inspection of the enriched biological processes of C. elegans revealed that most upregulated biological processes (BP) are related to cell division (GO:0007049, GO:0051301) and development (GO:0032502), processes akin to the phenotype defined in the EDL. We also found upregulation of genes related to cytoskeleton organization (GO:0000226, GO:0007010), chitin metabolism (GO:0006030), and downregulation of ECM organization (GO:0030198). A cross-comparison between C. elegans and EDL enriched biological processes, shown in Figure 3, also indicates the shared overrepresentation of proliferation-related gene sets (GO:0008283, GO:0000278, GO:0022402). Gene sets related to the immune response (GO:0006955), synaptic signaling (GO:0098916) and the ECM (GO:0030198) were upregulated in the EDL but downregulated in C. elegans. A comparison of C. elegans and EDL DEGs revealed seven shared genes. These include an oncogene with a role in cell polarity (Cab39) [58] and a gene involved in base excision repair (Ung) [59]. An early development gene Zcchc24 [60] was downregulated in both datasets. In addition, we found downregulation of Rab20, a gene involved in cell trafficking in the Golgi apparatus [61], consistent with downregulation of cell-cell signaling (GO:0007267). Genes upregulated in C. elegans but downregulated in the EDL have roles in uracil methylation (Trmt44), calcium-mediated synaptic transmission (Syt12), and thrombin degradation (Thbd). Figure 3. Open in a new tab Shared upregulated and downregulated biological processes in C. elegans compared with soleus and the EDL in response to spaceflight. The resulting gene ratio and P values from Webgestalt analysis of DEGs are shown.2.3.2. Comparison between C. elegans and Mouse Slow Twitch Muscle, Soleus Similar to findings from comparisons with EDL, we also found shared biological processes between C. elegans and soleus (Figure 3), namely downregulation of cell proliferation. However, other processes were regulated in opposite directions. Specifically, transmembrane transport (GO:0055085), defense response (GO:0006952, GO:0098542), and cell adhesion (GO:0007155) were downregulated in C. elegans, yet upregulated in the soleus. We found 16 shared DEGs in C. elegans and soleus (Table 2). Upregulated in both C. elegans and soleus are mitochondrial genes involved in mtDNA repair (Mpv17), branched chain amino acid metabolism (Ppm1k) [62], and the DNA helicase gene Mcm2. Shared downregulated genes include Thbd, involved in thrombin degradation as well as Rab20, previously described. Genes that were upregulated in C. elegans but downregulated in the soleus include those involved in DNA repair (Nsmce1) [63], and the unfolded protein response (Shq1), suggesting increased damage response in C. elegans. Genes that are downregulated in C. elegans but upregulated in the soleus are involved in muscle excitability (Ric3) [64] and synaptic signaling (Syt12, Ric3, Htr7) [64,65,66] which may impact muscle contraction if globally upregulated in neurons. Downregulated in C. elegans were Dpp4, a gene encoding a multi-functional transmembrane protein involved in glucose uptake [67], and Plce1 involved in growth and differentiation [68]. Pde4b, which codes for an enzyme that degrades cAMP to AMP, was downregulated, suggesting increased cAMP signaling in C. elegans, which is more akin to the EDL response. Table 2.

Cross-Comparison between Space Flown D. melanogaster and Mouse Muscles 2.4.1. Shared Stress Response in EDL and Larval D. melanogaster We also determined whether space flown D. melanogaster share any similarities with mammalian muscle responses spaceflight. To determine this, we individually compared EDL with larvae and adult D. melanogaster. We reasoned that doing such may provide insight into any life-stage dependencies in our findings. DEA of space flown D. melanogaster larvae revealed 439 orthologous mouse genes (Supplementary Table S10), which were subjected to ORA (Supplementary Table S11). Genes were compared with mouse EDL, revealing 18 shared DEGs shown in Table 3. Shared upregulated genes include the circadian rhythm gene Noct, consistent with previous observations in space flown D. melanogaster [69]. Stress-induced molecular chaperones (Hsp90aa1) were also upregulated as well as genes involved in the biosynthesis of carnitine and fatty acid transport (Tmlhe). Shared downregulated genes include Mettl26, a methyltransferase. Genes with opposing patterns of regulation reveal key differences in metabolism including D2hgdh, upregulated in D. melanogaster, involved in D2-HG metabolism in the mitochondria, and Cth, involved in cysteine biosynthesis. Genes that were upregulated in the EDL but downregulated in D. melanogaster suggest differential regulation of glycosylation (Gmppb), the cytoskeleton (Tubb4b) and ECM organization (Hspg2, Prcp), blood pressure (Prcp), and protein ubiquitination (Plaa).

Shared Responses of Larval D. melanogaster and Soleus from Space Flown Mice A comparison of larval D. melanogaster DEGs revealed 61 shared genes with the soleus (Supplementary Table S12). ORA of the 38 upregulated orthologs (Supplementary Table S13) suggested a shared increase in protein metabolism (GO:0006520, GO:0000096, GO:0006534). Notably, both datasets include the downregulation of Pdia6, which promotes proliferation [70,71] and a mitochondrial gene, Gtpbp3, for which studies involving its knockdown reported reduced ATP generation, increased ROS, and apoptosis [72]. The molecular chaperones Hspa5 and Hspb6 were also downregulated, suggesting a reduction of UPR signaling and consistent with increased protein metabolism, features observed in the soleus. Scarb1 was downregulated in both soleus and D. melanogaster larvae. SCARB1 has been shown to play an important role in muscle regeneration [73]. Similarly, Crym was downregulated, knockout of which in mice leads to hypertrophy of fast glycolytic fibers [74]. Pnf4, important for actin polymerization [75] was also downregulated in both soleus and D. melanogaster larvae.2.4.3. Comparison of Space Flown Adult D. melanogaster and Fast Twitch Mammalian Muscles We next compared adult D. melanogaster to the mouse muscles. Spaceflight led to 459 DEGs (FDR<0.05) in adult D. melanogaster (Supplementary Table S14). Of these, we found 101 that are orthologous to mouse genes, which were used for ORA (Supplementary Table S15). Four of the DEGs were found to be shared with the mouse EDL dataset. Genes that showed upregulation of expression in the two datasets were found to be involved in chromatin scaffolding (Ppp1r10) and replication (Mcm6). Ppm1l, downregulated in both datasets, is a negative regulator of stress and inflammatory cytokines. Hence, its downregulation in the EDL is consistent with an increased immune response [76]. Also dysregulated was Hspg2, which encodes an ECM protein.2.4.4. Comparison of Space Flown Adult D. melanogaster with Mouse Soleus A comparison of adult D. melanogaster DEGs with soleus DEGs (FDR < 0.1) revealed 12 shared genes shown in Table 4. Genes that are upregulated in both datasets include a myosin protein ligase (Mylip) involved in muscle atrophy, previously reported to be induced by glucocorticoids [77]. Also upregulated were genes encoding a helicase protein Mcm2 involved in replication and the pro-survival gene, Ppm11, which negatively regulates SAPK-mediated apoptosis. However, Jarid2 was also upregulated in both, which represses pro-cell cycle genes [78]. Additionally, Cbs which takes part in the transulfuration pathways in cysteine production, is also upregulated. Genes that are downregulated in both datasets encode a nucleoporin (Nup37), a polymerase (Polr2e) and Dnajb4, the suppression of which has been linked to decreased growth [79]. Genes upregulated in D. melanogaster but downregulated in mouse soleus include the helicase subunit (Mcm6) and genes involved in cysteine production (Gnmt), calcium signaling (Inpp5a), and limb development (Fjx1).

Comparison between Ground-Based Unloading Models and Muscles from Space Flown Mice 2.5.1. Comparison between Gastrocnemius from Hindlimb Unloaded and Space Flown Mice To gain insight on shared transcriptomic signatures of ground-based unloading models and space flown mice, a transcriptomic analysis was conducted on RNA of gastrocnemius from space flown mice and a time and age-matched HU study (GLDS-21). Analyses revealed 75 DEGs (p < 0.05) in the gastrocnemius from hindlimb unloading (HU) mice (Supplementary Table S16) and 115 DEGs (p < 0.05) in the gastrocnemius from space flown mice (Supplementary Table S17). The top upregulated genes in the HU model have roles in UPR (Hspa1b, Hspa1a, Atsf3), and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism (Fasn, Ppargc1a). Proto-oncogenes Fos and Jun were also upregulated in HU mice. In contrast, a previous study reported upregulation of Fos and Jun in human muscle after exercise [80]. Additionally, the top 10 most downregulated genes include mitochondrial genes such as Idh2, which takes part in the electron transport chain, Bdh1 involved in ketone metabolism, and Ldhb, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. ORA performed on DEGs from gastrocnemius of HU mice (Supplementary Table S18) revealed differential regulation of stress responses (GO:0033554, GO:0009628), as well as muscle tissue proliferation (GO:0048659), differentiation (GO:0035914) and development (GO:0007519). Conversely, the top upregulated genes in the gastrocnemius from space flown mice include Mt1 and Mt2, genes that have antioxidant activity and glucocorticoid response elements [81]. We also found upregulation of a number of tumor suppressor genes such as Btg2, Cebpd, Gadd45g, Cdkn1a and Tp53inp1 [82,83,84,85,86], suggesting reduced growth and proliferation. Cidec, which codes for a protein that promotes lipid droplet formation in adipocytes [87], was also upregulated. ORA of upregulated DEGs in spaceflight gastrocnemius (Supplementary Table S18) suggests a stress response as shown by differential regulation of GC signaling (GO:0071385). ORA also revealed upregulation of glucose metabolism (GO:0032868) in the gastrocnemius from space flown mice, suggesting alterations in energy homeostasis. A comparison of DEGs in HU and spaceflight gastrocnemius revealed five shared genes with similar patterns of regulation. DEGs upregulated in both datasets suggest that HU and spaceflight both lead to altered circadian rhythm (Nfil3), regulation of proliferation (Btg2) and changes to endothelial adhesion (Cyr61), and scaffolding of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (Musk), which may potentially alter muscle function. Additionally, Bdh1, a gene involved in metabolism of ketone bodies, is downregulated in both datasets. This is consistent with a previous study showing an increase in ketone bodies such as 3-hydroxybutyrate in liver of mice flown on STS-135 [54].2.5.2. Comparison of Muscles from Bed Rest Study and Space Flown Mice Next, we investigated shared transcriptomic responses between representative mixed fiber type muscles, and vastus lateralis muscles (VL) obtained from a bedrest study ( GEO GSE24215/GLDS-370) (349 DEGs, ± 1.5 FC, p < 0.05, Supplementary Table S19) versus quadriceps of space flown mice (887 DEGs, p < 0.05), Supplementary Table S20). Eight genes were shared between these datasets (Table 5). Upregulated in both datasets was Tbc1d12 involved in increasing glucose uptake [88], whereas the shared downregulated genes included Ptp4a3, the downregulation of which increases expression of ECM genes [89], and Fbxo40, the downregulation of which has been observed in muscular dystrophy [90]. Additionally, Ssmpx, a gene induced by stretching of muscles, was downregulated in the human VL but upregulated in mouse quadriceps [91]. ORA of DEGs in human VL (Supplementary Table S21) revealed downregulation of nucleotide metabolism (GO:0009117, GO:0006753) and oxidation-reduction processes usually associated with oxidative phosphorylation (GO:0055114). Conversely, ORA results for mouse quadriceps (Supplementary Table S22) showed downregulation of protein metabolism (GO:0030163, GO:0044257, GO:0051603, and GO:0006511) and a response to stress (GO:0033554).

Discussion 3.1. Mechanisms of Muscle Atrophy Resistance Skeletal muscles are highly adaptive to changes in mechanical forces and display a robust regenerative capacity. In response to weight-bearing or cell damage, cells can initiate pro-survival signaling pathways that increase cell viability and growth, maintain cell number homeostasis, and allow proliferation to meet functional needs. Analysis of the transcriptomic response in the EDL from space flown animals reveals enrichment and overrepresentation of gene sets involved in necrosis, wound healing, immune response, and proliferation, which altogether may suggest a compensatory proliferation in reaction to cell damage. Since mature muscles cells do not divide, the enrichment of proliferative terms may represent the recruitment of satellite cells, which then differentiate into new myofibers [92] to achieve muscle regeneration after cellular insult [93]. This hypothesis is supported by enrichment of developmental GO terms and the upregulation of genes such as Fos and Pax3 known to be expressed in activated satellite cells during muscle cell development and in early muscle regeneration post trauma [94,95]. Previous studies also show tissue regeneration markers of satellite cell activation in murine quadriceps during spaceflight [96]. Spaceflight and its analogs can lead to impaired immunity [97,98,99,100,101,102]. A more robust immune response in the EDL may also indicate damage and repair events in this muscle, given the role the immune system plays in the regeneration process [103,104]. In the EDL, the upregulation of Il15, which codes for an immune modulating cytokine previously noted to confer hypertrophic effects. Increased Il15 expression may contribute to regeneration and prevent excessive atrophy in response to unloading [105]. Additionally, these results also suggest changes to vasculature, which may impact nutrient availability and therefore growth. Previous work on the HU model revealed impaired vasodilation [106] and vasoconstriction [107] in feed arteries of weight bearing plantar flexors. Similarly, radiation exposure has been shown to impact development in human vessel models [108]. The involvement of the above mentioned differentially expressed genes in skeletal muscle atrophy can be tested in future spaceflight experiments. A genetic mechanism that may contribute to the difference in sensitivity to atrophy between the EDL and soleus may involve regulation of PDEs, which hydrolyze and tightly control cAMP/cGMP. cAMP/cGMP are ubiquitous second messenger signaling molecules known to protect against atrophy, increase myofiber size, and promote conversion to faster glycolytic fibers [109]. Our results showed downregulation of phosphodiesterase genes (Pde2a) in the EDL suggesting increased cAMP/gAMP signaling. In contrast, the upregulation of Pde2a, along with five other phosphodiesterase genes (Pde3a, Pde4a, Pde4b, Pde4c, Pde9a) in the soleus suggests decreased cAMP/cGMP signaling. Further work is needed to define levels of cAMP signaling in different muscle types during spaceflight and whether this pathway can be exploited to prevent muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Additionally, in the EDL, a long non-coding RNA (Lncbate10) was upregulated, which is known to protect Pgc1α from repression in adipose tissues [44]. This coincides with the upregulation of Pgc1α, a gene whose expression is also known to protect against atrophy [110]. The expression of Lncbate10 has been shown to be induced by high cAMP concentrations, consistent with the downregulation of the cAMP regulator, Pde2a [44]. Spaceflight is known to induce slow-to-fast muscle fiber conversion [111]. In addition to Pgc1α upregulation in the EDL, we also observed the upregulation of Mettl21e, both of which are known to drive hypertrophy of type II myofibers [45,112]. Additionally, we observed the downregulation of Vegfa in the soleus, which was not observed in the EDL. This suggests opposing regulation of a key growth signal in vasculature of the two muscle types, which influence nutrient availability and ultimately, the propensity for muscle growth.3.2. Glucocorticoids and the Circadian Rhythm The enrichment of glucocorticoid (GC) signaling suggests that spaceflight led to upregulation of the stress response. This is consistent with the reported rise in plasma and urine cortisol levels observed in certain but not all of spaceflight studies [113,114]. GCs are steroidal signaling molecules with many roles including the regulation of energy homeostasis. They can cause the breakdown of amino acids and a decrease in insulin sensitivity, which were previously observed in the soleus [115]. GCs can also induce expression of clock genes via GC response elements and may therefore have a role in perturbing the circadian rhythm and sleep cycles during spaceflight [22,116,117,118]. The disturbance of the circadian rhythm in both muscles (EDL and soleus) may also negatively impact muscle mass. For example, knockout of a key circadian gene, Bmal in mice led to premature aging including sarcopenia [119]. Perturbations in GC and the circadian signaling have been implicated in disorders such as metabolic syndrome, [120,121,122], sleep disturbances [123,124], immune dysregulation [100,125,126] and cataracts [127]. Hence, these signaling pathways may potentially represent therapeutic targets for the detrimental effects of spaceflight.3.3. Spaceflight Alters Mechanosensing and Neuronal Signaling in Mouse Muscle Transcriptomic analysis of muscles from space flown mice revealed alterations in signaling pathways involved in mechanotransduction and neuromuscular communication. For example, results showed downregulation of Stum in the EDL, which encodes a protein important for the sensing of mechanical stimuli in proprioceptive neurons [128]. This finding is consistent with the effects of unloading and reduced proprioception observed during spaceflight [128,129]. Similarly, we observed enrichment of genes involved in Rho signaling, one of the pathways that can promote stress fiber formation [130]. Contractility changes in stress fibers is thought to be one the mechanisms by which mechanical forces exerted on the extracellular matrix (ECM) can be sensed by a cell [131]. We also found differential expression of a number of genes involved in neuron excitability such as Grin2b, the dysregulation of which leads to decreased muscle tone [132]. In the soleus, the enrichment of gene sets involved in nervous system development and negative axon extension and the downregulation of neurogenesis (GO:0022008) suggest changes to motor neuron signaling.3.4. C. elegans Shows Similarity to Mouse Fast Twitch Muscle Responses to Spaceflight Rodents have been widely used to extrapolate human responses to spaceflight due to their significant genetic, physiological, and anatomical similarities. C. elegans, however, have been widely used to study developmental processes since at least 83% of the proteome has a human homologue and ~8000 of its proteins have matching human gene transcripts [133]. The use of C. elegans as a spaceflight model has advantages over rodent models such as their relatively simpler maintenance requirements and smaller body size that allows for a larger number of individuals to be flown in space. In addition, C. elegans allows the use of genetic and molecular tools to dissect specific pathways and can be used for the analysis of potential countermeasures. A caveat of our comparison is that the transcriptomics was performed on a population of animals of mixed ages, and that nematodes contain multiple tissues—neurons, gut, reproductive tissue, in addition to muscles. Understanding how responses in C. elegans mirror mammalian responses to spaceflight may allow for better extrapolation to mammalian results. While the comparison between C. elegans and mouse muscles revealed differences in spaceflight-induced regulation of developmental genes, there was a shared increase in proliferation-related terms with the more atrophy resistant EDL. Similarly, we posit that C. elegans may resist muscle atrophy through shared increased cAMP signaling as indicated by the downregulation of Pde4b, encoding a cAMP regulatory enzyme, variants of which were upregulated in the soleus. The more proliferative transcriptomic signature in C. elegans is more similar to that of the EDL, suggesting shared mechanisms of resistance and may point to a utility for the organism in anticipating responses of fast twitch muscle fibers. Additionally, while C. elegans have been used for uncovering mechanisms of innate immunity analogous to humans, their immune response to spaceflight was not comparable to that seen in fast or slow twitch muscle. This may be due to the lack of an adaptive immune system in C. elegans [134].3.5. Discrete Life Stages of D. melanogaster May Have Distinct Utility for Studying Muscle Types Establishing shared responses to spaceflight between D. melanogaster and mammalian muscles also may be of value in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight. D. melanogaster are desirable as flight payloads due to their relatively small experimental footprint and their ease of maintenance. A comparison between different life stages of D. melanogaster and mammalian fast and slow twitch muscles revealed that discrete fly life stages may have differing utility for modeling certain features of the response to spaceflight in these mammalian muscle types. For example, an increase in protein metabolism as well as the downregulation of the UPR, two key features of the soleus response, were observed in D. melanogaster larvae. Conversely, protein metabolism was downregulated in adult D. melanogaster and not observed in the fast twitch EDL. This may suggest stage-dependent differences in metabolism. Moreover, other features of mature adult D. melanogaster are more akin to the fast twitch muscle, including an increase in amino acid production, calcium signaling and limb morphogenesis suggesting an environment with more growth signals. With regards to metabolism, the increase in expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport in adult D. melanogaster is akin to that of the EDL. However, adult D. melanogaster also shows a shared degradation of myosin protein with slow twitch muscle EDL. Furthermore, we also found a similar stress response between space flown adult D. melanogaster and mouse fast twitch muscle as indicated by differential regulation of circadian rhythm and antioxidant response genes. Spaceflight and analog studies using D. melanogaster may allow for greater mechanistic insight on muscle gene regulation under spaceflight conditions. To date, on-orbit sampling of invertebrate models has mostly involved whole animals due to the logistical challenges of performing microdissections of tissues. Transcriptomic signatures can vary across muscle types and such differences may not be captured when analyzing the overall transcriptome from the whole organism. For example, each muscle type in D. melanogaster has a discrete pattern of isoform expression of Troponin, which regulates thin filament contraction [30,135]. We found that these isoforms are also differentially expressed in both spaceflight and analog experiments, consistent with a previous report [30]. Advances in sample preservation and in situ dissections on orbit will greatly improve our ability to gain mechanistic knowledge from smaller model organisms.3.6. Differential Regulation of ECM in Spaceflight across Organismal Models Our results indicate differential regulation of ECM-related processes in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and rodent EDL in response to spaceflight. Specifically, C. elegans showed downregulation of ECM organization and cell adhesion gene sets while these were upregulated in the EDL. Similarly, there was downregulation of ECM genes Hspg2, Prcp in larval D. melanogaster, while these genes were upregulated in the EDL. Hspg2 encodes Perlecan, which is involved in ECM organization [135]. PRCP activates Prekallikrein, which cleaves fibronectin, a component of the ECM [136]. Hspg2 was also differentially regulated in adult D. melanogaster. Comparison of vastus lateralis from bedrest and quadriceps from space flown mice also revealed a shared upregulation of Ptp4a3, the downregulation of which increases expression of ECM genes [89]. These results suggest a general trend of increased expression of ECM-related genes in rodents and humans compared to downregulation in smaller model organisms such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans. The ECM plays important roles in a plethora of biological processes ranging from growth, migration, structural organization, barrier formation, and the immune response [137]. It is also impacted by spaceflight or simulated microgravity, as part of the mechanotransduction pathways involving integrins and mechanically activated ion channels [138]. The differences in the direction of regulation of ECM-related genes may be due to differences in body or tissue structure (hence differing ECM composition) and the differences in the timing of sampling and duration of flight. However, differential expression of ECM-related genes in all spaceflight models and analogs tested in this study suggest that ECM remodeling is likely to be a universal response to spaceflight.3.7. Transcriptomic Signatures of Spaceflight Models and Analogs Exhibit Similarities and Key Differences Ground-based analogs such as HU have proven useful in anticipating many aspects of the musculoskeletal response to microgravity. Analysis of the transcriptome of the gastrocnemius from space flown rodents and a time-matched HU study revealed differences in transcriptomic signatures between these two models, particularly in the direction of regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, circadian rhythm, endothelial cell adhesion, and motor neuron signaling. These changes are consistent with musculoskeletal atrophy, gait changes, sleep disturbances, and altered vascular function in humans that experienced spaceflight. However, we recognize that experimental limitations may impact comparative analysis of ground-based and spaceflight studies in rodents. Specifically, differences in animal handling and housing of space and ground-based rodent models can potentially affect the results. The use of appropriate housing controls and introduction of manipulations in controls that consider the additional handling associated with sending payloads to space (e.g., transport in ground vehicles, landing forces, light-dark cycle changes) may minimize the confounding factors when comparing findings from ground-based versus spaceflight rodent studies. We also compared muscles from a rodent spaceflight and human bedrest study, two of the relatively resource intensive approaches to modeling human responses to spaceflight. Both have key advantages relative to ground-based rodent models. The former is expected to reflect mammalian responses to actual spaceflight and the later, actual human physiological responses to unloading. We found that representative mixed fiber type muscles in HU mice and humans on bedrest (quadriceps and VL, respectively) share similarities in differential expression of Tbc1d12, a gene involved in glucose uptake. In addition, Fbxo40, a gene that is also upregulated in a denervation model for muscle atrophy [90] is similarly responsive to both spaceflight in rodents and bedrest. Further, FBXO40 functions as a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that is regulated by activated STAT3, thereby increasing insulin resistance in mice under 1G conditions [139]. Upregulation of both Tbc1d12 and Fbxo40 in bedrest and rodent spaceflight models is consistent with reported perturbations in glucose metabolism observed in humans in space [140]. These findings provide a rationale for testing whether targeting Fbxo40 and its signaling partners will be useful in mitigating muscle atrophy and altered glucose metabolism in both spaceflight and Earth-based scenarios.4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Datasets Used in This Study Table 1 lists the various datasets used in this study. These datasets can be found in NASA GeneLab and are cited in these references [24,25,37,38,39,40,41]. The datasets involving mice flown on the ISS make use of the NASA Rodent Research notation for the various experimental groups. Specifically, NASA RR-1 validation mice consisted of four groups to also enable assessment of the contributions of age and cage configuration. These include Spaceflight (FLT) and Ground Control (GC) groups, which both make use of the NASA rodent habitat. The GC group was run with a 4-day delay to allow for replication of actual temperature, gas partial pressures, and humidity conditions of the FLT group. In addition, a baseline (Basal) group was euthanized on Earth one day after launch to compare changes in both the FLT and GC groups. Lastly, a Vivarium (Viv) control comprising mice maintained in standard housing was also included to determine the impact of the mouse habitat hardware in the results obtained from the FLT and GC groups. Refer to [17] for further details. NASA GeneLab generated omics data from the following comparisons: Basal vs Viv controls, GC vs Viv controls, FLT vs GC [17]. In this work, we focus on the GC and FLT groups. A number of bedrest studies focusing on muscle have been published, with a variety of assay approaches (coding and non-coding RNA), main experimental variables, and tissue collection schemes [24,141,142]. For this current analysis, we selected a transcriptomic dataset from a previous bedrest study [24] based on availability of raw expression data from coding RNA.4.2. Processed RNAseq Data Differential expression data of RNA-seq datasets (GLDS-99, 103 and 104) were downloaded from NASA GeneLab. The NASA GeneLab online database describes the standard analysis pipeline used to generate this processed data. Briefly, the percentage of rRNA in raw fastq files was assessed using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and then filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). The quality of both raw and trimmed reads was evaluated with FastQC [143] (version 0.118), while MultiQC [144] (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Indexes for Mus musculus genome were generated with genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf using STAR [145] (version 2.7.1a). Processed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were then quantified using RSEM [146] (version 1.3.1). Quantification data was imported to R [147] (version 3.6.0) with tximport [148] (version 1.14.0) and normalized with DESeq2 [149] (version 1.26.0). Differential expression analysis was conducted in R (version 3.6.0) using DESeq2 (version 1.26.0). All groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb [150], PANTHER.db [151], and org.Mm.eg.db [152]. Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 [153] was performed on expression data from space flown subjects against ground controls to assess gene level changes in these muscles and use in downstream pathway analysis.4.3. Processing of Microarray Data For Affymetrix microarray datasets (GLDS-3 and GLDS-21), the raw expression data were downloaded from NASA GeneLab database. The data were normalized using the ‘affyNormQC.R’ r script applying the RMA algorithm through the oligo R package with default parameters. The ‘affyNormQC.R’ r script was also used to generate quality control with parameter ‘do.logtranspaceflightorm’ set to TRUE. The microarray experiments were annotated with the r script ‘annotateProbes.R’, which employed Annotation-Db class probe annotations specific to the chip used in each experiment from the Bioconductor repository. In cases where multiple probes mapped to the same gene ID, representative probes were selected with the highest mean normalized intensity across all samples. The limmaDiffExp.R r script was used to perform differential gene expression analysis on normalized expression data to perform pair-wise comparisons for all groups. For each probe set, the variance of mean signal intensities was estimated, improved by an empirical Bayes method for combining variances of probes showing similar variability, and the significance of the difference between the means was evaluated with a t-test to obtain p values. p values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate [154,155]. Raw Agilent microarray data (GLDS-113 and GLDS-370) were downloaded from NASA GeneLab. Data were analyzed using Gene Spring software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Background correction was performed using the ‘normexp’ method (with offset = 50), and between array normalization was performed utilizing the quantile normalization method with a log2 transformation. Control probes and those without a RefSeq ID were removed, while probes mapping to the same RefSeq ID were collapsed by mean expression (leaving ~20,700 genes for analysis). All datasets used are outlined in Table 1 and anatomical locations of mammalian muscles are shown in Figure 1.4.4. Pathway Analysis First, differential expression analysis (DEA) was performed to reveal DEGs, the top 10 of which sorted by fold change values were used to pinpoint central players that orchestrate the response to spaceflight. ORA using WebGestalt [156] was then performed on DEGs to determine enriched gene ontology terms (Log2 FC > 0.32 or < -0.32, FDR adjusted p < 0.05). A variance stabilizing transformation was applied to the count data from datasets GLDS-99 and GLDS-104, and a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed with FDR threshold of < 0.1 using Cytoscape [157]. The EnrichmentMap and Autoannotate Cytoscape plugins were used to visualize and annotate clusters of overlapping gene sets to help identify overarching enriched functional themes and aid in the interpretation of the effects of spaceflight in distinct muscle types. A comparative analysis was performed on the results from each muscle.5. Conclusions This study aimed to determine the effects of spaceflight on the transcriptome of distinct mammalian muscle types and to define shared transcriptomic signatures across a variety of model organisms. Our analyses revealed that spaceflight elicited both shared and discrete responses in representative slow and fast twitch muscle types (soleus and EDL respectively). The shared responses between these muscle types include altered expression of genes involved in GC stress responses and the circadian rhythm. These two muscle types displayed differences in transcriptomic signatures pertaining to immune function and cellular growth, with the EDL exhibiting greater degree of differential regulation of these processes based on the number of differentially expressed genes between spaceflight and ground samples. Additionally, EDL and soleus showed differences in the transcriptomic response of genes involved in ER stress mechanisms. Our findings also highlight the possible role of Pde2a as a key molecule that may confer the atrophy resistance seen in the EDL. We also found that the muscle specific Ubiquitin E ligase Fbxo40 was downregulated across models for muscle atrophy (bedrest and spaceflight), suggesting a possible target for countermeasures development. These results were also used as a backdrop for the comparison to spaceflight responses of non-mammalian models. The molecular signature of C. elegans in response to spaceflight showed greater similarity to that of the EDL. Furthermore, the transcriptomic signature of the larval stage of D. melanogaster showed more similarity to the slow twitch muscle soleus. In contrast, the response of adult D. melanogaster was more akin to that of fast twitch muscle EDL. Muscles from rodent spaceflight and human bedrest studies indicate alterations in glucose homeostasis and circadian rhythm which are consistent with findings in humans that experienced spaceflight. As expected for a highly resource intensive data collection endeavor, spaceflight omics datasets are rare and can have differences in experiment designs. One of the advantages of applying unbiased bioinformatics analyses of gene expression data is that patterns, differences, or similarities in the regulation of biological processes can be observed from a relatively small number of datasets. We have demonstrated that such an approach can be used to continue to gain insight on the shared responses across model organisms and also between ground and flight analogs for microgravity. However, we recognize limitations in this study, including the possibility that differing experiment designs across datasets such as duration of flight, relative life stage and gender and sex can impact the results obtained. In addition, several datasets yielded a relatively small number of differentially expressed genes, which can limit the ability to find shared molecular signatures across multiple datasets. As more spaceflight and analog datasets become available from the various model organisms, follow-up analyses can be conducted using the approach we have employed. We anticipate that doing so will reveal additional shared mechanisms across the model organisms of spaceflight. Although the use of invertebrate models such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans show promise in anticipating select spaceflight responses of specific muscles, our findings also confirm the marked differences in molecular signatures across these model organisms when dissections are not possible. Hence, the use of rodents to extrapolate human responses to spaceflight continue to have major advantages from a physiology perspective versus classic non-mammalian genetic model systems such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans. However, our findings raise the possibility of using invertebrate models as a first step toward conducting precision animal research in future deep space missions.Acknowledgments GeneLab data are courtesy of the NASA GeneLab Data Repository [158].

    "abstract": "Abstract Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis. However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.",
    "introduction": "Introduction Streptococcus mutans is a primary causative agent of dental caries, demonstrated by its isolation from carious tooth lesions in humans,1 its ability to initiate caries in germ-free rodent models of infection,2 and the established link between high levels of this bacterium in the oral cavity and active caries.3 Although preventable by fluoridation of water and various dental procedures,4, caries remains the most common chronic disease among children, and remains untreated in up to 30% of adults over 35 years-old.5 S. mutans transient bacteremias can also initiate endocarditis in at-risk patient groups.6 Successful colonization of the oral cavity and persistence in multi-species dental plaque by S. mutans is inherently dependent on both its ability to form biofilm and its rapid metabolism of carbohydrates by the glycolytic pathway. The low pH that results from accumulation of acidic metabolic end-products favors the growth of S. mutans and other acid-tolerant species relative to healthy plaque microflora, as well as the eventual demineralization of tooth enamel and the development of caries. Adherence of S. mutans to the tooth surface and subsequent biofilm development are mediated by several bacterial factors, including production of sucrose-dependent extracellular glucan polymers by glucosyltransferase enzymes,7 specific cell surface adhesins,8, 9 the major autolysin AtlA,10 the quorum-sensing competence (com) system,11 and extracellular DNA.12 To protect the health of astronauts during space flight missions, it is critical to understand the effects of this environment on both host biology and the host microbiota. Simulated microgravity exposure has been shown to cause increased mandibular and alveolar bone loss13 and decreased saliva flow,14 significant predisposing host factors that could contribute to development of caries and/or periodontal disease. Traditionally, the approach to maintaining astronaut oral health during space flight missions has been routed in preventative dentistry, whereby astronauts are subjected to rigorous preflight dental screening and treatment.15 However, in the face of future long-term space flight missions, research and discovery of new methods for maintaining oral hygiene and dental health under a microgravity environment are required.15 Previous studies on the effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiota have primarily focused on culture-dependent methods of quantifying the numbers of oral bacteria in human subjects before and after spaceflight.16–18 Furthermore, astronauts have been shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight.16 However, assessment of the physiology and virulence potential of oral pathogens such as S. mutans under controlled microgravity analog conditions has been relatively lacking. In this respect, rotating wall vessel bioreactors are a common technology used to grow bacteria under microgravity analog conditions in ground-based studies. When completely filled with media (lacking air bubbles or “head space”) and rotated on the axis perpendicular to the Earth’s gravitational vector, these reactors maintain a low-shear environment (<1 dyn/cm2) whereby gravitational vectors are randomized over the surface of the cells or particles contained within the vessel.19 As such, this simulated environment models “weightlessness” by counteracting gravitational forces that would otherwise promote cellular sedimentation.19,20 The low-shear force experienced in this microgravity analog system boasts the additional advantage of mimicking the low-shear force of saliva flow (<0.8 dyn/cm2) experienced by plaque bacteria in the oral cavity.21 In this study, high-aspect rotating vessels (HARVs) were therefore used to ascertain the effects of simulated microgravity on S. mutans gene expression, physiology, oxidative stress resistance, and competence, using both culture-dependent and “-omic” (metabolomics and RNA-seq) approaches.",

    "results": "Results S. mutans HARV growth curves and cell aggregation To probe the effect of simulated microgravity growth on S. mutans, continuous growth curves (whereby cell samples were removed from the same HARV at different time points) were performed (n = 3 independent experiments each) in biofilm media (BM) containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose over a 24 h period. In this analysis, no statistically significant differences in CFU/ml at each time point were observed (Supplemental Fig. S1). An initial decrease in CFU/ml was observed in both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures between t = 0 (time of inoculation) and t = 2 h growth, which was likely a function of sucrose-dependent cell aggregation. Very small differences in cell viability patterns in early stationary phase (6–8 h growth) suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV culture may have entered stationary phase slightly sooner than the normal gravity HARV culture in this experiment. As well, the simulated microgravity culture persisted in stationary phase until approximately 12 h growth, followed by a somewhat rapid death phase, with a 1-log loss of viability between 12 and 24 h growth. In contrast, the viability of normal gravity culture underwent a more gradual decrease in cell viability between 12 and 24 h of growth. Monitoring of cell growth by CFU/ml in the continuous growth curve experiments described above required constant disruption of the HARV cultures, making it difficult to assess potential macroscopic differences in cell aggregation in the simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions. Therefore, these growth curves were also performed using an “end-point” approach, whereby simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (n = 2 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) were grown undisturbed in replicate HARV vessels for t = 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h (Fig. 1). Using this end-point approach, no significant differences in CFU/ml were observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures at the assessed time points (Fig. 1), and the initial drop in CFU/ml observed early in the growth curves of the continuous cultures (Supplemental Fig. S1) was not observed in these end-point cultures. As well, both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures underwent the same pattern of growth when monitored with this end-point approach: Log phase growth occurred between 0 and 6 h, and both cultures were in early stationary phase at 8 h growth, followed by entry into late stationary phase/death phase between 24 and 48 h growth. Interestingly, differences in macroscopic cell aggregation were consistently observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV conditions when using the end-point growth analysis. Specifically, the simulated microgravity condition tended to form round/compact cellular structures, whereas the aggregates in the normal gravity growth condition tended to form less compact structures (Fig. 2). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab End-point growth curve analysis of S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures. Simulated microgravity (dark gray bars) and normal gravity (light gray bars) HARV end-point growth was measured by serial dilution and CFU/ml plating at t = 0 (time of inoculation; average of n = 4 independent experiments), and t = 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h postinoculation (average of n = 2 independent experiments per time point per growth condition), as described in “Materials and methods”. The vertical dotted line on the graph indicates that the t = 24 and 48 h data were obtained in a separate experimental run from the t = 4, 6, 8, and 12 h time points. Error bars = standard error of the mean (SEM)Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Representative S. mutans end-point HARV cultures grown for 8 h in biofilm media under simulated microgravity (a) and normal gravity (b) conditions. Note the structural differences of the self-aggregating bacterial cells under each condition (indicated by arrows) Metabolomics analysis of “end-point” HARV cultures To monitor potential differences in the metabolome of simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures, cell pellets and culture supernatants were harvested from a second end-point HARV culture experiment (n = 3 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) at t = 4, t = 8, and t = 24 h samples, corresponding to log-phase, early stationary phase, and late stationary/death phase, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). Given that macroscopic differences in the self-aggregating clusters of S. mutans cells were consistently observed at the t = 8 h time point (Fig. 2), RNA-seq analysis was also performed on the t = 8 h samples. Principle component analysis (PCA) of metabolomics data generated from t = 4, 8, and 24 h HARV cultures (Supplemental Files S2 and S3) revealed a strong relationship between the time of growth (t = 4, 8, and 24 h) and metabolite profile for each of the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures (Fig. 3). However, a much weaker “time-treatment” relationship existed when comparing the metabolite profile between simulated microgravity vs. normal gravity cultures at each time point. Welch’s two sample t tests revealed 8, 14, and 10 statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in cellular metabolite production between cells grown under normal gravity and microgravity conditions at the 4, 8, and 24 h time points, respectively (Supplemental File S2). Likewise, 21, 21, and 23 statistically significant differences were observed between the corresponding culture supernatant samples at these time points (Supplemental File S3). Keeping in mind the caveat that the number of significant differences at each time point were close to that expected by random chance alone (5% error rate), the significant changes of cell-associated and supernatant metabolites of the 8 h HARV cultures are summarized in Table 1, and their potential relationship to the corresponding 8 h RNA-seq data are discussed below.

Compared to the metabolomics data, differential expression analysis of the 8 h RNA-seq data revealed a large number of statistically significant gene expression changes in normal gravity relative to simulated microgravity growth (Supplemental File S4). Specifically, 94 genes were up-regulated (log2 fold-change ≥1.0) and 153 genes were down-regulated (log2 fold-change ≤−1.0) in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity cultures. These patterns in gene expression were confirmed by qPCR for a subset of genes (Supplemental Table S1). Functional classification (Fig. 4) revealed that expression of a large number of genes associated with transposon sequences, as well as several genes encoding predicted phage proteins, were down-regulated in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity growth. A second trend of interest was the significant down-regulated expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including various phosphotransferase (PTS) systems, the carbon catabolite protein regulator ccpA, and the redox sensitive transcriptional regulator rex, in the 8 h normal gravity cultures relative to the simulated microgravity cultures (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4). Increased expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs and other aspects of protein translation was also observed in the normal gravity cultures compared to simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of a large number of genes encoding transcriptional regulators was decreased in the normal gravity cultures (Fig. 4). As well, altered expression of stress genes was also observed in the normal gravity HARV cultures, including decreased expression of the toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems mazEF (SMU_172/173) and relBE (SMU_895/896), decreased expression of the holin-like lrgA, decreased expression of the peroxide resistance gene dpr, and increased expression of genes encoding glutathione S-transferase (SMU_1296) and glutaredoxin (SMU_669c) (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Distribution of gene functional categories differentially expressed during normal gravity growth relative to simulated microgravity. RNA isolated from 8 h normal gravity and simulated microgravity S. mutans HARV cultures (n = 3 independent experiments per growth condition) was subjected to RNA-seq transcriptome profiling as described in “Materials and methods”. Differential expression and statistical analysis was carried out using a cutoff FDR-adjusted p value of 0.05. Of this dataset, those genes with a log2 (fold-change) value of at least ±1.0 were grouped by functional classification based on DAVID gene functional categorization analysis,  gene annotations and KEGG pathway analysis. Total number of up-regulated genes (log2 fold-change ≥1.0, black bars) = 94, total number of down-regulated genes (log2 fold-change ≤ −1.0, gray bars) = 153DAVID bioinformatics resource22, 23 was used to further probe the RNA-seq dataset for functional annotation groups that were enriched in the genes that displayed a log2 fold change expression of at least ±1.0 in the normal gravity vs. simulated microgravity HARV cultures (Supplemental Table S2). This analysis revealed the presence of four significant (enrichment scores ≥1.3) functional annotation clusters in the down-regulated normal gravity genes, which included genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport (cluster I), transcriptional regulators (clusters II and III), and carbohydrate transporters/other membrane proteins (cluster IV). As well, functional annotation clusters involved in arginine metabolism (cluster V) and nucleoside/tRNA metabolism (cluster VI) were significantly enriched (enrichment scores ≥1.3) in the up-regulated normal gravity genes. To identify metabolic pathways potentially altered under the simulated microgravity growth condition, all statistically-significant changes in 8 h growth gene expression from the RNA-seq differential expression analysis with a minimum log2 fold-change of at least ±0.6 were also analyzed using the bioinformatics program Metacyc.24. The top metabolic pathways identified by this analysis were mixed acid fermentation (seven genes), arginine biosynthesis (six genes), and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis (five genes) (Supplemental Fig. S3). Specifically, genes involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutarate (a TCA cycle intermediate), arginine biosynthesis, and dCDP/dTMP biosynthesis were upregulated in the normal gravity HARV cultures, whereas genes involved in ethanol and acetate fermentation were down-regulated in normal gravity HARV cultures. Interestingly, when comparing these metabolic pathways to statistically-significant changes in cellular metabolites at 8 h growth (Table 1), several matched to the corresponding metabolic pathway changes (Supplemental Fig. S3) identified in the RNA-seq data by Metacyc, including 2-oxogluarate (alpha-ketoglutarate; mixed acid fermentation), pyruvate (mixed acid fermentation), argininosuccinate (arginine biosynthesis), uridine monophosphate and uracil (pyrmidine deoxynucleotide de novo biosynthesis). The apparent increased sensitivity of the RNA-seq data in detecting more changes in S. mutans metabolism relative to the corresponding metabolomics data may reflect a suboptimal component of the metabolomics sample collection method and/or processing time. Assessment of oxidative stress and competence phenotypes S. mutans encounters significant oxidative stress in the oral cavity in the form of H2O2 production by competing non-cariogenic oral streptococci,25,26 as well as from dental care products (toothpastes, mouthwash) that contain H2O2. Furthermore, expression of several oxidative stress-related genes (dpr, rex, SMU_1296, SMU_669c) was altered in the 8 h simulated microgravity HARV cultures. Therefore, the ability of S. mutans to survive exogenous H2O2 treatment was compared in cells isolated from exponential (t = 4), early-stationary (t = 8) and late stationary (t = 16) simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (Fig. 5). Although no significant differences in oxidative stress resistance were observed between normal gravity and simulated microgravity cells isolated from 4 and 8 h growth, the H2O2-treated 4 h cells (Fig. 5a) displayed a greater overall loss of viability (~1% survival after 90 min of treatment) compared to the 8 h cells (Fig. 5b; ~50% survival after 90 min of treatment). Interestingly, when this experiment was repeated on cells from normal gravity and simulated microgravity cultures harvested at 16 h growth (Fig. 5c), the simulated microgravity cells displayed significantly (P < 0.05, one-tailed T test) increased H2O2 killing (~22% survival after 60 min treatment) compared to the normal gravity cells (~43% survival after 60 min treatment). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Percent survival of S. mutans post-treatment with 5 mM H2O2. Cells from t = 4 (a), t = 8 (b), or t = 16 (c) hour simulated microgravity (triangles) and normal gravity (circles) HARV cultures (n = 3 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in sterile HBSS. Samples were withdrawn to determine initial CFU/ml (“t = 0”), and then H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. CFU/ml of each cell suspension was sampled at 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min post-H2O2 addition, and CFU/ml were determined. % Survival was calculated by 100 × [(t = final CFU/ml)/(t = 0 CFU/ml)]. Error bars = SEM. Asterisk denotes statistical significance, one-tailed t test (p < 0.05)Because previous S. mutans studies have implicated a complex link between oxidative stress, biofilm formation, and natural competence [reviewed in27], we were curious if competence was also subject to regulation by the low-shear modeled microgravity ﻿(LSMMG) environment. Therefore early-exponential phase (growth phase at which S. mutans is most competent during standard in vitro growth) simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures were tested for their ability to uptake plasmid DNA. However, transformation efficiency (as measured by uptake of a plasmid conferring erythromycin resistance) was nearly identical between simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (Fig. 6). The transformation efficiency was also not affected by HARV growth itself, as the HARV transformation efficiencies were similar to those measured in a parallel non-rotating culture of S. mutans (Fig. 6). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab S. mutans competence phenotype assessed in simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures. Simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures, as well as a parallel static Falcon tube control culture, were each grown for 1.5 h in biofilm media prior to addition of 2 µg pOri23 plasmid DNA. All three cultures were then grown for 2.5 more hours followed by harvest and serial dilution plating on BHI agar ± 10 µg/ml erythromycin (selective antibiotic to monitor plasmid transformation). Transformation efficiency was calculated as the percentage of transformants (CFU/ml on BHI + erythromycin) among total viable cells (CFU/ml on BHI).

    "discussion": "Discussion Although the effects of both spaceflight and microgravity analog growth on virulence-related phenotypes of bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus have been well-described,28–38 comparatively little research has been dedicated to studying the specific effects of space flight and simulated microgravity on virulence attributes of oral bacteria such as S. mutans. In the Skylab missions conducted in the 1970s, the effects of space flight and diet on the oral cavity and oral microbiota of astronauts were documented using culture-dependent methods. These studies demonstrated that increased counts of specific oral bacteria (i.e. Bacteriodes, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, S. sanguinus, and S. mutans) were recovered from the astronauts in response to space flight.16 Furthermore, the astronauts in these studies exhibited decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation.16 More recently, the effect of simulated microgravity on the physiology and biofilm structure of S. mutans was also assessed using a superconducting magnet capable of generating a large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF),39 which mimics the space-like gravity environment by achieving stable levitation of diamagnetic materials such as biological cells and tissues.40 The results of this study suggested that growth of S. mutans under simulated microgravity enhanced its acid tolerance, altered its biofilm architecture, and increased its proportion within dual-species biofilms co-cultured with S. sanguinis, an H2O2-producing early colonizer of dental plaque biofilm.39 Collectively, these previous studies suggest that both space flight and the microgravity analog environment have the ability to alter the cariogenic potential of S. mutans. In our current work, HARVs rotated on an axis perpendicular to the Earth’s gravitational vector were used to simulate a low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) growth environment. This ground-based model of microgravity has been used to study the response of a variety of microorganisms to “weightlessness” that would be encountered during space flight [reviewed in19, 41, 42]. However, it is important to keep in mind that the S. mutans LSMMG-associated metabolic and physiological changes (i.e. alterations in cell aggregation, transcriptome, and sensitivity to oxidative stress) presented here could represent the bacteria’s response to either simulated microgravity and/or low-fluid shear (<1 dyn/cm2) specific environmental signals, the latter of which may be relevant to the fluid shear of saliva flow (<0.8 dyn/cm2) experienced by S. mutans in the oral cavity.19,21 Therefore, the data obtained in this study have the potential to shed light on S. mutans physiology and virulence properties relevant to environmental signals experienced in the host, and will hopefully provide a springboard for planning future space flight studies of oral bacteria. It is also important to note that all of the S. mutans experiments presented in this study were conducted in semi-defined culture medium containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose, previously shown to promote in vitro S. mutans biofilm formation.43 The addition of sucrose, a host dietary sugar to which S. mutans is exposed to in the oral cavity, promotes production of extracellular glucan polymers by S. mutans, important biofilm matrix components that promote intracellular adhesion.7 In reality, the in vivo plaque biofilm environment of S. mutans is much more complex, including stress conditions such as interspecies competition for nutrients and space within the biofilm, as well as alternating periods of “feast and famine” with respect to dietary carbohydrate consumption. Therefore, the growth condition used in this study should be considered a simple representation of caries-promoting “feast” conditions experienced by S. mutans in the oral cavity. With these caveats in mind, the following discussion points represent interesting patterns/conclusions from the data obtained in this study: 1. S. mutans displays an altered early stationary-phase metabolism under simulated microgravity conditions: As indicated in the “Results” section and Fig. 1, S. mutans “end-point” simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures appear to enter stationary phase at the same point in growth (6 h) compared to normal gravity cultures, and there were no apparent differences in CFU/ml of each culture at each time point. This being said, the 8 h (early stationary phase) metabolomics and RNA-seq data suggest that S. mutans simulated microgravity metabolism at this point is altered relative to normal gravity growth. For example, simulated microgravity cultures experienced a ten-fold decrease in supernatant glucose levels (Table 1 and Supplemental File S3) at 8 h growth relative to the normal gravity cultures. Furthermore, expression of PTS system genes involved in transport of carbohydrates (glucose, mannitol, trehalose, mannose and cellobiose) was significantly upregulated during simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs, and other aspects of protein translation was decreased in the microgravity cultures at this time point (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4 ). Bioinformatics analysis also revealed patterns of decreased arginine metabolism and decreased pyrimidine biosynthesis (Supplemental Table S2 and Supplemental Fig. S3) in the 8 h simulated microgravity cultures. Finally, expression of genes encoding the central metabolic transcriptional regulators CcpA and Rex were also both upregulated (2.2-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively) at 8 h growth in the simulated microgravity cultures. CcpA has been shown to regulate S. mutans catabolite repression and the ability to utilize non-preferred carbohydrates, acid tolerance, acid production, and biofilm formation,44–46 whereas Rex regulates expression of S. mutans genes involved with carbohydrate fermentation, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress resistance in response to cellular redox.47,48 Interestingly, a role for Rex in the transcriptional response of Staphylococcus aureus to LSMMG was also previously implicated by the altered expression of a number of Rex-regulated genes under this growth condition.29 Although great care was taken in each experiment to vigorously vortex all samples prior to and during serial dilution plating, we cannot exclude the possibility that sucrose-dependent cell clumping may have masked more apparent growth differences between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity end-point HARV cultures in these studies. 2. S. mutans late stationary-phase simulated microgravity cultures appear to be subject to increased stress: A striking phenotypic property observed in S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures was the greatly increased sensitivity of cells from late stationary phase (16 h) to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5c) relative to cells from normal gravity cultures. However, no apparent differences in oxidative stress resistance were observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cells harvested at earlier time points (log phase and early stationary phase, Fig. 5a, b, respectively). This result correlated with the LG-HMF S. mutans microgravity study by Cheng and co-workers,39 which found that mid-exponential phase S. mutans microgravity and normal gravity cells did not differ in their sensitivity to H2O2. In previous studies, late stationary-phase (20–24 h) cultures of S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa were both shown to be more resistant to oxidative stress when grown in simulated microgravity,30,49 whereas S. typhimurium simulated microgravity cultures grown to an earlier phase of growth (10 h) displayed increased sensitivity to H2O2 treatment.31 Furthermore, the sensitivity of stationary phase simulated microgravity cultures of adherent-invasive E. coli to oxidative stress was shown to be strain-dependent.33 The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxidative stress when grown in LSMMG has also been previously investigated: compared to normal gravity growth, S. aureus cells isolated from simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased sensitivity to challenge with H2O2, which was demonstrated to be related to decreased carotenoid (yellow membrane pigment) production under this growth condition.29 These previously-published studies, in conjunction with the S. mutans results presented here, clearly demonstrate that the microgravity model used, growth phase at which oxidative stress is tested, and/or other inherent species and strain-dependent differences, make it difficult to discern broad conclusions regarding the effect of the LSMMG on oxidative stress resistance. Although direct comparisons cannot be extrapolated due to time point differences between the 8 h RNA-seq data (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4) and 16 h oxidative stress data (Fig. 5c), it is interesting to note that the 8 h simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased expression of genes previously-shown to be involved in the response to oxidative stress in S. mutans. These included lrgA, which encodes a predicted holin-like protein,50,51 dpr, encoding an iron-binding protein that reduces the intracellular free iron pool during oxidative stress,52,53 and rex.48 As well, S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased expression of genes encoding phosphotransacetylase (Pta; SMU_1043c) and two putative acetate kinase (Act) genes (ackA and SMU_1299c), involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate to acetate, respectively.54 In S. mutans, aspects of the Pta-Ack pathway have been shown to influence the cellular response to oxidative stress resistance.54 These results suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV cultures may be experiencing an oxidative-like stress response in early stationary phase (8 h growth), and the altered expression of these oxidative-stress related genes and metabolic pathways is perhaps occurring in response to this stress. Further support for the idea that the S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures may be experiencing more inherent stress relative to the normal gravity cultures stems from the observation that TA system genes mazEF and relBE were significantly upregulated during simulated microgravity growth (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4). MazF and RelE have been shown in several bacteria to selectively inhibit translation by cleaving specific mRNA recognition sequences in response to nutritional stress [reviewed in55,56]. These data collectively suggest that S. mutans simulated microgravity HARV cultures display characteristics associated with stationary phase cellular stress. However, it is not clear from this data whether these cultures are experiencing overlapping simultaneous stresses (such as oxidative and starvation stress), or if the sum of these phenotype and gene expression changes represent a stress response specific to LSMMG. 3. S. mutans displays an altered cell aggregation phenotype under simulated microgravity conditions: Micro-organisms such as Micrococcus luteus,57 E. coli,58 P. aeruginosa,34,35,59 S. aureus,29 S. typhimurium,36 and Candida albicans 60,61 have all displayed increased biofilm growth when grown in either ground-based simulated and/or space flight microgravity conditions. In some instances, this biofilm increase was paralleled by documented increases in expression of biofilm-promoting regulatory genes or adhesion factors.29,34–36,49,58,61 Given these observations in other micro-organisms, we predicted that S. mutans would also display an increase in biofilm formation when grown in HARV microgravity cultures. Although biofilms attached to a solid surface were not assessed in these studies, macroscopic differences in cell–cell aggregation were typically observed in simulated microgravity compared to normal gravity HARV cultures at stationary phase (8 h growth; Fig. 2), suggesting that cell–cell adhesion and/or biofilm-like properties of this bacterium were altered in response to simulated microgravity growth. Although cell aggregation was observed in both the normal gravity and simulated microgravity HARV cultures grown in biofilm-promoting media containing sucrose, the simulated microgravity cell aggregates were more compact and more difficult to disrupt relative to the aggregates formed during normal gravity growth. Follow-up studies will be required to better characterize the structural properties of these cell aggregates (i.e. production of sucrose-dependent exopolysaccharide) and whether they are actually similar to biofilms that form on hydroxyapatite in vitro and/or the tooth surface in vivo. However, it is noteworthy that altered cell aggregation and/or “attachment-independent” phenotypes have also been observed in other biofilm-forming microbes in both LSMMG29,34 and during spaceflight.61 In summary, the results from our experiments suggest that S. mutans undergoes changes in metabolism, physiology, and global gene expression during stationary-phase simulated microgravity growth that impact cell aggregation and oxidative stress resistance. Defining the exact regulatory circuits and contributions of these differentially regulated genes to the ability of S. mutans to survive and adapt to LSMMG and spaceflight environments will help in the development of treatment and control strategies to combat the caries potential of this pathogen. Furthermore, these studies may provide insight into the response of S. mutans to low-fluid shear encountered in the oral cavity. Our future research efforts will focus on assessing S. mutans biofilm formation during simulated microgravity growth using culture conditions more closely mimicking the oral cavity (i.e., artificial saliva media and periodic pulsing of sucrose addition), as well as growth of S. mutans as part of a mixed-species biofilm consortium.",

However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.Microbiology: Cavities-causing bacteria altered by space-like conditions The gene expression patterns, metabolism and physiology of tooth cavities-causing microbes change in a space-like gravity environment. These findings could help explain why astronauts are at a greater risk for dental diseases when in space. Kelly Rice and colleagues from the University of Florida, Gainesville, USA, cultured Streptococcus mutans bacteria under simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions. The bacteria grown in microgravity were more susceptible to killing with hydrogen peroxide, tended to aggregate in more compact cellular structures, showed changes in their metabolite profile and expressed around 250 genes at levels that were either much higher or lower than normal gravity control cultures. These genes included many involved in carbohydrate metabolism, protein production and stress responses. The observed changes collectively suggest that space flight and microgravity could alter the cavities-causing potential of S. mutans.Introduction Streptococcus mutans is a primary causative agent of dental caries, demonstrated by its isolation from carious tooth lesions in humans,1 its ability to initiate caries in germ-free rodent models of infection,2 and the established link between high levels of this bacterium in the oral cavity and active caries.3 Although preventable by fluoridation of water and various dental procedures,4, caries remains the most common chronic disease among children, and remains untreated in up to 30% of adults over 35 years-old.5 S. mutans transient bacteremias can also initiate endocarditis in at-risk patient groups.6 Successful colonization of the oral cavity and persistence in multi-species dental plaque by S. mutans is inherently dependent on both its ability to form biofilm and its rapid metabolism of carbohydrates by the glycolytic pathway. The low pH that results from accumulation of acidic metabolic end-products favors the growth of S. mutans and other acid-tolerant species relative to healthy plaque microflora, as well as the eventual demineralization of tooth enamel and the development of caries. Adherence of S. mutans to the tooth surface and subsequent biofilm development are mediated by several bacterial factors, including production of sucrose-dependent extracellular glucan polymers by glucosyltransferase enzymes,7 specific cell surface adhesins,8, 9 the major autolysin AtlA,10 the quorum-sensing competence (com) system,11 and extracellular DNA.12 To protect the health of astronauts during space flight missions, it is critical to understand the effects of this environment on both host biology and the host microbiota. Simulated microgravity exposure has been shown to cause increased mandibular and alveolar bone loss13 and decreased saliva flow,14 significant predisposing host factors that could contribute to development of caries and/or periodontal disease. Traditionally, the approach to maintaining astronaut oral health during space flight missions has been routed in preventative dentistry, whereby astronauts are subjected to rigorous preflight dental screening and treatment.15 However, in the face of future long-term space flight missions, research and discovery of new methods for maintaining oral hygiene and dental health under a microgravity environment are required.15 Previous studies on the effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiota have primarily focused on culture-dependent methods of quantifying the numbers of oral bacteria in human subjects before and after spaceflight.16–18 Furthermore, astronauts have been shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight.16 However, assessment of the physiology and virulence potential of oral pathogens such as S. mutans under controlled microgravity analog conditions has been relatively lacking. In this respect, rotating wall vessel bioreactors are a common technology used to grow bacteria under microgravity analog conditions in ground-based studies. When completely filled with media (lacking air bubbles or “head space”) and rotated on the axis perpendicular to the Earth’s gravitational vector, these reactors maintain a low-shear environment (<1 dyn/cm2) whereby gravitational vectors are randomized over the surface of the cells or particles contained within the vessel.19 As such, this simulated environment models “weightlessness” by counteracting gravitational forces that would otherwise promote cellular sedimentation.19,20 The low-shear force experienced in this microgravity analog system boasts the additional advantage of mimicking the low-shear force of saliva flow (<0.8 dyn/cm2) experienced by plaque bacteria in the oral cavity.21 In this study, high-aspect rotating vessels (HARVs) were therefore used to ascertain the effects of simulated microgravity on S. mutans gene expression, physiology, oxidative stress resistance, and competence, using both culture-dependent and “-omic” (metabolomics and RNA-seq) approaches.Results S. mutans HARV growth curves and cell aggregation To probe the effect of simulated microgravity growth on S. mutans, continuous growth curves (whereby cell samples were removed from the same HARV at different time points) were performed (n = 3 independent experiments each) in biofilm media (BM) containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose over a 24 h period. In this analysis, no statistically significant differences in CFU/ml at each time point were observed (Supplemental Fig. S1). An initial decrease in CFU/ml was observed in both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures between t = 0 (time of inoculation) and t = 2 h growth, which was likely a function of sucrose-dependent cell aggregation. Very small differences in cell viability patterns in early stationary phase (6–8 h growth) suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV culture may have entered stationary phase slightly sooner than the normal gravity HARV culture in this experiment. As well, the simulated microgravity culture persisted in stationary phase until approximately 12 h growth, followed by a somewhat rapid death phase, with a 1-log loss of viability between 12 and 24 h growth. In contrast, the viability of normal gravity culture underwent a more gradual decrease in cell viability between 12 and 24 h of growth. Monitoring of cell growth by CFU/ml in the continuous growth curve experiments described above required constant disruption of the HARV cultures, making it difficult to assess potential macroscopic differences in cell aggregation in the simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions. Therefore, these growth curves were also performed using an “end-point” approach, whereby simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (n = 2 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) were grown undisturbed in replicate HARV vessels for t = 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h (Fig. 1). Using this end-point approach, no significant differences in CFU/ml were observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures at the assessed time points (Fig. 1), and the initial drop in CFU/ml observed early in the growth curves of the continuous cultures (Supplemental Fig. S1) was not observed in these end-point cultures. As well, both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures underwent the same pattern of growth when monitored with this end-point approach: Log phase growth occurred between 0 and 6 h, and both cultures were in early stationary phase at 8 h growth, followed by entry into late stationary phase/death phase between 24 and 48 h growth. Interestingly, differences in macroscopic cell aggregation were consistently observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV conditions when using the end-point growth analysis. Specifically, the simulated microgravity condition tended to form round/compact cellular structures, whereas the aggregates in the normal gravity growth condition tended to form less compact structures (Fig. 2). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab End-point growth curve analysis of S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures. Simulated microgravity (dark gray bars) and normal gravity (light gray bars) HARV end-point growth was measured by serial dilution and CFU/ml plating at t = 0 (time of inoculation; average of n = 4 independent experiments), and t = 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h postinoculation (average of n = 2 independent experiments per time point per growth condition), as described in “Materials and methods”. The vertical dotted line on the graph indicates that the t = 24 and 48 h data were obtained in a separate experimental run from the t = 4, 6, 8, and 12 h time points. Error bars = standard error of the mean (SEM)Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Representative S. mutans end-point HARV cultures grown for 8 h in biofilm media under simulated microgravity (a) and normal gravity (b) conditions. Note the structural differences of the self-aggregating bacterial cells under each condition (indicated by arrows)Metabolomics analysis of “end-point” HARV cultures To monitor potential differences in the metabolome of simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures, cell pellets and culture supernatants were harvested from a second end-point HARV culture experiment (n = 3 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) at t = 4, t = 8, and t = 24 h samples, corresponding to log-phase, early stationary phase, and late stationary/death phase, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). Given that macroscopic differences in the self-aggregating clusters of S. mutans cells were consistently observed at the t = 8 h time point (Fig. 2), RNA-seq analysis was also performed on the t = 8 h samples. Principle component analysis (PCA) of metabolomics data generated from t = 4, 8, and 24 h HARV cultures (Supplemental Files S2 and S3) revealed a strong relationship between the time of growth (t = 4, 8, and 24 h) and metabolite profile for each of the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures (Fig. 3). However, a much weaker “time-treatment” relationship existed when comparing the metabolite profile between simulated microgravity vs. normal gravity cultures at each time point. Welch’s two sample t tests revealed 8, 14, and 10 statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in cellular metabolite production between cells grown under normal gravity and microgravity conditions at the 4, 8, and 24 h time points, respectively (Supplemental File S2). Likewise, 21, 21, and 23 statistically significant differences were observed between the corresponding culture supernatant samples at these time points (Supplemental File S3). Keeping in mind the caveat that the number of significant differences at each time point were close to that expected by random chance alone (5% error rate), the significant changes of cell-associated and supernatant metabolites of the 8 h HARV cultures are summarized in Table 1, and their potential relationship to the corresponding 8 h RNA-seq data are discussed below.

Compared to the metabolomics data, differential expression analysis of the 8 h RNA-seq data revealed a large number of statistically significant gene expression changes in normal gravity relative to simulated microgravity growth (Supplemental File S4). Specifically, 94 genes were up-regulated (log2 fold-change ≥1.0) and 153 genes were down-regulated (log2 fold-change ≤−1.0) in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity cultures. These patterns in gene expression were confirmed by qPCR for a subset of genes (Supplemental Table S1). Functional classification (Fig. 4) revealed that expression of a large number of genes associated with transposon sequences, as well as several genes encoding predicted phage proteins, were down-regulated in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity growth. A second trend of interest was the significant down-regulated expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including various phosphotransferase (PTS) systems, the carbon catabolite protein regulator ccpA, and the redox sensitive transcriptional regulator rex, in the 8 h normal gravity cultures relative to the simulated microgravity cultures (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4). Increased expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs and other aspects of protein translation was also observed in the normal gravity cultures compared to simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of a large number of genes encoding transcriptional regulators was decreased in the normal gravity cultures (Fig. 4). As well, altered expression of stress genes was also observed in the normal gravity HARV cultures, including decreased expression of the toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems mazEF (SMU_172/173) and relBE (SMU_895/896), decreased expression of the holin-like lrgA, decreased expression of the peroxide resistance gene dpr, and increased expression of genes encoding glutathione S-transferase (SMU_1296) and glutaredoxin (SMU_669c) (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Distribution of gene functional categories differentially expressed during normal gravity growth relative to simulated microgravity. RNA isolated from 8 h normal gravity and simulated microgravity S. mutans HARV cultures (n = 3 independent experiments per growth condition) was subjected to RNA-seq transcriptome profiling as described in “Materials and methods”. Differential expression and statistical analysis was carried out using a cutoff FDR-adjusted p value of 0.05. Of this dataset, those genes with a log2 (fold-change) value of at least ±1.0 were grouped by functional classification based on DAVID gene functional categorization analysis,  gene annotations and KEGG pathway analysis. Total number of up-regulated genes (log2 fold-change ≥1.0, black bars) = 94, total number of down-regulated genes (log2 fold-change ≤ −1.0, gray bars) = 153DAVID bioinformatics resource22, 23 was used to further probe the RNA-seq dataset for functional annotation groups that were enriched in the genes that displayed a log2 fold change expression of at least ±1.0 in the normal gravity vs. simulated microgravity HARV cultures (Supplemental Table S2). This analysis revealed the presence of four significant (enrichment scores ≥1.3) functional annotation clusters in the down-regulated normal gravity genes, which included genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport (cluster I), transcriptional regulators (clusters II and III), and carbohydrate transporters/other membrane proteins (cluster IV). As well, functional annotation clusters involved in arginine metabolism (cluster V) and nucleoside/tRNA metabolism (cluster VI) were significantly enriched (enrichment scores ≥1.3) in the up-regulated normal gravity genes. To identify metabolic pathways potentially altered under the simulated microgravity growth condition, all statistically-significant changes in 8 h growth gene expression from the RNA-seq differential expression analysis with a minimum log2 fold-change of at least ±0.6 were also analyzed using the bioinformatics program Metacyc.24. The top metabolic pathways identified by this analysis were mixed acid fermentation (seven genes), arginine biosynthesis (six genes), and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis (five genes) (Supplemental Fig. S3). Specifically, genes involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutarate (a TCA cycle intermediate), arginine biosynthesis, and dCDP/dTMP biosynthesis were upregulated in the normal gravity HARV cultures, whereas genes involved in ethanol and acetate fermentation were down-regulated in normal gravity HARV cultures. Interestingly, when comparing these metabolic pathways to statistically-significant changes in cellular metabolites at 8 h growth (Table 1), several matched to the corresponding metabolic pathway changes (Supplemental Fig. S3) identified in the RNA-seq data by Metacyc, including 2-oxogluarate (alpha-ketoglutarate; mixed acid fermentation), pyruvate (mixed acid fermentation), argininosuccinate (arginine biosynthesis), uridine monophosphate and uracil (pyrmidine deoxynucleotide de novo biosynthesis). The apparent increased sensitivity of the RNA-seq data in detecting more changes in S. mutans metabolism relative to the corresponding metabolomics data may reflect a suboptimal component of the metabolomics sample collection method and/or processing time.Assessment of oxidative stress and competence phenotypes S. mutans encounters significant oxidative stress in the oral cavity in the form of H2O2 production by competing non-cariogenic oral streptococci,25,26 as well as from dental care products (toothpastes, mouthwash) that contain H2O2. Furthermore, expression of several oxidative stress-related genes (dpr, rex, SMU_1296, SMU_669c) was altered in the 8 h simulated microgravity HARV cultures. Therefore, the ability of S. mutans to survive exogenous H2O2 treatment was compared in cells isolated from exponential (t = 4), early-stationary (t = 8) and late stationary (t = 16) simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (Fig. 5). Although no significant differences in oxidative stress resistance were observed between normal gravity and simulated microgravity cells isolated from 4 and 8 h growth, the H2O2-treated 4 h cells (Fig. 5a) displayed a greater overall loss of viability (~1% survival after 90 min of treatment) compared to the 8 h cells (Fig. 5b; ~50% survival after 90 min of treatment). Interestingly, when this experiment was repeated on cells from normal gravity and simulated microgravity cultures harvested at 16 h growth (Fig. 5c), the simulated microgravity cells displayed significantly (P < 0.05, one-tailed T test) increased H2O2 killing (~22% survival after 60 min treatment) compared to the normal gravity cells (~43% survival after 60 min treatment). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Percent survival of S. mutans post-treatment with 5 mM H2O2. Cells from t = 4 (a), t = 8 (b), or t = 16 (c) hour simulated microgravity (triangles) and normal gravity (circles) HARV cultures (n = 3 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in sterile HBSS. Samples were withdrawn to determine initial CFU/ml (“t = 0”), and then H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. CFU/ml of each cell suspension was sampled at 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min post-H2O2 addition, and CFU/ml were determined. % Survival was calculated by 100 × [(t = final CFU/ml)/(t = 0 CFU/ml)]. Error bars = SEM. Asterisk denotes statistical significance, one-tailed t test (p < 0.05)Because previous S. mutans studies have implicated a complex link between oxidative stress, biofilm formation, and natural competence [reviewed in27], we were curious if competence was also subject to regulation by the low-shear modeled microgravity ﻿(LSMMG) environment. Therefore early-exponential phase (growth phase at which S. mutans is most competent during standard in vitro growth) simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures were tested for their ability to uptake plasmid DNA. However, transformation efficiency (as measured by uptake of a plasmid conferring erythromycin resistance) was nearly identical between simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (Fig. 6). The transformation efficiency was also not affected by HARV growth itself, as the HARV transformation efficiencies were similar to those measured in a parallel non-rotating culture of S. mutans (Fig. 6). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab S. mutans competence phenotype assessed in simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures. Simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures, as well as a parallel static Falcon tube control culture, were each grown for 1.5 h in biofilm media prior to addition of 2 µg pOri23 plasmid DNA. All three cultures were then grown for 2.5 more hours followed by harvest and serial dilution plating on BHI agar ± 10 µg/ml erythromycin (selective antibiotic to monitor plasmid transformation). Transformation efficiency was calculated as the percentage of transformants (CFU/ml on BHI + erythromycin) among total viable cells (CFU/ml on BHI). Data represent the average of n = 3 independent experiments. Error bars = SEMDiscussion Although the effects of both spaceflight and microgravity analog growth on virulence-related phenotypes of bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus have been well-described,28–38 comparatively little research has been dedicated to studying the specific effects of space flight and simulated microgravity on virulence attributes of oral bacteria such as S. mutans. In the Skylab missions conducted in the 1970s, the effects of space flight and diet on the oral cavity and oral microbiota of astronauts were documented using culture-dependent methods. These studies demonstrated that increased counts of specific oral bacteria (i.e. Bacteriodes, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, S. sanguinus, and S. mutans) were recovered from the astronauts in response to space flight.16 Furthermore, the astronauts in these studies exhibited decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation.16 More recently, the effect of simulated microgravity on the physiology and biofilm structure of S. mutans was also assessed using a superconducting magnet capable of generating a large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF),39 which mimics the space-like gravity environment by achieving stable levitation of diamagnetic materials such as biological cells and tissues.40 The results of this study suggested that growth of S. mutans under simulated microgravity enhanced its acid tolerance, altered its biofilm architecture, and increased its proportion within dual-species biofilms co-cultured with S. sanguinis, an H2O2-producing early colonizer of dental plaque biofilm.39 Collectively, these previous studies suggest that both space flight and the microgravity analog environment have the ability to alter the cariogenic potential of S. mutans. In our current work, HARVs rotated on an axis perpendicular to the Earth’s gravitational vector were used to simulate a low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) growth environment. This ground-based model of microgravity has been used to study the response of a variety of microorganisms to “weightlessness” that would be encountered during space flight [reviewed in19, 41, 42]. However, it is important to keep in mind that the S. mutans LSMMG-associated metabolic and physiological changes (i.e. alterations in cell aggregation, transcriptome, and sensitivity to oxidative stress) presented here could represent the bacteria’s response to either simulated microgravity and/or low-fluid shear (<1 dyn/cm2) specific environmental signals, the latter of which may be relevant to the fluid shear of saliva flow (<0.8 dyn/cm2) experienced by S. mutans in the oral cavity.19,21 Therefore, the data obtained in this study have the potential to shed light on S. mutans physiology and virulence properties relevant to environmental signals experienced in the host, and will hopefully provide a springboard for planning future space flight studies of oral bacteria. It is also important to note that all of the S. mutans experiments presented in this study were conducted in semi-defined culture medium containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose, previously shown to promote in vitro S. mutans biofilm formation.43 The addition of sucrose, a host dietary sugar to which S. mutans is exposed to in the oral cavity, promotes production of extracellular glucan polymers by S. mutans, important biofilm matrix components that promote intracellular adhesion.7 In reality, the in vivo plaque biofilm environment of S. mutans is much more complex, including stress conditions such as interspecies competition for nutrients and space within the biofilm, as well as alternating periods of “feast and famine” with respect to dietary carbohydrate consumption. Therefore, the growth condition used in this study should be considered a simple representation of caries-promoting “feast” conditions experienced by S. mutans in the oral cavity. With these caveats in mind, the following discussion points represent interesting patterns/conclusions from the data obtained in this study: 1. S. mutans displays an altered early stationary-phase metabolism under simulated microgravity conditions: As indicated in the “Results” section and Fig. 1, S. mutans “end-point” simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures appear to enter stationary phase at the same point in growth (6 h) compared to normal gravity cultures, and there were no apparent differences in CFU/ml of each culture at each time point. This being said, the 8 h (early stationary phase) metabolomics and RNA-seq data suggest that S. mutans simulated microgravity metabolism at this point is altered relative to normal gravity growth. For example, simulated microgravity cultures experienced a ten-fold decrease in supernatant glucose levels (Table 1 and Supplemental File S3) at 8 h growth relative to the normal gravity cultures. Furthermore, expression of PTS system genes involved in transport of carbohydrates (glucose, mannitol, trehalose, mannose and cellobiose) was significantly upregulated during simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs, and other aspects of protein translation was decreased in the microgravity cultures at this time point (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4 ). Bioinformatics analysis also revealed patterns of decreased arginine metabolism and decreased pyrimidine biosynthesis (Supplemental Table S2 and Supplemental Fig. S3) in the 8 h simulated microgravity cultures. Finally, expression of genes encoding the central metabolic transcriptional regulators CcpA and Rex were also both upregulated (2.2-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively) at 8 h growth in the simulated microgravity cultures. CcpA has been shown to regulate S. mutans catabolite repression and the ability to utilize non-preferred carbohydrates, acid tolerance, acid production, and biofilm formation,44–46 whereas Rex regulates expression of S. mutans genes involved with carbohydrate fermentation, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress resistance in response to cellular redox.47,48 Interestingly, a role for Rex in the transcriptional response of Staphylococcus aureus to LSMMG was also previously implicated by the altered expression of a number of Rex-regulated genes under this growth condition.29 Although great care was taken in each experiment to vigorously vortex all samples prior to and during serial dilution plating, we cannot exclude the possibility that sucrose-dependent cell clumping may have masked more apparent growth differences between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity end-point HARV cultures in these studies. 2. S. mutans late stationary-phase simulated microgravity cultures appear to be subject to increased stress: A striking phenotypic property observed in S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures was the greatly increased sensitivity of cells from late stationary phase (16 h) to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5c) relative to cells from normal gravity cultures. However, no apparent differences in oxidative stress resistance were observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cells harvested at earlier time points (log phase and early stationary phase, Fig. 5a, b, respectively). This result correlated with the LG-HMF S. mutans microgravity study by Cheng and co-workers,39 which found that mid-exponential phase S. mutans microgravity and normal gravity cells did not differ in their sensitivity to H2O2. In previous studies, late stationary-phase (20–24 h) cultures of S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa were both shown to be more resistant to oxidative stress when grown in simulated microgravity,30,49 whereas S. typhimurium simulated microgravity cultures grown to an earlier phase of growth (10 h) displayed increased sensitivity to H2O2 treatment.31 Furthermore, the sensitivity of stationary phase simulated microgravity cultures of adherent-invasive E. coli to oxidative stress was shown to be strain-dependent.33 The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxidative stress when grown in LSMMG has also been previously investigated: compared to normal gravity growth, S. aureus cells isolated from simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased sensitivity to challenge with H2O2, which was demonstrated to be related to decreased carotenoid (yellow membrane pigment) production under this growth condition.29 These previously-published studies, in conjunction with the S. mutans results presented here, clearly demonstrate that the microgravity model used, growth phase at which oxidative stress is tested, and/or other inherent species and strain-dependent differences, make it difficult to discern broad conclusions regarding the effect of the LSMMG on oxidative stress resistance. Although direct comparisons cannot be extrapolated due to time point differences between the 8 h RNA-seq data (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4) and 16 h oxidative stress data (Fig. 5c), it is interesting to note that the 8 h simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased expression of genes previously-shown to be involved in the response to oxidative stress in S. mutans. These included lrgA, which encodes a predicted holin-like protein,50,51 dpr, encoding an iron-binding protein that reduces the intracellular free iron pool during oxidative stress,52,53 and rex.48 As well, S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased expression of genes encoding phosphotransacetylase (Pta; SMU_1043c) and two putative acetate kinase (Act) genes (ackA and SMU_1299c), involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate to acetate, respectively.54 In S. mutans, aspects of the Pta-Ack pathway have been shown to influence the cellular response to oxidative stress resistance.54 These results suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV cultures may be experiencing an oxidative-like stress response in early stationary phase (8 h growth), and the altered expression of these oxidative-stress related genes and metabolic pathways is perhaps occurring in response to this stress. Further support for the idea that the S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures may be experiencing more inherent stress relative to the normal gravity cultures stems from the observation that TA system genes mazEF and relBE were significantly upregulated during simulated microgravity growth (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4). MazF and RelE have been shown in several bacteria to selectively inhibit translation by cleaving specific mRNA recognition sequences in response to nutritional stress [reviewed in55,56]. These data collectively suggest that S. mutans simulated microgravity HARV cultures display characteristics associated with stationary phase cellular stress. However, it is not clear from this data whether these cultures are experiencing overlapping simultaneous stresses (such as oxidative and starvation stress), or if the sum of these phenotype and gene expression changes represent a stress response specific to LSMMG. 3. S. mutans displays an altered cell aggregation phenotype under simulated microgravity conditions: Micro-organisms such as Micrococcus luteus,57 E. coli,58 P. aeruginosa,34,35,59 S. aureus,29 S. typhimurium,36 and Candida albicans 60,61 have all displayed increased biofilm growth when grown in either ground-based simulated and/or space flight microgravity conditions. In some instances, this biofilm increase was paralleled by documented increases in expression of biofilm-promoting regulatory genes or adhesion factors.29,34–36,49,58,61 Given these observations in other micro-organisms, we predicted that S. mutans would also display an increase in biofilm formation when grown in HARV microgravity cultures. Although biofilms attached to a solid surface were not assessed in these studies, macroscopic differences in cell–cell aggregation were typically observed in simulated microgravity compared to normal gravity HARV cultures at stationary phase (8 h growth; Fig. 2), suggesting that cell–cell adhesion and/or biofilm-like properties of this bacterium were altered in response to simulated microgravity growth. Although cell aggregation was observed in both the normal gravity and simulated microgravity HARV cultures grown in biofilm-promoting media containing sucrose, the simulated microgravity cell aggregates were more compact and more difficult to disrupt relative to the aggregates formed during normal gravity growth. Follow-up studies will be required to better characterize the structural properties of these cell aggregates (i.e. production of sucrose-dependent exopolysaccharide) and whether they are actually similar to biofilms that form on hydroxyapatite in vitro and/or the tooth surface in vivo. However, it is noteworthy that altered cell aggregation and/or “attachment-independent” phenotypes have also been observed in other biofilm-forming microbes in both LSMMG29,34 and during spaceflight.61 In summary, the results from our experiments suggest that S. mutans undergoes changes in metabolism, physiology, and global gene expression during stationary-phase simulated microgravity growth that impact cell aggregation and oxidative stress resistance. Defining the exact regulatory circuits and contributions of these differentially regulated genes to the ability of S. mutans to survive and adapt to LSMMG and spaceflight environments will help in the development of treatment and control strategies to combat the caries potential of this pathogen. Furthermore, these studies may provide insight into the response of S. mutans to low-fluid shear encountered in the oral cavity. Our future research efforts will focus on assessing S. mutans biofilm formation during simulated microgravity growth using culture conditions more closely mimicking the oral cavity (i.e., artificial saliva media and periodic pulsing of sucrose addition), as well as growth of S. mutans as part of a mixed-species biofilm consortium.Materials and methods Bacterial strain and growth conditions S. mutans UA15962 was used for all of the experiments described below. All S. mutans cultures (including HARV vessels) were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For each experiment, S. mutans was freshly streaked from a frozen 30% (vol vol−1) glycerol stock onto Brain heart infusion (BHI) agar and grown for 48 h. A single colony was then inoculated into 30 ml BHI broth, and grown as a static culture for 16–18 h prior to inoculation of HARVs. Disposable vessel rotary cell culture systems (Synthecon) with vertical and horizontal 4-station rotator bases were used to simulate microgravity (HARV rotated on axis perpendicular to gravitational vector) and “normal” (1 × g) gravity (HARV rotated on axis parallel to gravitational vector), respectively (Supplemental Figure S4). All HARV manipulations were performed under a Class II A2 biosafety cabinet (Labconco). HARV vessels were filled with sterile media according to manufacturer’s recommendations, and incubated at room temperature for 18 h prior to each experiment. This media was then aseptically removed, and 20× dilute S. mutans overnight culture (approximate OD600 = 0.06/ml) in room-temperature semi-defined biofilm media (BM)43 containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose, was used to fill each HARV. Prior to HARV rotation and incubation, sterile 5-ml luer lock syringes were used to remove air bubbles according to manufacturer’s protocols.Continuous HARV growth curves For each experiment (n = 3 independent experiments per growth condition), overnight S. mutans cultures were used to inoculate 120 ml of sterile BM containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1 ml withdrawn to measure the time-of-inoculation (t = 0) CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then subjected again to vigorous swirling and vortexing and immediately used to fill 2 × 50 ml disposable HARVs as described above. Each HARV was rotated either vertically (“simulated microgravity”) or horizontally (“normal gravity”) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. HARVs were rotated at 30 RPM for the first 8 h of growth, and the rotation speed of each reactor was increased to 32 RPM after 8 h of growth to ensure that S. mutans cell aggregates did not settle to the bottom of the simulated microgravity HARV. At 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postinoculation, each HARV was removed from the incubator, vigorously agitated to remove adherent cell clumps from the walls and membrane of the HARV reactor and evenly dispersing cell clumps, and 1 ml culture was immediately removed for CFU/ml assessment. The same volume of sterile media was then added back to each HARV and air bubbles removed as described above prior to re-initiation of simulated microgravity or normal gravity HARV growth. For CFU/ml quantification, each 1 ml sample was vortexed vigorously for at least 30 s to resuspend cell clumps, followed immediately by serial dilution (each tube vortexed vigorously for at least 15 s between each dilution) and CFU/ml determination using the track plating method.63 HARV “end-point” growth curves Overnight S. mutans cultures were used to inoculate 500 ml sterile BM containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose to an approximate OD600 = 0.06/ml as described above. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1 ml was withdrawn to measure the t = 0 OD600, pH, and CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then immediately used to fill 8 × 50 ml disposable HARVs (inoculum volume was subjected to vigorous swirling and vortexing before addition to each HARV). For end-point growth curve analysis at t = 4, 6, 8, and 12 h (n = 2 independent experiments total per time point per growth condition), four simulated microgravity and four normal gravity HARV cultures were grown in parallel at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HARVs were rotated at 30 RPM for the first 8 h of growth, and the rotation speed of each reactor was increased to 32 RPM after 8 h of growth to ensure that S. mutans cell aggregates did not settle to the bottom of the simulated microgravity cultures. At each time point, one simulated microgravity and one normal gravity HARV were each harvested as follows: 25 ml of HARV culture was transferred to a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube. The HARV was then closed and shaken vigorously for approximately 5 s (until there were no remaining visible clumps of bacteria stuck to the inside walls and membrane of the HARV). The reactor was then immediately uncapped and the remaining culture transferred to the 50 ml Falcon tube, which was vortexed at high speed for 30 s prior to removing 100 µl for CFU counts. The tube was vortexed again for 10 s, and 900 µl immediately removed for measuring OD600 and pH readings. OD600 readings were obtained using a Genesys 10 Bio spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), culture pH measured with colorpHast indicator strips (EMD), and CFU/ml calculated by serial dilution plating as described above. For the end-point growth curve analysis at t = 24 and t = 48 h, a separate experiment (n = 2 biological replicates for each time point) was performed as described above.HARV end-point growth for metabolomic and RNA-seq analyses Overnight S. mutans cultures were used to inoculate 350 ml sterile BM containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose to an approximate OD600 = 0.06/ml as described above. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1 ml was withdrawn to measure the t = 0 OD600, pH, and CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then immediately used to fill 6 × 50 ml disposable HARVs (inoculum volume was subjected to vigorous swirling and vortexing before addition to each HARV). A sterile media control was also collected at the beginning of each experiment and stored at −80 °C for metabolomics analysis (see below). For each experiment (n = 3 independent experiments total), three simulated microgravity and three normal gravity HARV cultures were grown in parallel at 37 °C, 5% CO2 as described above for the end-point growth curve analysis. For each experiment, one simulated microgravity and one normal gravity HARV were each harvested at t = 4, t = 8 h, and t = 24 h growth, as described above for the end-point growth curve analysis (for a total of n = 3 independent samples per time point per growth condition). HARVs were photographed prior to culture disruption and harvest to document macroscopic growth observations. After harvesting, 34 ml of each t = 4, 8, and 24 h HARV culture was centrifuged at 3000 RPM, 4 °C for 20 min and immediately placed on ice. 1 ml of culture supernatant was removed from each centrifuged sample, transferred to 1.5 ml tubes, and immediately frozen at −80 °C. The remaining culture supernatants were decanted and cell pellets immediately frozen at −80 °C. For RNA-seq samples (t = 8 h only), a 10-ml aliquot of each HARV culture was also centrifuged at 3000 RPM, 4 °C for 20 min and immediately placed on ice. Culture supernatants were decanted and 1 ml RNAlater (Ambion) was added to each cell pellet prior to immediate storage at −80 °C.Metabolite extraction and metabolomics analysis Extraction of metabolites (n = 3 independent biological samples per time point and growth condition) and all metabolomics analyses (including statistics) were performed by Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) following previously-published methods.64–68 Details specific to this experiment can be found in Supplemental File S1 (Supplemental Materials and Methods).RNA isolation and RNA-seq analysis RNA was isolated from t = 8 h cell pellets stored at −80 °C in RNAlater (collected from n = 3 independent experiments each for simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures) with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and FASTPREP lysing matrix B tubes (MP Biomedical) using previously-described methods.50,69 Each RNA sample was then subjected to a second DNAse treatment using the TURBO DNA-free™ Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per the manufacturer’s protocols. Lack of contaminating genomic DNA in each RNA sample was then determined using quantitative real-time PCR (i.e. no cDNA synthesis step) and S. mutans-specific primers (1547-F/R; Supplemental Table S3) prior to sending ≥5 µg of each RNA sample to Seqwright Genomic Services (Houston, TX), who performed all steps of the RNA-seq workflow, data curation, differential expression, and corresponding statistical analysis. In brief, each RNA sample was subjected to an mRNA enrichment step and generation of a library of cDNA template molecules of known strand origin using the TruSeq Total mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, generating 2 × 100 bp read lengths for a total of 2 × 10 M reads per sample. Illumina CASAVA software was used to create genomic builds and count reads, whereas TopHat-2.0.8b and Cufflinks-2.0.170 were used to align reads to the S. mutans UA159 genome (Genbank accession # NC_004350.2). ﻿All RNA-seq data have been deposited to 's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE90166.﻿Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) assay For each experiment (n = 3 independent biological samples each for simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures), two S. mutans 10-ml HARV cultures were inoculated as described above, and each was grown for either 4, 8, or 16 h. For the 4 and 8 h experiments, the HARV rotation speed was 30 RPM. For the 16 h experiment, the HARV rotation speed was 30 RPM for the first 8 h of growth, and was then increased to 35 RPM to counteract sedimentation of cellular aggregates. S. mutans cultures were then harvested from each HARV vessel, transferred to a 50 ml Falcon tube, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 RPM. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml sterile 1× Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS), and 100 µl was withdrawn from each tube and subjected to serial dilution plating as described above to enumerate CFU/ml of each cell suspension at “t = 0” (prior to H2O2 addition). H2O2 was added to each remaining 4.9 ml cell suspension to a final concentration of 5 mM, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Samples of each cell suspension were removed at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min post-H2O2 addition to enumerate CFU/ml, and % survival for each sample was calculated by 100× (t = × CFU/ml/t = 0 CFU/ml).Competence assay The ability of S. mutans to take up exogenous DNA was assessed in microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures based on previously-described methods.50,71 For each experiment (n = 3 independent biological samples each for simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures), S. mutans 10-ml micro-gravity and normal gravity HARV cultures were grown in BM containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose for 90 min [corresponding to 2.3 × 106 CFU/ml (±3.0 × 105 SEM) for normal gravity and 3.1 × 106 CFU/ml (±1.5 × 105 SEM) for simulated microgravity] at 30 RPM. HARVS were removed from rotator bases and 2 µg of unmethylated pOri23 plasmid DNA was added to each reactor. Microgravity and normal gravity HARVs were then incubated for 2.5 h at 30 RPM prior to serial dilution and plating of each culture on BHI agar ±10 µg/ml erythromycin (Erm; selectable antibiotic for pOri23). CFU/ml were determined after 48 h plate growth, and transformation efficiencies were calculated as the percentage of transformants (BHI-Erm10 CFU/ml) among the total viable cells (BHI CFU/ml). For each experiment, a non-rotating control culture (15-ml Falcon tube containing 15 ml of S. mutans culture) was grown in parallel and assessed for competence as described above.Bioinformatics The DAVID Bioinformatics Resource22,23 was used to aid in functional categorization of the RNA-seq differential expression data and to perform functional annotation clustering. Only genes with statistically-significant log2-fold changes of at least ±1.0 were included in these analyses. The lowest classification stringency was used for functional categorization. For functional annotation clustering analysis, the default analysis parameters were used: Medium classification stringency, similarity threshold = 0.5, enrichment threshold (EASE score) = 1.0. As recommended previously,22 an enrichment score cutoff of ≥1.3 was applied to the functional annotation clustering analysis. For identifying trends in metabolic pathway changes, all statistically-significant RNA-seq differential expression data with a log2-fold change of at least ±0.6 were also analyzed using Metacyc.24 Statistics For metabolomics, statistical analyses were performed in ArrayStudio on log transformed data. For those analyses not standard in ArrayStudio, the programs R (http://cran.r-project.org/) or JMP (SAS, http://www.jmp.com) were used as previously described.72 Two-way ANOVA was used to compare the effects of treatment (simulated microgravity vs. normal gravity growth) and growth time (t = 4, 8, and 24 h) on metabolite differences. Multiple comparisons were accounted for with the false discovery rate (FDR) method, and each FDR was estimated by q-values. PCA was also applied to the metabolomics data. For RNA-seq, differential expression analysis was performed by Seqwright Genomic Services using FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads) values and fold-change was expressed as log2 (FPKM normal gravity/FPKM simulated microgravity). For all other data, statistical analyses were performed using Sigmaplot version 12.5 (Build 12.5.0.38, Systat Software, Inc.). Data was tested for normality and equal variance, followed by a T-test or Rank-sum test, as appropriate.Electronic supplementary material Supplementary Tables (21.6KB, docx) Supplementary Figures (4.2MB, pdf) Supplementary File S1 (22.6KB, docx) Supplementary File S2 (2.4MB, xlsx) Supplementary File S3 (2.4MB, xlsx) Supplementary File S4 (218.3KB, xlsx) Acknowledgements This work was funded in part by a Florida Education Fund McKnight Doctoral Fellowship to S.S.O, NASA grant NNX13AM09G to K.C.R., and  grant R01 AI118999 to K.C.R.

    "abstract": "Abstract Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk factor for opportunistic infections. To gain insight into S. aureus virulence potential in the spaceflight environment, we analyzed RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics data from the “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit on the international space station. This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. aureus metabolism is altered in spaceflight conditions relative to the ground controls. Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences increased quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential. Subject terms: Microbiology, Molecular biology",
    "introduction": "Introduction Staphylococcus aureus is a pernicious pathogen capable of infecting nearly every tissue and organ system in the human body. Most S. aureus strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, and certain isolates are resistant to nearly all antibiotics used in the clinical setting. The CDC 2019 Antibiotic Threats Report listed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at a “serious” threat level, with over 10,000 estimated deaths in 2017 alone1. S. aureus is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired infections, and in recent years, highly virulent and transmissible community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains have emerged. Approximately 30% of humans are nasally colonized by S. aureus, which represents a significant risk factor for invasive infections2. As a pathogen, S. aureus expresses a vast repertoire of cell surface adhesins, secreted toxins, and tissue-degrading enzymes that contribute to its ability to colonize host tissue, evade the immune system, and transition from a localized to systemic infection. The expression of these virulence factors is coordinated by a complex network of genetic regulators, including the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum-sensing system, which has been extensively reviewed3–7. The agr operon is comprised of two transcripts, RNAII and RNAIII, which are activated by the P2 and P3 promoters, respectively8. RNAIII is an untranslated RNA species that regulates a variety of target genes at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, making it a primary downstream effector of the Agr system, whereas the RNAII transcript contains the agrBDCA genes [reviewed in refs. 6,7]: AgrD, which is processed and secreted out of the cell in a form known as the autoinducing peptide (AIP), AgrB, the membrane protein that performs this processing and secretion, AgrC, a sensor kinase which recognizes the AIP and transduces the signal to AgrA, the response regulator which activates transcription at the P2 and P3 promoters. S. aureus also poses a potential health risk to astronauts during long-term spaceflight missions. This bacterium was recovered from the nasal passages of Apollo 13 and 14 astronauts at significantly higher numbers compared to preflight samples collected from the same astronauts9, and S. aureus was also among the most frequently isolated bacteria from astronauts that participated in 25 Space Shuttle missions (STS-26 to STS-50)10. Furthermore, several studies monitoring the presence of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS)11–13 as well as in the environment of a full-duration simulation of a crewed return flight to Mars14 identified staphylococci as being predominant. Because of the potential threat of S. aureus to astronaut health, this pathogen’s stress resistance and virulence potential have been studied in both a spaceflight experiment15 and in ground-based models15–19 of simulated microgravity. In the previous spaceflight experiment, S. aureus virulence was reduced when assessed as a function of the quantity of residual bacteria in the presence and absence of Caenorhabditis elegans15. However, these studies were conducted using a nematode feeding model, which does not entirely reflect the complexity of S. aureus pathogenesis in humans. NASA previously conducted a “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) spaceflight experiment (OSDR accession# OSD-145), designed to measure the response of both Bacillus subtilis and S. aureus to the spaceflight environment20,21. In this experiment, Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs)22 were used to grow asynchronous ground controls and spaceflight samples of S. aureus strain UAMS-1, a clinical MSSA isolate that was originally isolated from an osteomyelitis infection23. Herein, our analysis of the S. aureus RNA-Seq, proteomics, and metabolomics datasets from BRIC-23 suggests that S. aureus spaceflight samples may have altered metabolism (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, and transport of non-preferred carbon sources, and decreased glycolysis/fermentation and translation machinery) relative to ground-control cultures. Furthermore, agr genes and several positively regulated targets were the most highly upregulated transcripts in spaceflight. We also performed secretome analysis of culture supernatants from the BRIC-23 spaceflight and ground control cultures, in which several Agr-regulated secreted proteins were increased in abundance in the spaceflight samples. Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences altered metabolism, increased quorum sensing, and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential.",
    "methods": "Methods Overview of BRIC-23 experimental design A general overview of the BRIC-23 flight (FLT) experiment is outlined in Fig. 1, and complete details have been previously described20,21. In brief, two BRIC-PDFUs (each containing five 60 mm Petri dishes with 107 CFU of S. aureus UAMS-123 cells dried on the bottom of each plate) were launched to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-9 on 07/18/2016. Growth was actuated in each petri dish by addition of 8.5 ml tryptone soytone yeast extract medium containing 10% glycerol (TSYG) on 07/22/2016, followed by growth at ~22 °C for 48 h. BRIC-PDFUs were then placed in −80 °C stowage until return from the ISS on 08/30/2016. Samples remained frozen during return and were stored at −80 °C until deintegration. Ground control (GC) experiments were performed asynchronously with the same hardware, configuration, timing, and growth temperature as in the BRIC-23 FL experiment. Deintegrated samples from both FLT and GC were stored at −80 °C until processed for RNA-Seq, proteomics, and metabolomics as described in21. RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics raw data files and associated metadata are available through NASA Open Science for Life in Space (OSDR) entry OSD-145: BRIC-23 GeneLab Process Verification Test: Staphylococcus aureus transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data (10.26030/ga0p-2817) (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-145). BRIC-23 secretomics and data analysis Filter-sterilized and concentrated (5 kDa MW cutoff) BRIC-23 supernatants were provided by NASA’s Life Science Data Archive (LSDA) (n = 5 each of BRIC-23 FLT and GC samples). Proteins from a 480–610 µl volume of each sample were precipitated by adding 120–150 µL of 100% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid to each sample, followed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, then the supernatant was discarded. Protein pellets were washed with 200 µL of cold acetone, then samples were centrifuged again as above, and the acetone wash was repeated for a total of two washes. Protein pellets were dried by leaving tubes open in a Class 2AII biosafety cabinet for 5 min to allow acetone to evaporate. Next, pellets were resuspended in 200 µL urea buffer (6 M urea, 0.4 M Tris, pH 7.8) and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were measured via Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit, Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (10.59 µg per sample) were used, and three replicates per sample type were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The entire lane per sample was excised with a scalpel and diced into 1 mm2 cubes. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed as previously described69,70. Protein identification and quantification were performed using a label-free quantitative shotgun mass proteomics approach using an HPLC-Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (UF-ICBR proteomics core). Briefly, the peptide samples were analyzed using a 250-mm Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The Thermo EASY nano-LC system was used for liquid chromatography, employing a 20-mm C16 pre-column (Thermo Scientific) to remove impurities. A reversed-phase C18 analytical column with a 100 Å pore (Thermo Scientific, Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 LC Column) was used for sample separation. The following solvents were used for chromatography: solvent A (0.1% formic acid), solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with a 2–40% solvent B acetonitrile gradient for 105 min, followed by a 14-minute wash with 98% solvent B, and equilibration with 2% solvent A. The LC system was directly interfaced with the Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. The Orbitrap detector acquired MS data at 120 K resolution with a scan range of 350–2000 m/z. For MS/MS analysis, ions were isolated by a quadrupole, prioritizing the most intense ions, and ions for all available parallelizable times were injected. Precursor ions were then excluded for 36 s. Fragmentation was performed using collision-induced dissociation (CID) at a collision energy of 35% and an activation time of 10 ms. Proteins were identified and quantified from the generated raw data using Proteome Discoverer, as previously described69,71–78. These data were also analyzed by Scaffold software version 4.11.0 (Proteome Software, Inc., USA) to identify secreted proteins with statistically significant alterations in expression. Briefly, tandem mass spectra were extracted, charge state deconvoluted, and deisotoped using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) samples were analyzed by using the SEQUEST algorithm (Thermo Fisher) using available databases containing S. aureus proteins (Genbank #BX571856.1) and contaminants. Scaffold software version 4.11.0 (Proteome Software, Inc., USA) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications, where the required delta Cn scores were >0.2 and XCorr scores were >1.2, 1.9, 2.3, and 2.6 for singly, doubly, triply, and quadruply charged peptides, respectively. Protein identifications were accepted if they were established at >95.0% probability and contained >2 identified peptides, with a peptide FDR of 0.2%. The protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm. Weighted spectral counts were used for protein quantification, and data were normalized before the fold changes were calculated between the flight and control samples. The P < 0.05 (Student t-test, calculated in GraphPad Prism) and a minimum 1.5-fold change between treatment and control proteins indicated proteins with significant changes in abundance. Secretomics raw data files and associated metadata are available through NASA OSDR entry OSD-500: BRIC-23: Secretomics (10.26030/rztr-e997) (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-500). BRIC-23 cellular proteomics analysis Cellular proteins were identified and quantified from the generated raw data from the BRIC-23 experiment (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-145) using Proteome Discoverer. Briefly, tandem mass spectra were extracted, charge state deconvoluted, and deisotoped using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) samples were analyzed by using the SEQUEST algorithm (Thermo Fisher) using available databases containing S. aureus proteins (Genbank #BX571856.1). All analyzed fractions were merged before the analysis. SEQUEST search parameters were as follows: two maximum trypsin mis-cleavages, precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da; static modifications were TMT six-plex/+229.163 Da (N-terminus, Lys) and carbamidomethyl modification/+57.021 Da (Cys); dynamic modification was oxidation modification/+15.995 Da (Met). Maximum dynamic modifications per peptide were four. High XCorr Confidence Thresholds were 1.2, 1.9, 2.3, and 2.6 for z = 1, 2, 3, and >4, respectively. The maximum allowable delta Cn value was 0.05. Moreover, a decoy databank search was performed to establish FDR at a minimum of 0.05 for protein identifications, where the validation was done using the q-value method. All the medium and high-confidence peptides were used to identify and quantify proteins. The reporter ions (i.e., m/z 126, 127 N, 127 C, 128 N, 131) were identified where the most confident centroid was used and 10 ppm for reporter ion mass tolerance. The reporter ion values were normalized to control samples (128 N). Proteins belonging to multiple protein groups were grouped into a single accession number, and final ratios were reported. Fold changes were calculated between flight and ground samples, where the P-value was calculated using the Student’s t-test (P < 0.05), indicating proteins with significant changes in abundance (minimum 1.5-fold change). BRIC-23 RNA-Seq analysis FastQ data files from n = 9 FLT and n = 9 GC samples were downloaded from OSDR (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-145) and imported into CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen) for analysis. Ribosomal RNA reads were filtered out, and the remaining reads were mapped to the S. aureus MRSA252 genome (Genbank #BX571856.1). The UAMS-1 genome (strain used in the BRIC-23 flight experiment) is not closed. Therefore, the updated Genbank genome file for MRSA252, which contains annotations for sRNAs79 and critical virulence genes such as phenol soluble modulins (psma1-4), was used instead. A previously published analysis pipeline was followed79,80 using the “RNA-Seq analysis” feature of CLC Genomics Workbench version 21, with quantile normalization of data sets81. Standard cutoffs ( ≥ 2-fold change, mean normalized expression value ≥ 10 for both samples) were used to curate differential gene expression (DE) data, performed as described in82. Microsoft Excel was used for RNA-Seq DE data reduction and statistical analysis. Student’s two-tailed t-test was used to determine significance (P < 0.000016 with 5% FDR Bonferroni correction). Metabolomics Analysis MetaboAnalyst 5.083 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/home.xhtml) was used to quantify the cellular and supernatant untargeted metabolomics data from BRIC-23 datasets (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-145). All missing values were replaced by half of the minimum positive value found within the data. However, features with over 50% missing values were removed from the dataset. The data were normalized by sum and subjected to log transformation and auto-scaling, where the values were mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of each variable. A P-value threshold of 0.05 (Student t-test) was used for generating volcano plots and a fold change of 1.5. Bioinformatics Functional categories of genes/proteins identified by RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics as being statistically significant ( > 2-fold change in expression for RNA-Seq, and >1.5-fold change for proteomics and secretomics) were assigned using manual curation based on gene annotation and/or predicted function using the following databases: Aureowiki84, Uniprot85, PATRIC86 and Biocyc87. Hierarchical clustering and heat map generation of statistically significant DE data was performed using 1-Pearson correlation on rows and columns, using Morpheus default settings (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus). Venn diagram of overlapping and unique DE genes/proteins identified by RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics as being statistically significant with > 2-fold change in expression for RNA-Seq and > 1.5-fold change for proteomics and secretomics, was generated using OmicsBox (BioBam, Valencia, Spain)88. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics data was performed using ClustVis89. PCA plots for metabolomics data were generated with Rscript chemometrics.R within the MetaboAnalyst program83. RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and/or secretomics DE data were analyzed using Paint-omics version 325 and STRING version 11.526 to detect enriched KEGG pathways and genes/proteins, respectively. The  MRSA252 genome (Genbank #BX571856.1) was used as a reference in both analyses. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis specific to each -omics analysis is described in each respective section above. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel, Graphpad Prism 9, Scaffold software version 4.11.0, or MetaboAnalyst 5.0, as indicated.

    "results": "Results Experimental considerations, sample variability, and clustering amongst FLT and GC samples As outlined in Fig. 1a, the BRIC-23 flight (FLT) experiment and corresponding asynchronous ground controls (GCs) were conducted on S. aureus cultures grown to a single time point (48 h) at ISS ambient ( ~ 22 °C) temperature. The total CFUs per petri dish harvested from both flight and ground control experiments (as reported in OSDR entry OSD-145) suggested that the FLT cultures may have grown to higher cell densities compared to GC cultures (Fig. 1b).

For B and C, data represent the average of n = 9 biological samples per growth condition, error bars = standard deviation. P-values (two-tailed t-test) are shown.Principle components analysis (PCA) was performed on all quantile normalized Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM) gene expression values from the BRIC-23 FLT and GC RNA-Seq samples (n = 9 per experimental group) (Fig. 2a). This analysis revealed that the samples within each experimental group showed robust clustering, and that most of the sample variability correlated with experimental group (FLT vs. GC) along the PC1 axis. Cellular proteomics (Fig. 2b) and secretomics (Fig. 2c) PCA of scaled abundances and normalized weighted spectra, respectively, revealed similar trends as the RNA-Seq data. All datasets were also subjected to differential expression/abundance analysis to identify differences in transcript and protein relative abundances between spaceflight and ground control samples. FLT and GC genes that showed statistically significant differences in relative abundance ( > 2-fold change) in the RNA-Seq dataset (summarized in Supplemental Table 1) were also subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis, which showed robust clustering amongst the biological replicates within each experimental group (n = 9 each), indicating consistency of the data across replicates in each group (Supplemental Fig. 1). For cellular proteomics, the metadata associated with this experiment in GeneLab indicated that due to low protein yield from some of the GC samples, replicates had to be pooled prior to proteomics, resulting in only n = 3 GC samples and n = 9 FLT samples. However, hierarchical clustering analysis on the FLT and GC proteins that showed statistically significant differences in relative abundance ( > 1.5-fold change, Supplemental Table 2) indicated good consistency and clustering between the biological replicates within each experimental group (Supplemental Fig. 1). FLT and GC samples (n = 5 each) analyzed for secretomics also displayed strong clustering among proteins with significant differences in relative abundance ( > 1.5-fold change, Supplemental Fig. 1 and Supplemental Table 3). Interestingly, the average concentration of secreted proteins of FLT sample supernatants was approximately 30% less than that of the GC culture supernatants (Fig. 1c; measured after concentration and removal of < 5 kDa peptides/amino acids).

PCA analysis of RNA-Seq data was performed on normalized RPKM values for all genes using CLC genomics workbench, and PCA analysis of proteomics and secretomics was performed on scaled abundances and normalized weighted spectra, respectively, using Clustvis89. Overlap between RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics datasets In total, 386 genes and proteins were identified across the RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and secretomics datasets that exceeded the respective cutoff values of 2-fold for RNA-Seq and 1.5-fold for proteomics (Fig. 3), with 37 genes/proteins that were common to at least two datasets (Table 1). Of the twenty genes that were common to RNA-Seq and cellular proteomics (Table 1), nineteen displayed increased abundance in spaceflight, including multiple genes and proteins related to the urease pathway and Type VII secretion, as well as two genes related to copper transport and two subunits of L-serine dehydratase. Notably, AgrA, the main response regulator of the agr quorum sensing system, was found to have both increased transcript levels and increased protein abundance in spaceflight samples. The sole protein downregulated in both datasets was a predicted GMP reductase, responsible for interconversion of purine nucleotides. Eight of the nine genes and proteins overlapping between the RNA-Seq and secretomics datasets were primarily annotated as intracellular proteins, involved in several different pathways. The lone extracellular protein in this dataset, EsxA, is secreted by the Type VII-like Ess secretion system24. Other genes and proteins of the Ess-related secretion system (EsaA, EsaB, EssC) were also upregulated in both the RNA-Seq and cellular proteomics datasets (Table 1). Four genes and proteins were common to all three datasets, and all displayed increased abundance in spaceflight in each analysis. These consisted of the urease alpha and beta subunits, the urease accessory protein UreG, and the secreted EsxA protein described above (Table 1). Fig. 3.

Plus (+) and minus (-) symbols designate upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in FLT samples relative to GC samples. Overview of gene and protein functional categories identified in multi-omics analysis The statistically significant changes in transcripts and proteins that fell within the fold-change cutoff criteria for each dataset ( > 2-fold for RNA-Seq, > 1.5-fold for proteomics and secretomics) were manually curated and functionally categorized to broadly examine which aspects of S. aureus physiology and virulence were affected by spaceflight conditions (Fig. 4). All datasets contained many hypothetical or uncharacterized proteins and genes, accounting for approximately 21% of all DE genes (RNA-Seq, Fig. 4a), 33% of all DE cellular proteins (proteomics, Fig. 4b), and 33% of all DE secreted proteins (secretomics, Fig. 4c). In the RNA-Seq DE analysis, gene transcripts related to extracellular transport, urease, and Type VII secretion were among the most commonly upregulated, along with genes involved in capsule biosynthesis and metabolism of a variety of substrates, including amino acids and carbohydrates (Fig. 4a). As discussed in more detail below, genes of the agr P2 (agrBDCA) and P3 (RNAIII) transcripts represented the five most highly upregulated transcripts (14 to 88-fold) in FLT samples (Supplemental Table 1). Additionally, expression of many Agr-independent virulence factors was upregulated in spaceflight relative to the ground controls (discussed in more detail below), as well as expression of genes and/or proteins involved in DNA-binding, transcriptional regulators, ABC transporters, urease subunits, and metal acquisition (Fig. 4). Ribosomal proteins was the most commonly downregulated category in FLT samples amongst cellular proteins, followed by those involved in glycolysis, ATP synthesis, and stress resistance. Additionally, a number of small RNAs (RNA-Seq) were downregulated in FLT samples relative to GC samples (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. Distribution of S. aureus UAMS-1 gene/protein functional categories differentially expressed (DE) during spaceflight relative to ground control. Open in a new tab a BRIC-23 RNA-Seq data was subjected to DE analysis, with cutoffs (DE fold-change ≥ 2, P-value < 0.000016 and mean normalized expression value ≥ 10 for both samples) applied prior to assignment of functional categories (based on S. aureus genome annotations and/or UNIProt database). b, c BRIC-23 cellular proteomics (B) and secretomics (C) functional categories were assigned based on S. aureus genome annotations and/or UNIProt database (P-value < 0.05, fold-change > 1.5).Functional enrichment amongst these omics datasets was also assessed by PaintOmics25 and STRING26 (Table 2 and Supplemental Table 4, respectively), which confirmed the patterns of gene and protein functional categories observed in Fig. 4. Using PaintOmics, an overrepresentation of significant biological features (P < 0.05) of pathways related to arginine biosynthesis, purine metabolism, thiamine metabolism, quorum sensing, and phosphotransferase systems (PTS) were common to both the RNA-Seq and proteomics datasets (Table 2). Additionally, pathways related to ribosome function and fructose/mannose metabolism were significantly enriched in the proteomics dataset, and two-component system and riboflavin metabolism were significantly enriched in the RNA-Seq dataset (Table 2). STRING analysis of RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics DE genes/proteins (meeting statistical and fold-change cutoff criteria) revealed significant (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) enrichment of many of the same functional pathways detected by PaintOmics (Supplemental Table 4). Additionally, categories related to polysaccharide biosynthesis (RNA-Seq), sucrose/starch metabolism (RNA-Seq), heme/virulence (RNA-Seq), nickel cation binding (RNA-Seq and proteomics), and arginine biosynthesis (secretomics) were significantly enriched in STRING analysis of these data.

Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using PaintOmics 3. Expression changes in Agr and virulence factors in spaceflight Notably, expression of genes comprising the agr operon were highly upregulated in spaceflight samples, with agrA, agrB, agrC, and agrD each showing an approximately 14-fold increase in transcript abundance, and RNAIII displaying an 88-fold increase in transcript abundance (Supplemental Table 1). AgrA, the direct transcriptional activator of the agr P2 and P3 operons, was also upregulated 3.96-fold in the FLT proteomics data (Table 1), corroborating the increased transcript abundance of agrA observed in the RNA-Seq data. Additionally, genes and proteins known to be upregulated by Agr were also upregulated in FLT samples in a manner consistent with a highly active Agr system, including increased expression of genes encoding PSM alpha (psmα, 8.08-fold) and gamma hemolysin C (hlgC, 2.20-fold), and increased protein abundance of SspA (6.95-fold), SspB (13.07-fold), and ScpA (7.18-fold)27–32. The secreted metalloprotease aureolysin (Aur), regulated by Agr via repression of Rot30, was also upregulated by 2.2–3.5 fold in the secretomics and proteomics datasets, respectively (Table 1). Agr has also been implicated in positive regulation of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis operon capABCDE33, and expression of these genes was upregulated in spaceflight (2.15–2.39-fold; Supplemental Table 1). Abundance of the surface protein fibronectin-binding protein A (FnbA), the expression of which is inhibited by Agr34,35, was also significantly decreased in the spaceflight proteomics data (−1.81-fold). Several virulence factors not under Agr’s regulatory control were also upregulated in spaceflight samples. The Type VII-like Ess secretion system had six transcripts with increased abundance in FLT samples, four of which were also identified and upregulated in the proteomics and/or secretomics datasets. Staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc) was also highly upregulated in secretomics samples from spaceflight (7.72-fold). Although increased abundance of other non-agr-regulated virulence factors was also observed, such as those implicated in hemolysin production (CvfC, 1.51-fold36) and nasal colonization (SceD, 1.57-fold37), other well-characterized S. aureus virulence factors such as hyaluronidase, coagulase, lipase, and staphylokinase, were not identified as being significantly altered between FLT and GC samples. S. aureus metabolic alterations under spaceflight conditions S. aureus is noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of environments and adjust its metabolism accordingly, and its virulence potential can be mediated by diverse environmental and nutritional stimuli5,38. In addition to genes and proteins related to the Agr quorum sensing system and its regulon, expression patterns of metabolic genes and proteins in spaceflight suggested that these S. aureus cultures may have experienced an altered metabolic state compared to the ground control cultures. Both cellular and secreted metabolites were analyzed for alterations in spaceflight cultures, and PCA plots of metabolomics data indicated that spaceflight samples and ground control samples clustered separately (Supplemental Fig. 2a). These metabolomics data also corroborated many of the changes in gene and protein expression levels associated with S. aureus metabolic functions. Urease expression, for example, was noted to be significantly upregulated in spaceflight, with seven genes upregulated between 4.12 and 5.02-fold and six proteins upregulated between 1.85 and 2.53-fold. Urea concentrations were decreased in spaceflight supernatant samples but did not meet the statistical cutoffs applied to the metabolomics analyses (data not shown). Additionally, altered levels of metabolites, genes and/or proteins related to arginine metabolism (increased ornithine, arginine/ornithine antiporter ArcD, Arginine deiminase ArcA, arginine kinase) were observed in FLT samples relative to GCs (Supplemental Tables 1–3, 5, 6). Spaceflight S. aureus samples also exhibited several features congruent with a transition to catabolism of non-preferred carbon sources. These included decreased abundance of glucose in culture supernatants (Supplemental Table 6), decreased abundance of a glucose import protein (SAR1435), and functional enrichment (Table 1) and upregulated expression of genes and/or proteins of several sugar transporters (SAR0235, SAR0193, SAR2244, SAR1803) (Supplemental Tables 1–3). Several members of TCA cycle, including CitZ, OdhA/B, and SdhA/B displayed increased protein abundance and/or gene expression in spaceflight samples. Altered levels of metabolites, genes and/or proteins related to cysteine/serine metabolism (increased O-acetylserine, homoserine, cysteine, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and serine dehydratase), and methionine metabolism (decreased methionine, increased methionine sulfoxide, increased methionine ABC transporter) were also observed in spaceflight samples relative to ground controls (Supplemental Tables 1–3, 5, 6). Additionally, increased expression of several metal transport genes was observed in the spaceflight cultures (Supplemental Table 1).",
    "discussion": "Discussion Our analysis of the S. aureus RNA-Seq, proteomics, secretomics, and metabolomics datasets from BRIC-23 indicate that S. aureus undergoes significant alterations in physiology and virulence factor production in the spaceflight environment which could alter its pathogenic potential for astronauts conducting long-term spaceflight missions. However, these results need to be interpreted in the context of the experimental confines of the BRIC-23 experiment, namely that only a single time point (48 h growth) was assessed, and that the experiment was conducted at ISS ambient temperature ( ~ 22 °C). Ground-based pre-science verification test (pre-SVT) growth curves previously conducted at ~25 °C (using dried starting inoculum on petri dishes and growth medium identical to those used in the BRIC-23 flight and ground controls) indicated that S. aureus entered early stationary phase by 48 h growth in this condition20. In comparison, SVT incubation of BRIC-PDFUs in the the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at KSC conducted at ~22 °C, which more closely mimicked ISS ambient temperature, showed that cultures reached late exponential phase growth by 48 h20. Since a true growth curve (multiple time points) was not conducted in the actual BRIC-23 flight and ground control experiments, we cannot speculate on any potential differences in the growth rates and/or phase of growth between BRIC-23 FLT and GC cultures at the 48 h time point. However, the reported total CFUs per petri dish in both flight and ground control experiments suggest that the FLT cultures may have grown to higher cell densities compared to GC cultures (Fig. 1b). Similar to this, experiments previously conducted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated that this bacterium achieved increased final cell density (as measured by flow cytometry of fixed cells) in flight cultures relative to ground controls under the specific growth medium characteristics of low phosphate and low oxygen availability39. Esherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis spaceflight cultures grown at 23 °C in a fluid processing apparatus also achieved increased stationary phase cell densities in flight cultures relative to their corresponding ground controls40. It is therefore not clear whether the S. aureus BRIC-23 FLT cultures were in an identical phase of growth compared to the GC cultures, which could impact some of the observed differences discussed in more detail below. Additionally, temperature is known to have a significant impact on S. aureus gene expression, as it has recently been shown that expression of genes encoding secreted proteases and toxins (aur, sspA, sspB, esxA), as well as agrD, displayed increased transcript abundance at 34 °C compared to 37 °C and 40 °C41. Therefore, the BRIC-23 data could be considered more relevant to conditions experienced by S. aureus outside of the host (i.e., growth and/or persistence on fomites, which could impact S. aureus transmission). Future experiments examining multiple time points and a more biologically relevant incubation temperature (35–37 °C) represent logical follow-up steps to gain a complete picture of the S. aureus physiological response to spaceflight. A major finding of the BRIC-23 data analysis was that the S. aureus Agr quorum sensing response, as well as increased expression of both Agr-dependent and Agr-independent virulence factors, was highly upregulated during this spaceflight experiment. Given the challenges of medical treatment of bacterial infections in space, increased potential for Agr quorum sensing and production of virulence factors are concerns for astronaut health, and worthy of additional study of this bacterium under spaceflight conditions. Agr function has been identified as a critical component of infection and lethality in animal models, including rabbit and mouse models of osteomyelitis, necrotic pneumonia, and skin infection23,42,43. Additionally, agr has been observed to be important for human infection, with CA-MRSA skin infections strongly affected by Agr activity27. However, naturally occurring agr mutant strains as well as mixed cultures of wildtype and mutant agr variants have been isolated from human infections, indicating that Agr is not the only system responsible for pathogenesis, and that loss of Agr function may in fact contribute to chronic infection44,45. Autoinduction of Agr is activated in late exponential phase and stationary phase in response to high cell density, as higher concentrations of secreted AIP can be recognized by AgrC, resulting in a positive feedback loop of agr activation. Low Agr activity is characterized by cell attachment and biofilm formation, and as cell density increases, agr activation encourages a cellular transition to a dispersal and pathogenesis-focused lifestyle8,31,46–48. This is accomplished through upregulation of secreted proteases and toxins, which help cells overcome host defenses, and downregulation of surface adhesion factors to aid in dissemination throughout the host. Given that higher CFUs were recovered from the BRIC-23 FLT cultures at 48 h growth relative to the GC cultures, it is possible that the increased cell density of FLT cultures contributed to increased activation of Agr. Interestingly, even though increased Agr activation was observed in FLT cultures, the average concentration of secreted proteins in FLT sample supernatants was approximately 30% less than the GC culture supernatants (Fig. 1c), possibly a consequence of increased expression and abundance of secreted proteases (SspA, SspB, ScpA, Aur) which are known to have significant effects on the stability of the S. aureus exoproteome49–53. Interestingly, observations from previous ground-based simulated microgravity studies of S. aureus also showed that simulated microgravity cultures excreted less protein compared to normal gravity controls19. Several virulence factors not under Agr’s regulatory control were also upregulated in spaceflight samples. These included several components of the Type VII-like Ess secretion system, which has been implicated in protection from host antimicrobial resistance54 as well as exhibiting a potential role in cross-strain competition24. Therefore, increased expression of the Ess system could potentially confer a competitive advantage to S. aureus in colonizing and/or persisting on environmental fomites, as well as the human body. Staphylococcal nuclease, controlled by the SaeRS regulatory system55,56, was also highly upregulated in secretomics samples from spaceflight. This enzyme breaks down extracellular DNA and RNA57, contributing to biofilm dispersal58. Nuclease also contributes to S. aureus pathogenicity by enhancing its ability to evade killing by neutrophils, via degradation of the DNA backbone of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)59. Increased abundance of other non-agr-regulated virulence factors implicated in hemolysin production (CvfC36) and nasal colonization (SceD37) was also observed. Collectively, this data suggests that the virulence potential of S. aureus in spaceflight could be amplified by factors in addition to the Agr regulon. Additionally, S. aureus appears to undergo an altered metabolism during spaceflight. For example, urease subunit gene expression and/or protein abundance was significantly upregulated in spaceflight. This enzyme hydrolyzes urea to form ammonia and carbon dioxide, and is a vital contributor to acid stress survival in S. aureus60. Increased urease expression and activity, in conjunction with increased acid production, has also been demonstrated in S. aureus biofilms61. Altered levels of metabolites, genes and/or proteins related to arginine metabolism were also observed in spaceflight samples relative to ground controls. Collectively, these changes could reflect an overall increase in urea cycle activity in response to acid stress and/or as an alternative pathway for ATP production, as the arginine deiminase pathway produces both ammonia and ATP (via substrate-level phosphorylation)62,63. Spaceflight S. aureus samples also exhibited several features congruent with a transition to catabolism of non-preferred carbon sources, including decreased abundance of extracellular glucose, increased abundance of gene transcripts and/or proteins encoding various sugar transporters, and increased protein abundance and/or gene expression of TCA cycle enzymes. Derepression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in S. aureus has been associated with decreased availability of carbon sources which generally occurs during post-exponential growth64,65. Additionally, altered levels of metabolites, genes and/or proteins related to cysteine/serine metabolism (increased O-acetylserine, homoserine, cysteine, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and serine dehydratase), and methionine metabolism (decreased methionine, increased methionine sulfoxide, increased methionine ABC transporter) were observed in spaceflight samples relative to ground controls (Supplemental Tables 1–3, 5, 6). These changes, in combination with increased expression of several metal transport genes (Supplemental Table 1), suggest that S. aureus could have altered sulfur and/or metal requirements to support its metabolism under flight conditions. The global regulator CodY was also identified in the cellular proteomics analysis, with a –1.52-fold change in spaceflight samples. CodY notably responds to changes in nutrient levels and alters the expression of a wide range of metabolic genes, virulence factors, and other regulators56,66–68. Some targets known to be repressed by this regulator include capsule synthesis, Agr, and staphylococcal nuclease, which all exhibit increased abundance in spaceflight samples (Supplemental Tables 1–3). Therefore, depleted nutrients in the spaceflight environment could contribute to these observed alterations in S. aureus virulence factor production and metabolism, partly through decreased CodY activity. In summary, data from the BRIC-23 experiment indicate that S. aureus spaceflight cultures exhibit changes in physiology and virulence factor production (summarized in Fig. 5) which could affect its ability to cause human disease during long-duration spaceflight missions. Specifically, S. aureus spaceflight samples may have altered metabolism (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, and transport of non-preferred carbon sources, and decreased glycolysis/fermentation and translation machinery) relative to ground-control cultures. Furthermore, both Agr-dependent and Agr-independent virulence factor expression were upregulated in spaceflight, with the agr RNAII and RNAIII transcripts themselves being the most highly upregulated. However, it is important to interpret these results in the context of the experimental confines of the BRIC-23 experiment. Fig. 5.

Copyright notice ID: 10774393 PMID: 38191486 Abstract Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk factor for opportunistic infections. To gain insight into S. aureus virulence potential in the spaceflight environment, we analyzed RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics data from the “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit on the international space station. This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. aureus metabolism is altered in spaceflight conditions relative to the ground controls. Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences increased quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential. Subject terms: Microbiology, Molecular biologyIntroduction Staphylococcus aureus is a pernicious pathogen capable of infecting nearly every tissue and organ system in the human body. Most S. aureus strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, and certain isolates are resistant to nearly all antibiotics used in the clinical setting. The CDC 2019 Antibiotic Threats Report listed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at a “serious” threat level, with over 10,000 estimated deaths in 2017 alone1. S. aureus is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired infections, and in recent years, highly virulent and transmissible community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains have emerged. Approximately 30% of humans are nasally colonized by S. aureus, which represents a significant risk factor for invasive infections2. As a pathogen, S. aureus expresses a vast repertoire of cell surface adhesins, secreted toxins, and tissue-degrading enzymes that contribute to its ability to colonize host tissue, evade the immune system, and transition from a localized to systemic infection. The expression of these virulence factors is coordinated by a complex network of genetic regulators, including the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum-sensing system, which has been extensively reviewed3–7. The agr operon is comprised of two transcripts, RNAII and RNAIII, which are activated by the P2 and P3 promoters, respectively8. RNAIII is an untranslated RNA species that regulates a variety of target genes at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, making it a primary downstream effector of the Agr system, whereas the RNAII transcript contains the agrBDCA genes [reviewed in refs. 6,7]: AgrD, which is processed and secreted out of the cell in a form known as the autoinducing peptide (AIP), AgrB, the membrane protein that performs this processing and secretion, AgrC, a sensor kinase which recognizes the AIP and transduces the signal to AgrA, the response regulator which activates transcription at the P2 and P3 promoters. S. aureus also poses a potential health risk to astronauts during long-term spaceflight missions. This bacterium was recovered from the nasal passages of Apollo 13 and 14 astronauts at significantly higher numbers compared to preflight samples collected from the same astronauts9, and S. aureus was also among the most frequently isolated bacteria from astronauts that participated in 25 Space Shuttle missions (STS-26 to STS-50)10. Furthermore, several studies monitoring the presence of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS)11–13 as well as in the environment of a full-duration simulation of a crewed return flight to Mars14 identified staphylococci as being predominant. Because of the potential threat of S. aureus to astronaut health, this pathogen’s stress resistance and virulence potential have been studied in both a spaceflight experiment15 and in ground-based models15–19 of simulated microgravity. In the previous spaceflight experiment, S. aureus virulence was reduced when assessed as a function of the quantity of residual bacteria in the presence and absence of Caenorhabditis elegans15. However, these studies were conducted using a nematode feeding model, which does not entirely reflect the complexity of S. aureus pathogenesis in humans. NASA previously conducted a “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) spaceflight experiment (OSDR accession# OSD-145), designed to measure the response of both Bacillus subtilis and S. aureus to the spaceflight environment20,21. In this experiment, Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs)22 were used to grow asynchronous ground controls and spaceflight samples of S. aureus strain UAMS-1, a clinical MSSA isolate that was originally isolated from an osteomyelitis infection23. Herein, our analysis of the S. aureus RNA-Seq, proteomics, and metabolomics datasets from BRIC-23 suggests that S. aureus spaceflight samples may have altered metabolism (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, and transport of non-preferred carbon sources, and decreased glycolysis/fermentation and translation machinery) relative to ground-control cultures. Furthermore, agr genes and several positively regulated targets were the most highly upregulated transcripts in spaceflight. We also performed secretome analysis of culture supernatants from the BRIC-23 spaceflight and ground control cultures, in which several Agr-regulated secreted proteins were increased in abundance in the spaceflight samples. Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences altered metabolism, increased quorum sensing, and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential.Results Experimental considerations, sample variability, and clustering amongst FLT and GC samples As outlined in Fig. 1a, the BRIC-23 flight (FLT) experiment and corresponding asynchronous ground controls (GCs) were conducted on S. aureus cultures grown to a single time point (48 h) at ISS ambient ( ~ 22 °C) temperature. The total CFUs per petri dish harvested from both flight and ground control experiments (as reported in OSDR entry OSD-145) suggested that the FLT cultures may have grown to higher cell densities compared to GC cultures (Fig. 1b).

Full details have been previously published in20,21. b Average total CFU harvested from FLT and GC cultures. c Average protein concentration (measured after concentration and removal of < 5 kDa peptides/amino acids) of culture supernatants from FLT and GC cultures. For B and C, data represent the average of n = 9 biological samples per growth condition, error bars = standard deviation. P-values (two-tailed t-test) are shown.Principle components analysis (PCA) was performed on all quantile normalized Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM) gene expression values from the BRIC-23 FLT and GC RNA-Seq samples (n = 9 per experimental group) (Fig. 2a). This analysis revealed that the samples within each experimental group showed robust clustering, and that most of the sample variability correlated with experimental group (FLT vs. GC) along the PC1 axis. Cellular proteomics (Fig. 2b) and secretomics (Fig. 2c) PCA of scaled abundances and normalized weighted spectra, respectively, revealed similar trends as the RNA-Seq data. All datasets were also subjected to differential expression/abundance analysis to identify differences in transcript and protein relative abundances between spaceflight and ground control samples. FLT and GC genes that showed statistically significant differences in relative abundance ( > 2-fold change) in the RNA-Seq dataset (summarized in Supplemental Table 1) were also subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis, which showed robust clustering amongst the biological replicates within each experimental group (n = 9 each), indicating consistency of the data across replicates in each group (Supplemental Fig. 1). For cellular proteomics, the metadata associated with this experiment in GeneLab indicated that due to low protein yield from some of the GC samples, replicates had to be pooled prior to proteomics, resulting in only n = 3 GC samples and n = 9 FLT samples. However, hierarchical clustering analysis on the FLT and GC proteins that showed statistically significant differences in relative abundance ( > 1.5-fold change, Supplemental Table 2) indicated good consistency and clustering between the biological replicates within each experimental group (Supplemental Fig. 1). FLT and GC samples (n = 5 each) analyzed for secretomics also displayed strong clustering among proteins with significant differences in relative abundance ( > 1.5-fold change, Supplemental Fig. 1 and Supplemental Table 3). Interestingly, the average concentration of secreted proteins of FLT sample supernatants was approximately 30% less than that of the GC culture supernatants (Fig. 1c; measured after concentration and removal of < 5 kDa peptides/amino acids).

In all graphs, BRIC-23 flight (FLT; circles) and ground control (GC; triangles) samples are indicated. PCA analysis of RNA-Seq data was performed on normalized RPKM values for all genes using CLC genomics workbench, and PCA analysis of proteomics and secretomics was performed on scaled abundances and normalized weighted spectra, respectively, using Clustvis89.Overlap between RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics datasets In total, 386 genes and proteins were identified across the RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and secretomics datasets that exceeded the respective cutoff values of 2-fold for RNA-Seq and 1.5-fold for proteomics (Fig. 3), with 37 genes/proteins that were common to at least two datasets (Table 1). Of the twenty genes that were common to RNA-Seq and cellular proteomics (Table 1), nineteen displayed increased abundance in spaceflight, including multiple genes and proteins related to the urease pathway and Type VII secretion, as well as two genes related to copper transport and two subunits of L-serine dehydratase. Notably, AgrA, the main response regulator of the agr quorum sensing system, was found to have both increased transcript levels and increased protein abundance in spaceflight samples. The sole protein downregulated in both datasets was a predicted GMP reductase, responsible for interconversion of purine nucleotides. Eight of the nine genes and proteins overlapping between the RNA-Seq and secretomics datasets were primarily annotated as intracellular proteins, involved in several different pathways. The lone extracellular protein in this dataset, EsxA, is secreted by the Type VII-like Ess secretion system24. Other genes and proteins of the Ess-related secretion system (EsaA, EsaB, EssC) were also upregulated in both the RNA-Seq and cellular proteomics datasets (Table 1). Four genes and proteins were common to all three datasets, and all displayed increased abundance in spaceflight in each analysis. These consisted of the urease alpha and beta subunits, the urease accessory protein UreG, and the secreted EsxA protein described above (Table 1). Fig. 3.

Plus (+) and minus (-) symbols designate upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in FLT samples relative to GC samples.Overview of gene and protein functional categories identified in multi-omics analysis The statistically significant changes in transcripts and proteins that fell within the fold-change cutoff criteria for each dataset ( > 2-fold for RNA-Seq, > 1.5-fold for proteomics and secretomics) were manually curated and functionally categorized to broadly examine which aspects of S. aureus physiology and virulence were affected by spaceflight conditions (Fig. 4). All datasets contained many hypothetical or uncharacterized proteins and genes, accounting for approximately 21% of all DE genes (RNA-Seq, Fig. 4a), 33% of all DE cellular proteins (proteomics, Fig. 4b), and 33% of all DE secreted proteins (secretomics, Fig. 4c). In the RNA-Seq DE analysis, gene transcripts related to extracellular transport, urease, and Type VII secretion were among the most commonly upregulated, along with genes involved in capsule biosynthesis and metabolism of a variety of substrates, including amino acids and carbohydrates (Fig. 4a). As discussed in more detail below, genes of the agr P2 (agrBDCA) and P3 (RNAIII) transcripts represented the five most highly upregulated transcripts (14 to 88-fold) in FLT samples (Supplemental Table 1). Additionally, expression of many Agr-independent virulence factors was upregulated in spaceflight relative to the ground controls (discussed in more detail below), as well as expression of genes and/or proteins involved in DNA-binding, transcriptional regulators, ABC transporters, urease subunits, and metal acquisition (Fig. 4). Ribosomal proteins was the most commonly downregulated category in FLT samples amongst cellular proteins, followed by those involved in glycolysis, ATP synthesis, and stress resistance. Additionally, a number of small RNAs (RNA-Seq) were downregulated in FLT samples relative to GC samples (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4. Distribution of S. aureus UAMS-1 gene/protein functional categories differentially expressed (DE) during spaceflight relative to ground control. Open in a new tab a BRIC-23 RNA-Seq data was subjected to DE analysis, with cutoffs (DE fold-change ≥ 2, P-value < 0.000016 and mean normalized expression value ≥ 10 for both samples) applied prior to assignment of functional categories (based on S. aureus genome annotations and/or UNIProt database). b, c BRIC-23 cellular proteomics (B) and secretomics (C) functional categories were assigned based on S. aureus genome annotations and/or UNIProt database (P-value < 0.05, fold-change > 1.5).Functional enrichment amongst these omics datasets was also assessed by PaintOmics25 and STRING26 (Table 2 and Supplemental Table 4, respectively), which confirmed the patterns of gene and protein functional categories observed in Fig. 4. Using PaintOmics, an overrepresentation of significant biological features (P < 0.05) of pathways related to arginine biosynthesis, purine metabolism, thiamine metabolism, quorum sensing, and phosphotransferase systems (PTS) were common to both the RNA-Seq and proteomics datasets (Table 2). Additionally, pathways related to ribosome function and fructose/mannose metabolism were significantly enriched in the proteomics dataset, and two-component system and riboflavin metabolism were significantly enriched in the RNA-Seq dataset (Table 2). STRING analysis of RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics DE genes/proteins (meeting statistical and fold-change cutoff criteria) revealed significant (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05) enrichment of many of the same functional pathways detected by PaintOmics (Supplemental Table 4). Additionally, categories related to polysaccharide biosynthesis (RNA-Seq), sucrose/starch metabolism (RNA-Seq), heme/virulence (RNA-Seq), nickel cation binding (RNA-Seq and proteomics), and arginine biosynthesis (secretomics) were significantly enriched in STRING analysis of these data.

Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using PaintOmics 3.Expression changes in Agr and virulence factors in spaceflight Notably, expression of genes comprising the agr operon were highly upregulated in spaceflight samples, with agrA, agrB, agrC, and agrD each showing an approximately 14-fold increase in transcript abundance, and RNAIII displaying an 88-fold increase in transcript abundance (Supplemental Table 1). AgrA, the direct transcriptional activator of the agr P2 and P3 operons, was also upregulated 3.96-fold in the FLT proteomics data (Table 1), corroborating the increased transcript abundance of agrA observed in the RNA-Seq data. Additionally, genes and proteins known to be upregulated by Agr were also upregulated in FLT samples in a manner consistent with a highly active Agr system, including increased expression of genes encoding PSM alpha (psmα, 8.08-fold) and gamma hemolysin C (hlgC, 2.20-fold), and increased protein abundance of SspA (6.95-fold), SspB (13.07-fold), and ScpA (7.18-fold)27–32. The secreted metalloprotease aureolysin (Aur), regulated by Agr via repression of Rot30, was also upregulated by 2.2–3.5 fold in the secretomics and proteomics datasets, respectively (Table 1). Agr has also been implicated in positive regulation of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis operon capABCDE33, and expression of these genes was upregulated in spaceflight (2.15–2.39-fold; Supplemental Table 1). Abundance of the surface protein fibronectin-binding protein A (FnbA), the expression of which is inhibited by Agr34,35, was also significantly decreased in the spaceflight proteomics data (−1.81-fold). Several virulence factors not under Agr’s regulatory control were also upregulated in spaceflight samples. The Type VII-like Ess secretion system had six transcripts with increased abundance in FLT samples, four of which were also identified and upregulated in the proteomics and/or secretomics datasets. Staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc) was also highly upregulated in secretomics samples from spaceflight (7.72-fold). Although increased abundance of other non-agr-regulated virulence factors was also observed, such as those implicated in hemolysin production (CvfC, 1.51-fold36) and nasal colonization (SceD, 1.57-fold37), other well-characterized S. aureus virulence factors such as hyaluronidase, coagulase, lipase, and staphylokinase, were not identified as being significantly altered between FLT and GC samples. S. aureus metabolic alterations under spaceflight conditions S. aureus is noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of environments and adjust its metabolism accordingly, and its virulence potential can be mediated by diverse environmental and nutritional stimuli5,38. In addition to genes and proteins related to the Agr quorum sensing system and its regulon, expression patterns of metabolic genes and proteins in spaceflight suggested that these S. aureus cultures may have experienced an altered metabolic state compared to the ground control cultures. Both cellular and secreted metabolites were analyzed for alterations in spaceflight cultures, and PCA plots of metabolomics data indicated that spaceflight samples and ground control samples clustered separately (Supplemental Fig. 2a). These metabolomics data also corroborated many of the changes in gene and protein expression levels associated with S. aureus metabolic functions. Urease expression, for example, was noted to be significantly upregulated in spaceflight, with seven genes upregulated between 4.12 and 5.02-fold and six proteins upregulated between 1.85 and 2.53-fold. Urea concentrations were decreased in spaceflight supernatant samples but did not meet the statistical cutoffs applied to the metabolomics analyses (data not shown). Additionally, altered levels of metabolites, genes and/or proteins related to arginine metabolism (increased ornithine, arginine/ornithine antiporter ArcD, Arginine deiminase ArcA, arginine kinase) were observed in FLT samples relative to GCs (Supplemental Tables 1–3, 5, 6). Spaceflight S. aureus samples also exhibited several features congruent with a transition to catabolism of non-preferred carbon sources. These included decreased abundance of glucose in culture supernatants (Supplemental Table 6), decreased abundance of a glucose import protein (SAR1435), and functional enrichment (Table 1) and upregulated expression of genes and/or proteins of several sugar transporters (SAR0235, SAR0193, SAR2244, SAR1803) (Supplemental Tables 1–3). Several members of TCA cycle, including CitZ, OdhA/B, and SdhA/B displayed increased protein abundance and/or gene expression in spaceflight samples. Altered levels of metabolites, genes and/or proteins related to cysteine/serine metabolism (increased O-acetylserine, homoserine, cysteine, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and serine dehydratase), and methionine metabolism (decreased methionine, increased methionine sulfoxide, increased methionine ABC transporter) were also observed in spaceflight samples relative to ground controls (Supplemental Tables 1–3, 5, 6). Additionally, increased expression of several metal transport genes was observed in the spaceflight cultures (Supplemental Table 1).Discussion Our analysis of the S. aureus RNA-Seq, proteomics, secretomics, and metabolomics datasets from BRIC-23 indicate that S. aureus undergoes significant alterations in physiology and virulence factor production in the spaceflight environment which could alter its pathogenic potential for astronauts conducting long-term spaceflight missions. However, these results need to be interpreted in the context of the experimental confines of the BRIC-23 experiment, namely that only a single time point (48 h growth) was assessed, and that the experiment was conducted at ISS ambient temperature ( ~ 22 °C). Ground-based pre-science verification test (pre-SVT) growth curves previously conducted at ~25 °C (using dried starting inoculum on petri dishes and growth medium identical to those used in the BRIC-23 flight and ground controls) indicated that S. aureus entered early stationary phase by 48 h growth in this condition20. In comparison, SVT incubation of BRIC-PDFUs in the the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at KSC conducted at ~22 °C, which more closely mimicked ISS ambient temperature, showed that cultures reached late exponential phase growth by 48 h20. Since a true growth curve (multiple time points) was not conducted in the actual BRIC-23 flight and ground control experiments, we cannot speculate on any potential differences in the growth rates and/or phase of growth between BRIC-23 FLT and GC cultures at the 48 h time point. However, the reported total CFUs per petri dish in both flight and ground control experiments suggest that the FLT cultures may have grown to higher cell densities compared to GC cultures (Fig. 1b). Similar to this, experiments previously conducted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated that this bacterium achieved increased final cell density (as measured by flow cytometry of fixed cells) in flight cultures relative to ground controls under the specific growth medium characteristics of low phosphate and low oxygen availability39. Esherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis spaceflight cultures grown at 23 °C in a fluid processing apparatus also achieved increased stationary phase cell densities in flight cultures relative to their corresponding ground controls40. It is therefore not clear whether the S. aureus BRIC-23 FLT cultures were in an identical phase of growth compared to the GC cultures, which could impact some of the observed differences discussed in more detail below. Additionally, temperature is known to have a significant impact on S. aureus gene expression, as it has recently been shown that expression of genes encoding secreted proteases and toxins (aur, sspA, sspB, esxA), as well as agrD, displayed increased transcript abundance at 34 °C compared to 37 °C and 40 °C41. Therefore, the BRIC-23 data could be considered more relevant to conditions experienced by S. aureus outside of the host (i.e., growth and/or persistence on fomites, which could impact S. aureus transmission). Future experiments examining multiple time points and a more biologically relevant incubation temperature (35–37 °C) represent logical follow-up steps to gain a complete picture of the S. aureus physiological response to spaceflight. A major finding of the BRIC-23 data analysis was that the S. aureus Agr quorum sensing response, as well as increased expression of both Agr-dependent and Agr-independent virulence factors, was highly upregulated during this spaceflight experiment. Given the challenges of medical treatment of bacterial infections in space, increased potential for Agr quorum sensing and production of virulence factors are concerns for astronaut health, and worthy of additional study of this bacterium under spaceflight conditions. Agr function has been identified as a critical component of infection and lethality in animal models, including rabbit and mouse models of osteomyelitis, necrotic pneumonia, and skin infection23,42,43. Additionally, agr has been observed to be important for human infection, with CA-MRSA skin infections strongly affected by Agr activity27. However, naturally occurring agr mutant strains as well as mixed cultures of wildtype and mutant agr variants have been isolated from human infections, indicating that Agr is not the only system responsible for pathogenesis, and that loss of Agr function may in fact contribute to chronic infection44,45. Autoinduction of Agr is activated in late exponential phase and stationary phase in response to high cell density, as higher concentrations of secreted AIP can be recognized by AgrC, resulting in a positive feedback loop of agr activation. Low Agr activity is characterized by cell attachment and biofilm formation, and as cell density increases, agr activation encourages a cellular transition to a dispersal and pathogenesis-focused lifestyle8,31,46–48. This is accomplished through upregulation of secreted proteases and toxins, which help cells overcome host defenses, and downregulation of surface adhesion factors to aid in dissemination throughout the host. Given that higher CFUs were recovered from the BRIC-23 FLT cultures at 48 h growth relative to the GC cultures, it is possible that the increased cell density of FLT cultures contributed to increased activation of Agr. Interestingly, even though increased Agr activation was observed in FLT cultures, the average concentration of secreted proteins in FLT sample supernatants was approximately 30% less than the GC culture supernatants (Fig. 1c), possibly a consequence of increased expression and abundance of secreted proteases (SspA, SspB, ScpA, Aur) which are known to have significant effects on the stability of the S. aureus exoproteome49–53. Interestingly, observations from previous ground-based simulated microgravity studies of S. aureus also showed that simulated microgravity cultures excreted less protein compared to normal gravity controls19. Several virulence factors not under Agr’s regulatory control were also upregulated in spaceflight samples. These included several components of the Type VII-like Ess secretion system, which has been implicated in protection from host antimicrobial resistance54 as well as exhibiting a potential role in cross-strain competition24. Therefore, increased expression of the Ess system could potentially confer a competitive advantage to S. aureus in colonizing and/or persisting on environmental fomites, as well as the human body. Staphylococcal nuclease, controlled by the SaeRS regulatory system55,56, was also highly upregulated in secretomics samples from spaceflight. This enzyme breaks down extracellular DNA and RNA57, contributing to biofilm dispersal58. Nuclease also contributes to S. aureus pathogenicity by enhancing its ability to evade killing by neutrophils, via degradation of the DNA backbone of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)59. Increased abundance of other non-agr-regulated virulence factors implicated in hemolysin production (CvfC36) and nasal colonization (SceD37) was also observed. Collectively, this data suggests that the virulence potential of S. aureus in spaceflight could be amplified by factors in addition to the Agr regulon. Additionally, S. aureus appears to undergo an altered metabolism during spaceflight. For example, urease subunit gene expression and/or protein abundance was significantly upregulated in spaceflight. This enzyme hydrolyzes urea to form ammonia and carbon dioxide, and is a vital contributor to acid stress survival in S. aureus60. Increased urease expression and activity, in conjunction with increased acid production, has also been demonstrated in S. aureus biofilms61. Altered levels of metabolites, genes and/or proteins related to arginine metabolism were also observed in spaceflight samples relative to ground controls. Collectively, these changes could reflect an overall increase in urea cycle activity in response to acid stress and/or as an alternative pathway for ATP production, as the arginine deiminase pathway produces both ammonia and ATP (via substrate-level phosphorylation)62,63. Spaceflight S. aureus samples also exhibited several features congruent with a transition to catabolism of non-preferred carbon sources, including decreased abundance of extracellular glucose, increased abundance of gene transcripts and/or proteins encoding various sugar transporters, and increased protein abundance and/or gene expression of TCA cycle enzymes. Derepression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in S. aureus has been associated with decreased availability of carbon sources which generally occurs during post-exponential growth64,65. Additionally, altered levels of metabolites, genes and/or proteins related to cysteine/serine metabolism (increased O-acetylserine, homoserine, cysteine, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and serine dehydratase), and methionine metabolism (decreased methionine, increased methionine sulfoxide, increased methionine ABC transporter) were observed in spaceflight samples relative to ground controls (Supplemental Tables 1–3, 5, 6). These changes, in combination with increased expression of several metal transport genes (Supplemental Table 1), suggest that S. aureus could have altered sulfur and/or metal requirements to support its metabolism under flight conditions. The global regulator CodY was also identified in the cellular proteomics analysis, with a –1.52-fold change in spaceflight samples. CodY notably responds to changes in nutrient levels and alters the expression of a wide range of metabolic genes, virulence factors, and other regulators56,66–68. Some targets known to be repressed by this regulator include capsule synthesis, Agr, and staphylococcal nuclease, which all exhibit increased abundance in spaceflight samples (Supplemental Tables 1–3). Therefore, depleted nutrients in the spaceflight environment could contribute to these observed alterations in S. aureus virulence factor production and metabolism, partly through decreased CodY activity. In summary, data from the BRIC-23 experiment indicate that S. aureus spaceflight cultures exhibit changes in physiology and virulence factor production (summarized in Fig. 5) which could affect its ability to cause human disease during long-duration spaceflight missions. Specifically, S. aureus spaceflight samples may have altered metabolism (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, and transport of non-preferred carbon sources, and decreased glycolysis/fermentation and translation machinery) relative to ground-control cultures. Furthermore, both Agr-dependent and Agr-independent virulence factor expression were upregulated in spaceflight, with the agr RNAII and RNAIII transcripts themselves being the most highly upregulated. However, it is important to interpret these results in the context of the experimental confines of the BRIC-23 experiment. Fig. 5. Summary of S. aureus alterations in physiology and virulence factor production in the spaceflight environment. Open in a new tab Diagram is based on analyzed RNA-Seq, proteomics, secretomics, and metabolomics data presented in this study.Methods Overview of BRIC-23 experimental design A general overview of the BRIC-23 flight (FLT) experiment is outlined in Fig. 1, and complete details have been previously described20,21. In brief, two BRIC-PDFUs (each containing five 60 mm Petri dishes with 107 CFU of S. aureus UAMS-123 cells dried on the bottom of each plate) were launched to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-9 on 07/18/2016. Growth was actuated in each petri dish by addition of 8.5 ml tryptone soytone yeast extract medium containing 10% glycerol (TSYG) on 07/22/2016, followed by growth at ~22 °C for 48 h. BRIC-PDFUs were then placed in −80 °C stowage until return from the ISS on 08/30/2016. Samples remained frozen during return and were stored at −80 °C until deintegration. Ground control (GC) experiments were performed asynchronously with the same hardware, configuration, timing, and growth temperature as in the BRIC-23 FL experiment. Deintegrated samples from both FLT and GC were stored at −80 °C until processed for RNA-Seq, proteomics, and metabolomics as described in21. RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics raw data files and associated metadata are available through NASA Open Science for Life in Space (OSDR) entry OSD-145: BRIC-23 GeneLab Process Verification Test: Staphylococcus aureus transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data (10.26030/ga0p-2817) (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-145).BRIC-23 secretomics and data analysis Filter-sterilized and concentrated (5 kDa MW cutoff) BRIC-23 supernatants were provided by NASA’s Life Science Data Archive (LSDA) (n = 5 each of BRIC-23 FLT and GC samples). Proteins from a 480–610 µl volume of each sample were precipitated by adding 120–150 µL of 100% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid to each sample, followed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, then the supernatant was discarded. Protein pellets were washed with 200 µL of cold acetone, then samples were centrifuged again as above, and the acetone wash was repeated for a total of two washes. Protein pellets were dried by leaving tubes open in a Class 2AII biosafety cabinet for 5 min to allow acetone to evaporate. Next, pellets were resuspended in 200 µL urea buffer (6 M urea, 0.4 M Tris, pH 7.8) and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were measured via Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit, Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (10.59 µg per sample) were used, and three replicates per sample type were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The entire lane per sample was excised with a scalpel and diced into 1 mm2 cubes. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed as previously described69,70. Protein identification and quantification were performed using a label-free quantitative shotgun mass proteomics approach using an HPLC-Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (UF-ICBR proteomics core). Briefly, the peptide samples were analyzed using a 250-mm Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The Thermo EASY nano-LC system was used for liquid chromatography, employing a 20-mm C16 pre-column (Thermo Scientific) to remove impurities. A reversed-phase C18 analytical column with a 100 Å pore (Thermo Scientific, Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 LC Column) was used for sample separation. The following solvents were used for chromatography: solvent A (0.1% formic acid), solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with a 2–40% solvent B acetonitrile gradient for 105 min, followed by a 14-minute wash with 98% solvent B, and equilibration with 2% solvent A. The LC system was directly interfaced with the Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. The Orbitrap detector acquired MS data at 120 K resolution with a scan range of 350–2000 m/z. For MS/MS analysis, ions were isolated by a quadrupole, prioritizing the most intense ions, and ions for all available parallelizable times were injected. Precursor ions were then excluded for 36 s. Fragmentation was performed using collision-induced dissociation (CID) at a collision energy of 35% and an activation time of 10 ms. Proteins were identified and quantified from the generated raw data using Proteome Discoverer, as previously described69,71–78. These data were also analyzed by Scaffold software version 4.11.0 (Proteome Software, Inc., USA) to identify secreted proteins with statistically significant alterations in expression. Briefly, tandem mass spectra were extracted, charge state deconvoluted, and deisotoped using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) samples were analyzed by using the SEQUEST algorithm (Thermo Fisher) using available databases containing S. aureus proteins (Genbank #BX571856.1) and contaminants. Scaffold software version 4.11.0 (Proteome Software, Inc., USA) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications, where the required delta Cn scores were >0.2 and XCorr scores were >1.2, 1.9, 2.3, and 2.6 for singly, doubly, triply, and quadruply charged peptides, respectively. Protein identifications were accepted if they were established at >95.0% probability and contained >2 identified peptides, with a peptide FDR of 0.2%. The protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm. Weighted spectral counts were used for protein quantification, and data were normalized before the fold changes were calculated between the flight and control samples. The P < 0.05 (Student t-test, calculated in GraphPad Prism) and a minimum 1.5-fold change between treatment and control proteins indicated proteins with significant changes in abundance. Secretomics raw data files and associated metadata are available through NASA OSDR entry OSD-500: BRIC-23: Secretomics (10.26030/rztr-e997) (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-500).BRIC-23 cellular proteomics analysis Cellular proteins were identified and quantified from the generated raw data from the BRIC-23 experiment (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-145) using Proteome Discoverer. Briefly, tandem mass spectra were extracted, charge state deconvoluted, and deisotoped using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) samples were analyzed by using the SEQUEST algorithm (Thermo Fisher) using available databases containing S. aureus proteins (Genbank #BX571856.1). All analyzed fractions were merged before the analysis. SEQUEST search parameters were as follows: two maximum trypsin mis-cleavages, precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da; static modifications were TMT six-plex/+229.163 Da (N-terminus, Lys) and carbamidomethyl modification/+57.021 Da (Cys); dynamic modification was oxidation modification/+15.995 Da (Met). Maximum dynamic modifications per peptide were four. High XCorr Confidence Thresholds were 1.2, 1.9, 2.3, and 2.6 for z = 1, 2, 3, and >4, respectively. The maximum allowable delta Cn value was 0.05. Moreover, a decoy databank search was performed to establish FDR at a minimum of 0.05 for protein identifications, where the validation was done using the q-value method. All the medium and high-confidence peptides were used to identify and quantify proteins. The reporter ions (i.e., m/z 126, 127 N, 127 C, 128 N, 131) were identified where the most confident centroid was used and 10 ppm for reporter ion mass tolerance. The reporter ion values were normalized to control samples (128 N). Proteins belonging to multiple protein groups were grouped into a single accession number, and final ratios were reported. Fold changes were calculated between flight and ground samples, where the P-value was calculated using the Student’s t-test (P < 0.05), indicating proteins with significant changes in abundance (minimum 1.5-fold change).BRIC-23 RNA-Seq analysis FastQ data files from n = 9 FLT and n = 9 GC samples were downloaded from OSDR (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-145) and imported into CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen) for analysis. Ribosomal RNA reads were filtered out, and the remaining reads were mapped to the S. aureus MRSA252 genome (Genbank #BX571856.1). The UAMS-1 genome (strain used in the BRIC-23 flight experiment) is not closed. Therefore, the updated Genbank genome file for MRSA252, which contains annotations for sRNAs79 and critical virulence genes such as phenol soluble modulins (psma1-4), was used instead. A previously published analysis pipeline was followed79,80 using the “RNA-Seq analysis” feature of CLC Genomics Workbench version 21, with quantile normalization of data sets81. Standard cutoffs ( ≥ 2-fold change, mean normalized expression value ≥ 10 for both samples) were used to curate differential gene expression (DE) data, performed as described in82. Microsoft Excel was used for RNA-Seq DE data reduction and statistical analysis. Student’s two-tailed t-test was used to determine significance (P < 0.000016 with 5% FDR Bonferroni correction).Metabolomics Analysis MetaboAnalyst 5.083 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/home.xhtml) was used to quantify the cellular and supernatant untargeted metabolomics data from BRIC-23 datasets (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-145). All missing values were replaced by half of the minimum positive value found within the data. However, features with over 50% missing values were removed from the dataset. The data were normalized by sum and subjected to log transformation and auto-scaling, where the values were mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of each variable. A P-value threshold of 0.05 (Student t-test) was used for generating volcano plots and a fold change of 1.5.Bioinformatics Functional categories of genes/proteins identified by RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics as being statistically significant ( > 2-fold change in expression for RNA-Seq, and >1.5-fold change for proteomics and secretomics) were assigned using manual curation based on gene annotation and/or predicted function using the following databases: Aureowiki84, Uniprot85, PATRIC86 and Biocyc87. Hierarchical clustering and heat map generation of statistically significant DE data was performed using 1-Pearson correlation on rows and columns, using Morpheus default settings (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus). Venn diagram of overlapping and unique DE genes/proteins identified by RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics as being statistically significant with > 2-fold change in expression for RNA-Seq and > 1.5-fold change for proteomics and secretomics, was generated using OmicsBox (BioBam, Valencia, Spain)88. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of RNA-Seq, proteomics, and secretomics data was performed using ClustVis89. PCA plots for metabolomics data were generated with Rscript chemometrics.R within the MetaboAnalyst program83. RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and/or secretomics DE data were analyzed using Paint-omics version 325 and STRING version 11.526 to detect enriched KEGG pathways and genes/proteins, respectively. The  MRSA252 genome (Genbank #BX571856.1) was used as a reference in both analyses.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis specific to each -omics analysis is described in each respective section above. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel, Graphpad Prism 9, Scaffold software version 4.11.0, or MetaboAnalyst 5.0, as indicated.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplemental Material (474.5KB, pdf) Reporting Summary (1.5MB, pdf) Acknowledgements This study was funded by NASA grants 80NSSC19K0139 and 80NSSC21K0601 awarded to Kelly C.

    "abstract": "Significance Plant vacuoles are essential organelles and occupy up to 90% of the cell volume. Their roles include regulation of stomata movements, protein storage in seeds, gravity sensing, and ion homeostasis. Vacuole or lysosome fusion in eukaryotes is mediated by two multisubunit complexes, SNARE and homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS), but only the SNARE complex is well characterized in plants. Here, we show that, similar to other eukaryotes, HOPS mediates vacuole fusion in plants by interaction with SNAREs and that the HOPS subunit VPS33 and the SNARE protein SYP22 display the sites for interaction between these complexes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, however, plant HOPS recruitment to liposomes is inhibited by phosphoinositides, which appear to define strict rules for regulating fusion and fragmentation of dynamic vacuoles. Keywords: Arabidopsis, vacuole fusion, HOPS, SNARE, phosphoinositides",

    "methods": "Methods Plant Materials, Growth Conditions, and Transformation. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown as described (2). The ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as WT control. The genomic VPS41-GFP fusion (VPS41p::VPS41-GFP) was described elsewhere (4). Organelle markers mRFP-SYP22 (18), mCherry-RAB5 (mCherry-RabF2a), and mCherry-RAB7 (mCherry-RabG3f) (51) have been previously described. SALK T-DNA insertion lines, including vps41-1 (SALK_076372), vps41-2 (SALK_035406), vps33-3 (SALK_016684C), vps33-4 (SALK_151719), and vps33-5 (SALK_143407), were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR (SI Appendix, Table S4). The zip2 zig-1 mutant was previously characterized (56). The TILLING lines (57) vps33-1 (CS92162) and vps33-2 (CS93595) were obtained from ABRC and backcrossed three times with Col-0 WT. Homozygous vps33-1 and vps33-2 were genotyped by PCR amplification (SI Appendix, Table S4) and restriction digestion with BsmBI (vps33-1) or TspRI (vps33-2). Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown at room temperature for 3–4 wk in Metro-Mix 300 soil with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. Arabidopsis transformation was carried out by floral dip (81) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 and GV3101. Transient plant Agro-infiltration of 3- to 4-wk-old N. benthamiana leaves was carried out as described (82). GFP or RFP fluorescence was observed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) 36–48 h after infiltration. Molecular Cloning. The full-length genomic fusion of VPS33 with GFP driven by either 3- or 1-kb native promoters were generated using the GoldenBraid system (83). Primers for VPS33 genomic sequences (SI Appendix, Table S4) were generated by the GB domesticator software (https://gbcloning.upv.es/tools/domestication/), and each part was amplified by PCR (83, 84). Each transcriptional unit (TU) was assembled by restriction–ligation reaction into pUPD2 and sequenced. The full fusion construct containing the VPS33 promoter and genomic sequence, GFP, and the VPS33 terminator sequence was then assembled into pDGB3_alpha1. This cassette was finally inserted into pDGB3_omega1 together with the kanamycin resistance cassette from pGB0184 to generate pVPS33::gVPS33-GFP (VPS33-GFP). All experiments were carried out with the 3-kb promoter, except for Fig. 1 P–R, where the 1-kb promoter was used. UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter-driven and BiFC constructs were generated by Gateway cloning. Coding sequences of VPS41 (At1g08190), VPS33 (At3G54860), VTI11 (At5G39510), SYP22 (AT5G146860), and AtTIP2;1 (AT3G16240) were obtained by RT-PCR. Briefly, total mRNA was extracted from Col-0 WT seedlings using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer’s instruction. cDNAs were synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) and amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (SI Appendix, Table S4) compatible for Gateway cloning. Entry clones were generated in pENTR4 or pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) (SI Appendix, Table S3). Expression clones (SI Appendix, Table S2) were generated by recombination between the entry clones and multiple destination vectors using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). Vectors driven by the pUBQ10 promoter were generated after substitution of the short UBQ promoter of the vector set described in ref. 85 with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596 bp) from pNIGEL07 (51). pDEST15 and pDEST17 destination vectors (Invitrogen) were used for protein expression in bacteria, and N- and C-terminal nEYFP and cEYFP pSITE vectors (86) were used to generate constructs for BiFC. All expression constructs are described in SI Appendix, Table S2. The amiR-vps constructs were cloned using the GreenGate system (87). Specific amiRNA sequences against VPS41 and VPS11 (AT2G05170) were identified with the Web MicroRNA Designer (WMD3) tool (88) at wmd3.weigelworld.org/cgi-bin/webapp.cgi. The amiR-vps sequences were amplified in four independent PCRs (SI Appendix, Table S5) with the pRS300 plasmid containing the miR319a precursor sequence. To be suited for the GreenGate cloning system, primers “A” and “B” were modified with specific overhangs. The final PCR products (fourth reaction) were first digested with Eco31I and then ligated into the preopened intermediate vectors (SI Appendix, Table S5). The resulting vectors (supermodule A and B for each amiR-vps) were sequenced and combined in consecutive GreenGate reactions as described (87). The DEX induction system is based on the p6xOP/LhG4-GR transcription system (89, 90). Primers and vectors used in these experiments are reported in SI Appendix, Tables S3–S5. Microscopy. Zeiss LSM 710 or Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan confocal microscopes were used for all imaging experiments unless specified. The excitation/emission wavelengths for imaging were 488 nm/492–570 nm for GFP and YFP, 561 nm/588–696 nm for mCherry and mRFP, and 561 nm/566–690 nm for LysoTracker Red. Three-day-old seedlings were analyzed with a 40×/1.2 N.A. water-immersion objective. To image PSVs, seeds were imbibed in water for 1 h, and seed coats were peeled off with a sharp needle. Vacuoles in the mature embryos were imaged by capturing PSV autofluorescence (excitation/emission wavelengths were 405/450–510 nm) from a single Z plane per sample. PSV quantification was carried out using Fiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ, based on ImageJ 1.51d; fiji.sc/) (91). Linear (Pearson) and the nonlinear (Spearman’s) correlation coefficients for colocalization analysis were obtained with the PSC colocalization plug-in (92). The threshold level for the noise was set at 4. Membrane/cytosolic ratios of VPS41-GFP were calculated in Fiji by extracting intensity values of VPS41-GFP only from the vacuole membrane. This was accomplished by generating a membrane signal mask by thresholding of the RFP-SYP22 marker in the red channel to 40 or above. The mask was then applied to the GFP channel to extract the histograms of intensity values for VPS41-GFP at the membrane. A “cytosolic” intensity average was calculated by measuring intensity values from four cytosolic regions of interest per image. Live-cell CLSM of vacuoles from amiRNA lines was done using a Leica TCS SP5II microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a Leica HCX PL APO lambda blue 63×/1.20 N.A. UV water-immersion objective. Images were acquired with a lateral pixel resolution between 50 and 96 nm at a speed of 400 Hz with bidirectional scanning and five times line averaging. To reduce background fluorescence, the pinhole was adjusted between 0.75 and 1.0 airy unit (AU). The excitation/emission wavelengths for imaging were 488 nm/495–550 nm for BCECF and 561 nm/600–680 nm for FM4-64. Image postprocessing operations (Gaussian blur between 0.5 and 0.75; adjustment of brightness and contrast of the whole image) were done with Fiji. Chemical Treatments and Fluorescent Dyes. Three- or 4-d-old seedlings were used in all chemical treatments and fluorescent dye stainings. Wm (W3144; Sigma) was diluted in liquid AGM to a final concentration of 33 μM, and the same volume of DMSO was added to the control (1% final). Seedlings were treated for 3 h in the dark at 22 °C. A minimum of three seedlings was analyzed for each treatment, and the experiment was repeated three times. LysoTracker Red staining was carried out by incubation of seedlings in liquid AGM supplemented with 2 μM LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) for 2 h. For amiRNA induction with DEX, 5 d-old seedlings were incubated for 72 h in liquid AGM supplemented with 30 µM DEX, or DMSO (control). Seedlings were stained with 10 µM BCECF, acetoxymethyl ester, and 1 µM FM 4-64 as described (8). Protein Purification. BL21-AI E. coli cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with T7::GST-VPS41, T7::GST-VPS33, T7::GST, T7::HIS-SYP22, or T7::HIS-VTI11. Recombinant bacteria were cultured in 300 mL of LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and 1% glucose at 37 °C to an OD of 0.4–0.6. Expression of the tagged proteins was induced with 0.2% arabinose. Cultures were incubated at 28 °C for 5 h, except for T7::HIS-SYP22, which was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and HIS-VTI11, which was incubated at 16 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors; Roche; #04693132001) and 12 μg/mL lysozyme (Sigma). The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 11,200 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was then added to either a Gluthatione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) or a Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), accordingly. The recombinant proteins were eluted after an overnight incubation at 4 °C in slow rotation following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Lipid–Protein Binding Assays. Phospholipid-coated PIP strips (Echelon) were blocked with TBST buffer [10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20] containing 3% (wt/vol) BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Strips were then incubated with 3 mL of 0.33 nM purified GST-VPS41, GST-VPS33, or GST in TBST and 3% (wt/vol) BSA at 4 °C overnight. Strips were washed three times and incubated with mouse anti-GST primary antibody [1:1,000 dilution in 3% (wt/vol) BSA; Thermo Fisher]. A secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody [diluted 1:2,000 in 3% (wt/vol) BSA; Thermo Fisher Scientific] was used next, and signal was detected by western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) using a G:BOX Chemi XRQ gel documentation system (Syngene). This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. The liposome binding assay was modified from refs. 93 and 94 using PolyPIPosomes (Echelon Biosciences) containing no phosphoinositides (control; catalog #Y-0000), PI(3)P (catalog #Y-003), or PI(3,5)P2 (catalog #Y-035). Proteins were first clarified by ultracentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Then, 2.5 µg of GST-VPS41, 1.7 µg of GST-VPS33, 500 ng of GST alone, and 600 ng of PI(3)P Grip (p40 PX) (Echelon Biosciences) were diluted in a final volume of 95 µL of 1× binding buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4; 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/mL BSA; 0.2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, and 1× protease inhibitors from Roche; #04693132001). Five microliters of the PolyPIPosome was added, and the final 100-µL volume was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with slow rotation. Liposomes were then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature and washed one time in 1× binding buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 30 µl of Laemmli buffer and resolved together with 30% of the supernatant by SDS/PAGE using a 3–8% Tris-acetate protein gel (Invitrogen). Similar results were obtained in three different experiments. In Vitro Protein–Protein Interaction. Mouse anti-GST (catalog #MA4-004; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or mouse Penta-HIS (Qiagen 34660) antibodies were bound to Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. To avoid coelution of the antibodies, we treated the beads with BS3 (Thermo Scientific) cross-linking agent. Beads and antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, treated with 1 M Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, quenching buffer, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes, the different protein combinations were added. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed three times with PBS buffer containing protease inhibitors, and bound proteins were eluted by 5-min denaturation at 90 °C in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved in 10% acrylamide gels or 3–8% Tris-acetate protein gels (Invitrogen).",
    "results": "Results VPS41 and VPS33 Partially Colocalize with Late Endosomes, but only VPS41 Is Detected at the Tonoplast. VPS41 (AT1G08190) and VPS33 (AT3G54860) share 23.29% and 19.17% sequence identity with yeast Vps41p and Vps33p, respectively. Therefore, VPS33 and VPS41 are likely homologs of these yeast HOPS proteins (31, 50). We first investigated whether VPS41 and VPS33 colocalized in vacuolar or prevacuolar membranes, as expected for HOPS. Transient expression of mRFP-VPS41 and VPS33-GFP under control of UBQ10 promoters in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves indicated that these proteins accumulate in the cytosol and nucleus, and associate with membranes in punctate structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B). RFP-VPS41 and VPS33-GFP colocalized in the majority of the punctate structures and the nucleus, and partially at the cell periphery (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C), which supports their participation in a complex. These experiments, however, do not provide enough resolution to identify the compartments where these proteins accumulate and they may be influenced by overexpression. To better characterize protein localizations, VPS41-GFP (4) and VPS33-GFP were analyzed in stable Arabidopsis transgenic plants using full-length genomic fusions to GFP under native promoters. Both proteins were again detected in the cytosol, but membrane association was more discernible. Similar to its localization in pollen (4), VPS41-GFP was detected at the tonoplast and punctate organelles in roots (Fig. 1A), and this localization was not affected by the location of the fluorescence tag as the localization of YFP-VPS41 was very similar (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). Colocalization with known organelle markers was used to identify the structures labeled with VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP. VPS41-GFP colocalized with the tonoplast marker RFP-SYP22 (18) and confirmed its tonoplast association (Fig. 1 A–C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1E). Furthermore, VPS41-GFP partially colocalized with mCherry-RAB7, a marker for the late stages of PVC maturation (51) (Fig. 1 D–F), consistent with results from pollen (4). Colocalization with the early PVC marker mCherry-RAB5 (51) was detected in only a few organelles (Fig. 1 G–I). These results indicate that VPS41-GFP localizes to the vacuole and late endosomes. Similar experiments with VPS33-GFP indicate that VPS41 and VPS33 have overlapping but not identical localizations. VPS33-GFP rarely colocalized with RFP-SYP22 at the tonoplast, except for a few puncta (Fig. 1 J–L and SI Appendix, Fig. S1F), indicating that this protein is absent from the vacuole. VPS33-GFP is present in the cytosol and in cytosolic punctate structures, where it partially colocalized with mCherry-RAB7 (Fig. 1 M–O) and shows strong colocalization with mCherry-RAB5 (Fig. 1 P–R). Quantification of these colocalization experiments further validates the overlapping but distinct localization of VPS33 and VPS41 (Fig. 1 S and T). Both proteins show significant colocalization with RAB7 endosomes. While VPS33 has the strongest colocalization with RAB5 endosomes, it is weakly colocalized with the tonoplast marker SYP22. In contrast, VPS41 shows significant accumulation at the tonoplast but is not associated with RAB5 endosomes (Fig. 1 S and T). Interestingly, both VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP seem to accumulate in more endosomal compartments when coexpressed with mCherry-RAB5 (compare Fig. 1A with Fig. 1G and Fig. 1J with Fig. 1P). The effect of the mCherry-RAB5 fusion on the recruitment or stability of these proteins at the endosome or the endosomes themselves will require further analysis beyond the scope of this work. Overall, these results suggest that VPS33 and VPS41 are cytosolic proteins that preferentially associate with late endosomal compartments, and this is consistent with a role for HOPS in the tethering of vacuoles or prevacuoles. Interestingly, only VPS41 is detected at the tonoplast, and only VPS33 has significant accumulation in RAB5 endosomes. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Subcellular localization of VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP. Genomic fusion constructs of VPS41 (VPS41-GFP) and VPS33 (VPS33-GFP) driven by native promoters were cotransformed with subcellular markers into Arabidopsis, and root cells were imaged by confocal microscopy. (A–I) Colocalization of VPS41-GFP (A, D, and G) with mRFP-SYP22 (B), mCherry-RAB7 (E), or mCherry-RAB5 (H) in root cells of stably transformed Arabidopsis seedlings. Corresponding merged images are shown (C, F, and I). Arrowheads indicate sites of marker colocalization at the tonoplast, and arrows point to colocalization in endosomes. (Scale bars: 20 µm.) (J–R) Colocalization of VPS33-GFP (J, M, and P) with mRFP-SYP22 (K), mCherry-RAB7 (N), or mCherry-RAB5 (Q). The merged images are shown (L, O, and R). No apparent accumulation of VPS33-GFP was detected at the tonoplast. Partial colocalization was detected in RAB5 and RAB7 endosomes (arrows). (Scale bars: 20 µm.) (S and T) Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients from the colocalization analyses between VPS41-GFP (S) or VPS33-GFP (T) with mRFP-SYP22, mCherry-RAB5, or mChery-RAB7. Thirty-seven to 56 images from nine seedlings combined were used for each analysis. Bars represent SE. VPS41 Tonoplast Association Is Dependent on Phosphoinositides. The distinct localizations of VPS33-GFP and VPS41-GFP prompted us to test whether the two proteins were characterized by different phospholipid binding affinities. This was tested using an in vitro lipid-binding assay with recombinant proteins. GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Purified proteins were incubated on lipid strips, and protein binding was detected with anti-GST. GST alone was used as negative control (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Both GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 show affinity toward all phosphoinositides in this assay, including the two that are most abundant at the late endosomes and vacuole, PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that VPS41 and VPS33 association with membranes may be regulated in part by phosphoinositide binding. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Phosphoinositides regulate the membrane association of VPS41. (A) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to phosphoinositide lipids. GST-VPS41 (Center) and GST-VPS33 (Right) were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Lipid affinity of purified proteins was analyzed using a lipid strip assay. Lipids include the following: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphocholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate. (B) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to liposomes that lack phosphoinositides. Affinity-purified GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 proteins were incubated without liposomes (none) or with PC/PE liposomes bearing no phosphoinositides (control), PtdIns(3)P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2, and protein binding was detected by cosedimentation and immunoblot with α-GST. Incubation with PI(3)P-GRIP was used as positive control, and GST alone was used as negative control. (C–H) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, but not from endosomes. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (C and F) and mCherry-RAB7 (D and G) were treated with DMSO (C–E) or 33 µM Wm (F–H) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. Merged images are shown (E and H). Tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP is indicated with arrowheads. Wm induced the enlargement of RAB7-labeled endosomes (arrows) that retained VPS41-GFP signal. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (I–N) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (I and L) and mRFP-SYP22 (J and M) were treated with DMSO (I–K) or 33 µM Wm (L–N) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. VPS41-GFP signal is depicted using a rainbow LUT (I and L), where high intensity values are represented in red and low intensity values are shown in blue. Red pixels were associated with the tonoplast in the DMSO control only. Merged images are shown using green color for the GFP signal (K and N). (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (O) Quantification of the tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP from I–N. The ratio between the membrane and cytosolic fluorescence intensity of VPS41-GFP was calculated using ImageJ from DMSO or Wm-treated seedlings (N = 27 images from seven to eight seedlings per treatment; *significant in a t test at P < 0.05).To characterize lipid binding in a physiological context, we used a liposome-binding assay that better resembles lipid binding in a bilayer. Phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) liposomes bearing either no phosphoinositide, PtdIns(3)P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2 were incubated in the presence of recombinant proteins, and binding was assayed by cosedimentation. As shown in Fig. 2B, both GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bound to the control liposomes, indicating that these proteins have strong affinity for neutral lipids. Surprisingly, addition of PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2 abolished this binding, which suggests that VPS33 and VPS41 membrane binding is tightly controlled. The PI(3)P-GRIP protein which contains a PtdIns(3)P-binding domain was used as a positive control, and GST was used as a negative control. These results underscore VPS41 and VPS33 sensitivities to phosphoinositides and to the different presentation of these lipids between the flat surface of the lipid strip and the curved membrane of the liposomes. PtdIns(3)P is a negative regulator for homotypic vacuole fusion in plants (2) and recruits HOPS to the vortex ring in yeast (52). Hence, PtdIns(3)P and other phosphoinositides are good candidates to regulate HOPS subunit association with the vacuole and PVC. We therefore asked whether the localizations of GFP-VPS41 was affected by phosphoinositide availability using Wm treatment, which results in PtdIns(3)P depletion from cellular membranes (53). GFP-VPS41 was found at the tonoplast and some mCherry-RAB7-labeled endosomes, in the DMSO control as expected (Fig. 2 C–E). Wm treatment resulted in PVC swelling with the characteristic doughnut-like structures that were decorated with both VPS41-GFP and mCherry-RAB7 (Fig. 2 F–H), which suggests that Wm treatment did not alter the VPS41 association with late endosome membranes. Remarkably, VPS41-GFP was no longer detected at the tonoplast after Wm treatment (Fig. 2 F–H). To quantify the loss of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, we used the RFP-SYP22 marker as a proxy for vacuole membrane localization. As shown in Fig. 2 I–K, the sites of highest VPS41-GFP fluorescence intensity in the control colocalize with RFP-SYP22 at the tonoplast. This tonoplast bright signal is lost after the Wm treatment (Fig. 2 L–N). Quantification of these results further indicates that Wm treatment results in a 35% decrease in the membrane/cytosolic ratio of VPS41-GFP (Fig. 2O). These results indicate that tonoplast association of VPS41 is mediated by phosphoinositide binding, but its association with late endosome membranes is independent of phosphoinositides. Major changes in VPS33-GFP localization were not detected after Wm treatment as a few RAB7 endosomes were still labeled with VPS33-GFP (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 B–G). HOPS Is Essential for Male Fertility and Important for Plant Development. To define the role of VPS41 and VPS33 in vacuole fusion and dynamics, we identified loss-of-function alleles for VPS41 and VPS33 from the SALK T-DNA collection (54). T-DNA insertions were confirmed for vps41-1 (SALK_076372) and vps41-3 (SALK_036406), which carry the T-DNA insertions in the 13th exon and the promoter region of VPS41, respectively. Three T-DNA insertion alleles were confirmed for VPS33, vps33-3 (SALK_016684C), vps33-4 (SALK_151719), and vps33-5 (SALK_143407). These mutants carry the insertions in the 13th intron, the promoter, and the seventh exon of VPS33 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). RT-PCR from homozygous lines showed no altered VPS41 transcript accumulation for vps41-3, and this line was not used further. No homozygous plants were recovered from over 50 progeny of vps41-1/+, vps33-3/+, vps33-4/+, or vps33-5/+, and none had evidence for embryo abortion in siliques from heterozygous plants, which suggested the possibility of gametophyte lethality or sterility. To determine which gametophyte was unfertile, reciprocal crosses were performed between vps41-1/+ or vps33-3/+ and Col-0 WT plants to determine the male and female transmission efficiency (TE) (55) (SI Appendix, Table S1). The results show that transmission through the female gametes is not compromised in either mutant. However, male vps41-1 TE is abolished, indicating that VPS41 is essential for pollen fertility. The vps33-3 pollen, instead, is not completely sterile, but the male TE is strongly reduced to 16.1%. The pollen defects of vps33 and vps41 loss-of-function alleles are consistent with previous reports (4, 32) and, together with the phenotype of vps18 and vps39 mutants recently reported (3), support an important role of the HOPS complex in male gametophyte development. Similar to VPS41-GFP (4), the full-length genomic fusion construct for VPS33-GFP complements the pollen fertility defects of loss-of-function mutants as homozygous vps33-3 can be recovered (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B–D). HOPS Is Important for Vacuole Biogenesis and Fusion. We identified viable weaker alleles to characterize VPS41 and VPS33 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). One EMS allele for VPS41, zip2/vps41 (56), and two viable TILLING (57) alleles of VPS33, vps33-1 and vps33-2, are available. The zip2/vps41 allele was identified from a screen of suppressors of zig-1/vti11 in gravitropism (56). The mutation results in a G721R substitution within an annotated clathrin heavy chain repeat (CHCR) of the VPS41 protein that is predicted to mediate protein–protein interactions (58). The mutations in vps33-1 and vps33-2 result in S95F and V136M substitutions in the VPS33 protein, respectively. Both are predicted to occur in domain 1 of the VPS33 protein, which, together with domain 3, has been shown in fungi and yeast to form a cleft that is thought to accommodate SNARE bundles (28). None of the single mutants shows developmental phenotypes in rosettes or inflorescences under normal growth conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S3E). No vacuole phenotypes were observed in zip2/vps41, vps33-1, or vps33-2 when seedling roots were analyzed using LysoTracker Red staining (SI Appendix, Fig. S3F). However, we observed an increased number of PSVs in mature zip2/vps41, vps33-1, and vps33-2 embryos compared with the WT (Fig. 3 A–D). The number of vacuoles per cell was counted in each genotype to quantify this defect (Fig. 3E). Only cells with a cross-section area between 11 and 15.9 µm2 were included in the analysis. Fifty-three percent of the cells from the WT control have five to six vacuoles per cell, and a smaller fraction (26%) have seven to eight vacuoles. In contrast, only 16.8% of the cells from the zip2/vps41 embryos have five to six vacuoles while the rest (88%) have seven or more. Similar results were detected for vps33-1 where 17% of the cells contain six or fewer vacuoles, while the rest (83%) had seven or more. Finally, almost all of the vps33-2 mutant embryos showed seven to eight vacuoles per cell. These results support the hypothesis that VPS41 and VPS33 are involved in vacuole homotypic fusion and are important for PSV maturation. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab HOPS is required for protein storage and lytic vacuole morphology. (A–D) Morphology of protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) in mature embryos from the WT control (Col-0) (A), zip2/vps41 (B), vps33-1 (C), and vps33-2 (D). Autofluorescence of the PSVs was acquired by CLSM. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (E) Vacuole number distribution in mature embryos. Embryos from WT control (Col-0), vps33-1, vps33-2, and zip2/vps41 were imaged as in A–D, and the number of vacuoles per cell was counted. Only cells with a cross-section area between 11 and 15.9 µm2 were included in the analysis. Bars represent the percentage of cells with less than 4 (blue), 5–6 (orange), 7–8 (gray), 9–10 (red), and 11 or more (green) vacuoles per cell in each genotype. Col-0, n = 165 cells; zip2, n = 146 cells; vps33-1, n = 154 cells; vps33-2, n = 118 cells. (F–N) Vacuole morphology of amiRNA lines after DEX induction. Seedlings from Col-0 WT (control, F–H), amiR-vps41 (I–K), and amiR-vps11 (L–N) were incubated for 72 h with DEX and stained with BCECF and FM4-64. Roots were imaged at the meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ). (Scale bar: 20 µm.)A dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible amiRNA system was used to determine the function of HOPS in developing seedlings. The HOPS-CORE subunit VPS11 and the HOPS-specific subunit VPS41 were targeted by the inducible amiRNA system. WT, amiR-vps41, and amiR-vps11 seedlings were treated with DMSO (control) or DEX for 72 h, and vacuole morphology was observed by 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) staining. Normal vacuole morphology was observed in both amiR-vps11 and amiR-vps41 in the absence of DEX compared with the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S3G) and in the WT after DEX treatment (Fig. 3 F–H). In contrast, dramatic changes in vacuole morphology were observed after DEX induction of the two lines. Both amiR-vps41 (Fig. 3 I–K) and amiR-vps11 (Fig. 3 L–N) seedlings showed highly fragmented vacuoles in meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ) of the root after DEX induction. We note that the phenotype was observed only in cells that were not elongated at the time of induction. This phenotype together with the PSV phenotype of allelic mutants demonstrates a critical role of HOPS for vacuole fusion and biogenesis. VPS41 and VPS33 Interact in Vivo with Each Other and with SYP22 in Specific Foci. If HOPS is involved in membrane fusion at the vacuole, it is likely to interact with the vacuolar SNARE complex (17, 18), including SYP22 and VTI11. To determine whether VPS41 and VPS33 interact with each other and with the vacuolar SNAREs, split YFP fusion proteins were constructed for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments in Nicotiana leaf epidermis (59, 60). Only N-terminal n/cYFP fusions of the SNARE proteins were used because the C termini of vacuolar SNAREs reside in the vacuole lumen. For VPS33 and VPS41, both N- and C-terminal constructs were generated, but none of the C-terminal n/cYFP fusions restored YFP signal in any combination. Coexpression of cYFP-VPS41 with nYFP-VPS33 resulted in a punctate pattern at the vacuole periphery (Fig. 4A), indicating that VPS41 and VPS33 are likely to participate in the HOPS complex. Coexpression of the same cYFP-VPS41 construct with the SNARE fusion nYFP-SYP22 resulted in a punctate pattern as well, indicating that these two proteins interact in vivo (Fig. 4B). In contrast, no YFP fluorescence was detected when cYFP-VPS41 was coexpressed with nYFP-VTI11 (Fig. 4C). Note that broad fluorescent structures (asterisks) in Fig. 4 B and C are likely background signal because they were observed in negative controls (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B). Next, we tested interactions with VPS33. Again, coexpression of cYFP-VPS33 with nYFP-VPS41 resulted in a punctate pattern indicative of protein–protein interaction (Fig. 4D). When cYFP-VPS33 was coexpressed with nYFP-SYP22, a strong YFP signal was detected in punctate foci (Fig. 4E), supporting the hypothesis that HOPS and SNAREs interact to mediate membrane fusion. Similar to the VPS41 interactions, no YFP fluorescence was detected when cYFP-VPS33 and nYFP-VTI11 were coexpressed, suggesting the absence of close interactions between these two proteins in vivo (Fig. 4F). To further validate these results, the c/nYFP-VPS33 was coexpressed with a n/cYFP- fusion to the aquaporin TIP2;1 as a negative control. No YFP signal was detected in either combination (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 D and E), which confirms the lack of interaction for the negative controls. The two vacuolar SNAREs VTI11 and SYP22 were used as positive controls as they have been shown to interact (21) and localize at the PVC (18, 61). Indeed, coexpression of cYFP-VTI11 with nYFP-SYP22 as well as cYFP-SYP22 with nYFP-VTI11 resulted in similar punctate structures at the periphery of the vacuole (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 C and F). Overall, these data show that VPS33 and VPS41 can assemble in subcellular foci and that both proteins can interact in vivo with SYP22, but not with VTI11. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis for HOPS–SNARE interactions mediating membrane fusion at the vacuole. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab VPS41 and VPS33 interact and can bind the SNARE protein SYP22. (A–F) VPS41 and VPS33 interact in vivo and bind the SNARE protein SYP22. BiFC analysis of protein interactions in infiltrated N. benthamiana leaf cells by confocal microscopy. The N-terminal half (nY) or the C-terminal half (cY) of YFP were fused with VPS41, VPS33, SYP22, or VTI11. (A–C) cYFP-VPS41 interacts with nYFP-VPS33 (A), nYFP-SYP22 (B), but not with nYFP-VTI11 (C). (D–F) cYFP-VPS33 interacts with nYFP-VPS41 (D), nYFP-SYP22 (E), but not with nYFP-VTI11 (F). Asterisks indicate background signal that was observed in the negative control. (G) VPS33 binds the SYP22 SNARE in vitro. Recombinant GST-VPS41, GST-VPS33, HIS-SYP22, and HIS-VTI11 protein fusions were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The purified proteins were mixed as indicated, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with an α-HIS antibody. Proteins from 5% of the input, immunoprecipitate (IP), or 5% of the flowthrough were separated by SDS/PAGE, and GST-VPS41 or GST-VPS33 were detected by Western blot with an α-GST antibody. Arrows indicate the expected sizes of GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33. The positions of 150-kDa (Top) and 100-kDa (Bottom) molecular markers are indicated with arrowheads. (H–K) Genetic interaction between hypomorphic HOPS mutant alleles and zig-1. Seedlings were stained for 2 h in LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) and acquired in LSCM. Abnormal vacuole morphology in the maturation zone was observed in zig-1 (H), vps33-1 zig-1 (J), and vps33-2 zig-1 mutants (K). The vacuole phenotype was complemented in the root differentiation zone (DZ) of the double-mutant zig-1 zip2 (I). (L–N) Loss of the VTI11 SNARE induces abnormal VPS41-GFP localization. VPS41-GFP was imaged in the Col-0 WT (L) or the zig-1 mutant background (M and N). The protein was found in bright aggregates at the junction of zig-1 vacuoles or in clusters in the cytosol as shown with the Airyscan mode of the confocal (N). (O–Q). Loss of the VTI11 SNARE induces abnormal VPS33-GFP localization. VPS33-GFP was imaged in the Col-0 WT (O) or zig-1 (P and Q). Details of the aggregates at the junction between unfused vacuoles can be observed in the Airyscan mode (Q). (Scale bars: 10 µm.) VSP33 Interacts Directly with the Qa SNARE SYP22. VPS33 mediates SNARE complex assembly in yeast (29), and we could detect interactions between VPS33, VPS41, and SYP22 by BiFC. Therefore, we tested whether either of the two HOPS subunits could support a direct interaction with SYP22 by in vitro coimmunopreciptation. Proteins were expressed as tagged fusions to either GST (VPS33 and VPS41) or HIS (SYP22 and VTI11), and immunoprecipitation was carried out using an α-HIS antibody. GST-VPS41 was not detected in the α-HIS immunoprecipitate when incubated with either HIS-SYP22 or HIS-VTI11 (Fig. 4G), indicating a lack of direct interaction. In contrast, a direct interaction between GST-VPS33 and HIS-SYP22 was detected using this assay, as GST-VPS33 was detected in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4G). This interaction was confirmed in a complementary experiment where α-GST pulled down both HIS-SYP22 and GST-VPS33 in the coimmunoprecipitate (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Whether or not there were direct interactions with HIS-VTI11 was less definitive. Incubation of GST-VPS33 and HIS-VTI11 with α-HIS produced detectable signals of GST-VPS33 on immunoblots (Fig. 4G), but no signal was detected for HIS-VTI11 when α-GST was used (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Overall, these data provide strong evidence that HOPS–SNARE interactions in plants are mediated by direct interaction of VPS33 and SYP22, most likely due to conserved mechanisms. The HOPS Subunit VPS41 Genetically Interacts with the VTI11 SNARE. The evidence for protein–protein interactions between HOPS subunits and the vacuolar SNARE SYP22 prompted us to test for genetic interactions between the two complexes. zip2, a mutant allele of VPS41 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A), was identified as a suppressor of the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1, a loss-of-function allele of VTI11 (56). To determine whether zip2 suppresses the vacuole phenotype of zig-1, vacuoles from the zig-1 zip2 double mutants were visualized with LysoTracker Red (Fig. 4 H–K). The zig-1 mutant displayed the previously described vacuole phenotype in both the root tip and root maturation zone (2) (Fig. 4H and SI Appendix, Fig. S4H). The zig-1 zip2 still exhibited multiple vacuoles near the root tip (SI Appendix, Fig. S4I), but this phenotype was not observed in the root maturation zone (Fig. 4I). These results indicate that zip2 partially suppresses the zig-1 phenotype at the subcellular level and confirm a genetic interaction between ZIP2/VPS41 and VTI11. Furthermore, this result suggests that the zip2 mutation results in changes in the VPS41 protein structure that may alter the interactions between HOPS and SNAREs. A similar approach was used to test for genetic interactions between VPS33 and VTI11, but unlike zig-1 zip2 doubles, vps33-1 zig-1 and vps33-2 zig-1 double mutants showed the abnormal zig-1 vacuole phenotype in all root cells (Fig. 4 J and K and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 J and K) and the zig-zagged phenotype of the inflorescence. These results indicate that the vps33-1 and vps33-2 mutations failed to complement the vacuole phenotype, perhaps due to their hypomorphic nature, which may have innocuous effects on the VPS33 protein. The proposed interaction between HOPS and SNAREs led us to predict that loss of the VTI11 SNARE from the vacuole could alter the localization of VPS41 or VPS33. We tested this possibility in zig-1 mutants. VPS41-GFP localization in the WT background showed the cytosolic, punctate, and tonoplast localization previously described (Fig. 4L). In contrast, VPS41-GFP was not detected at the tonoplast and only accumulated in bright aggregated patterns in the zig-1 background (Fig. 4M). When visualized using the Airyscan mode of the microscope, these bright patterns were associated with adjacent vacuoles or clusters of small organelles in the cytosol (Fig. 4N). A similar result was obtained with VPS33-GFP. In contrast to the dispersed puncta of VPS33-GFP in the WT (Fig. 4O), zig-1 mutants showed clustered structures labeled with VPS33-GFP (Fig. 4 P and Q). At least some of these clusters represent small vacuoles as similar clusters were detected in zig-1 mutants labeled with RFP-SYP22 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 L–N). These results indicate that a functional SNARE complex is required for the normal localization of VPS41 and VPS33.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The plant HOPS tethering complex is evolutionarily conserved with other eukaryotes (3, 31, 35), is involved in vacuole traffic via a RAB7-mediated pathway, and is critical for homotypic vacuole fusion (3). HOPS shares four subunits with CORVET, a similar conserved complex that mediates tethering of RAB5 endosomes and vacuoles in a plant-specific manner (3). Our results show that stable VPS33–VPS41 interactions predominantly occur in punctate organelles likely to correspond to endosomes as expected for a tether between endosomes and vacuoles. The possibility remains, however, that the functional HOPS complex also assembles transiently at sites of vacuole homotypic fusions, which are not abundant in the cells used in these experiments. HOPS is essential for vacuole membrane fusion in plants. VPS33 and VPS41 are essential in pollen fertility, and in fact, loss of VPS41 function interfered with pollen penetration into the stigma (4). This and previous results (3, 4, 33, 34) indicate that HOPS is essential for plant viability. The increased number of PSVs of hypomorphic mutants zip2, vps33-1, and vps33-2 is indicative of HOPS function in PSV fusion or trafficking, as it has been observed in other vacuolar trafficking mutants (2, 18, 43, 62, 63). Moreover, the inducible amiRNA silencing of VPS41 and VPS11 underscores HOPS function in lytic vacuole fusion. Phosphoinositides and Membrane Curvature Delimit VPS41 and VPS33 Recruitment. VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP localize to late endosomes, which is consistent with a role in membrane fusion at the PVC and vacuole as part of HOPS (31) and with previous results in pollen tubes (4). The exclusive presence of VPS41 at the vacuole, however, was unexpected. One interpretation is that VPS33 recruitment to the vacuole is transient and limited to sites of membrane fusion, while VPS41 binding to the tonoplast is stable and results from specific lipid-binding affinities. Even though both proteins showed affinity for most phosphoinositides in a lipid strip assay, these results do not rule out the possibility of different affinities to specific phosphoinositides or that their recruitment to specific membranes is enhanced by interaction with other proteins. Two other HOPS subunits, VPS18 and VPS39, the latter being HOPS specific, are also absent from the vacuole (3). Given the competing needs of the core subunits VPS33, VPS18, VPS11, and VPS16 for either HOPS or CORVET assembly, the stable recruitment of VPS41 to the tonoplast could serve as a reservoir for this subunit in a way that does not compete for complex assembly. Phosphoinositides recruit HOPS to the vertex ring between two juxtaposed vacuoles undergoing fusion in yeast (27, 52). We hypothesized that these lipids could fulfill a similar role in plants, and this was first supported by VPS41 and VPS33 binding to immobilized phosphoinositides on a membrane. Surprisingly, both VPS33 and VPS41 also bound to membrane liposomes but only in the absence of PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2. This result implicates membrane curvature as an additional factor in the recruitment of HOPS to cellular membranes in plants and highlights the sensitivity of these proteins to both membrane topology and phosphoinositide lipid content. The plant vacuole membrane is a flat surface compared with the late endosomes, and membrane curvature could indeed represent a proxy for organelle identity in plant vacuole traffic. We propose that VPS41 binding to the vacuole membrane entails its recruitment by PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2, since PtdIns(3)P has been detected at the tonoplast, and both are important for vacuolar traffic (64, 65). In contrast, VPS41 binding to curved membranes such as those of late endosomes is independent of and inhibited by phosphoinositides. This model is further supported by the loss of VPS41-GFP from the vacuole membrane but not from late endosomes in Wm-treated cells. The inhibitory effect of phosphoinositides on VPS33 and VPS41 binding to liposomes suggests that plants have evolved different mechanisms of regulating vacuole fusion compared with yeast. In contrast to plants, the complete yeast HOPS complex and VPS41 alone bind to liposomes containing vacuolar phosphoinositides, but they do not bind strongly to bare liposomes (27, 66, 67). Therefore, while phosphoinositides promote recruitment of HOPS to curved membranes in yeast, they have the opposite effect in plants. Current models for vacuole fusion propose that the site of HOPS function, the vertex of two juxtaposed vacuoles, represents a highly curved membrane (68, 69). Moreover, small liposomes may be used as a proxy for HOPS interactions with the membrane at the vertex ring (68). The liposomes used here are not small enough to represent membrane curvature at sites of vacuole fusion, but if phosphoinositides also abolish HOPS binding at these sites, it would be consistent with yet another phenomenon observed only in plants. Our group has shown that Wm induces vacuole fusion in plants, both in developing roots and in guard cells, and we proposed that phosphoinositides function as negative regulators of vacuole fusion (2). This effect of Wm, however, is not observed in yeast vacuoles (48) or animal lysosomes (49), and therefore, plants seemed to have coerced the regulatory role of phosphoinositides into inhibitors rather than promoters of vacuole fusion. This difference may be due to evolutionary changes in the mechanisms by which VPS41 binds to membranes. VPS41 binding to highly curved membranes in yeast is mediated by an amphipathic lipid packing sensor (ALPS) motif, which also contains two important regulatory phosphorylation sites (67). The ALPS motif is not conserved in plants including Arabidopsis (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), which further supports the existence of plant-specific mechanisms for recruitment of HOPS to highly curved membranes. PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 are important phosphoinositides for vacuole traffic and dynamics (64). PtdIns(3,5)P2 is produced by phosphorylation of the PtdIns(3)P precursor by the PI5 kinases FAB1A and FAB1B (70), and FAB1A has been localized to late endosomes (71). A new sensor of PtdIns(3,5)P2 indicates that this lipid accumulates in late endosomes (72), but it is not clear how much can persist after late endosome fusion with the vacuole. The possibility that PtdIns(3,5)P2 accumulates in the tonoplast is supported by the localization of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatases SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN 2–5 (SAC2–5) exclusively to the vacuole membrane (73). Interestingly, Wm treatment resulted in significant dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, which could result from rapid depletion of PtdIns(3,5)P2 specifically in the tonoplast if both synthesis is stalled due to the unavailability of its precursor and active dephosphorylation by SAC phosphatases (73). PtdIns(3,5)P2 has recently emerged as an important regulator of plant growth, development, and stress responses. PtdIns(3,5)P2 is critical for polar growth (74) and is induced under osmotic stress in plants (75) and yeast (76). Loss of FAB1A and FAB1B results in pollen lethality due to the formation of aberrantly large vacuoles during pollen development (77), which implicates PtdIns(3,5)P2 in vacuole biogenesis. Moreover, PtdIns(3,5)P2 was found to be important for vacuole acidification and fragmentation during stomata closing (78), and loss of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatases SAC2–5, which is expected to increase its accumulation in membranes, induces vacuole fragmentation in Arabidopsis roots (73). It is tempting to speculate that these roles of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in promoting vacuole fragmentation in guard cells during stomata closure result from its inhibitory effect on VPS33 and VPS41 recruitment to sites of apposing vacuole membranes, which would be otherwise available for fusion. Our results suggest that vacuolar phosphoinositides are likely to play an important role in vacuole fusion–fragmentation dynamics by controlling the recruitment of HOPS to apposing vacuole membranes. Further research is necessary to test this hypothesis. HOPS–SNARE Interactions Are Mediated by the SYP22 Qa SNARE. The HOPS complex is expected to interact with SNARE proteins to regulate membrane fusion at the vacuole. That zip2/vps41 partially suppressed the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1/vti11 is consistent with functional interactions between HOPS and the vacuole SNARE complexes containing VTI11 and SYP22. The mutation in zip2/vps41 may result in altered HOPS–SNARE interactions or the ability of HOPS to promote or proofread the SNARE complex assembly. Furthermore, the altered localization of VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP in the zig-1 mutant is consistent with a functional interaction between HOPS and SNARE that mediates vacuole fusion. We speculate that the bright punctate localizations of the tagged VPS41 and VPS33 in zig-1 may represent nonfunctional fusogenic complexes where SNAREs and HOPS are retained, with delays in their tonoplast accumulation and recycling. This was also observed when the SYP22 SNARE was localized to the same clusters of organelles. Furthermore, we previously hypothesized that the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1 mutants could result from a putative proofreading activity of HOPS upon the mismatched vacuolar SNARE complex missing VTI11 (2), as it has been shown for yeast (79). The aggregation of VPS41 molecules in zig-1 is consistent with such activity, as HOPS could be loaded onto the abnormal SNARE complex while preventing fusion to occur. Further experiments are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. BiFC experiments showed that both HOPS subunits, VPS33 and VPS41, interacted with SYP22 in vivo, but only the VPS33–SYP22 interaction was detected in vitro. This is consistent with a role of HOPS as a chaperone for SNARE complex assembly (see below) and with coimmunoprecipitation between VCL1 and SYP22 in Arabidopsis seedlings (35). These interactions were detected in punctate structures similar to those of VPS33-VPS41 and VTI11-SYP22, suggesting that HOPS–SNARE interactions probably occur in late endosomes. Neither VPS33 or VPS41 interacted with VTI11 in the BiFC assay, which suggests that SNARE–HOPS interactions are not mediated by VTI11 protein surfaces. Overall, our results are consistent with the current model for HOPS–SNARE interactions that mediate membrane fusion in yeast. In this model, VPS33 binding to the Qa-SNARE Vam3 is the first step for SNARE complex assembly. The VPS33–Qa-SNARE interaction is thought to promote a conformational change, which exposes binding surfaces for other SNAREs on the VPS33 subunit (80). The interactions between VPS33 and SYP22, both in BiFC and in vitro, suggest that this mechanism is conserved in plants. Therefore, initial binding of VPS33 and SYP22 may be the first step in the HOPS–SNARE interactions that mediate vacuole fusion in plants.",

Significance Plant vacuoles are essential organelles and occupy up to 90% of the cell volume. Their roles include regulation of stomata movements, protein storage in seeds, gravity sensing, and ion homeostasis. Vacuole or lysosome fusion in eukaryotes is mediated by two multisubunit complexes, SNARE and homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS), but only the SNARE complex is well characterized in plants. Here, we show that, similar to other eukaryotes, HOPS mediates vacuole fusion in plants by interaction with SNAREs and that the HOPS subunit VPS33 and the SNARE protein SYP22 display the sites for interaction between these complexes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, however, plant HOPS recruitment to liposomes is inhibited by phosphoinositides, which appear to define strict rules for regulating fusion and fragmentation of dynamic vacuoles. Keywords: Arabidopsis, vacuole fusion, HOPS, SNARE, phosphoinositidesAbstract The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germination, stomata opening, and gravity perception. Known components of the vacuole fusion machinery in eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryogenesis and pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that Arabidopsis HOPS subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacuole fragmentation phenotypes and demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide evidence for genetic interactions between VPS41 and VTI11 SNARE that regulate vacuole fusion, and the requirement of a functional SNARE complex for normal VPS41 and VPS33 localization. Finally, we provide evidence to support VPS33 and SYP22 at the initial stage for HOPS–SNARE interactions, which is similar to other eukaryotes. These results highlight both conserved and specific mechanisms for HOPS recruitment and function during vacuole fusion in plants. The plant vacuole is an essential organelle with multiple roles including storage, pH homeostasis, and recycling (1). Vacuole fusion is required for stomata opening, pollen fertility, and embryo viability (2–4). Two types of vacuoles exist in plant cells. Embryos in developing seeds contain multiple protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), which have a neutral pH and accumulate storage proteins such as the 7S and 11S globulins. Cells in most mature tissues, instead, contain one large lytic vacuole, which is acidic, abundant in lytic proteases, and critical for ion homeostasis and cell turgor (5). Transition from PSVs to lytic vacuoles occurs during germination (6) and involves PSV fusion and maturation (7). Vacuoles in root meristematic cells are formed by interconnected tubular structures (8), and membrane fusion is necessary for the establishment of the central lytic vacuole (2). Transient and mobile structures such as transvacuolar strands, sheets, and bulbs contribute to the dynamic nature of plant vacuoles (9–12). In vegetative cells, however, very little vacuole fragmentation occurs and most cells contain a single large vacuole. Two exceptions are the changes in guard cell vacuoles during stomata movements (2, 13, 14) and in the leaf motor cells of the mimosa tree (Albizia julibrissin) (15). In both cases, vacuole remodeling occurs during dramatic changes in cellular turgor that drive organ movements. The changes in guard cell vacuoles that occur during stomata opening require homotypic membrane fusion mediated by the vacuolar soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex containing VTI11 (2). Vacuole fusion is not well characterized in plants, but in eukaryotic cells it requires SNAREs, RAB GTPases, membrane lipids, and a tethering complex. SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion by assembly of a four-helix bundle, or trans-SNARE complex, from one SNARE located in the incoming vesicle and three SNAREs located in the target membrane. The SNARE complex brings the two membranes together via a zippering mechanism that is thought to result in membrane fusion (16). A SNARE complex for plant prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and the vacuole is composed of SYP22/VAM3 (Qa-SNARE), VTI11 (Qb-SNARE, called Vti1p in yeast), SYP51 (Qc-SNARE), and VAMP727 (R-SNARE) (17, 18). The Qabc complex can also associate with the R-SNAREs VAMP711 or VAMP713 (19, 20). A role of these SNAREs in vacuole fusion is evidenced by altered vacuole phenotypes of vti11, syp22, and syp22 vamp727 double mutants (2, 18, 21). The homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex was recently shown to mediate homotypic vacuole fusion in plants (3). HOPS is important for the fusion of vacuoles in yeast (16, 22), and fusion of lysosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans (23) and humans (24). The yeast HOPS complex is the best characterized and is formed by six subunits. Vps39p and Vps41p are HOPS specific, while Vps11p, Vps16p, Vps18p, and Vps33p form the “CORE” and are shared with CORVET, a tethering complex that functions at the early endosome (25, 26). HOPS recruitment to yeast vacuole membranes requires phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(4,5)P2, two important regulatory lipids in vacuole fusion (27). Vps33 belongs to the family of Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, which are implicated in assembly and regulation of SNARE complexes. SM proteins have a three-domain architecture, in which domains 1 and 3 form a cleft that accommodates the SNAREs (28). The X-ray structure of a fungal Vps33 bound to a single SNARE, together with in vitro fusion assays, suggests that VPS33 catalyzes SNARE complex assembly through a specific SNARE motif recognition (29). All other HOPS subunits are predicted to form a β-propeller at the N terminus and an α-solenoid at the C terminus (30). The complete HOPS complex has been detected in Arabidopsis by mass spectrometry (3), and all subunits are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome as single genes (31). VACUOLELESS1 (VCL1), the homolog of yeast Vps16, VPS11, VPS39, and VPS41 are required for vacuole biogenesis and pollen development (3, 4, 32–35). VCL1 interacts with VPS33 and VPS11 and localizes to PVCs and the tonoplast (35). VPS18 and VPS39 were also localized to a subdomain of the tonoplast and to cytosolic organelles (3). The molecular mechanisms for HOPS function and regulation during vacuole fusion in plants are not well characterized. The RAB5 and RAB7 GTPase families have been implicated in regulation of endosomes maturation and membrane fusion at the vacuole (36). RAB5 and RAB7 localize to partially overlapping endosome populations, with only RAB7 detected at the tonoplast (19, 37–41). The current model is that the SAND-CCZ complex is a RAB5 effector, exerts GEF function on RAB7, and is necessary for the conversion of RAB5 to RAB7 in PVCs (42–44). Active RAB7 is required for vacuolar localization of HOPS subunits VPS18 and VPS39 (3). Plant homotypic vacuole fusion is also regulated by phosphoinositides. Pollen grains defective in phosphatidylinositol 4-phophate 5-kinase 1 (PI5K1) and PI5K2 have larger vacuoles than the WT, which implicates PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vacuole biogenesis (45). Depletion of PtdIns(3)P after wortmannin (Wm) treatment induces rapid vacuole membrane fusion in root and hypocotyl cells of vti11/zig1 mutants and in guard cells of WT (2). Wm treatment also induces the swelling of plant PVCs, which results in doughnut-shaped structures known as Wm bodies (46). These effects of Wm are due to its inhibitory action against phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (47) and implicate PtdIns(3)P and other phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion in plants. Interestingly, these effects of Wm have not been observed in yeast or animal cells (48, 49), suggesting the possibility of specific mechanisms for plant vacuole fusion. Here, we characterized VPS41 and VPS33 using reverse genetics, fluorescently tagged proteins, and biochemical analyses. We show that VPS41 and VPS33 are important for pollen fertility and PSV maturation in embryos, and that VPS41 is required for homotypic vacuole fusion in developing seedlings. We demonstrate that both proteins localize to late endosomes, that only VPS41 is detected in the tonoplast, and that they interact with each other and with the vacuolar SNARE SYP22. The VPS41-GFP localization at the tonoplast, but not that at late endosomes, is Wm sensitive. In vitro lipid–protein binding assays show that while VPS33 and VPS41 bind to phosphoinositides on lipid strips, neither protein binds to PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2-containing liposomes, even though they do bind to control liposomes. We speculate that specific affinities for membrane lipids together with membrane curvature are key regulatory mechanisms behind vacuole fusion events mediated by HOPS and SNAREs. Results VPS41 and VPS33 Partially Colocalize with Late Endosomes, but only VPS41 Is Detected at the Tonoplast. VPS41 (AT1G08190) and VPS33 (AT3G54860) share 23.29% and 19.17% sequence identity with yeast Vps41p and Vps33p, respectively. Therefore, VPS33 and VPS41 are likely homologs of these yeast HOPS proteins (31, 50). We first investigated whether VPS41 and VPS33 colocalized in vacuolar or prevacuolar membranes, as expected for HOPS. Transient expression of mRFP-VPS41 and VPS33-GFP under control of UBQ10 promoters in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves indicated that these proteins accumulate in the cytosol and nucleus, and associate with membranes in punctate structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B). RFP-VPS41 and VPS33-GFP colocalized in the majority of the punctate structures and the nucleus, and partially at the cell periphery (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C), which supports their participation in a complex. These experiments, however, do not provide enough resolution to identify the compartments where these proteins accumulate and they may be influenced by overexpression. To better characterize protein localizations, VPS41-GFP (4) and VPS33-GFP were analyzed in stable Arabidopsis transgenic plants using full-length genomic fusions to GFP under native promoters. Both proteins were again detected in the cytosol, but membrane association was more discernible. Similar to its localization in pollen (4), VPS41-GFP was detected at the tonoplast and punctate organelles in roots (Fig. 1A), and this localization was not affected by the location of the fluorescence tag as the localization of YFP-VPS41 was very similar (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). Colocalization with known organelle markers was used to identify the structures labeled with VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP. VPS41-GFP colocalized with the tonoplast marker RFP-SYP22 (18) and confirmed its tonoplast association (Fig. 1 A–C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1E). Furthermore, VPS41-GFP partially colocalized with mCherry-RAB7, a marker for the late stages of PVC maturation (51) (Fig. 1 D–F), consistent with results from pollen (4). Colocalization with the early PVC marker mCherry-RAB5 (51) was detected in only a few organelles (Fig. 1 G–I). These results indicate that VPS41-GFP localizes to the vacuole and late endosomes. Similar experiments with VPS33-GFP indicate that VPS41 and VPS33 have overlapping but not identical localizations. VPS33-GFP rarely colocalized with RFP-SYP22 at the tonoplast, except for a few puncta (Fig. 1 J–L and SI Appendix, Fig. S1F), indicating that this protein is absent from the vacuole. VPS33-GFP is present in the cytosol and in cytosolic punctate structures, where it partially colocalized with mCherry-RAB7 (Fig. 1 M–O) and shows strong colocalization with mCherry-RAB5 (Fig. 1 P–R). Quantification of these colocalization experiments further validates the overlapping but distinct localization of VPS33 and VPS41 (Fig. 1 S and T). Both proteins show significant colocalization with RAB7 endosomes. While VPS33 has the strongest colocalization with RAB5 endosomes, it is weakly colocalized with the tonoplast marker SYP22. In contrast, VPS41 shows significant accumulation at the tonoplast but is not associated with RAB5 endosomes (Fig. 1 S and T). Interestingly, both VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP seem to accumulate in more endosomal compartments when coexpressed with mCherry-RAB5 (compare Fig. 1A with Fig. 1G and Fig. 1J with Fig. 1P). The effect of the mCherry-RAB5 fusion on the recruitment or stability of these proteins at the endosome or the endosomes themselves will require further analysis beyond the scope of this work. Overall, these results suggest that VPS33 and VPS41 are cytosolic proteins that preferentially associate with late endosomal compartments, and this is consistent with a role for HOPS in the tethering of vacuoles or prevacuoles. Interestingly, only VPS41 is detected at the tonoplast, and only VPS33 has significant accumulation in RAB5 endosomes. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Subcellular localization of VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP.

Thirty-seven to 56 images from nine seedlings combined were used for each analysis. Bars represent SE.VPS41 Tonoplast Association Is Dependent on Phosphoinositides. The distinct localizations of VPS33-GFP and VPS41-GFP prompted us to test whether the two proteins were characterized by different phospholipid binding affinities. This was tested using an in vitro lipid-binding assay with recombinant proteins. GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Purified proteins were incubated on lipid strips, and protein binding was detected with anti-GST. GST alone was used as negative control (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Both GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 show affinity toward all phosphoinositides in this assay, including the two that are most abundant at the late endosomes and vacuole, PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that VPS41 and VPS33 association with membranes may be regulated in part by phosphoinositide binding. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Phosphoinositides regulate the membrane association of VPS41. (A) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to phosphoinositide lipids. GST-VPS41 (Center) and GST-VPS33 (Right) were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Lipid affinity of purified proteins was analyzed using a lipid strip assay. Lipids include the following: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphocholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate. (B) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to liposomes that lack phosphoinositides. Affinity-purified GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 proteins were incubated without liposomes (none) or with PC/PE liposomes bearing no phosphoinositides (control), PtdIns(3)P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2, and protein binding was detected by cosedimentation and immunoblot with α-GST. Incubation with PI(3)P-GRIP was used as positive control, and GST alone was used as negative control. (C–H) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, but not from endosomes. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (C and F) and mCherry-RAB7 (D and G) were treated with DMSO (C–E) or 33 µM Wm (F–H) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. Merged images are shown (E and H). Tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP is indicated with arrowheads. Wm induced the enlargement of RAB7-labeled endosomes (arrows) that retained VPS41-GFP signal. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (I–N) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (I and L) and mRFP-SYP22 (J and M) were treated with DMSO (I–K) or 33 µM Wm (L–N) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. VPS41-GFP signal is depicted using a rainbow LUT (I and L), where high intensity values are represented in red and low intensity values are shown in blue. Red pixels were associated with the tonoplast in the DMSO control only. Merged images are shown using green color for the GFP signal (K and N). (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (O) Quantification of the tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP from I–N. The ratio between the membrane and cytosolic fluorescence intensity of VPS41-GFP was calculated using ImageJ from DMSO or Wm-treated seedlings (N = 27 images from seven to eight seedlings per treatment; *significant in a t test at P < 0.05).To characterize lipid binding in a physiological context, we used a liposome-binding assay that better resembles lipid binding in a bilayer. Phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) liposomes bearing either no phosphoinositide, PtdIns(3)P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2 were incubated in the presence of recombinant proteins, and binding was assayed by cosedimentation. As shown in Fig. 2B, both GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bound to the control liposomes, indicating that these proteins have strong affinity for neutral lipids. Surprisingly, addition of PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2 abolished this binding, which suggests that VPS33 and VPS41 membrane binding is tightly controlled. The PI(3)P-GRIP protein which contains a PtdIns(3)P-binding domain was used as a positive control, and GST was used as a negative control. These results underscore VPS41 and VPS33 sensitivities to phosphoinositides and to the different presentation of these lipids between the flat surface of the lipid strip and the curved membrane of the liposomes. PtdIns(3)P is a negative regulator for homotypic vacuole fusion in plants (2) and recruits HOPS to the vortex ring in yeast (52). Hence, PtdIns(3)P and other phosphoinositides are good candidates to regulate HOPS subunit association with the vacuole and PVC. We therefore asked whether the localizations of GFP-VPS41 was affected by phosphoinositide availability using Wm treatment, which results in PtdIns(3)P depletion from cellular membranes (53). GFP-VPS41 was found at the tonoplast and some mCherry-RAB7-labeled endosomes, in the DMSO control as expected (Fig. 2 C–E). Wm treatment resulted in PVC swelling with the characteristic doughnut-like structures that were decorated with both VPS41-GFP and mCherry-RAB7 (Fig. 2 F–H), which suggests that Wm treatment did not alter the VPS41 association with late endosome membranes. Remarkably, VPS41-GFP was no longer detected at the tonoplast after Wm treatment (Fig. 2 F–H). To quantify the loss of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, we used the RFP-SYP22 marker as a proxy for vacuole membrane localization. As shown in Fig. 2 I–K, the sites of highest VPS41-GFP fluorescence intensity in the control colocalize with RFP-SYP22 at the tonoplast. This tonoplast bright signal is lost after the Wm treatment (Fig. 2 L–N). Quantification of these results further indicates that Wm treatment results in a 35% decrease in the membrane/cytosolic ratio of VPS41-GFP (Fig. 2O). These results indicate that tonoplast association of VPS41 is mediated by phosphoinositide binding, but its association with late endosome membranes is independent of phosphoinositides. Major changes in VPS33-GFP localization were not detected after Wm treatment as a few RAB7 endosomes were still labeled with VPS33-GFP (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 B–G).HOPS Is Essential for Male Fertility and Important for Plant Development. To define the role of VPS41 and VPS33 in vacuole fusion and dynamics, we identified loss-of-function alleles for VPS41 and VPS33 from the SALK T-DNA collection (54). T-DNA insertions were confirmed for vps41-1 (SALK_076372) and vps41-3 (SALK_036406), which carry the T-DNA insertions in the 13th exon and the promoter region of VPS41, respectively. Three T-DNA insertion alleles were confirmed for VPS33, vps33-3 (SALK_016684C), vps33-4 (SALK_151719), and vps33-5 (SALK_143407). These mutants carry the insertions in the 13th intron, the promoter, and the seventh exon of VPS33 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). RT-PCR from homozygous lines showed no altered VPS41 transcript accumulation for vps41-3, and this line was not used further. No homozygous plants were recovered from over 50 progeny of vps41-1/+, vps33-3/+, vps33-4/+, or vps33-5/+, and none had evidence for embryo abortion in siliques from heterozygous plants, which suggested the possibility of gametophyte lethality or sterility. To determine which gametophyte was unfertile, reciprocal crosses were performed between vps41-1/+ or vps33-3/+ and Col-0 WT plants to determine the male and female transmission efficiency (TE) (55) (SI Appendix, Table S1). The results show that transmission through the female gametes is not compromised in either mutant. However, male vps41-1 TE is abolished, indicating that VPS41 is essential for pollen fertility. The vps33-3 pollen, instead, is not completely sterile, but the male TE is strongly reduced to 16.1%. The pollen defects of vps33 and vps41 loss-of-function alleles are consistent with previous reports (4, 32) and, together with the phenotype of vps18 and vps39 mutants recently reported (3), support an important role of the HOPS complex in male gametophyte development. Similar to VPS41-GFP (4), the full-length genomic fusion construct for VPS33-GFP complements the pollen fertility defects of loss-of-function mutants as homozygous vps33-3 can be recovered (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B–D).HOPS Is Important for Vacuole Biogenesis and Fusion. We identified viable weaker alleles to characterize VPS41 and VPS33 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). One EMS allele for VPS41, zip2/vps41 (56), and two viable TILLING (57) alleles of VPS33, vps33-1 and vps33-2, are available. The zip2/vps41 allele was identified from a screen of suppressors of zig-1/vti11 in gravitropism (56). The mutation results in a G721R substitution within an annotated clathrin heavy chain repeat (CHCR) of the VPS41 protein that is predicted to mediate protein–protein interactions (58). The mutations in vps33-1 and vps33-2 result in S95F and V136M substitutions in the VPS33 protein, respectively. Both are predicted to occur in domain 1 of the VPS33 protein, which, together with domain 3, has been shown in fungi and yeast to form a cleft that is thought to accommodate SNARE bundles (28). None of the single mutants shows developmental phenotypes in rosettes or inflorescences under normal growth conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S3E). No vacuole phenotypes were observed in zip2/vps41, vps33-1, or vps33-2 when seedling roots were analyzed using LysoTracker Red staining (SI Appendix, Fig. S3F). However, we observed an increased number of PSVs in mature zip2/vps41, vps33-1, and vps33-2 embryos compared with the WT (Fig. 3 A–D). The number of vacuoles per cell was counted in each genotype to quantify this defect (Fig. 3E). Only cells with a cross-section area between 11 and 15.9 µm2 were included in the analysis. Fifty-three percent of the cells from the WT control have five to six vacuoles per cell, and a smaller fraction (26%) have seven to eight vacuoles. In contrast, only 16.8% of the cells from the zip2/vps41 embryos have five to six vacuoles while the rest (88%) have seven or more. Similar results were detected for vps33-1 where 17% of the cells contain six or fewer vacuoles, while the rest (83%) had seven or more. Finally, almost all of the vps33-2 mutant embryos showed seven to eight vacuoles per cell. These results support the hypothesis that VPS41 and VPS33 are involved in vacuole homotypic fusion and are important for PSV maturation. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab HOPS is required for protein storage and lytic vacuole morphology. (A–D) Morphology of protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) in mature embryos from the WT control (Col-0) (A), zip2/vps41 (B), vps33-1 (C), and vps33-2 (D). Autofluorescence of the PSVs was acquired by CLSM. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (E) Vacuole number distribution in mature embryos. Embryos from WT control (Col-0), vps33-1, vps33-2, and zip2/vps41 were imaged as in A–D, and the number of vacuoles per cell was counted. Only cells with a cross-section area between 11 and 15.9 µm2 were included in the analysis. Bars represent the percentage of cells with less than 4 (blue), 5–6 (orange), 7–8 (gray), 9–10 (red), and 11 or more (green) vacuoles per cell in each genotype. Col-0, n = 165 cells; zip2, n = 146 cells; vps33-1, n = 154 cells; vps33-2, n = 118 cells. (F–N) Vacuole morphology of amiRNA lines after DEX induction. Seedlings from Col-0 WT (control, F–H), amiR-vps41 (I–K), and amiR-vps11 (L–N) were incubated for 72 h with DEX and stained with BCECF and FM4-64. Roots were imaged at the meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ). (Scale bar: 20 µm.)A dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible amiRNA system was used to determine the function of HOPS in developing seedlings. The HOPS-CORE subunit VPS11 and the HOPS-specific subunit VPS41 were targeted by the inducible amiRNA system. WT, amiR-vps41, and amiR-vps11 seedlings were treated with DMSO (control) or DEX for 72 h, and vacuole morphology was observed by 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) staining. Normal vacuole morphology was observed in both amiR-vps11 and amiR-vps41 in the absence of DEX compared with the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S3G) and in the WT after DEX treatment (Fig. 3 F–H). In contrast, dramatic changes in vacuole morphology were observed after DEX induction of the two lines. Both amiR-vps41 (Fig. 3 I–K) and amiR-vps11 (Fig. 3 L–N) seedlings showed highly fragmented vacuoles in meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ) of the root after DEX induction. We note that the phenotype was observed only in cells that were not elongated at the time of induction. This phenotype together with the PSV phenotype of allelic mutants demonstrates a critical role of HOPS for vacuole fusion and biogenesis.VPS41 and VPS33 Interact in Vivo with Each Other and with SYP22 in Specific Foci. If HOPS is involved in membrane fusion at the vacuole, it is likely to interact with the vacuolar SNARE complex (17, 18), including SYP22 and VTI11. To determine whether VPS41 and VPS33 interact with each other and with the vacuolar SNAREs, split YFP fusion proteins were constructed for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments in Nicotiana leaf epidermis (59, 60). Only N-terminal n/cYFP fusions of the SNARE proteins were used because the C termini of vacuolar SNAREs reside in the vacuole lumen. For VPS33 and VPS41, both N- and C-terminal constructs were generated, but none of the C-terminal n/cYFP fusions restored YFP signal in any combination. Coexpression of cYFP-VPS41 with nYFP-VPS33 resulted in a punctate pattern at the vacuole periphery (Fig. 4A), indicating that VPS41 and VPS33 are likely to participate in the HOPS complex. Coexpression of the same cYFP-VPS41 construct with the SNARE fusion nYFP-SYP22 resulted in a punctate pattern as well, indicating that these two proteins interact in vivo (Fig. 4B). In contrast, no YFP fluorescence was detected when cYFP-VPS41 was coexpressed with nYFP-VTI11 (Fig. 4C). Note that broad fluorescent structures (asterisks) in Fig. 4 B and C are likely background signal because they were observed in negative controls (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B). Next, we tested interactions with VPS33. Again, coexpression of cYFP-VPS33 with nYFP-VPS41 resulted in a punctate pattern indicative of protein–protein interaction (Fig. 4D). When cYFP-VPS33 was coexpressed with nYFP-SYP22, a strong YFP signal was detected in punctate foci (Fig. 4E), supporting the hypothesis that HOPS and SNAREs interact to mediate membrane fusion. Similar to the VPS41 interactions, no YFP fluorescence was detected when cYFP-VPS33 and nYFP-VTI11 were coexpressed, suggesting the absence of close interactions between these two proteins in vivo (Fig. 4F). To further validate these results, the c/nYFP-VPS33 was coexpressed with a n/cYFP- fusion to the aquaporin TIP2;1 as a negative control. No YFP signal was detected in either combination (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 D and E), which confirms the lack of interaction for the negative controls. The two vacuolar SNAREs VTI11 and SYP22 were used as positive controls as they have been shown to interact (21) and localize at the PVC (18, 61). Indeed, coexpression of cYFP-VTI11 with nYFP-SYP22 as well as cYFP-SYP22 with nYFP-VTI11 resulted in similar punctate structures at the periphery of the vacuole (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 C and F). Overall, these data show that VPS33 and VPS41 can assemble in subcellular foci and that both proteins can interact in vivo with SYP22, but not with VTI11. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis for HOPS–SNARE interactions mediating membrane fusion at the vacuole. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab VPS41 and VPS33 interact and can bind the SNARE protein SYP22. (A–F) VPS41 and VPS33 interact in vivo and bind the SNARE protein SYP22. BiFC analysis of protein interactions in infiltrated N. benthamiana leaf cells by confocal microscopy. The N-terminal half (nY) or the C-terminal half (cY) of YFP were fused with VPS41, VPS33, SYP22, or VTI11. (A–C) cYFP-VPS41 interacts with nYFP-VPS33 (A), nYFP-SYP22 (B), but not with nYFP-VTI11 (C). (D–F) cYFP-VPS33 interacts with nYFP-VPS41 (D), nYFP-SYP22 (E), but not with nYFP-VTI11 (F). Asterisks indicate background signal that was observed in the negative control. (G) VPS33 binds the SYP22 SNARE in vitro. Recombinant GST-VPS41, GST-VPS33, HIS-SYP22, and HIS-VTI11 protein fusions were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The purified proteins were mixed as indicated, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with an α-HIS antibody. Proteins from 5% of the input, immunoprecipitate (IP), or 5% of the flowthrough were separated by SDS/PAGE, and GST-VPS41 or GST-VPS33 were detected by Western blot with an α-GST antibody. Arrows indicate the expected sizes of GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33. The positions of 150-kDa (Top) and 100-kDa (Bottom) molecular markers are indicated with arrowheads. (H–K) Genetic interaction between hypomorphic HOPS mutant alleles and zig-1. Seedlings were stained for 2 h in LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) and acquired in LSCM. Abnormal vacuole morphology in the maturation zone was observed in zig-1 (H), vps33-1 zig-1 (J), and vps33-2 zig-1 mutants (K). The vacuole phenotype was complemented in the root differentiation zone (DZ) of the double-mutant zig-1 zip2 (I). (L–N) Loss of the VTI11 SNARE induces abnormal VPS41-GFP localization. VPS41-GFP was imaged in the Col-0 WT (L) or the zig-1 mutant background (M and N). The protein was found in bright aggregates at the junction of zig-1 vacuoles or in clusters in the cytosol as shown with the Airyscan mode of the confocal (N). (O–Q). Loss of the VTI11 SNARE induces abnormal VPS33-GFP localization. VPS33-GFP was imaged in the Col-0 WT (O) or zig-1 (P and Q). Details of the aggregates at the junction between unfused vacuoles can be observed in the Airyscan mode (Q). (Scale bars: 10 µm.)VSP33 Interacts Directly with the Qa SNARE SYP22. VPS33 mediates SNARE complex assembly in yeast (29), and we could detect interactions between VPS33, VPS41, and SYP22 by BiFC. Therefore, we tested whether either of the two HOPS subunits could support a direct interaction with SYP22 by in vitro coimmunopreciptation. Proteins were expressed as tagged fusions to either GST (VPS33 and VPS41) or HIS (SYP22 and VTI11), and immunoprecipitation was carried out using an α-HIS antibody. GST-VPS41 was not detected in the α-HIS immunoprecipitate when incubated with either HIS-SYP22 or HIS-VTI11 (Fig. 4G), indicating a lack of direct interaction. In contrast, a direct interaction between GST-VPS33 and HIS-SYP22 was detected using this assay, as GST-VPS33 was detected in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4G). This interaction was confirmed in a complementary experiment where α-GST pulled down both HIS-SYP22 and GST-VPS33 in the coimmunoprecipitate (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Whether or not there were direct interactions with HIS-VTI11 was less definitive. Incubation of GST-VPS33 and HIS-VTI11 with α-HIS produced detectable signals of GST-VPS33 on immunoblots (Fig. 4G), but no signal was detected for HIS-VTI11 when α-GST was used (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Overall, these data provide strong evidence that HOPS–SNARE interactions in plants are mediated by direct interaction of VPS33 and SYP22, most likely due to conserved mechanisms.The HOPS Subunit VPS41 Genetically Interacts with the VTI11 SNARE. The evidence for protein–protein interactions between HOPS subunits and the vacuolar SNARE SYP22 prompted us to test for genetic interactions between the two complexes. zip2, a mutant allele of VPS41 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A), was identified as a suppressor of the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1, a loss-of-function allele of VTI11 (56). To determine whether zip2 suppresses the vacuole phenotype of zig-1, vacuoles from the zig-1 zip2 double mutants were visualized with LysoTracker Red (Fig. 4 H–K). The zig-1 mutant displayed the previously described vacuole phenotype in both the root tip and root maturation zone (2) (Fig. 4H and SI Appendix, Fig. S4H). The zig-1 zip2 still exhibited multiple vacuoles near the root tip (SI Appendix, Fig. S4I), but this phenotype was not observed in the root maturation zone (Fig. 4I). These results indicate that zip2 partially suppresses the zig-1 phenotype at the subcellular level and confirm a genetic interaction between ZIP2/VPS41 and VTI11. Furthermore, this result suggests that the zip2 mutation results in changes in the VPS41 protein structure that may alter the interactions between HOPS and SNAREs. A similar approach was used to test for genetic interactions between VPS33 and VTI11, but unlike zig-1 zip2 doubles, vps33-1 zig-1 and vps33-2 zig-1 double mutants showed the abnormal zig-1 vacuole phenotype in all root cells (Fig. 4 J and K and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 J and K) and the zig-zagged phenotype of the inflorescence. These results indicate that the vps33-1 and vps33-2 mutations failed to complement the vacuole phenotype, perhaps due to their hypomorphic nature, which may have innocuous effects on the VPS33 protein. The proposed interaction between HOPS and SNAREs led us to predict that loss of the VTI11 SNARE from the vacuole could alter the localization of VPS41 or VPS33. We tested this possibility in zig-1 mutants. VPS41-GFP localization in the WT background showed the cytosolic, punctate, and tonoplast localization previously described (Fig. 4L). In contrast, VPS41-GFP was not detected at the tonoplast and only accumulated in bright aggregated patterns in the zig-1 background (Fig. 4M). When visualized using the Airyscan mode of the microscope, these bright patterns were associated with adjacent vacuoles or clusters of small organelles in the cytosol (Fig. 4N). A similar result was obtained with VPS33-GFP. In contrast to the dispersed puncta of VPS33-GFP in the WT (Fig. 4O), zig-1 mutants showed clustered structures labeled with VPS33-GFP (Fig. 4 P and Q). At least some of these clusters represent small vacuoles as similar clusters were detected in zig-1 mutants labeled with RFP-SYP22 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 L–N). These results indicate that a functional SNARE complex is required for the normal localization of VPS41 and VPS33.Discussion The plant HOPS tethering complex is evolutionarily conserved with other eukaryotes (3, 31, 35), is involved in vacuole traffic via a RAB7-mediated pathway, and is critical for homotypic vacuole fusion (3). HOPS shares four subunits with CORVET, a similar conserved complex that mediates tethering of RAB5 endosomes and vacuoles in a plant-specific manner (3). Our results show that stable VPS33–VPS41 interactions predominantly occur in punctate organelles likely to correspond to endosomes as expected for a tether between endosomes and vacuoles. The possibility remains, however, that the functional HOPS complex also assembles transiently at sites of vacuole homotypic fusions, which are not abundant in the cells used in these experiments. HOPS is essential for vacuole membrane fusion in plants. VPS33 and VPS41 are essential in pollen fertility, and in fact, loss of VPS41 function interfered with pollen penetration into the stigma (4). This and previous results (3, 4, 33, 34) indicate that HOPS is essential for plant viability. The increased number of PSVs of hypomorphic mutants zip2, vps33-1, and vps33-2 is indicative of HOPS function in PSV fusion or trafficking, as it has been observed in other vacuolar trafficking mutants (2, 18, 43, 62, 63). Moreover, the inducible amiRNA silencing of VPS41 and VPS11 underscores HOPS function in lytic vacuole fusion. Phosphoinositides and Membrane Curvature Delimit VPS41 and VPS33 Recruitment. VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP localize to late endosomes, which is consistent with a role in membrane fusion at the PVC and vacuole as part of HOPS (31) and with previous results in pollen tubes (4). The exclusive presence of VPS41 at the vacuole, however, was unexpected. One interpretation is that VPS33 recruitment to the vacuole is transient and limited to sites of membrane fusion, while VPS41 binding to the tonoplast is stable and results from specific lipid-binding affinities. Even though both proteins showed affinity for most phosphoinositides in a lipid strip assay, these results do not rule out the possibility of different affinities to specific phosphoinositides or that their recruitment to specific membranes is enhanced by interaction with other proteins. Two other HOPS subunits, VPS18 and VPS39, the latter being HOPS specific, are also absent from the vacuole (3). Given the competing needs of the core subunits VPS33, VPS18, VPS11, and VPS16 for either HOPS or CORVET assembly, the stable recruitment of VPS41 to the tonoplast could serve as a reservoir for this subunit in a way that does not compete for complex assembly. Phosphoinositides recruit HOPS to the vertex ring between two juxtaposed vacuoles undergoing fusion in yeast (27, 52). We hypothesized that these lipids could fulfill a similar role in plants, and this was first supported by VPS41 and VPS33 binding to immobilized phosphoinositides on a membrane. Surprisingly, both VPS33 and VPS41 also bound to membrane liposomes but only in the absence of PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2. This result implicates membrane curvature as an additional factor in the recruitment of HOPS to cellular membranes in plants and highlights the sensitivity of these proteins to both membrane topology and phosphoinositide lipid content. The plant vacuole membrane is a flat surface compared with the late endosomes, and membrane curvature could indeed represent a proxy for organelle identity in plant vacuole traffic. We propose that VPS41 binding to the vacuole membrane entails its recruitment by PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2, since PtdIns(3)P has been detected at the tonoplast, and both are important for vacuolar traffic (64, 65). In contrast, VPS41 binding to curved membranes such as those of late endosomes is independent of and inhibited by phosphoinositides. This model is further supported by the loss of VPS41-GFP from the vacuole membrane but not from late endosomes in Wm-treated cells. The inhibitory effect of phosphoinositides on VPS33 and VPS41 binding to liposomes suggests that plants have evolved different mechanisms of regulating vacuole fusion compared with yeast. In contrast to plants, the complete yeast HOPS complex and VPS41 alone bind to liposomes containing vacuolar phosphoinositides, but they do not bind strongly to bare liposomes (27, 66, 67). Therefore, while phosphoinositides promote recruitment of HOPS to curved membranes in yeast, they have the opposite effect in plants. Current models for vacuole fusion propose that the site of HOPS function, the vertex of two juxtaposed vacuoles, represents a highly curved membrane (68, 69). Moreover, small liposomes may be used as a proxy for HOPS interactions with the membrane at the vertex ring (68). The liposomes used here are not small enough to represent membrane curvature at sites of vacuole fusion, but if phosphoinositides also abolish HOPS binding at these sites, it would be consistent with yet another phenomenon observed only in plants. Our group has shown that Wm induces vacuole fusion in plants, both in developing roots and in guard cells, and we proposed that phosphoinositides function as negative regulators of vacuole fusion (2). This effect of Wm, however, is not observed in yeast vacuoles (48) or animal lysosomes (49), and therefore, plants seemed to have coerced the regulatory role of phosphoinositides into inhibitors rather than promoters of vacuole fusion. This difference may be due to evolutionary changes in the mechanisms by which VPS41 binds to membranes. VPS41 binding to highly curved membranes in yeast is mediated by an amphipathic lipid packing sensor (ALPS) motif, which also contains two important regulatory phosphorylation sites (67). The ALPS motif is not conserved in plants including Arabidopsis (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), which further supports the existence of plant-specific mechanisms for recruitment of HOPS to highly curved membranes. PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 are important phosphoinositides for vacuole traffic and dynamics (64). PtdIns(3,5)P2 is produced by phosphorylation of the PtdIns(3)P precursor by the PI5 kinases FAB1A and FAB1B (70), and FAB1A has been localized to late endosomes (71). A new sensor of PtdIns(3,5)P2 indicates that this lipid accumulates in late endosomes (72), but it is not clear how much can persist after late endosome fusion with the vacuole. The possibility that PtdIns(3,5)P2 accumulates in the tonoplast is supported by the localization of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatases SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN 2–5 (SAC2–5) exclusively to the vacuole membrane (73). Interestingly, Wm treatment resulted in significant dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, which could result from rapid depletion of PtdIns(3,5)P2 specifically in the tonoplast if both synthesis is stalled due to the unavailability of its precursor and active dephosphorylation by SAC phosphatases (73). PtdIns(3,5)P2 has recently emerged as an important regulator of plant growth, development, and stress responses. PtdIns(3,5)P2 is critical for polar growth (74) and is induced under osmotic stress in plants (75) and yeast (76). Loss of FAB1A and FAB1B results in pollen lethality due to the formation of aberrantly large vacuoles during pollen development (77), which implicates PtdIns(3,5)P2 in vacuole biogenesis. Moreover, PtdIns(3,5)P2 was found to be important for vacuole acidification and fragmentation during stomata closing (78), and loss of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatases SAC2–5, which is expected to increase its accumulation in membranes, induces vacuole fragmentation in Arabidopsis roots (73). It is tempting to speculate that these roles of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in promoting vacuole fragmentation in guard cells during stomata closure result from its inhibitory effect on VPS33 and VPS41 recruitment to sites of apposing vacuole membranes, which would be otherwise available for fusion. Our results suggest that vacuolar phosphoinositides are likely to play an important role in vacuole fusion–fragmentation dynamics by controlling the recruitment of HOPS to apposing vacuole membranes. Further research is necessary to test this hypothesis.HOPS–SNARE Interactions Are Mediated by the SYP22 Qa SNARE. The HOPS complex is expected to interact with SNARE proteins to regulate membrane fusion at the vacuole. That zip2/vps41 partially suppressed the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1/vti11 is consistent with functional interactions between HOPS and the vacuole SNARE complexes containing VTI11 and SYP22. The mutation in zip2/vps41 may result in altered HOPS–SNARE interactions or the ability of HOPS to promote or proofread the SNARE complex assembly. Furthermore, the altered localization of VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP in the zig-1 mutant is consistent with a functional interaction between HOPS and SNARE that mediates vacuole fusion. We speculate that the bright punctate localizations of the tagged VPS41 and VPS33 in zig-1 may represent nonfunctional fusogenic complexes where SNAREs and HOPS are retained, with delays in their tonoplast accumulation and recycling. This was also observed when the SYP22 SNARE was localized to the same clusters of organelles. Furthermore, we previously hypothesized that the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1 mutants could result from a putative proofreading activity of HOPS upon the mismatched vacuolar SNARE complex missing VTI11 (2), as it has been shown for yeast (79). The aggregation of VPS41 molecules in zig-1 is consistent with such activity, as HOPS could be loaded onto the abnormal SNARE complex while preventing fusion to occur. Further experiments are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. BiFC experiments showed that both HOPS subunits, VPS33 and VPS41, interacted with SYP22 in vivo, but only the VPS33–SYP22 interaction was detected in vitro. This is consistent with a role of HOPS as a chaperone for SNARE complex assembly (see below) and with coimmunoprecipitation between VCL1 and SYP22 in Arabidopsis seedlings (35). These interactions were detected in punctate structures similar to those of VPS33-VPS41 and VTI11-SYP22, suggesting that HOPS–SNARE interactions probably occur in late endosomes. Neither VPS33 or VPS41 interacted with VTI11 in the BiFC assay, which suggests that SNARE–HOPS interactions are not mediated by VTI11 protein surfaces. Overall, our results are consistent with the current model for HOPS–SNARE interactions that mediate membrane fusion in yeast. In this model, VPS33 binding to the Qa-SNARE Vam3 is the first step for SNARE complex assembly. The VPS33–Qa-SNARE interaction is thought to promote a conformational change, which exposes binding surfaces for other SNAREs on the VPS33 subunit (80). The interactions between VPS33 and SYP22, both in BiFC and in vitro, suggest that this mechanism is conserved in plants. Therefore, initial binding of VPS33 and SYP22 may be the first step in the HOPS–SNARE interactions that mediate vacuole fusion in plants.Methods Plant Materials, Growth Conditions, and Transformation. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown as described (2). The ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as WT control. The genomic VPS41-GFP fusion (VPS41p::VPS41-GFP) was described elsewhere (4). Organelle markers mRFP-SYP22 (18), mCherry-RAB5 (mCherry-RabF2a), and mCherry-RAB7 (mCherry-RabG3f) (51) have been previously described. SALK T-DNA insertion lines, including vps41-1 (SALK_076372), vps41-2 (SALK_035406), vps33-3 (SALK_016684C), vps33-4 (SALK_151719), and vps33-5 (SALK_143407), were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR (SI Appendix, Table S4). The zip2 zig-1 mutant was previously characterized (56). The TILLING lines (57) vps33-1 (CS92162) and vps33-2 (CS93595) were obtained from ABRC and backcrossed three times with Col-0 WT. Homozygous vps33-1 and vps33-2 were genotyped by PCR amplification (SI Appendix, Table S4) and restriction digestion with BsmBI (vps33-1) or TspRI (vps33-2). Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown at room temperature for 3–4 wk in Metro-Mix 300 soil with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. Arabidopsis transformation was carried out by floral dip (81) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 and GV3101. Transient plant Agro-infiltration of 3- to 4-wk-old N. benthamiana leaves was carried out as described (82). GFP or RFP fluorescence was observed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) 36–48 h after infiltration.Molecular Cloning. The full-length genomic fusion of VPS33 with GFP driven by either 3- or 1-kb native promoters were generated using the GoldenBraid system (83). Primers for VPS33 genomic sequences (SI Appendix, Table S4) were generated by the GB domesticator software (https://gbcloning.upv.es/tools/domestication/), and each part was amplified by PCR (83, 84). Each transcriptional unit (TU) was assembled by restriction–ligation reaction into pUPD2 and sequenced. The full fusion construct containing the VPS33 promoter and genomic sequence, GFP, and the VPS33 terminator sequence was then assembled into pDGB3_alpha1. This cassette was finally inserted into pDGB3_omega1 together with the kanamycin resistance cassette from pGB0184 to generate pVPS33::gVPS33-GFP (VPS33-GFP). All experiments were carried out with the 3-kb promoter, except for Fig. 1 P–R, where the 1-kb promoter was used. UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter-driven and BiFC constructs were generated by Gateway cloning. Coding sequences of VPS41 (At1g08190), VPS33 (At3G54860), VTI11 (At5G39510), SYP22 (AT5G146860), and AtTIP2;1 (AT3G16240) were obtained by RT-PCR. Briefly, total mRNA was extracted from Col-0 WT seedlings using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer’s instruction. cDNAs were synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) and amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (SI Appendix, Table S4) compatible for Gateway cloning. Entry clones were generated in pENTR4 or pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) (SI Appendix, Table S3). Expression clones (SI Appendix, Table S2) were generated by recombination between the entry clones and multiple destination vectors using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). Vectors driven by the pUBQ10 promoter were generated after substitution of the short UBQ promoter of the vector set described in ref. 85 with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596 bp) from pNIGEL07 (51). pDEST15 and pDEST17 destination vectors (Invitrogen) were used for protein expression in bacteria, and N- and C-terminal nEYFP and cEYFP pSITE vectors (86) were used to generate constructs for BiFC. All expression constructs are described in SI Appendix, Table S2. The amiR-vps constructs were cloned using the GreenGate system (87). Specific amiRNA sequences against VPS41 and VPS11 (AT2G05170) were identified with the Web MicroRNA Designer (WMD3) tool (88) at wmd3.weigelworld.org/cgi-bin/webapp.cgi. The amiR-vps sequences were amplified in four independent PCRs (SI Appendix, Table S5) with the pRS300 plasmid containing the miR319a precursor sequence. To be suited for the GreenGate cloning system, primers “A” and “B” were modified with specific overhangs. The final PCR products (fourth reaction) were first digested with Eco31I and then ligated into the preopened intermediate vectors (SI Appendix, Table S5). The resulting vectors (supermodule A and B for each amiR-vps) were sequenced and combined in consecutive GreenGate reactions as described (87). The DEX induction system is based on the p6xOP/LhG4-GR transcription system (89, 90). Primers and vectors used in these experiments are reported in SI Appendix, Tables S3–S5.Microscopy. Zeiss LSM 710 or Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan confocal microscopes were used for all imaging experiments unless specified. The excitation/emission wavelengths for imaging were 488 nm/492–570 nm for GFP and YFP, 561 nm/588–696 nm for mCherry and mRFP, and 561 nm/566–690 nm for LysoTracker Red. Three-day-old seedlings were analyzed with a 40×/1.2 N.A. water-immersion objective. To image PSVs, seeds were imbibed in water for 1 h, and seed coats were peeled off with a sharp needle. Vacuoles in the mature embryos were imaged by capturing PSV autofluorescence (excitation/emission wavelengths were 405/450–510 nm) from a single Z plane per sample. PSV quantification was carried out using Fiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ, based on ImageJ 1.51d; fiji.sc/) (91). Linear (Pearson) and the nonlinear (Spearman’s) correlation coefficients for colocalization analysis were obtained with the PSC colocalization plug-in (92). The threshold level for the noise was set at 4. Membrane/cytosolic ratios of VPS41-GFP were calculated in Fiji by extracting intensity values of VPS41-GFP only from the vacuole membrane. This was accomplished by generating a membrane signal mask by thresholding of the RFP-SYP22 marker in the red channel to 40 or above. The mask was then applied to the GFP channel to extract the histograms of intensity values for VPS41-GFP at the membrane. A “cytosolic” intensity average was calculated by measuring intensity values from four cytosolic regions of interest per image. Live-cell CLSM of vacuoles from amiRNA lines was done using a Leica TCS SP5II microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a Leica HCX PL APO lambda blue 63×/1.20 N.A. UV water-immersion objective. Images were acquired with a lateral pixel resolution between 50 and 96 nm at a speed of 400 Hz with bidirectional scanning and five times line averaging. To reduce background fluorescence, the pinhole was adjusted between 0.75 and 1.0 airy unit (AU). The excitation/emission wavelengths for imaging were 488 nm/495–550 nm for BCECF and 561 nm/600–680 nm for FM4-64. Image postprocessing operations (Gaussian blur between 0.5 and 0.75; adjustment of brightness and contrast of the whole image) were done with Fiji.Chemical Treatments and Fluorescent Dyes. Three- or 4-d-old seedlings were used in all chemical treatments and fluorescent dye stainings. Wm (W3144; Sigma) was diluted in liquid AGM to a final concentration of 33 μM, and the same volume of DMSO was added to the control (1% final). Seedlings were treated for 3 h in the dark at 22 °C. A minimum of three seedlings was analyzed for each treatment, and the experiment was repeated three times. LysoTracker Red staining was carried out by incubation of seedlings in liquid AGM supplemented with 2 μM LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) for 2 h. For amiRNA induction with DEX, 5 d-old seedlings were incubated for 72 h in liquid AGM supplemented with 30 µM DEX, or DMSO (control). Seedlings were stained with 10 µM BCECF, acetoxymethyl ester, and 1 µM FM 4-64 as described (8).Protein Purification. BL21-AI E. coli cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with T7::GST-VPS41, T7::GST-VPS33, T7::GST, T7::HIS-SYP22, or T7::HIS-VTI11. Recombinant bacteria were cultured in 300 mL of LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and 1% glucose at 37 °C to an OD of 0.4–0.6. Expression of the tagged proteins was induced with 0.2% arabinose. Cultures were incubated at 28 °C for 5 h, except for T7::HIS-SYP22, which was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and HIS-VTI11, which was incubated at 16 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors; Roche; #04693132001) and 12 μg/mL lysozyme (Sigma). The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 11,200 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was then added to either a Gluthatione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) or a Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), accordingly. The recombinant proteins were eluted after an overnight incubation at 4 °C in slow rotation following the manufacturer’s recommendations.Lipid–Protein Binding Assays. Phospholipid-coated PIP strips (Echelon) were blocked with TBST buffer [10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20] containing 3% (wt/vol) BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Strips were then incubated with 3 mL of 0.33 nM purified GST-VPS41, GST-VPS33, or GST in TBST and 3% (wt/vol) BSA at 4 °C overnight. Strips were washed three times and incubated with mouse anti-GST primary antibody [1:1,000 dilution in 3% (wt/vol) BSA; Thermo Fisher]. A secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody [diluted 1:2,000 in 3% (wt/vol) BSA; Thermo Fisher Scientific] was used next, and signal was detected by western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) using a G:BOX Chemi XRQ gel documentation system (Syngene). This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. The liposome binding assay was modified from refs. 93 and 94 using PolyPIPosomes (Echelon Biosciences) containing no phosphoinositides (control; catalog #Y-0000), PI(3)P (catalog #Y-003), or PI(3,5)P2 (catalog #Y-035). Proteins were first clarified by ultracentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Then, 2.5 µg of GST-VPS41, 1.7 µg of GST-VPS33, 500 ng of GST alone, and 600 ng of PI(3)P Grip (p40 PX) (Echelon Biosciences) were diluted in a final volume of 95 µL of 1× binding buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4; 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/mL BSA; 0.2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, and 1× protease inhibitors from Roche; #04693132001). Five microliters of the PolyPIPosome was added, and the final 100-µL volume was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with slow rotation. Liposomes were then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature and washed one time in 1× binding buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 30 µl of Laemmli buffer and resolved together with 30% of the supernatant by SDS/PAGE using a 3–8% Tris-acetate protein gel (Invitrogen). Similar results were obtained in three different experiments.In Vitro Protein–Protein Interaction. Mouse anti-GST (catalog #MA4-004; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or mouse Penta-HIS (Qiagen 34660) antibodies were bound to Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. To avoid coelution of the antibodies, we treated the beads with BS3 (Thermo Scientific) cross-linking agent. Beads and antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, treated with 1 M Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, quenching buffer, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes, the different protein combinations were added. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed three times with PBS buffer containing protease inhibitors, and bound proteins were eluted by 5-min denaturation at 90 °C in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved in 10% acrylamide gels or 3–8% Tris-acetate protein gels (Invitrogen).Supplementary Material Supplementary File pnas.1807763115.sapp.pdf (2.5MB, pdf) Acknowledgments We thank J.

    "title": "REGULATOR OF BULB BIOGENESIS1 (RBB1) Is Involved in Vacuole Bulb Formation in Arabidopsis.",
    "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411111/",
    "abstract": "Abstract Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole morphology. We characterized regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 (rbb1-1), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control. rbb1-1 mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes. RBB1 is involved in the regulation of vacuole morphology and may be involved in the establishment or stability of trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs.",
    "introduction": "Introduction The lytic vacuole in vegetative cells may occupy more 90% of the cell volume. This essential organelle is highly dynamic and has critical functions in cellular homeostasis, maintenance of turgor, storage and recycling [1–3]. Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant membrane fluctuations and transient and highly mobile structures such as trans-vacuolar strands (TVS), sheets and bulbs [4, 5]. TVS are dynamic tubules delimited by the tonoplast that are thought to distribute cytoplasmic contents, including organelles between opposite sides of the cortical cytoskeleton [6]. In root hairs of Hydrocharis dubia, TVS form predomindantly along the tip growing axis and are thought to deliver cytosolic components to the growing tip [7, 8]. Many TVS sorrounding the phragmoplast were also observed in tobacco BY-2 cells during cell division [9]. The actin cytoskeleton has been localized to TVS [10], and disruption of actin filaments results in their dissasembly [11]. Similarly, microinjection of antiserum against two actin-binding proteins of the villin group disrupted the TVS in root hair cells of H. dubia [7, 12]. The current model for TVS formation is that the actomyosin system regulates TVS formation and dynamics [13, 14]. Bulbs are spherical structures of diameters between 1 and 10 μm that are highly dynamic in the lumen of the vacuole. These membrane structures are associated with the outer tonoplast membrane or transvacuolar strands and contain cytoplasmic structures, even organelles, between the folded membranes [5, 15]. Imaging by electron microscopy has indicated that bulbs are formed by multiple layers of tonoplast membranes, which explains the increased intensity of bulbs in fluorescently labeled tonoplasts [15]. Bulbs are present in LVs of cotyledon and leaf epidermis and their numbers decrease during cotyledon expansion [15], and leaf maturation [16]. Bulbs have been visualized by fluorescencence microscopy of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions with several tonoplast proteins and in multiple cell types. For example, in vacuoles of tobacco leaves, bulbs were observed when GFP-VAM3/SYP22 [17] or a GFP fusion with the phosphate transporter NPT2 [18] were transiently expressed. In Arabidopsis, bulbs have been detected in epidermis of the root elongation zone and the leaf, sepal bundle sheet, and germinating pollen of stably transformed plants expressing either GFP-AtVAM3 [5], TPK1-GFP [19, 20], TIP1;1-GFP [21], or FP fusions with other tonoplast intrinsic proteins [16, 22]. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate sensor 2xFYVE-YFP also labels the bulbs [23]. These structures are not simply the result of ectopic expression of FP fusions because they were also detected in Arabidopsis WT plants by electron microscopy [15]. It was recently proposed that bulbs may form by dimerization of GFP or YFP tags when fused to tonoplast markers, and that some of these structures may be artifacts from this interaction [24]. Two types of structures were distinguished: bulbs associated with high levels of expression of GFP fusions that showed 3 or more fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the tonoplast, and “intra-vacuolar spherical structures” (IVSPs) present in transgenic lines in which the intensity of fluorescence was only two fold that of the tonoplast and were visualized with a non-dimerizing GFP molecule. This distinction was most dramatic in the root elongation zone where only very bright bulbs were observed, but it was more complex in other tissues, such as the cotyledon epidermis, where both types of structures existed [24]. Two hypotheses for the function of bulbs have been proposed. Bulbs may act as reservoirs of membranes for cell expansion or they may represent the first step for proteolysis of tonoplast proteins inside the vacuole [15, 19]. Only two mutants with bulb phenotypes have been identified thus far. These are sgr2-1 and vti11, and in both cases these mutants show a reduced number of bulbs [23]. SGR2 encodes a protein similar to phospholipase A1, and sgr2 mutants have an abnormal vacuole morphology with multiple small vacuole-like structures and abnormal distribution of the vacuole and the cytosol in shoot endodermal cells [25]. VTI11 encodes a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein that mediates membrane fusion between pre-vacuolar compartments and the vacuole [26, 27]. VTI11 is also involved in vacuole homotypic fusion, and vti11 mutant alleles have highly fragmented vacuoles [28]. Given the highly abnormal vacuole morphology of these two mutants, it is unclear if the lack of bulbs is a direct or indirect effect of the loss of SGR2 and VTI11. Here we describe the phenotype of regulator of bulb biogenesis1 (rbb1-1), a novel mutant in Arabidopsis that displays increased numbers of bulbs in otherwise normal vacuoles. We show that rbb1-1 mutants make fewer TVS than the parental control. We propose the hypothesis that RBB1 may function in TVS formation and that increased bulb accumulation in rbb1-1 may result from impaired formation of TVS. In addition, we show that the differential labeling of bulbs between rbb1-1 and the parental line does not result from abnormal trafficking to the vacuole. We also identified RBB1 locus, which encodes a large plant-specific protein of unknown function.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Plant Material and Growth Conditions The parental line carrying GFP-TIP2;1 and mCherry-HDEL [29], and the marker lines TIP1;1-YFP [16] and SYP22-RFP [30] were previously described. SALK_095160, SALK_067590 and SALK_074387 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR. pUBQ10::RFP-TIP1;1 was generated by Gateway cloning (Invitrogen). Briefly, the TIP1;1 CDS was amplified from Col-0 cDNA by PCR and the amplicon was introduced into pENTR-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). A RFP-TIP1;1 expression clone was generated by recombination with pUBN-RFP [31] using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). The promoter of the resulting construct was substituted with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596 bp) from pNIGEL07 (Geldner et al 2009) to generate pUBQ10::RFP-TIP1;1. The RBB1::3xYpet-RBB1 and RBB1::RBB1-3xYpet constructs were generated by a Recombineering-based gene tagging system [32] using the JAtY76M24 clone and the primers listed in S1 Table. After introducing 3xYpet, the JAtY clone was shortened by homologous recombination using \"delleft\" and \"RB-amp\" primers (S1 Table). This resulted in a fragment of the chromosomal region containing 12.8 kb upstream of start codon of RBB1 and up to 5 kb downstream from the stop codon. These constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101 and then transformed into Col-0 wild type plants via floral dip [33]. Seeds were plated on AGM (0.5X MS media and 1% sucrose) with 4 g /L GelRite. For light-grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated for 4 days in the dark to break dormancy and then incubated at 22°C under a 16 h light photoperiod. For dark-grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated in the dark and then incubated at 22°C while covered in aluminum foil. Chemical Stocks and Treatments C834 (ID 6982834) was from Chembridge, Brefeldin A from Sigma and Lysotracker Red and FM4-64 from Invitrogen. All chemicals were dissolved in 100% DMSO and all treatments were carried out with 4-day old seedlings, unless specified. BFA treatment was done in liquid AGM containing 75 μM BFA and for 3 h. C834 treatment was done with 3-d-old seedlings in solid AGM-GelRite supplemented with 55μM C834 for 48 hours as described [29]. For staining, seedlings were incubated in liquid AGM containing 2 μM Lysotracker Red for 2 h or 5 μM FM4-64 for 5 min. Microscopy A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope was used for all imaging experiments. A 40x water objective (1.1 N.A.) was used to image embryos and roots. A 20x objective (0.8 N.A.) was used to image hypocotyls and cotyledons. The excitation/emission wavelengths during acquisition were 488 nm/492–570 nm for GFP and Ypet, 561 nm/588–696 nm for mCherry and RFP, 514 nm/588–700 nm for FM4-64, and 561 nm/566-690 nm for Lysotracker red. To count the number of TVS, seedlings were imaged using a large pinhole to generate 600 μm thick optical sections for hypocotyls and 102 μm sections for cotyledons. A 40X objective was used and image zoom was kept at 0.6. Epidermal cells within the bottom half of the hypocotyl, but excluding the root-shoot junction, were used for TVS counting in hypocotyls. Epidermal cells from the adaxial side were used for cotyledons. TVS were counted in each cell from the collected images. RT-PCR Total mRNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (NEB). cDNA was synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) and was used a template for RT-PCR. Oligo sequences used for PCR are shown in S2 Table and 30 cycles were used for all reactions. Map-based cloning and genome sequencing A mapping population was generated from a cross between rbb1-1 and the Ler wild type background, and segregating homozygous rbb1-1 mutants were identified based on the bulb phenotype. Two Single Sequence Length Polymorphism (SSLP) markers [34] co-segregated with the rbb1-1 phenotype and placed the mutation in Chromosome 5. For SNP detection, 12 homozygous F3 families from 1 backcross to the parental line were selected based on the bulb phenotype and 500 seedlings per family were used to generate DNA libraries. Samples were sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq sequencer as 100 bp reads at BGI (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute). The expected genome coverage was 35X. Data analysis was carried out at the Bioinformatics Consulting and Service Core at North Carolina State University as follows. Sequence reads were aligned to the TAIR10 genome using bowtie2 and variant calls were made using samtools mpileup. Variants were filtered for those located within TAIR10 genes and data was exported to a spreadsheet. Only SNPs located between markers RBCS-B and PINHEAD in Chromosome 5 were analyzed further. From these, mutations that were originally present in the parental line were identified from the sequencing of an unrelated mutant from the same mutagenesis screen. In addition, mutations in introns or UTRs, silent mutations and mutations unlikely to result from EMS mutagenesis were discarded. Western Blot Total proteins were extracted from 7 day-old seedlings. Samples were homogenized in 50mM HEPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 5 mM EDTA, 8% sucrose, 1mM DTT and proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics) in a chilled mortar. The homogenates were spun at 5,000g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was filtered through 3 layers of miracloth. For membrane protein fractions (P100), filtered total proteins were spun at 100,000g for 1 h at 4°C and the pellet was resuspended in buffer. Protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford assay. For immunoblot of 3xYpet-RBB1, 8 μg of proteins were loaded in a NuPAGE 3–8% Tris-Acetate gel (Life Technologies) following manufacturer instructions. The following antibodies were used: anti-GFP (Thermo MA5-15256), anti-cFBase (Agrisera AS04043), anti-H+ATPase (Agrisera AS07260) and anti-calreticulin [35]. Peroxidase-Conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Thermo 32430) or peroxidase-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit (Thermo 32460) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad) using a G:BOX Chemi XRQ system (Syngene) for image capture. Signal was quantified using the GeneTools image analysis software (Syngene).",
    "results": "Results GFP-TIP2;1 labels excess bulbs in regulator of bulb biogenesis1 We recently carried out a screen for mutants in tonoplast protein trafficking and vacuole biogenesis and characterized the function of the VTI11 SNARE protein and phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion [28]. During the course of this work, we identified a mutant in which the tonoplast protein GFP-TIP2;1 labeled many vacuolar bulbs and it was named regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 (rbb1-1). In the parental line, the GFP-TIP2;1 protein labels the tonoplast and very few bulbs in root epidermis and cortex and the epidermis of hypocotyls, cotyledons and rosette leaves (Fig 1A–1D) [16, 28, 36]. In the rbb1-1 mutant, GFP-TIP2;1 also labels the tonoplast, and the size and morphology of the vacuole appeared normal. However, many more bulbs were evident as bright sub-vacuolar structures in multiple tissues (Fig 1E–1H). In hypocotyls, bulbs were observed consistently in many cells in the epidermis and cortex (Fig 1E). Bulbs were also apparent in high numbers in the epidermis of cotyledons and rosette leaves of rbb1-1 (Fig 1F and 1H). Vacuolar bulbs were detected in roots (Fig 1G), but this phenotype was variable amongst different seed stocks and was not characterized further. The variability in the root phenotype may be due to root-specific modifying factors that segregate in the population. No major defects in plant morphology were detected in rbb1-1 homozygous plants (S1 Fig). Sequencing demonstrated that the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene is intact in rbb1-1 and consequently, the bulb phenotype is not related to a mutation in the GFP-TIP2;1 protein sequence. Fig 1. regulator of bulb biogenesis1 contains many bulbs in many cell types. Open in a new tab (a-h) rbb1-1 mutants have more bulbs than the parental line. GFP-TIP2;1 localization in the parental line (WT, a-d) or rbb1-1 (e-h). Four-day-old seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize morphology of the vacuole in the epidermis of hypocotyl (a, e) and cotyledon (b, f), and in root epidermis and cortex (c, g). The bulb phenotype was also observed in rosette leaves of 6-week-old plants (d, h). Scale bar = 20 μm. (i-n) GFP-TIP2;1 and RFP-TIP1;1 co-localize in rbb1-1 bulbs. The hypocotyls of 4-day-old dark-grown seedlings expressing GFP-TIP2;1 (green, i, l) and RFP-TIP1;1 (magenta, j, m) in the parental line (i-k) and rbb1-1 mutants (l-n) are shown. Merged images (k, n) are also shown. Scale bar: 20 μm. (o) rbb1-1 mutants do not accumulate higher levels of GFP-TIP2;1 in seedlings. Immunoblot of GFP-TIP2;1 accumulation in the parental line and rbb1-1 using antibodies against GFP (α-GFP) and Calreticulin (α-CRT) as loading control.TIP1;1-YFP is often found in vacuolar bulbs [16, 23, 37]. In order to determine if the rbb1-1 bulbs accumulate TIP1;1 in a similar manner, we introduced a RFP-TIP1;1 fusion in the rbb1-1 mutant background. In the parental line, RFP-TIP1;1 localized to the tonoplast, and labeled very few bulbs in roots and hypocotyls (Fig 1I–1K). RFP-TIP1;1 co-localized with GFP-TIP2;1 in the tonoplast and the bulbs when the two markers were co-expressed in rbb1-1 (Fig 1L–1N). It was previously proposed that vacuolar bulbs are involved in the degradation of membrane proteins [19] and that bulbs may form as a response to overexpression of dimer-type FP [24]. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 could be caused by enhanced accumulation of GFP-TIP2;1 in rbb1-1 by Western blot. No significant differences in GFP-TIP2;1 protein accumulation were detected between rbb1-1 and the parental control, indicating that the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 is not related to differences in protein accumulation or stability (Fig 1O and S1C Fig). These results overall indicate that, independent on the nature of the bulbs in rbb1-1, the RBB1 locus is required to prevent the formation or accumulation of bulbs in the vacuole. In order to compare rbb1-1 bulbs with the IVSPs and bulbs previously described [24], we measured the maximum intensity values for bulb membranes in rbb1-1. As shown in S2 Fig, maximum intensity values for the bulbs in the parental line are 1.2- and 1.3-fold higher than the outer tonoplast in cotyledons and hypocotyls, respectively. In contrast, rbb1-1 bulbs have 2 fold higher intensity than the tonoplast in hypocotyl, and 3.5-fold higher in cotyledons. Therefore, rbb1-1 bulbs would fit the description of both IVSPs and bulbs [24]. Moreover, given the fact that the GFP-TIP2;1 protein levels in rbb1-1 mutants is similar to the parental line, we conclude that the rbb1-1 bulbs are not simply the result of increased GFP dimerization in the mutant. However, we can not discard the possibility that GFP dimerization acts as an enhancer of the rbb1 phenotype. Given the complexity of these structures, we will refer to them here simply as bulbs. The vacuole membrane in many plant species constantly remodels with the formation of transvacuolar strands (TVS). We then hypothesized that the mechanisms involved in bulb formation and the dynamics of TVS may be related and that RBB1 may have a role in TVS formation. In order to test this possibility, we compared the number of TVS between the parental line and rbb1-1 mutants. In contrast to the parental line, which shows 4.06 ± 0.39 TVS per cell in cotyledon epidermis, rbb1-1 mutants have only 1.40 ± 0.16 (Fig 2A and S3A and S3B Fig). Therefore, rbb1-1 has ~3-fold fewer TVS than the parental line, and this result provides support to a hypothesis that RBB1 is involved in TVS formation. This phenotype was also observed in the hypocotyls of light- and dark-grown seedlings. Thus, the parental line showed an average of 2.2 ± 0.2 TVS per cell in the light and 1.75 ± 0.21 in the dark, while the rbb1-1 mutant had 1.25 ± 0.15 and 1.03 ± 0.19, respectively (Fig 2B). This indicates that rbb1-1 had a 40% reduction in the number of TVS per cell in hypocotyls in both light and dark-grown seedlings. These results point towards important roles of RBB1 in the remodeling of the vacuole that generates either bulbs or TVS. Fig 2. rbb1-1 mutants have fewer transvacuolar strands. Open in a new tab (a) The number of trans-vacuolar strands (TVS) per cell was counted in cotyledon cells from the parental line and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown in the light. n = 48 cells from 8 seedlings. (b) rbb1-1 mutants have fewer TVS in hypocotyl from light- and dark-grown seedlings. Seedlings were germinated in the light or dark for 4 days and TVS were counted. n = 60 cells from 10 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. * Significantly different to the parental line in a t-test (P ≤ 0.05). The rbb1-1 phenotype can be detected 3 days post-germination In order to characterize the developmental progression of the bulb phenotype in rbb1-1, vacuoles were visualized at different times during seed germination (Fig 3A–3J). No bulbs were observed in PSVs of imbibed seeds or 1 d after incubation at 22°C in either the parental line or rbb1-1 (Fig 3A, 3B, 3F and 3G). Bulbs were first detected at day 2 post-germination in both the parental line and rbb1-1 when the large lytic vacuole is already established [16]. The bulbs were very transient in the parental line and very few were observed at 3 days or later. In contrast, the number of bulbs in rbb1-1 continued to increase at days 3 and 4. These results indicate that RBB1 function may be important after day 3, but not during the early stages of germination. Fig 3. Developmental progression of the rbb1-1 phenotype and effects from light. Open in a new tab (a-j) The bulb phenotype is apparent in hypocotyls after 3 d of germination. Germinating seedlings from the parental line (GFP-TIP2;1, a-e) and rbb1-1 mutants (f-j) were imaged after 0–4 days of incubation. (k-n) The bulb phenotype of rbb1-1 is present in light- and dark-grown seedlings. GFP-TIP2;1 localization in hypocotyls was visualized in 4-d-old seedlings from the parental line (WT, k, m) or rbb1-1 (l, n) when grown under light (k, l) or dark (m, n) conditions. n = 36 cells from 6 seedlings. All scale bars = 20 μm. (o) Dark treatment does not alter the rbb1-1 phenotype. The number of bulbs was counted in hypocotyls from parental line and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown in the light or in the dark as in k-n. n = 9–15 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. (p) rbb1-1 hypocotyls have fewer TVS after 3 d of germination. Seedlings were germinated in the light and TVS were counted after 2 days of incubation. n = 50 cells from 5 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. * Significantly different to the parental line in a t-test (P ≤ 0.01).One proposed function of the bulbs is to contribute membranes during cell expansion [15]. This prompted us to investigate whether the rbb1-1 phenotype was affected by conditions that promoted cell expansion such as the elongation of hypocotyls in the dark. To this end, vacuoles from the hypocotyl epidermis of parental and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown either in the light or the dark were imaged in the microscope, and bulbs were counted. While the parental control seedlings grown in the light contain 0.10 ± 0.03 bulbs per 103 μm2 (Fig 3K and 3O), the rbb1-1 mutant contains 1.00 ± 0.16 (Fig 3L and 3O). Therefore, the rbb1-1 mutant contains 10 fold more bulbs per area in hypocotyls when compared to the parental control grown under normal light conditions. Next we analyzed the phenotype of rbb1-1 mutants in the dark. In contrast to the dark-grown parental control, which contains 0.07 ± 0.01 bulbs per 103 μm2 (Fig 3M and 3O), the dark-grown rbb1-1 mutant showed 1.18 ± 0.09 bulbs per 103 μm2 (Fig 3N and 3O), or a 16-fold increase. Thus, the number of bulbs in rbb1-1 was higher than the parental under both light treatments, but light availability did not significantly alter the rbb1-1 phenotype. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs would enhance the elongation rate of dark-grown rbb1-1 seedlings, but no differences in hypocotyl length were detected between the mutant and the parental control at 3 or 5 d (S3C Fig). Furthermore, cell elongation was not affected, as we could not detect significant differences in cell size between the wild type and rbb1-1 hypocotyls when grown in the dark (S3D Fig). Finally, if the RBB1 is responsible for the bulb and TVS phenotypes of rbb1-1, we expected a similar developmental progression, which can be tested by quantification of TVS during germination. TVS could not clearly be detected before day 2, and no significant difference was detected at day 2 between wild type and rbb1-1 hypocotyls when grown in the light (Fig 3P) However, the number of TVS was reduced by 28% in rbb1-1 when compared to the wild type. This reduction was even greater (41%) at day 4. Therefore, the appearance of the bulb phenotype at days 3 and 4 correlates well with the reduction of TVS numbers in rbb1-1. GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking to the vacuole is not altered in rbb1-1 The increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 could be the result of abnormal GFP-TIP2;1 protein trafficking to the vacuole. To test this hypothesis, two inhibitors for tonoplast protein trafficking were used. Brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits a Golgi-dependent pathway for tonoplast proteins in hypocotyls and C834 inhibits a Golgi-independent traffic of GFP-TIP2;1 to the tonoplast [29]. We treated the GFP-TIP2;1 (parental control), the TIP1;1-YFP line and the rbb1-1 mutant with BFA and visualized each fusion protein in hypocotyls. The fusion proteins localized to the tonoplast (GFP-TIP2;1) or tonoplast and bulbs (rbb1-1 and TIP1;1-YFP) in the DMSO control as expected (Fig 4A–4C). In BFA-treated cells, the GFP-TIP2;1 localization was unchanged in the parental control (Fig 4D) or rbb1-1 (Fig 4E), indicating that the trafficking of this protein was still BFA-insensitive. In contrast and consistent with previous reports [29], the TIP1;1-YFP marker line displayed large and bright aggregates in the presence of BFA (Fig 4F). Next we tested sensitivity to C834. GFP-TIP2;1 localized to the tonoplast and did not co-localize with the ER marker mCherry-HDEL in neither the parental line or rbb1-1 (Fig 4G–4I and 4M–4O). In contrast, GFP-TIP2;1 co-localized with the ER marker in C834-treated roots of the parental line (Fig 4J–4L) and rbb1-1 (Fig 4P–4R). Therefore, we conclude that GFP-TIP2;1 traffics in a similar pathway in rbb1-1 and the parental line, at least early in the secretory pathway, and that the bulb-localization of GFP-TIP2;1 in rbb1-1 does not appear to be the result of altered trafficking to the vacuole. Fig 4. GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking to the vacuole is similar between rbb1-1 and the parental line. Open in a new tab (a-f) BFA inhibits trafficking of TIP1;1YFP but not GFP-TIP2;1 in the parental line or rbb1-1. Four-day-old seedlings from the parental (GFP-TIP2;1, a, d), rbb1-1 (b, e) or TIP1;1-YFP (c, f) were exposed to 0.1% DMSO (control, a, b, c) or 75 μM BFA (d, e, f) for 3 hours and hypocotyl cells were imaged. BFA compartments are indicated with arrows. Scale: 20 μm. (g-r) C834 inhibits GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking in the parental line and rbb1-1. Three-day-old seedlings from the parental line and rbb1-1 were exposed to 0.5% DMSO (g-i, m-o) or 55 μM C834 (j-l, p-r) for 48 h, and root cells were imaged in the microscope. Signal from GFP-TIP2;1 (green, g, j, m, p), the ER marker mCherry-HDEL (magenta, h, k, n, p) or the merged image is shown (i, l, o, r). Co-localization of GFP with mCherry-HDEL at the ER is indicated with arrowheads. Scale bar: 20 μm. The RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450 The bulb phenotype of rbb1-1 segregated as 25 out of 96 (1/3.84) in a backcross to the GFP-TIP2;1 parental line, suggesting that the rbb1-1 mutation is recessive. In order to identify the RBB1 locus, we used a combination of map-based cloning and whole genome sequencing. The RBB1 gene mapped to a region of 2.2Mb in Chromosome 5 between markers RBCS-B and PINHEAD. Using Illumina whole-genome sequencing, we identified nucleotide variants in the rbb1-1 mutant genome between these two markers. From those, only two SNPs located within gene coding sequences and corresponding to EMS-type non-silent mutations were detected, in At5g38540 and At5g40450. In order to determine which gene corresponded to the RBB1 locus, we identified Salk T-DNA insertion alleles [38] for both candidate genes. Only one T-DNA line, SALK_095160, for At5g38540 was available, but no homozygote plants could be recovered. Heterozygous plants were crossed to rbb1-1 and the vacuole phenotype of F1 seedlings grown in the dark was analyzed. Out of 27 F1 seedlings, none showed the rbb1-1 bulb phenotype indicating that RBB1 was unlikely to correspond to At5g38540. We obtained two SALK T-DNA alleles for At5g40450 (Fig 5A). However, one of the T-DNA lines, SALK_067590, had a complex transgene insertion and could not be used. We used RT-PCR to determine if At5g40450 was expressed in SALK_074387. The expression of the full length At5g40450 was disrupted in SALK_074387 (Fig 5B), and therefore, this was a good mutant allele to test for the bulb phenotype. However, it is unclear if this allele is a complete loss of function allele because partial transcripts can be detected by RT-PCR. We named this allele rbb1-2. Fig 5. The RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450. Open in a new tab (a) Schematic structure of the RBB1 locus indicating the positions of rbb1 alleles. Exons are indicated as black boxes and introns are indicated as white boxes. 5' and 3' UTRs are indicated in gray. Triangles indicate T-DNA insertions of SALK lines.

(b) Accumulation of RBB1 transcripts as determined by RT-PCR with gene specific primers in seedlings from Col-0 (WT), rbb1-2, the GFP-TIP2;1 parental line and rbb1-1. Three pairs of gene specific primers were used to detect the transcript at the 5' end, middle, and 3' end of the RBB1 gene as indicated in (a). Numbers represent amplicon size. (c-e) Lack of genetic complementation between rbb1-1 and rbb1-2. Hypocotyls of four-day-old dark-grown seedlings from the parental control (WT, c), rbb1-1 (d) and the F1 progeny from a cross between rbb1-1 and rbb1-2 (rbb1-1/rbb1-2 double heterozygotes, e) were imaged by confocal microscopy. Scale bar: 20μm. (f-g) rbb1-2 contains bulbs in a similar manner as rbb1-1. Four-day-old seedlings were stained with 2 μM Lysotracker Red for 2 hours to label the vacuole in Col-0 (WT) and rbb1-2. Bulbs are indicated with arrows. Scale: 20 μm. (h) RBB1 is expressed in many developmental stages. The accumulation of RBB1 transcripts was determined by RT-PCR with gene specific primers in various tissues of 4 and 7-day old Col-0 (WT) plants. Two pairs of gene specific primers detected the 5' end and 3' end of RBB1 gene as indicated in (a).To determine if RBB1 is At5g40450, a complementation test between rbb1-1 and rbb1-2 was carried out. F1 seedlings from a cross between rbb1-1 and homozygous rbb1-2 were incubated in the dark and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for the bulb phenotype. As shown in Fig 5E, the double heterozygote F1 plants display the rbb1 phenotype and indicate the lack of complementation between the two mutant alleles. We were unable to confirm this result in the F2 population as the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene was consistently silenced in the segregating population whenever the SALK insertion was present. This result is consistent with highly silenced transgenes in SALK insertion lines [39]. To confirm the identity of RBB1, we visualized the vacuole morphology of rbb1-2 mutants with Lysotracker Red, a fluorescent dye that stains acidic organelles including plant vacuoles [40] and the tonoplast membrane [41, 42] (S4 Fig). This experiment could only be carried out in cotyledons from light-grown seedlings as penetration of fluorescent dyes in hypocotyls is very poor. Similar to the reduced number of bulbs in the GFP-TIP2;1 line, bulbs were rarely detected in wild type Col-0 cotyledons (Fig 5F and S1 Movie). On the contrary, the rbb1-2 mutant allele showed a similar bulb phenotype as the rbb1-1 mutant with 4–5 vacuolar bulbs per cell in these cells (Fig 5G and S2 Movie). This phenotype also segregated as ~1/4 and therefore rbb1-2 is likely to be recessive. These results confirmed that the RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450 and that the bulb phenotype may be detected in the absence of the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene. At5g40450 encodes a large protein of 2,890 amino acids. The mutation in rbb1-1 is a C/T nucleotide substitution that results in an A1070V substitution in the predicted protein sequence. BLASTp analysis in  identified only two proteins with protein similarity covering at least 40% of the RBB1 protein sequence, CARUB_v10003962mg from Capsella rubella and EUTSA_v10027617mg from Eutrema salsugineum. All other hits (~40) show high similarity to a 75 amino acid region at the C terminus of RBB1. Remarkably, no significant similarity was found outside of plant taxa using BLASTp, which indicates that RBB1 is a plant-specific protein. In addition, no specific domain hits were detected using the Conserved Domain Database search function in  [43], but regions of similarity to three multi-domain structures were detected. Only two proteins were identified with significant similarity to RBB1 in C. rubella and E. salsugineum. RBB1 belongs to the putative Plant Model Organism Orthologous Group APK_ORTHOMCL5144, which includes genes from Rice, Poplar, Sorghum, Maize, and Brachypodium (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ortholog_group_apk.pl). This group is also supported by gene family clustering of orthologous genes in Phytozome (www.phytozome.net) [44]. The putative orthologs also encode very large proteins (up to 3,715 aa). One of the putative orthologs, Ricinus communis gene 29917.t000066, contains a 32 amino acid region that is 32% identical to the microtubule-associated protein futsch in Drosophila melanogaster. These results overall indicate that RBB1 is a novel plant-specific protein with unknown molecular function. In order to determine the spatial and temporal expression of RBB1, the accumulation of RBB1 transcripts was analyzed by RT-PCR in Col-0 wild type plants. RBB1 accumulated at similar levels in 4- and 7-day-old light-grown seedlings, and in rosette leaves and inflorescences (Fig 5H). These results are consistent with publicly available databases for At5g40450. According to Arabidopsis eFP browser [45], RBB1 is expressed in leaves and roots of both seedlings and mature plants, flowers and all stages of embryo development. Seedlings treated for 12 h with ABA, heat, cold and osmotic stress have decreased levels of RBB1 transcripts [45, 46]. In contrast, 3 h treatment with photosystem II inhibitor N-octyl-3-nitro-2,4,6-trihydroxybenzamide (PNO8) or the brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor brassinazole 220 resulted in a 2-fold induction of RBB1 [47]. These results indicate that RBB1 may have important functions in multiple developmental stages. The RBB1 transcript accumulation was also analyzed in the parental line and rbb1-1, but no differences in the expression level were detected (Fig 5B). Therefore, the rbb1-1 mutation did not affect the expression of RBB1 at the transcriptional level. RBB1 is a cytosolic protein In order to characterize the function of RBB1, a fluorescent protein (FP) fusion was generated to visualize its protein localization. Given the large size of the RBB1 coding sequence, we used Recombineering [32] to generate a FP fusion with RBB1 driven by its own promoter and other regulatory sequences. This system utilizes homologous recombination with TAC clones to fuse the gene encoding 3xYpet (YFP for energy transfer), a bright variation of YFP [48], to the gene of interest within the native genomic context. Both N- and C-terminal fusions of RBB1 with 3xYpet were generated and introduced into Col-0 wild type. We could not detect fluorescence in RBB1-3xYpet lines after selection of 15 independent transformants. However, 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in cotyledon epidermal cells, root cortical cells and, although very faint, in the cortex of hypocotyls of light-grown seedlings (S5A and S5B Fig). No Ypet signal was detected at the root tip corresponding to the cell division zone. In order to determine if the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion is functional, we introgressed the transgene into the rbb1-2 allele by crossing. This experiment was carried out in rbb1-2 because the GFP-TIP2;1 marker in rbb1-1 is tightly linked to the RBB1 locus and the probability of identifying rbb1-1 segregants without GFP-TIP2;1 was very low. In contrast to rbb1-2 seedlings stained with Lysotracker red, which showed many bulbs in cotyledons (Fig 6A), rbb1-2 seedlings expressing the 3xYpet-RBB1 protein have vacuole morphology very similar to the wild type (Fig 6B and 6C). Therefore, the 3xYpet-RBB1 construct complements the bulb phenotype of rbb1-2 indicating that this fusion protein is functional. Fig 6. 3xYpet-RBB1 is a cytoplasmic protein that associates with the tonoplast. Open in a new tab (a-c) A 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion complements the bulb phenotype of rbb1-2. Four-day-old seedlings from rbb1-2 (a) or rbb1-2 3xYpet-RBB1 (b, c) were stained with Lysotracker Red (magenta, a, b) to label the vacuole.

Arrowheads indicate the localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 at the tip of elongating trans-vacuolar strands. (m-o) GFP molecules can also label the tips of transvacuolar strands.

All scale bars = 20 μm. (p) 3xYpet-RBB1 accumulates in the soluble (S100) and membrane pellet (P100) fractions from whole seedlings. Immunoblot of 3xYpet-RBB1 soluble (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions from Col-0 and 3xYpet-RBB1 transgenic plants using antibodies against GFP (α-GFP), cFBPase (α-cFBPase, control for soluble fraction), and Plasma Membrane H+ATPase (α-H+ATPase, control for membrane fraction).The localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 was diffuse and suggestive of cytosolic localization in cotyledons of 7-day-old seedlings (Fig 6D). In order to determine its sub-cellular distribution in detail, we tested for co-localization between 3xYpet-RBB1 and the plasma membrane dye FM4-64, a marker for the tonoplast, RFP-SYP22 [30], and the vacuole dye Lysotracker Red. The 3xYpet-RBB1 marker does not co-localize with FM4-64 (Fig 6D–6F) or with RFP-SYP22 (Fig 6G–6I). The marker was found in the cytosol and did not co-localize with Lysotracker Red (Fig 6J–6L), even though occasionally there was good co-localization between these two signals (S5C–S5E Fig). These results indicate 3xYpet-RBB1 protein is most likely a soluble protein that accumulates in the cytosol. We also detected 3xYpet-RBB1 in a punctate pattern inside the vacuole that seemed to correspond to the tip of TVS labeled with Lysotracker Red in confocal images (Fig 6J–6L). Interestingly, 3xYpet-RBB1 remained associated with the tip during the elongation of those TVS (S5F Fig) in a similar manner as actin bundles [49]. These TVS structures may represent cross-sections of membrane sheets that transverse the vacuole, as previously proposed [10, 49]. In order to determine the significance of this localization, we compared it to the localization of a soluble GFP marker in the same manner. As shown in Fig 6M–6O, a simple GFP marker can also label the tip of TVS, and therefore, the punctate localization of RBB1 may simply result from accumulation of cytoplasmic proteins at the tip of emerging TVS. Immunoblot analysis was used to confirm that the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion protein accumulates as the expected size of ~400 kDa in seedlings. Membrane and soluble fractions were isolated from wild type Col-0 and the 3xYpet-RBB1 line and the fusion protein was detected with an anti-GFP antibody. The cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBPase) and plasma membrane H+ATPase were used as soluble and membrane protein controls, respectively. 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in both the soluble (S100) and the membrane (P100) fractions in 4 days-old seedlings (Fig 6L and S6 Fig). These results overall indicate that 3xYpet-RBB1 is a large soluble protein that is likely to associate with cellular membranes.",
    "discussion": "Discussion We have identified rbb1-1, a novel mutant with defects in vacuole morphology. Vacuoles in rbb1-1 contain increased numbers of bulbs in the large central vacuole of cotyledons and hypocotyl cells when compared to the parental control. These defined vacuolar sub-structures can be visualized with fluorescent protein markers for the tonoplast [15, 23]. It was recently proposed that bulbs, specially when they have more than double the intensity of fluorescence when compared to the tonoplast, are artifacts that result from GFP dimerization that stabilizes the adhesion of tonoplast membranes [24]. This model, however, does not explain the accumulation of bulbs in the 2xFYVE-YFP line in which the fusion protein associates with the membrane in a reversible manner by binding to a specific phosphoinositide [15, 23, 50]. The GFP-TIP2;1-labeled bulbs in rbb1-1 showed between 2 and 3.5-fold higher fluorescence intensity when compared to the tonoplast, indicating that they are likely to have a similar structure as previously characterized IVPS and bulbs [15, 23, 24]. We can not discard the possibility that the GFP fusion enhances the stability of the bulbs in rbb1-1, but rbb1 mutant alleles comprise a sensitized genetic background for studying the formation and regulation of these structures, which are quite elusive under normal conditions. The two other mutants that have been identified as having abnormal bulb accumulation, sgr2 and vti11, have fewer bulbs, also have very abnormal vacuole morphology [23, 25, 28]. Hence, rbb1-1 is a unique tool to characterize the structure and function of the bulbs in the absence of other vacuolar defects. RBB1 encodes a very large protein with unknown molecular function. In order to determine the function of RBB1, we generated a 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion protein under the control of the RBB1 promoter. This construct complemented the rbb1-2 mutant phenotype indicating that the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion is functional. In seedlings, 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in the root in the elongation and differentiation zones, but not in the cell division zone, and in hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells. Therefore, 3xYpet-RBB1 accumulates in cells that contain a large lytic vacuole [51], consistent with a role of RBB1 in regulating the morphology of this important organelle. Confocal scanning laser microscopy with the 3xYpet-RBB1 line indicated that this protein accumulates in the cytosol, and that in a few instances also co-localizes with Lysotracker red, a fluorescent dye that labels the tonoplast. RBB1 was found both in the soluble and membrane fractions by fractionation experiments, which raises the possibility that RBB1 may associate with membranes. 3xYpet-RBB1 was often present at the tips of elongating TVS in cotyledons and leaves, but visualization of a GFP control indicated that this localization may be detected some times with other cytosolic proteins. We detected a significant decrease in the number of TVS in rbb1-1 mutants both in light- and dark-grown hypocotyls and in cotyledons of light-grown seedlings. The TVS phenotype of rbb1-1 supports the hypothesis that RBB1 functions in the formation or stability of TVS. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that both the bulb phenotype and the reduced TVS phenotype can be detected at day 3 during germination. TVS are very dynamic structures that require the actomyosin cytoskeleton [4, 5, 14, 49], and are thought redistribute cytoplasmic contents or to enhance the structural stability of the cytoskeleton [14]. A potential role of RBB1 in TVS formation is consistent with the expression of 3xYpet-RBB1 in cells that contain a large vacuole. Given the localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 to the cytosol and its accumulation in both the soluble and membrane fractions, it is tempting to speculate that RBB1 interacts with the tonoplast during the formation and elongation of TVS and contributes to the remodeling of the vacuolar membrane. However, more experiments beyond the scope of this work are needed to test this possibility. Moreover, we speculate that the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 results from its inability to form functional TVS. Therefore, we propose an alternative model for bulb biogenesis in which a bulb forms when a TVS initiates but fails to elongate and the bulb functions as a mean to accommodate tonoplast membranes and cytoskeletal proteins that may have accumulated at the initiation site, until the bulb membrane is reabsorbed back into the tonoplast. It follows that the bulbs may have no specific function in the vacuole other than the transient accumulation of membranes and proteins when TVS failed to elongate. Further characterization of the function of RBB1 and interacting partners may shed light in the mechanisms that remodel the vacuole membrane into TVS or bulbs. Unlike the effects of GFP dimerization in vacuole morphology after fusion with vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase [24], it is unlikely that GFP dimerization plays a big role in the TVS phenotype of rbb1. While the bulb fluorescence intensity for cotyledons was 3.5 fold higher than that of tonoplast, this ratio is only 2.0 for hypocotyls in rbb1-1, the same tissue that was used to quantify TVS in Fig 2. Therefore, a ratio higher than 2.0 is not necessary in rbb1-1 to induce the accumulation of bulbs or a reduction in TVS. Previously proposed functions of vacuolar bulbs include acting as a tonoplast reservoir for rapid growth or serving as the sites of degradation of tonoplast membrane and proteins (Saito et al. 2002 and Maîtrejean et al. 2011). We tested one of these hypotheses by measuring the hypocotyl growth of rbb1-1 in the dark, a condition that promotes cell elongation. However, no obvious growth differences were observed between rbb1-1 and the parental line. One possibility is that the additional tonoplast membranes contained in rbb1-1 bulbs do not contribute to cell elongation. Alternatively, other factors such as the elasticity of the cell wall [49] may be limiting and would prevent us from detecting a difference in this assay. The RBB1 gene is expressed in seedlings and adult plants both in shoots and roots. That RBB1 is expressed as a full-length transcript of 8,957 bp is supported by several ESTs as well as the alignment of RNAseq reads spanning the entire coding sequence by the Integrated Genome Browser [52, 53]. The molecular function of RBB1 is unknown as the protein has no conserved domains, and it represents a new plant-specific protein. The identification of proteins that interact with RBB1 may shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which RBB1 could regulate the morphology of the vacuole.",

Copyright notice ID: 4411111 PMID: 25915922 Abstract Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole morphology. We characterized regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 (rbb1-1), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control. rbb1-1 mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes. RBB1 is involved in the regulation of vacuole morphology and may be involved in the establishment or stability of trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs.Introduction The lytic vacuole in vegetative cells may occupy more 90% of the cell volume. This essential organelle is highly dynamic and has critical functions in cellular homeostasis, maintenance of turgor, storage and recycling [1–3]. Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant membrane fluctuations and transient and highly mobile structures such as trans-vacuolar strands (TVS), sheets and bulbs [4, 5]. TVS are dynamic tubules delimited by the tonoplast that are thought to distribute cytoplasmic contents, including organelles between opposite sides of the cortical cytoskeleton [6]. In root hairs of Hydrocharis dubia, TVS form predomindantly along the tip growing axis and are thought to deliver cytosolic components to the growing tip [7, 8]. Many TVS sorrounding the phragmoplast were also observed in tobacco BY-2 cells during cell division [9]. The actin cytoskeleton has been localized to TVS [10], and disruption of actin filaments results in their dissasembly [11]. Similarly, microinjection of antiserum against two actin-binding proteins of the villin group disrupted the TVS in root hair cells of H. dubia [7, 12]. The current model for TVS formation is that the actomyosin system regulates TVS formation and dynamics [13, 14]. Bulbs are spherical structures of diameters between 1 and 10 μm that are highly dynamic in the lumen of the vacuole. These membrane structures are associated with the outer tonoplast membrane or transvacuolar strands and contain cytoplasmic structures, even organelles, between the folded membranes [5, 15]. Imaging by electron microscopy has indicated that bulbs are formed by multiple layers of tonoplast membranes, which explains the increased intensity of bulbs in fluorescently labeled tonoplasts [15]. Bulbs are present in LVs of cotyledon and leaf epidermis and their numbers decrease during cotyledon expansion [15], and leaf maturation [16]. Bulbs have been visualized by fluorescencence microscopy of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions with several tonoplast proteins and in multiple cell types. For example, in vacuoles of tobacco leaves, bulbs were observed when GFP-VAM3/SYP22 [17] or a GFP fusion with the phosphate transporter NPT2 [18] were transiently expressed. In Arabidopsis, bulbs have been detected in epidermis of the root elongation zone and the leaf, sepal bundle sheet, and germinating pollen of stably transformed plants expressing either GFP-AtVAM3 [5], TPK1-GFP [19, 20], TIP1;1-GFP [21], or FP fusions with other tonoplast intrinsic proteins [16, 22]. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate sensor 2xFYVE-YFP also labels the bulbs [23]. These structures are not simply the result of ectopic expression of FP fusions because they were also detected in Arabidopsis WT plants by electron microscopy [15]. It was recently proposed that bulbs may form by dimerization of GFP or YFP tags when fused to tonoplast markers, and that some of these structures may be artifacts from this interaction [24]. Two types of structures were distinguished: bulbs associated with high levels of expression of GFP fusions that showed 3 or more fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the tonoplast, and “intra-vacuolar spherical structures” (IVSPs) present in transgenic lines in which the intensity of fluorescence was only two fold that of the tonoplast and were visualized with a non-dimerizing GFP molecule. This distinction was most dramatic in the root elongation zone where only very bright bulbs were observed, but it was more complex in other tissues, such as the cotyledon epidermis, where both types of structures existed [24]. Two hypotheses for the function of bulbs have been proposed. Bulbs may act as reservoirs of membranes for cell expansion or they may represent the first step for proteolysis of tonoplast proteins inside the vacuole [15, 19]. Only two mutants with bulb phenotypes have been identified thus far. These are sgr2-1 and vti11, and in both cases these mutants show a reduced number of bulbs [23]. SGR2 encodes a protein similar to phospholipase A1, and sgr2 mutants have an abnormal vacuole morphology with multiple small vacuole-like structures and abnormal distribution of the vacuole and the cytosol in shoot endodermal cells [25]. VTI11 encodes a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein that mediates membrane fusion between pre-vacuolar compartments and the vacuole [26, 27]. VTI11 is also involved in vacuole homotypic fusion, and vti11 mutant alleles have highly fragmented vacuoles [28]. Given the highly abnormal vacuole morphology of these two mutants, it is unclear if the lack of bulbs is a direct or indirect effect of the loss of SGR2 and VTI11. Here we describe the phenotype of regulator of bulb biogenesis1 (rbb1-1), a novel mutant in Arabidopsis that displays increased numbers of bulbs in otherwise normal vacuoles. We show that rbb1-1 mutants make fewer TVS than the parental control. We propose the hypothesis that RBB1 may function in TVS formation and that increased bulb accumulation in rbb1-1 may result from impaired formation of TVS. In addition, we show that the differential labeling of bulbs between rbb1-1 and the parental line does not result from abnormal trafficking to the vacuole. We also identified RBB1 locus, which encodes a large plant-specific protein of unknown function.Materials and Methods Plant Material and Growth Conditions The parental line carrying GFP-TIP2;1 and mCherry-HDEL [29], and the marker lines TIP1;1-YFP [16] and SYP22-RFP [30] were previously described. SALK_095160, SALK_067590 and SALK_074387 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR. pUBQ10::RFP-TIP1;1 was generated by Gateway cloning (Invitrogen). Briefly, the TIP1;1 CDS was amplified from Col-0 cDNA by PCR and the amplicon was introduced into pENTR-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). A RFP-TIP1;1 expression clone was generated by recombination with pUBN-RFP [31] using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). The promoter of the resulting construct was substituted with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596 bp) from pNIGEL07 (Geldner et al 2009) to generate pUBQ10::RFP-TIP1;1. The RBB1::3xYpet-RBB1 and RBB1::RBB1-3xYpet constructs were generated by a Recombineering-based gene tagging system [32] using the JAtY76M24 clone and the primers listed in S1 Table. After introducing 3xYpet, the JAtY clone was shortened by homologous recombination using \"delleft\" and \"RB-amp\" primers (S1 Table). This resulted in a fragment of the chromosomal region containing 12.8 kb upstream of start codon of RBB1 and up to 5 kb downstream from the stop codon. These constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101 and then transformed into Col-0 wild type plants via floral dip [33]. Seeds were plated on AGM (0.5X MS media and 1% sucrose) with 4 g /L GelRite. For light-grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated for 4 days in the dark to break dormancy and then incubated at 22°C under a 16 h light photoperiod. For dark-grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated in the dark and then incubated at 22°C while covered in aluminum foil.Chemical Stocks and Treatments C834 (ID 6982834) was from Chembridge, Brefeldin A from Sigma and Lysotracker Red and FM4-64 from Invitrogen. All chemicals were dissolved in 100% DMSO and all treatments were carried out with 4-day old seedlings, unless specified. BFA treatment was done in liquid AGM containing 75 μM BFA and for 3 h. C834 treatment was done with 3-d-old seedlings in solid AGM-GelRite supplemented with 55μM C834 for 48 hours as described [29]. For staining, seedlings were incubated in liquid AGM containing 2 μM Lysotracker Red for 2 h or 5 μM FM4-64 for 5 min.Microscopy A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope was used for all imaging experiments. A 40x water objective (1.1 N.A.) was used to image embryos and roots. A 20x objective (0.8 N.A.) was used to image hypocotyls and cotyledons. The excitation/emission wavelengths during acquisition were 488 nm/492–570 nm for GFP and Ypet, 561 nm/588–696 nm for mCherry and RFP, 514 nm/588–700 nm for FM4-64, and 561 nm/566-690 nm for Lysotracker red. To count the number of TVS, seedlings were imaged using a large pinhole to generate 600 μm thick optical sections for hypocotyls and 102 μm sections for cotyledons. A 40X objective was used and image zoom was kept at 0.6. Epidermal cells within the bottom half of the hypocotyl, but excluding the root-shoot junction, were used for TVS counting in hypocotyls. Epidermal cells from the adaxial side were used for cotyledons. TVS were counted in each cell from the collected images.RT-PCR Total mRNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (NEB). cDNA was synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) and was used a template for RT-PCR. Oligo sequences used for PCR are shown in S2 Table and 30 cycles were used for all reactions.Map-based cloning and genome sequencing A mapping population was generated from a cross between rbb1-1 and the Ler wild type background, and segregating homozygous rbb1-1 mutants were identified based on the bulb phenotype. Two Single Sequence Length Polymorphism (SSLP) markers [34] co-segregated with the rbb1-1 phenotype and placed the mutation in Chromosome 5. For SNP detection, 12 homozygous F3 families from 1 backcross to the parental line were selected based on the bulb phenotype and 500 seedlings per family were used to generate DNA libraries. Samples were sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq sequencer as 100 bp reads at BGI (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute). The expected genome coverage was 35X. Data analysis was carried out at the Bioinformatics Consulting and Service Core at North Carolina State University as follows. Sequence reads were aligned to the TAIR10 genome using bowtie2 and variant calls were made using samtools mpileup. Variants were filtered for those located within TAIR10 genes and data was exported to a spreadsheet. Only SNPs located between markers RBCS-B and PINHEAD in Chromosome 5 were analyzed further. From these, mutations that were originally present in the parental line were identified from the sequencing of an unrelated mutant from the same mutagenesis screen. In addition, mutations in introns or UTRs, silent mutations and mutations unlikely to result from EMS mutagenesis were discarded.Western Blot Total proteins were extracted from 7 day-old seedlings. Samples were homogenized in 50mM HEPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 5 mM EDTA, 8% sucrose, 1mM DTT and proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics) in a chilled mortar. The homogenates were spun at 5,000g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was filtered through 3 layers of miracloth. For membrane protein fractions (P100), filtered total proteins were spun at 100,000g for 1 h at 4°C and the pellet was resuspended in buffer. Protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford assay. For immunoblot of 3xYpet-RBB1, 8 μg of proteins were loaded in a NuPAGE 3–8% Tris-Acetate gel (Life Technologies) following manufacturer instructions. The following antibodies were used: anti-GFP (Thermo MA5-15256), anti-cFBase (Agrisera AS04043), anti-H+ATPase (Agrisera AS07260) and anti-calreticulin [35]. Peroxidase-Conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Thermo 32430) or peroxidase-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit (Thermo 32460) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad) using a G:BOX Chemi XRQ system (Syngene) for image capture. Signal was quantified using the GeneTools image analysis software (Syngene).Results GFP-TIP2;1 labels excess bulbs in regulator of bulb biogenesis1 We recently carried out a screen for mutants in tonoplast protein trafficking and vacuole biogenesis and characterized the function of the VTI11 SNARE protein and phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion [28]. During the course of this work, we identified a mutant in which the tonoplast protein GFP-TIP2;1 labeled many vacuolar bulbs and it was named regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 (rbb1-1). In the parental line, the GFP-TIP2;1 protein labels the tonoplast and very few bulbs in root epidermis and cortex and the epidermis of hypocotyls, cotyledons and rosette leaves (Fig 1A–1D) [16, 28, 36]. In the rbb1-1 mutant, GFP-TIP2;1 also labels the tonoplast, and the size and morphology of the vacuole appeared normal. However, many more bulbs were evident as bright sub-vacuolar structures in multiple tissues (Fig 1E–1H). In hypocotyls, bulbs were observed consistently in many cells in the epidermis and cortex (Fig 1E). Bulbs were also apparent in high numbers in the epidermis of cotyledons and rosette leaves of rbb1-1 (Fig 1F and 1H). Vacuolar bulbs were detected in roots (Fig 1G), but this phenotype was variable amongst different seed stocks and was not characterized further. The variability in the root phenotype may be due to root-specific modifying factors that segregate in the population. No major defects in plant morphology were detected in rbb1-1 homozygous plants (S1 Fig). Sequencing demonstrated that the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene is intact in rbb1-1 and consequently, the bulb phenotype is not related to a mutation in the GFP-TIP2;1 protein sequence. Fig 1. regulator of bulb biogenesis1 contains many bulbs in many cell types. Open in a new tab (a-h) rbb1-1 mutants have more bulbs than the parental line. GFP-TIP2;1 localization in the parental line (WT, a-d) or rbb1-1 (e-h). Four-day-old seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize morphology of the vacuole in the epidermis of hypocotyl (a, e) and cotyledon (b, f), and in root epidermis and cortex (c, g). The bulb phenotype was also observed in rosette leaves of 6-week-old plants (d, h). Scale bar = 20 μm. (i-n) GFP-TIP2;1 and RFP-TIP1;1 co-localize in rbb1-1 bulbs. The hypocotyls of 4-day-old dark-grown seedlings expressing GFP-TIP2;1 (green, i, l) and RFP-TIP1;1 (magenta, j, m) in the parental line (i-k) and rbb1-1 mutants (l-n) are shown. Merged images (k, n) are also shown. Scale bar: 20 μm. (o) rbb1-1 mutants do not accumulate higher levels of GFP-TIP2;1 in seedlings. Immunoblot of GFP-TIP2;1 accumulation in the parental line and rbb1-1 using antibodies against GFP (α-GFP) and Calreticulin (α-CRT) as loading control.TIP1;1-YFP is often found in vacuolar bulbs [16, 23, 37]. In order to determine if the rbb1-1 bulbs accumulate TIP1;1 in a similar manner, we introduced a RFP-TIP1;1 fusion in the rbb1-1 mutant background. In the parental line, RFP-TIP1;1 localized to the tonoplast, and labeled very few bulbs in roots and hypocotyls (Fig 1I–1K). RFP-TIP1;1 co-localized with GFP-TIP2;1 in the tonoplast and the bulbs when the two markers were co-expressed in rbb1-1 (Fig 1L–1N). It was previously proposed that vacuolar bulbs are involved in the degradation of membrane proteins [19] and that bulbs may form as a response to overexpression of dimer-type FP [24]. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 could be caused by enhanced accumulation of GFP-TIP2;1 in rbb1-1 by Western blot. No significant differences in GFP-TIP2;1 protein accumulation were detected between rbb1-1 and the parental control, indicating that the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 is not related to differences in protein accumulation or stability (Fig 1O and S1C Fig). These results overall indicate that, independent on the nature of the bulbs in rbb1-1, the RBB1 locus is required to prevent the formation or accumulation of bulbs in the vacuole. In order to compare rbb1-1 bulbs with the IVSPs and bulbs previously described [24], we measured the maximum intensity values for bulb membranes in rbb1-1. As shown in S2 Fig, maximum intensity values for the bulbs in the parental line are 1.2- and 1.3-fold higher than the outer tonoplast in cotyledons and hypocotyls, respectively. In contrast, rbb1-1 bulbs have 2 fold higher intensity than the tonoplast in hypocotyl, and 3.5-fold higher in cotyledons. Therefore, rbb1-1 bulbs would fit the description of both IVSPs and bulbs [24]. Moreover, given the fact that the GFP-TIP2;1 protein levels in rbb1-1 mutants is similar to the parental line, we conclude that the rbb1-1 bulbs are not simply the result of increased GFP dimerization in the mutant. However, we can not discard the possibility that GFP dimerization acts as an enhancer of the rbb1 phenotype. Given the complexity of these structures, we will refer to them here simply as bulbs. The vacuole membrane in many plant species constantly remodels with the formation of transvacuolar strands (TVS). We then hypothesized that the mechanisms involved in bulb formation and the dynamics of TVS may be related and that RBB1 may have a role in TVS formation. In order to test this possibility, we compared the number of TVS between the parental line and rbb1-1 mutants. In contrast to the parental line, which shows 4.06 ± 0.39 TVS per cell in cotyledon epidermis, rbb1-1 mutants have only 1.40 ± 0.16 (Fig 2A and S3A and S3B Fig). Therefore, rbb1-1 has ~3-fold fewer TVS than the parental line, and this result provides support to a hypothesis that RBB1 is involved in TVS formation. This phenotype was also observed in the hypocotyls of light- and dark-grown seedlings. Thus, the parental line showed an average of 2.2 ± 0.2 TVS per cell in the light and 1.75 ± 0.21 in the dark, while the rbb1-1 mutant had 1.25 ± 0.15 and 1.03 ± 0.19, respectively (Fig 2B). This indicates that rbb1-1 had a 40% reduction in the number of TVS per cell in hypocotyls in both light and dark-grown seedlings. These results point towards important roles of RBB1 in the remodeling of the vacuole that generates either bulbs or TVS. Fig 2. rbb1-1 mutants have fewer transvacuolar strands. Open in a new tab (a) The number of trans-vacuolar strands (TVS) per cell was counted in cotyledon cells from the parental line and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown in the light. n = 48 cells from 8 seedlings. (b) rbb1-1 mutants have fewer TVS in hypocotyl from light- and dark-grown seedlings. Seedlings were germinated in the light or dark for 4 days and TVS were counted. n = 60 cells from 10 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. * Significantly different to the parental line in a t-test (P ≤ 0.05).The rbb1-1 phenotype can be detected 3 days post-germination In order to characterize the developmental progression of the bulb phenotype in rbb1-1, vacuoles were visualized at different times during seed germination (Fig 3A–3J). No bulbs were observed in PSVs of imbibed seeds or 1 d after incubation at 22°C in either the parental line or rbb1-1 (Fig 3A, 3B, 3F and 3G). Bulbs were first detected at day 2 post-germination in both the parental line and rbb1-1 when the large lytic vacuole is already established [16]. The bulbs were very transient in the parental line and very few were observed at 3 days or later. In contrast, the number of bulbs in rbb1-1 continued to increase at days 3 and 4. These results indicate that RBB1 function may be important after day 3, but not during the early stages of germination. Fig 3. Developmental progression of the rbb1-1 phenotype and effects from light. Open in a new tab (a-j) The bulb phenotype is apparent in hypocotyls after 3 d of germination. Germinating seedlings from the parental line (GFP-TIP2;1, a-e) and rbb1-1 mutants (f-j) were imaged after 0–4 days of incubation. (k-n) The bulb phenotype of rbb1-1 is present in light- and dark-grown seedlings. GFP-TIP2;1 localization in hypocotyls was visualized in 4-d-old seedlings from the parental line (WT, k, m) or rbb1-1 (l, n) when grown under light (k, l) or dark (m, n) conditions. n = 36 cells from 6 seedlings. All scale bars = 20 μm. (o) Dark treatment does not alter the rbb1-1 phenotype. The number of bulbs was counted in hypocotyls from parental line and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown in the light or in the dark as in k-n. n = 9–15 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. (p) rbb1-1 hypocotyls have fewer TVS after 3 d of germination. Seedlings were germinated in the light and TVS were counted after 2 days of incubation. n = 50 cells from 5 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. * Significantly different to the parental line in a t-test (P ≤ 0.01).One proposed function of the bulbs is to contribute membranes during cell expansion [15]. This prompted us to investigate whether the rbb1-1 phenotype was affected by conditions that promoted cell expansion such as the elongation of hypocotyls in the dark. To this end, vacuoles from the hypocotyl epidermis of parental and rbb1-1 seedlings that were grown either in the light or the dark were imaged in the microscope, and bulbs were counted. While the parental control seedlings grown in the light contain 0.10 ± 0.03 bulbs per 103 μm2 (Fig 3K and 3O), the rbb1-1 mutant contains 1.00 ± 0.16 (Fig 3L and 3O). Therefore, the rbb1-1 mutant contains 10 fold more bulbs per area in hypocotyls when compared to the parental control grown under normal light conditions. Next we analyzed the phenotype of rbb1-1 mutants in the dark. In contrast to the dark-grown parental control, which contains 0.07 ± 0.01 bulbs per 103 μm2 (Fig 3M and 3O), the dark-grown rbb1-1 mutant showed 1.18 ± 0.09 bulbs per 103 μm2 (Fig 3N and 3O), or a 16-fold increase. Thus, the number of bulbs in rbb1-1 was higher than the parental under both light treatments, but light availability did not significantly alter the rbb1-1 phenotype. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs would enhance the elongation rate of dark-grown rbb1-1 seedlings, but no differences in hypocotyl length were detected between the mutant and the parental control at 3 or 5 d (S3C Fig). Furthermore, cell elongation was not affected, as we could not detect significant differences in cell size between the wild type and rbb1-1 hypocotyls when grown in the dark (S3D Fig). Finally, if the RBB1 is responsible for the bulb and TVS phenotypes of rbb1-1, we expected a similar developmental progression, which can be tested by quantification of TVS during germination. TVS could not clearly be detected before day 2, and no significant difference was detected at day 2 between wild type and rbb1-1 hypocotyls when grown in the light (Fig 3P) However, the number of TVS was reduced by 28% in rbb1-1 when compared to the wild type. This reduction was even greater (41%) at day 4. Therefore, the appearance of the bulb phenotype at days 3 and 4 correlates well with the reduction of TVS numbers in rbb1-1.GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking to the vacuole is not altered in rbb1-1 The increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 could be the result of abnormal GFP-TIP2;1 protein trafficking to the vacuole. To test this hypothesis, two inhibitors for tonoplast protein trafficking were used. Brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits a Golgi-dependent pathway for tonoplast proteins in hypocotyls and C834 inhibits a Golgi-independent traffic of GFP-TIP2;1 to the tonoplast [29]. We treated the GFP-TIP2;1 (parental control), the TIP1;1-YFP line and the rbb1-1 mutant with BFA and visualized each fusion protein in hypocotyls. The fusion proteins localized to the tonoplast (GFP-TIP2;1) or tonoplast and bulbs (rbb1-1 and TIP1;1-YFP) in the DMSO control as expected (Fig 4A–4C). In BFA-treated cells, the GFP-TIP2;1 localization was unchanged in the parental control (Fig 4D) or rbb1-1 (Fig 4E), indicating that the trafficking of this protein was still BFA-insensitive. In contrast and consistent with previous reports [29], the TIP1;1-YFP marker line displayed large and bright aggregates in the presence of BFA (Fig 4F). Next we tested sensitivity to C834. GFP-TIP2;1 localized to the tonoplast and did not co-localize with the ER marker mCherry-HDEL in neither the parental line or rbb1-1 (Fig 4G–4I and 4M–4O). In contrast, GFP-TIP2;1 co-localized with the ER marker in C834-treated roots of the parental line (Fig 4J–4L) and rbb1-1 (Fig 4P–4R). Therefore, we conclude that GFP-TIP2;1 traffics in a similar pathway in rbb1-1 and the parental line, at least early in the secretory pathway, and that the bulb-localization of GFP-TIP2;1 in rbb1-1 does not appear to be the result of altered trafficking to the vacuole. Fig 4. GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking to the vacuole is similar between rbb1-1 and the parental line. Open in a new tab (a-f) BFA inhibits trafficking of TIP1;1YFP but not GFP-TIP2;1 in the parental line or rbb1-1. Four-day-old seedlings from the parental (GFP-TIP2;1, a, d), rbb1-1 (b, e) or TIP1;1-YFP (c, f) were exposed to 0.1% DMSO (control, a, b, c) or 75 μM BFA (d, e, f) for 3 hours and hypocotyl cells were imaged. BFA compartments are indicated with arrows. Scale: 20 μm. (g-r) C834 inhibits GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking in the parental line and rbb1-1. Three-day-old seedlings from the parental line and rbb1-1 were exposed to 0.5% DMSO (g-i, m-o) or 55 μM C834 (j-l, p-r) for 48 h, and root cells were imaged in the microscope. Signal from GFP-TIP2;1 (green, g, j, m, p), the ER marker mCherry-HDEL (magenta, h, k, n, p) or the merged image is shown (i, l, o, r). Co-localization of GFP with mCherry-HDEL at the ER is indicated with arrowheads. Scale bar: 20 μm.The RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450 The bulb phenotype of rbb1-1 segregated as 25 out of 96 (1/3.84) in a backcross to the GFP-TIP2;1 parental line, suggesting that the rbb1-1 mutation is recessive. In order to identify the RBB1 locus, we used a combination of map-based cloning and whole genome sequencing. The RBB1 gene mapped to a region of 2.2Mb in Chromosome 5 between markers RBCS-B and PINHEAD. Using Illumina whole-genome sequencing, we identified nucleotide variants in the rbb1-1 mutant genome between these two markers. From those, only two SNPs located within gene coding sequences and corresponding to EMS-type non-silent mutations were detected, in At5g38540 and At5g40450. In order to determine which gene corresponded to the RBB1 locus, we identified Salk T-DNA insertion alleles [38] for both candidate genes. Only one T-DNA line, SALK_095160, for At5g38540 was available, but no homozygote plants could be recovered. Heterozygous plants were crossed to rbb1-1 and the vacuole phenotype of F1 seedlings grown in the dark was analyzed. Out of 27 F1 seedlings, none showed the rbb1-1 bulb phenotype indicating that RBB1 was unlikely to correspond to At5g38540. We obtained two SALK T-DNA alleles for At5g40450 (Fig 5A). However, one of the T-DNA lines, SALK_067590, had a complex transgene insertion and could not be used. We used RT-PCR to determine if At5g40450 was expressed in SALK_074387. The expression of the full length At5g40450 was disrupted in SALK_074387 (Fig 5B), and therefore, this was a good mutant allele to test for the bulb phenotype. However, it is unclear if this allele is a complete loss of function allele because partial transcripts can be detected by RT-PCR. We named this allele rbb1-2. Fig 5. The RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450. Open in a new tab (a) Schematic structure of the RBB1 locus indicating the positions of rbb1 alleles. Exons are indicated as black boxes and introns are indicated as white boxes. 5' and 3' UTRs are indicated in gray. Triangles indicate T-DNA insertions of SALK lines. The position of three diagnostic RT-PCR amplicons at the 5’ end, middle and 3’ end are shown. (b) Accumulation of RBB1 transcripts as determined by RT-PCR with gene specific primers in seedlings from Col-0 (WT), rbb1-2, the GFP-TIP2;1 parental line and rbb1-1. Three pairs of gene specific primers were used to detect the transcript at the 5' end, middle, and 3' end of the RBB1 gene as indicated in (a). Numbers represent amplicon size. (c-e) Lack of genetic complementation between rbb1-1 and rbb1-2. Hypocotyls of four-day-old dark-grown seedlings from the parental control (WT, c), rbb1-1 (d) and the F1 progeny from a cross between rbb1-1 and rbb1-2 (rbb1-1/rbb1-2 double heterozygotes, e) were imaged by confocal microscopy. Scale bar: 20μm. (f-g) rbb1-2 contains bulbs in a similar manner as rbb1-1. Four-day-old seedlings were stained with 2 μM Lysotracker Red for 2 hours to label the vacuole in Col-0 (WT) and rbb1-2. Bulbs are indicated with arrows. Scale: 20 μm. (h) RBB1 is expressed in many developmental stages. The accumulation of RBB1 transcripts was determined by RT-PCR with gene specific primers in various tissues of 4 and 7-day old Col-0 (WT) plants. Two pairs of gene specific primers detected the 5' end and 3' end of RBB1 gene as indicated in (a).To determine if RBB1 is At5g40450, a complementation test between rbb1-1 and rbb1-2 was carried out. F1 seedlings from a cross between rbb1-1 and homozygous rbb1-2 were incubated in the dark and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for the bulb phenotype. As shown in Fig 5E, the double heterozygote F1 plants display the rbb1 phenotype and indicate the lack of complementation between the two mutant alleles. We were unable to confirm this result in the F2 population as the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene was consistently silenced in the segregating population whenever the SALK insertion was present. This result is consistent with highly silenced transgenes in SALK insertion lines [39]. To confirm the identity of RBB1, we visualized the vacuole morphology of rbb1-2 mutants with Lysotracker Red, a fluorescent dye that stains acidic organelles including plant vacuoles [40] and the tonoplast membrane [41, 42] (S4 Fig). This experiment could only be carried out in cotyledons from light-grown seedlings as penetration of fluorescent dyes in hypocotyls is very poor. Similar to the reduced number of bulbs in the GFP-TIP2;1 line, bulbs were rarely detected in wild type Col-0 cotyledons (Fig 5F and S1 Movie). On the contrary, the rbb1-2 mutant allele showed a similar bulb phenotype as the rbb1-1 mutant with 4–5 vacuolar bulbs per cell in these cells (Fig 5G and S2 Movie). This phenotype also segregated as ~1/4 and therefore rbb1-2 is likely to be recessive. These results confirmed that the RBB1 locus corresponds to At5g40450 and that the bulb phenotype may be detected in the absence of the GFP-TIP2;1 transgene. At5g40450 encodes a large protein of 2,890 amino acids. The mutation in rbb1-1 is a C/T nucleotide substitution that results in an A1070V substitution in the predicted protein sequence. BLASTp analysis in  identified only two proteins with protein similarity covering at least 40% of the RBB1 protein sequence, CARUB_v10003962mg from Capsella rubella and EUTSA_v10027617mg from Eutrema salsugineum. All other hits (~40) show high similarity to a 75 amino acid region at the C terminus of RBB1. Remarkably, no significant similarity was found outside of plant taxa using BLASTp, which indicates that RBB1 is a plant-specific protein. In addition, no specific domain hits were detected using the Conserved Domain Database search function in  [43], but regions of similarity to three multi-domain structures were detected. Only two proteins were identified with significant similarity to RBB1 in C. rubella and E. salsugineum. RBB1 belongs to the putative Plant Model Organism Orthologous Group APK_ORTHOMCL5144, which includes genes from Rice, Poplar, Sorghum, Maize, and Brachypodium (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ortholog_group_apk.pl). This group is also supported by gene family clustering of orthologous genes in Phytozome (www.phytozome.net) [44]. The putative orthologs also encode very large proteins (up to 3,715 aa). One of the putative orthologs, Ricinus communis gene 29917.t000066, contains a 32 amino acid region that is 32% identical to the microtubule-associated protein futsch in Drosophila melanogaster. These results overall indicate that RBB1 is a novel plant-specific protein with unknown molecular function. In order to determine the spatial and temporal expression of RBB1, the accumulation of RBB1 transcripts was analyzed by RT-PCR in Col-0 wild type plants. RBB1 accumulated at similar levels in 4- and 7-day-old light-grown seedlings, and in rosette leaves and inflorescences (Fig 5H). These results are consistent with publicly available databases for At5g40450. According to Arabidopsis eFP browser [45], RBB1 is expressed in leaves and roots of both seedlings and mature plants, flowers and all stages of embryo development. Seedlings treated for 12 h with ABA, heat, cold and osmotic stress have decreased levels of RBB1 transcripts [45, 46]. In contrast, 3 h treatment with photosystem II inhibitor N-octyl-3-nitro-2,4,6-trihydroxybenzamide (PNO8) or the brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor brassinazole 220 resulted in a 2-fold induction of RBB1 [47]. These results indicate that RBB1 may have important functions in multiple developmental stages. The RBB1 transcript accumulation was also analyzed in the parental line and rbb1-1, but no differences in the expression level were detected (Fig 5B). Therefore, the rbb1-1 mutation did not affect the expression of RBB1 at the transcriptional level.RBB1 is a cytosolic protein In order to characterize the function of RBB1, a fluorescent protein (FP) fusion was generated to visualize its protein localization. Given the large size of the RBB1 coding sequence, we used Recombineering [32] to generate a FP fusion with RBB1 driven by its own promoter and other regulatory sequences. This system utilizes homologous recombination with TAC clones to fuse the gene encoding 3xYpet (YFP for energy transfer), a bright variation of YFP [48], to the gene of interest within the native genomic context. Both N- and C-terminal fusions of RBB1 with 3xYpet were generated and introduced into Col-0 wild type. We could not detect fluorescence in RBB1-3xYpet lines after selection of 15 independent transformants. However, 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in cotyledon epidermal cells, root cortical cells and, although very faint, in the cortex of hypocotyls of light-grown seedlings (S5A and S5B Fig). No Ypet signal was detected at the root tip corresponding to the cell division zone. In order to determine if the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion is functional, we introgressed the transgene into the rbb1-2 allele by crossing. This experiment was carried out in rbb1-2 because the GFP-TIP2;1 marker in rbb1-1 is tightly linked to the RBB1 locus and the probability of identifying rbb1-1 segregants without GFP-TIP2;1 was very low. In contrast to rbb1-2 seedlings stained with Lysotracker red, which showed many bulbs in cotyledons (Fig 6A), rbb1-2 seedlings expressing the 3xYpet-RBB1 protein have vacuole morphology very similar to the wild type (Fig 6B and 6C). Therefore, the 3xYpet-RBB1 construct complements the bulb phenotype of rbb1-2 indicating that this fusion protein is functional. Fig 6. 3xYpet-RBB1 is a cytoplasmic protein that associates with the tonoplast. Open in a new tab (a-c) A 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion complements the bulb phenotype of rbb1-2. Four-day-old seedlings from rbb1-2 (a) or rbb1-2 3xYpet-RBB1 (b, c) were stained with Lysotracker Red (magenta, a, b) to label the vacuole. The signal from 3xYpet-RBB1 (c) for the complemented plant is shown. (d-f) 3xYpet-RBB1 does not co-localize with FM4-64.

Cotyledons of 7-d-old seedlings expressing 3xYpet-RBB1 (g) and RFP-SYP22 (h) were imaged. Merged image (i) is shown. (j-l) 3xYpet-RBB1 and Lysotracker Red do not co-localize in rosette leaves. Seedlings from the 3xYpet-RBB1 line were stained with Lysotracker Red. Signal from 3xYpet-RBB1 (j), Lysotracker Red (k) and the merged image (l) are shown. Arrowheads indicate the localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 at the tip of elongating trans-vacuolar strands. (m-o) GFP molecules can also label the tips of transvacuolar strands. Seedlings from a 35::GFP marker line were stained with Lysotracker Red. The GFP signal (m), Lysotracker Red (n) and the merged image (o) are shown. Arrowheads indicate the tip of TVS. All scale bars = 20 μm. (p) 3xYpet-RBB1 accumulates in the soluble (S100) and membrane pellet (P100) fractions from whole seedlings. Immunoblot of 3xYpet-RBB1 soluble (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions from Col-0 and 3xYpet-RBB1 transgenic plants using antibodies against GFP (α-GFP), cFBPase (α-cFBPase, control for soluble fraction), and Plasma Membrane H+ATPase (α-H+ATPase, control for membrane fraction).The localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 was diffuse and suggestive of cytosolic localization in cotyledons of 7-day-old seedlings (Fig 6D). In order to determine its sub-cellular distribution in detail, we tested for co-localization between 3xYpet-RBB1 and the plasma membrane dye FM4-64, a marker for the tonoplast, RFP-SYP22 [30], and the vacuole dye Lysotracker Red. The 3xYpet-RBB1 marker does not co-localize with FM4-64 (Fig 6D–6F) or with RFP-SYP22 (Fig 6G–6I). The marker was found in the cytosol and did not co-localize with Lysotracker Red (Fig 6J–6L), even though occasionally there was good co-localization between these two signals (S5C–S5E Fig). These results indicate 3xYpet-RBB1 protein is most likely a soluble protein that accumulates in the cytosol. We also detected 3xYpet-RBB1 in a punctate pattern inside the vacuole that seemed to correspond to the tip of TVS labeled with Lysotracker Red in confocal images (Fig 6J–6L). Interestingly, 3xYpet-RBB1 remained associated with the tip during the elongation of those TVS (S5F Fig) in a similar manner as actin bundles [49]. These TVS structures may represent cross-sections of membrane sheets that transverse the vacuole, as previously proposed [10, 49]. In order to determine the significance of this localization, we compared it to the localization of a soluble GFP marker in the same manner. As shown in Fig 6M–6O, a simple GFP marker can also label the tip of TVS, and therefore, the punctate localization of RBB1 may simply result from accumulation of cytoplasmic proteins at the tip of emerging TVS. Immunoblot analysis was used to confirm that the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion protein accumulates as the expected size of ~400 kDa in seedlings. Membrane and soluble fractions were isolated from wild type Col-0 and the 3xYpet-RBB1 line and the fusion protein was detected with an anti-GFP antibody. The cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBPase) and plasma membrane H+ATPase were used as soluble and membrane protein controls, respectively. 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in both the soluble (S100) and the membrane (P100) fractions in 4 days-old seedlings (Fig 6L and S6 Fig). These results overall indicate that 3xYpet-RBB1 is a large soluble protein that is likely to associate with cellular membranes.Discussion We have identified rbb1-1, a novel mutant with defects in vacuole morphology. Vacuoles in rbb1-1 contain increased numbers of bulbs in the large central vacuole of cotyledons and hypocotyl cells when compared to the parental control. These defined vacuolar sub-structures can be visualized with fluorescent protein markers for the tonoplast [15, 23]. It was recently proposed that bulbs, specially when they have more than double the intensity of fluorescence when compared to the tonoplast, are artifacts that result from GFP dimerization that stabilizes the adhesion of tonoplast membranes [24]. This model, however, does not explain the accumulation of bulbs in the 2xFYVE-YFP line in which the fusion protein associates with the membrane in a reversible manner by binding to a specific phosphoinositide [15, 23, 50]. The GFP-TIP2;1-labeled bulbs in rbb1-1 showed between 2 and 3.5-fold higher fluorescence intensity when compared to the tonoplast, indicating that they are likely to have a similar structure as previously characterized IVPS and bulbs [15, 23, 24]. We can not discard the possibility that the GFP fusion enhances the stability of the bulbs in rbb1-1, but rbb1 mutant alleles comprise a sensitized genetic background for studying the formation and regulation of these structures, which are quite elusive under normal conditions. The two other mutants that have been identified as having abnormal bulb accumulation, sgr2 and vti11, have fewer bulbs, also have very abnormal vacuole morphology [23, 25, 28]. Hence, rbb1-1 is a unique tool to characterize the structure and function of the bulbs in the absence of other vacuolar defects. RBB1 encodes a very large protein with unknown molecular function. In order to determine the function of RBB1, we generated a 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion protein under the control of the RBB1 promoter. This construct complemented the rbb1-2 mutant phenotype indicating that the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion is functional. In seedlings, 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in the root in the elongation and differentiation zones, but not in the cell division zone, and in hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells. Therefore, 3xYpet-RBB1 accumulates in cells that contain a large lytic vacuole [51], consistent with a role of RBB1 in regulating the morphology of this important organelle. Confocal scanning laser microscopy with the 3xYpet-RBB1 line indicated that this protein accumulates in the cytosol, and that in a few instances also co-localizes with Lysotracker red, a fluorescent dye that labels the tonoplast. RBB1 was found both in the soluble and membrane fractions by fractionation experiments, which raises the possibility that RBB1 may associate with membranes. 3xYpet-RBB1 was often present at the tips of elongating TVS in cotyledons and leaves, but visualization of a GFP control indicated that this localization may be detected some times with other cytosolic proteins. We detected a significant decrease in the number of TVS in rbb1-1 mutants both in light- and dark-grown hypocotyls and in cotyledons of light-grown seedlings. The TVS phenotype of rbb1-1 supports the hypothesis that RBB1 functions in the formation or stability of TVS. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that both the bulb phenotype and the reduced TVS phenotype can be detected at day 3 during germination. TVS are very dynamic structures that require the actomyosin cytoskeleton [4, 5, 14, 49], and are thought redistribute cytoplasmic contents or to enhance the structural stability of the cytoskeleton [14]. A potential role of RBB1 in TVS formation is consistent with the expression of 3xYpet-RBB1 in cells that contain a large vacuole. Given the localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 to the cytosol and its accumulation in both the soluble and membrane fractions, it is tempting to speculate that RBB1 interacts with the tonoplast during the formation and elongation of TVS and contributes to the remodeling of the vacuolar membrane. However, more experiments beyond the scope of this work are needed to test this possibility. Moreover, we speculate that the increased number of bulbs in rbb1-1 results from its inability to form functional TVS. Therefore, we propose an alternative model for bulb biogenesis in which a bulb forms when a TVS initiates but fails to elongate and the bulb functions as a mean to accommodate tonoplast membranes and cytoskeletal proteins that may have accumulated at the initiation site, until the bulb membrane is reabsorbed back into the tonoplast. It follows that the bulbs may have no specific function in the vacuole other than the transient accumulation of membranes and proteins when TVS failed to elongate. Further characterization of the function of RBB1 and interacting partners may shed light in the mechanisms that remodel the vacuole membrane into TVS or bulbs. Unlike the effects of GFP dimerization in vacuole morphology after fusion with vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase [24], it is unlikely that GFP dimerization plays a big role in the TVS phenotype of rbb1. While the bulb fluorescence intensity for cotyledons was 3.5 fold higher than that of tonoplast, this ratio is only 2.0 for hypocotyls in rbb1-1, the same tissue that was used to quantify TVS in Fig 2. Therefore, a ratio higher than 2.0 is not necessary in rbb1-1 to induce the accumulation of bulbs or a reduction in TVS. Previously proposed functions of vacuolar bulbs include acting as a tonoplast reservoir for rapid growth or serving as the sites of degradation of tonoplast membrane and proteins (Saito et al. 2002 and Maîtrejean et al. 2011). We tested one of these hypotheses by measuring the hypocotyl growth of rbb1-1 in the dark, a condition that promotes cell elongation. However, no obvious growth differences were observed between rbb1-1 and the parental line. One possibility is that the additional tonoplast membranes contained in rbb1-1 bulbs do not contribute to cell elongation. Alternatively, other factors such as the elasticity of the cell wall [49] may be limiting and would prevent us from detecting a difference in this assay. The RBB1 gene is expressed in seedlings and adult plants both in shoots and roots. That RBB1 is expressed as a full-length transcript of 8,957 bp is supported by several ESTs as well as the alignment of RNAseq reads spanning the entire coding sequence by the Integrated Genome Browser [52, 53]. The molecular function of RBB1 is unknown as the protein has no conserved domains, and it represents a new plant-specific protein. The identification of proteins that interact with RBB1 may shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which RBB1 could regulate the morphology of the vacuole.Supporting Information S1 Fig. rbb1-1 mutants show normal growth.(a-b) Normal growth phenotype of 4 day-old seedlings (a), and 6 week-old plants (b) from the parental line, rbb1-1, Col-0, and rbb1-2.

    "abstract": "Significance Plant vacuoles are essential organelles and occupy up to 90% of the cell volume. Their roles include regulation of stomata movements, protein storage in seeds, gravity sensing, and ion homeostasis. Vacuole or lysosome fusion in eukaryotes is mediated by two multisubunit complexes, SNARE and homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS), but only the SNARE complex is well characterized in plants. Here, we show that, similar to other eukaryotes, HOPS mediates vacuole fusion in plants by interaction with SNAREs and that the HOPS subunit VPS33 and the SNARE protein SYP22 display the sites for interaction between these complexes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, however, plant HOPS recruitment to liposomes is inhibited by phosphoinositides, which appear to define strict rules for regulating fusion and fragmentation of dynamic vacuoles. Keywords: Arabidopsis, vacuole fusion, HOPS, SNARE, phosphoinositides",

    "methods": "Methods Plant Materials, Growth Conditions, and Transformation. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown as described (2). The ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as WT control. The genomic VPS41-GFP fusion (VPS41p::VPS41-GFP) was described elsewhere (4). Organelle markers mRFP-SYP22 (18), mCherry-RAB5 (mCherry-RabF2a), and mCherry-RAB7 (mCherry-RabG3f) (51) have been previously described. SALK T-DNA insertion lines, including vps41-1 (SALK_076372), vps41-2 (SALK_035406), vps33-3 (SALK_016684C), vps33-4 (SALK_151719), and vps33-5 (SALK_143407), were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR (SI Appendix, Table S4). The zip2 zig-1 mutant was previously characterized (56). The TILLING lines (57) vps33-1 (CS92162) and vps33-2 (CS93595) were obtained from ABRC and backcrossed three times with Col-0 WT. Homozygous vps33-1 and vps33-2 were genotyped by PCR amplification (SI Appendix, Table S4) and restriction digestion with BsmBI (vps33-1) or TspRI (vps33-2). Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown at room temperature for 3–4 wk in Metro-Mix 300 soil with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. Arabidopsis transformation was carried out by floral dip (81) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 and GV3101. Transient plant Agro-infiltration of 3- to 4-wk-old N. benthamiana leaves was carried out as described (82). GFP or RFP fluorescence was observed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) 36–48 h after infiltration. Molecular Cloning. The full-length genomic fusion of VPS33 with GFP driven by either 3- or 1-kb native promoters were generated using the GoldenBraid system (83). Primers for VPS33 genomic sequences (SI Appendix, Table S4) were generated by the GB domesticator software (https://gbcloning.upv.es/tools/domestication/), and each part was amplified by PCR (83, 84). Each transcriptional unit (TU) was assembled by restriction–ligation reaction into pUPD2 and sequenced. The full fusion construct containing the VPS33 promoter and genomic sequence, GFP, and the VPS33 terminator sequence was then assembled into pDGB3_alpha1. This cassette was finally inserted into pDGB3_omega1 together with the kanamycin resistance cassette from pGB0184 to generate pVPS33::gVPS33-GFP (VPS33-GFP). All experiments were carried out with the 3-kb promoter, except for Fig. 1 P–R, where the 1-kb promoter was used. UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter-driven and BiFC constructs were generated by Gateway cloning. Coding sequences of VPS41 (At1g08190), VPS33 (At3G54860), VTI11 (At5G39510), SYP22 (AT5G146860), and AtTIP2;1 (AT3G16240) were obtained by RT-PCR. Briefly, total mRNA was extracted from Col-0 WT seedlings using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer’s instruction. cDNAs were synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) and amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (SI Appendix, Table S4) compatible for Gateway cloning. Entry clones were generated in pENTR4 or pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) (SI Appendix, Table S3). Expression clones (SI Appendix, Table S2) were generated by recombination between the entry clones and multiple destination vectors using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). Vectors driven by the pUBQ10 promoter were generated after substitution of the short UBQ promoter of the vector set described in ref. 85 with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596 bp) from pNIGEL07 (51). pDEST15 and pDEST17 destination vectors (Invitrogen) were used for protein expression in bacteria, and N- and C-terminal nEYFP and cEYFP pSITE vectors (86) were used to generate constructs for BiFC. All expression constructs are described in SI Appendix, Table S2. The amiR-vps constructs were cloned using the GreenGate system (87). Specific amiRNA sequences against VPS41 and VPS11 (AT2G05170) were identified with the Web MicroRNA Designer (WMD3) tool (88) at wmd3.weigelworld.org/cgi-bin/webapp.cgi. The amiR-vps sequences were amplified in four independent PCRs (SI Appendix, Table S5) with the pRS300 plasmid containing the miR319a precursor sequence. To be suited for the GreenGate cloning system, primers “A” and “B” were modified with specific overhangs. The final PCR products (fourth reaction) were first digested with Eco31I and then ligated into the preopened intermediate vectors (SI Appendix, Table S5). The resulting vectors (supermodule A and B for each amiR-vps) were sequenced and combined in consecutive GreenGate reactions as described (87). The DEX induction system is based on the p6xOP/LhG4-GR transcription system (89, 90). Primers and vectors used in these experiments are reported in SI Appendix, Tables S3–S5. Microscopy. Zeiss LSM 710 or Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan confocal microscopes were used for all imaging experiments unless specified. The excitation/emission wavelengths for imaging were 488 nm/492–570 nm for GFP and YFP, 561 nm/588–696 nm for mCherry and mRFP, and 561 nm/566–690 nm for LysoTracker Red. Three-day-old seedlings were analyzed with a 40×/1.2 N.A. water-immersion objective. To image PSVs, seeds were imbibed in water for 1 h, and seed coats were peeled off with a sharp needle. Vacuoles in the mature embryos were imaged by capturing PSV autofluorescence (excitation/emission wavelengths were 405/450–510 nm) from a single Z plane per sample. PSV quantification was carried out using Fiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ, based on ImageJ 1.51d; fiji.sc/) (91). Linear (Pearson) and the nonlinear (Spearman’s) correlation coefficients for colocalization analysis were obtained with the PSC colocalization plug-in (92). The threshold level for the noise was set at 4. Membrane/cytosolic ratios of VPS41-GFP were calculated in Fiji by extracting intensity values of VPS41-GFP only from the vacuole membrane. This was accomplished by generating a membrane signal mask by thresholding of the RFP-SYP22 marker in the red channel to 40 or above. The mask was then applied to the GFP channel to extract the histograms of intensity values for VPS41-GFP at the membrane. A “cytosolic” intensity average was calculated by measuring intensity values from four cytosolic regions of interest per image. Live-cell CLSM of vacuoles from amiRNA lines was done using a Leica TCS SP5II microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a Leica HCX PL APO lambda blue 63×/1.20 N.A. UV water-immersion objective. Images were acquired with a lateral pixel resolution between 50 and 96 nm at a speed of 400 Hz with bidirectional scanning and five times line averaging. To reduce background fluorescence, the pinhole was adjusted between 0.75 and 1.0 airy unit (AU). The excitation/emission wavelengths for imaging were 488 nm/495–550 nm for BCECF and 561 nm/600–680 nm for FM4-64. Image postprocessing operations (Gaussian blur between 0.5 and 0.75; adjustment of brightness and contrast of the whole image) were done with Fiji. Chemical Treatments and Fluorescent Dyes. Three- or 4-d-old seedlings were used in all chemical treatments and fluorescent dye stainings. Wm (W3144; Sigma) was diluted in liquid AGM to a final concentration of 33 μM, and the same volume of DMSO was added to the control (1% final). Seedlings were treated for 3 h in the dark at 22 °C. A minimum of three seedlings was analyzed for each treatment, and the experiment was repeated three times. LysoTracker Red staining was carried out by incubation of seedlings in liquid AGM supplemented with 2 μM LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) for 2 h. For amiRNA induction with DEX, 5 d-old seedlings were incubated for 72 h in liquid AGM supplemented with 30 µM DEX, or DMSO (control). Seedlings were stained with 10 µM BCECF, acetoxymethyl ester, and 1 µM FM 4-64 as described (8). Protein Purification. BL21-AI E. coli cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with T7::GST-VPS41, T7::GST-VPS33, T7::GST, T7::HIS-SYP22, or T7::HIS-VTI11. Recombinant bacteria were cultured in 300 mL of LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and 1% glucose at 37 °C to an OD of 0.4–0.6. Expression of the tagged proteins was induced with 0.2% arabinose. Cultures were incubated at 28 °C for 5 h, except for T7::HIS-SYP22, which was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and HIS-VTI11, which was incubated at 16 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors; Roche; #04693132001) and 12 μg/mL lysozyme (Sigma). The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 11,200 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was then added to either a Gluthatione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) or a Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), accordingly. The recombinant proteins were eluted after an overnight incubation at 4 °C in slow rotation following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Lipid–Protein Binding Assays. Phospholipid-coated PIP strips (Echelon) were blocked with TBST buffer [10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20] containing 3% (wt/vol) BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Strips were then incubated with 3 mL of 0.33 nM purified GST-VPS41, GST-VPS33, or GST in TBST and 3% (wt/vol) BSA at 4 °C overnight. Strips were washed three times and incubated with mouse anti-GST primary antibody [1:1,000 dilution in 3% (wt/vol) BSA; Thermo Fisher]. A secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody [diluted 1:2,000 in 3% (wt/vol) BSA; Thermo Fisher Scientific] was used next, and signal was detected by western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) using a G:BOX Chemi XRQ gel documentation system (Syngene). This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. The liposome binding assay was modified from refs. 93 and 94 using PolyPIPosomes (Echelon Biosciences) containing no phosphoinositides (control; catalog #Y-0000), PI(3)P (catalog #Y-003), or PI(3,5)P2 (catalog #Y-035). Proteins were first clarified by ultracentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Then, 2.5 µg of GST-VPS41, 1.7 µg of GST-VPS33, 500 ng of GST alone, and 600 ng of PI(3)P Grip (p40 PX) (Echelon Biosciences) were diluted in a final volume of 95 µL of 1× binding buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4; 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/mL BSA; 0.2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, and 1× protease inhibitors from Roche; #04693132001). Five microliters of the PolyPIPosome was added, and the final 100-µL volume was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with slow rotation. Liposomes were then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature and washed one time in 1× binding buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 30 µl of Laemmli buffer and resolved together with 30% of the supernatant by SDS/PAGE using a 3–8% Tris-acetate protein gel (Invitrogen). Similar results were obtained in three different experiments. In Vitro Protein–Protein Interaction. Mouse anti-GST (catalog #MA4-004; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or mouse Penta-HIS (Qiagen 34660) antibodies were bound to Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. To avoid coelution of the antibodies, we treated the beads with BS3 (Thermo Scientific) cross-linking agent. Beads and antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, treated with 1 M Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, quenching buffer, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes, the different protein combinations were added. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed three times with PBS buffer containing protease inhibitors, and bound proteins were eluted by 5-min denaturation at 90 °C in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved in 10% acrylamide gels or 3–8% Tris-acetate protein gels (Invitrogen).",
    "results": "Results VPS41 and VPS33 Partially Colocalize with Late Endosomes, but only VPS41 Is Detected at the Tonoplast. VPS41 (AT1G08190) and VPS33 (AT3G54860) share 23.29% and 19.17% sequence identity with yeast Vps41p and Vps33p, respectively. Therefore, VPS33 and VPS41 are likely homologs of these yeast HOPS proteins (31, 50). We first investigated whether VPS41 and VPS33 colocalized in vacuolar or prevacuolar membranes, as expected for HOPS. Transient expression of mRFP-VPS41 and VPS33-GFP under control of UBQ10 promoters in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves indicated that these proteins accumulate in the cytosol and nucleus, and associate with membranes in punctate structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B). RFP-VPS41 and VPS33-GFP colocalized in the majority of the punctate structures and the nucleus, and partially at the cell periphery (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C), which supports their participation in a complex. These experiments, however, do not provide enough resolution to identify the compartments where these proteins accumulate and they may be influenced by overexpression. To better characterize protein localizations, VPS41-GFP (4) and VPS33-GFP were analyzed in stable Arabidopsis transgenic plants using full-length genomic fusions to GFP under native promoters. Both proteins were again detected in the cytosol, but membrane association was more discernible. Similar to its localization in pollen (4), VPS41-GFP was detected at the tonoplast and punctate organelles in roots (Fig. 1A), and this localization was not affected by the location of the fluorescence tag as the localization of YFP-VPS41 was very similar (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). Colocalization with known organelle markers was used to identify the structures labeled with VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP. VPS41-GFP colocalized with the tonoplast marker RFP-SYP22 (18) and confirmed its tonoplast association (Fig. 1 A–C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1E). Furthermore, VPS41-GFP partially colocalized with mCherry-RAB7, a marker for the late stages of PVC maturation (51) (Fig. 1 D–F), consistent with results from pollen (4). Colocalization with the early PVC marker mCherry-RAB5 (51) was detected in only a few organelles (Fig. 1 G–I). These results indicate that VPS41-GFP localizes to the vacuole and late endosomes. Similar experiments with VPS33-GFP indicate that VPS41 and VPS33 have overlapping but not identical localizations. VPS33-GFP rarely colocalized with RFP-SYP22 at the tonoplast, except for a few puncta (Fig. 1 J–L and SI Appendix, Fig. S1F), indicating that this protein is absent from the vacuole. VPS33-GFP is present in the cytosol and in cytosolic punctate structures, where it partially colocalized with mCherry-RAB7 (Fig. 1 M–O) and shows strong colocalization with mCherry-RAB5 (Fig. 1 P–R). Quantification of these colocalization experiments further validates the overlapping but distinct localization of VPS33 and VPS41 (Fig. 1 S and T). Both proteins show significant colocalization with RAB7 endosomes. While VPS33 has the strongest colocalization with RAB5 endosomes, it is weakly colocalized with the tonoplast marker SYP22. In contrast, VPS41 shows significant accumulation at the tonoplast but is not associated with RAB5 endosomes (Fig. 1 S and T). Interestingly, both VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP seem to accumulate in more endosomal compartments when coexpressed with mCherry-RAB5 (compare Fig. 1A with Fig. 1G and Fig. 1J with Fig. 1P). The effect of the mCherry-RAB5 fusion on the recruitment or stability of these proteins at the endosome or the endosomes themselves will require further analysis beyond the scope of this work. Overall, these results suggest that VPS33 and VPS41 are cytosolic proteins that preferentially associate with late endosomal compartments, and this is consistent with a role for HOPS in the tethering of vacuoles or prevacuoles. Interestingly, only VPS41 is detected at the tonoplast, and only VPS33 has significant accumulation in RAB5 endosomes. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Subcellular localization of VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP. Genomic fusion constructs of VPS41 (VPS41-GFP) and VPS33 (VPS33-GFP) driven by native promoters were cotransformed with subcellular markers into Arabidopsis, and root cells were imaged by confocal microscopy. (A–I) Colocalization of VPS41-GFP (A, D, and G) with mRFP-SYP22 (B), mCherry-RAB7 (E), or mCherry-RAB5 (H) in root cells of stably transformed Arabidopsis seedlings. Corresponding merged images are shown (C, F, and I). Arrowheads indicate sites of marker colocalization at the tonoplast, and arrows point to colocalization in endosomes. (Scale bars: 20 µm.) (J–R) Colocalization of VPS33-GFP (J, M, and P) with mRFP-SYP22 (K), mCherry-RAB7 (N), or mCherry-RAB5 (Q). The merged images are shown (L, O, and R). No apparent accumulation of VPS33-GFP was detected at the tonoplast. Partial colocalization was detected in RAB5 and RAB7 endosomes (arrows). (Scale bars: 20 µm.) (S and T) Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients from the colocalization analyses between VPS41-GFP (S) or VPS33-GFP (T) with mRFP-SYP22, mCherry-RAB5, or mChery-RAB7. Thirty-seven to 56 images from nine seedlings combined were used for each analysis. Bars represent SE. VPS41 Tonoplast Association Is Dependent on Phosphoinositides. The distinct localizations of VPS33-GFP and VPS41-GFP prompted us to test whether the two proteins were characterized by different phospholipid binding affinities. This was tested using an in vitro lipid-binding assay with recombinant proteins. GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Purified proteins were incubated on lipid strips, and protein binding was detected with anti-GST. GST alone was used as negative control (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Both GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 show affinity toward all phosphoinositides in this assay, including the two that are most abundant at the late endosomes and vacuole, PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that VPS41 and VPS33 association with membranes may be regulated in part by phosphoinositide binding. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Phosphoinositides regulate the membrane association of VPS41. (A) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to phosphoinositide lipids. GST-VPS41 (Center) and GST-VPS33 (Right) were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Lipid affinity of purified proteins was analyzed using a lipid strip assay. Lipids include the following: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphocholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate. (B) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to liposomes that lack phosphoinositides. Affinity-purified GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 proteins were incubated without liposomes (none) or with PC/PE liposomes bearing no phosphoinositides (control), PtdIns(3)P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2, and protein binding was detected by cosedimentation and immunoblot with α-GST. Incubation with PI(3)P-GRIP was used as positive control, and GST alone was used as negative control. (C–H) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, but not from endosomes. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (C and F) and mCherry-RAB7 (D and G) were treated with DMSO (C–E) or 33 µM Wm (F–H) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. Merged images are shown (E and H). Tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP is indicated with arrowheads. Wm induced the enlargement of RAB7-labeled endosomes (arrows) that retained VPS41-GFP signal. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (I–N) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (I and L) and mRFP-SYP22 (J and M) were treated with DMSO (I–K) or 33 µM Wm (L–N) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. VPS41-GFP signal is depicted using a rainbow LUT (I and L), where high intensity values are represented in red and low intensity values are shown in blue. Red pixels were associated with the tonoplast in the DMSO control only. Merged images are shown using green color for the GFP signal (K and N). (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (O) Quantification of the tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP from I–N. The ratio between the membrane and cytosolic fluorescence intensity of VPS41-GFP was calculated using ImageJ from DMSO or Wm-treated seedlings (N = 27 images from seven to eight seedlings per treatment; *significant in a t test at P < 0.05).To characterize lipid binding in a physiological context, we used a liposome-binding assay that better resembles lipid binding in a bilayer. Phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) liposomes bearing either no phosphoinositide, PtdIns(3)P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2 were incubated in the presence of recombinant proteins, and binding was assayed by cosedimentation. As shown in Fig. 2B, both GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bound to the control liposomes, indicating that these proteins have strong affinity for neutral lipids. Surprisingly, addition of PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2 abolished this binding, which suggests that VPS33 and VPS41 membrane binding is tightly controlled. The PI(3)P-GRIP protein which contains a PtdIns(3)P-binding domain was used as a positive control, and GST was used as a negative control. These results underscore VPS41 and VPS33 sensitivities to phosphoinositides and to the different presentation of these lipids between the flat surface of the lipid strip and the curved membrane of the liposomes. PtdIns(3)P is a negative regulator for homotypic vacuole fusion in plants (2) and recruits HOPS to the vortex ring in yeast (52). Hence, PtdIns(3)P and other phosphoinositides are good candidates to regulate HOPS subunit association with the vacuole and PVC. We therefore asked whether the localizations of GFP-VPS41 was affected by phosphoinositide availability using Wm treatment, which results in PtdIns(3)P depletion from cellular membranes (53). GFP-VPS41 was found at the tonoplast and some mCherry-RAB7-labeled endosomes, in the DMSO control as expected (Fig. 2 C–E). Wm treatment resulted in PVC swelling with the characteristic doughnut-like structures that were decorated with both VPS41-GFP and mCherry-RAB7 (Fig. 2 F–H), which suggests that Wm treatment did not alter the VPS41 association with late endosome membranes. Remarkably, VPS41-GFP was no longer detected at the tonoplast after Wm treatment (Fig. 2 F–H). To quantify the loss of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, we used the RFP-SYP22 marker as a proxy for vacuole membrane localization. As shown in Fig. 2 I–K, the sites of highest VPS41-GFP fluorescence intensity in the control colocalize with RFP-SYP22 at the tonoplast. This tonoplast bright signal is lost after the Wm treatment (Fig. 2 L–N). Quantification of these results further indicates that Wm treatment results in a 35% decrease in the membrane/cytosolic ratio of VPS41-GFP (Fig. 2O). These results indicate that tonoplast association of VPS41 is mediated by phosphoinositide binding, but its association with late endosome membranes is independent of phosphoinositides. Major changes in VPS33-GFP localization were not detected after Wm treatment as a few RAB7 endosomes were still labeled with VPS33-GFP (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 B–G). HOPS Is Essential for Male Fertility and Important for Plant Development. To define the role of VPS41 and VPS33 in vacuole fusion and dynamics, we identified loss-of-function alleles for VPS41 and VPS33 from the SALK T-DNA collection (54). T-DNA insertions were confirmed for vps41-1 (SALK_076372) and vps41-3 (SALK_036406), which carry the T-DNA insertions in the 13th exon and the promoter region of VPS41, respectively. Three T-DNA insertion alleles were confirmed for VPS33, vps33-3 (SALK_016684C), vps33-4 (SALK_151719), and vps33-5 (SALK_143407). These mutants carry the insertions in the 13th intron, the promoter, and the seventh exon of VPS33 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). RT-PCR from homozygous lines showed no altered VPS41 transcript accumulation for vps41-3, and this line was not used further. No homozygous plants were recovered from over 50 progeny of vps41-1/+, vps33-3/+, vps33-4/+, or vps33-5/+, and none had evidence for embryo abortion in siliques from heterozygous plants, which suggested the possibility of gametophyte lethality or sterility. To determine which gametophyte was unfertile, reciprocal crosses were performed between vps41-1/+ or vps33-3/+ and Col-0 WT plants to determine the male and female transmission efficiency (TE) (55) (SI Appendix, Table S1). The results show that transmission through the female gametes is not compromised in either mutant. However, male vps41-1 TE is abolished, indicating that VPS41 is essential for pollen fertility. The vps33-3 pollen, instead, is not completely sterile, but the male TE is strongly reduced to 16.1%. The pollen defects of vps33 and vps41 loss-of-function alleles are consistent with previous reports (4, 32) and, together with the phenotype of vps18 and vps39 mutants recently reported (3), support an important role of the HOPS complex in male gametophyte development. Similar to VPS41-GFP (4), the full-length genomic fusion construct for VPS33-GFP complements the pollen fertility defects of loss-of-function mutants as homozygous vps33-3 can be recovered (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B–D). HOPS Is Important for Vacuole Biogenesis and Fusion. We identified viable weaker alleles to characterize VPS41 and VPS33 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). One EMS allele for VPS41, zip2/vps41 (56), and two viable TILLING (57) alleles of VPS33, vps33-1 and vps33-2, are available. The zip2/vps41 allele was identified from a screen of suppressors of zig-1/vti11 in gravitropism (56). The mutation results in a G721R substitution within an annotated clathrin heavy chain repeat (CHCR) of the VPS41 protein that is predicted to mediate protein–protein interactions (58). The mutations in vps33-1 and vps33-2 result in S95F and V136M substitutions in the VPS33 protein, respectively. Both are predicted to occur in domain 1 of the VPS33 protein, which, together with domain 3, has been shown in fungi and yeast to form a cleft that is thought to accommodate SNARE bundles (28). None of the single mutants shows developmental phenotypes in rosettes or inflorescences under normal growth conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S3E). No vacuole phenotypes were observed in zip2/vps41, vps33-1, or vps33-2 when seedling roots were analyzed using LysoTracker Red staining (SI Appendix, Fig. S3F). However, we observed an increased number of PSVs in mature zip2/vps41, vps33-1, and vps33-2 embryos compared with the WT (Fig. 3 A–D). The number of vacuoles per cell was counted in each genotype to quantify this defect (Fig. 3E). Only cells with a cross-section area between 11 and 15.9 µm2 were included in the analysis. Fifty-three percent of the cells from the WT control have five to six vacuoles per cell, and a smaller fraction (26%) have seven to eight vacuoles. In contrast, only 16.8% of the cells from the zip2/vps41 embryos have five to six vacuoles while the rest (88%) have seven or more. Similar results were detected for vps33-1 where 17% of the cells contain six or fewer vacuoles, while the rest (83%) had seven or more. Finally, almost all of the vps33-2 mutant embryos showed seven to eight vacuoles per cell. These results support the hypothesis that VPS41 and VPS33 are involved in vacuole homotypic fusion and are important for PSV maturation. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab HOPS is required for protein storage and lytic vacuole morphology. (A–D) Morphology of protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) in mature embryos from the WT control (Col-0) (A), zip2/vps41 (B), vps33-1 (C), and vps33-2 (D). Autofluorescence of the PSVs was acquired by CLSM. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (E) Vacuole number distribution in mature embryos. Embryos from WT control (Col-0), vps33-1, vps33-2, and zip2/vps41 were imaged as in A–D, and the number of vacuoles per cell was counted. Only cells with a cross-section area between 11 and 15.9 µm2 were included in the analysis. Bars represent the percentage of cells with less than 4 (blue), 5–6 (orange), 7–8 (gray), 9–10 (red), and 11 or more (green) vacuoles per cell in each genotype. Col-0, n = 165 cells; zip2, n = 146 cells; vps33-1, n = 154 cells; vps33-2, n = 118 cells. (F–N) Vacuole morphology of amiRNA lines after DEX induction. Seedlings from Col-0 WT (control, F–H), amiR-vps41 (I–K), and amiR-vps11 (L–N) were incubated for 72 h with DEX and stained with BCECF and FM4-64. Roots were imaged at the meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ). (Scale bar: 20 µm.)A dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible amiRNA system was used to determine the function of HOPS in developing seedlings. The HOPS-CORE subunit VPS11 and the HOPS-specific subunit VPS41 were targeted by the inducible amiRNA system. WT, amiR-vps41, and amiR-vps11 seedlings were treated with DMSO (control) or DEX for 72 h, and vacuole morphology was observed by 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) staining. Normal vacuole morphology was observed in both amiR-vps11 and amiR-vps41 in the absence of DEX compared with the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S3G) and in the WT after DEX treatment (Fig. 3 F–H). In contrast, dramatic changes in vacuole morphology were observed after DEX induction of the two lines. Both amiR-vps41 (Fig. 3 I–K) and amiR-vps11 (Fig. 3 L–N) seedlings showed highly fragmented vacuoles in meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ) of the root after DEX induction. We note that the phenotype was observed only in cells that were not elongated at the time of induction. This phenotype together with the PSV phenotype of allelic mutants demonstrates a critical role of HOPS for vacuole fusion and biogenesis. VPS41 and VPS33 Interact in Vivo with Each Other and with SYP22 in Specific Foci. If HOPS is involved in membrane fusion at the vacuole, it is likely to interact with the vacuolar SNARE complex (17, 18), including SYP22 and VTI11. To determine whether VPS41 and VPS33 interact with each other and with the vacuolar SNAREs, split YFP fusion proteins were constructed for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments in Nicotiana leaf epidermis (59, 60). Only N-terminal n/cYFP fusions of the SNARE proteins were used because the C termini of vacuolar SNAREs reside in the vacuole lumen. For VPS33 and VPS41, both N- and C-terminal constructs were generated, but none of the C-terminal n/cYFP fusions restored YFP signal in any combination. Coexpression of cYFP-VPS41 with nYFP-VPS33 resulted in a punctate pattern at the vacuole periphery (Fig. 4A), indicating that VPS41 and VPS33 are likely to participate in the HOPS complex. Coexpression of the same cYFP-VPS41 construct with the SNARE fusion nYFP-SYP22 resulted in a punctate pattern as well, indicating that these two proteins interact in vivo (Fig. 4B). In contrast, no YFP fluorescence was detected when cYFP-VPS41 was coexpressed with nYFP-VTI11 (Fig. 4C). Note that broad fluorescent structures (asterisks) in Fig. 4 B and C are likely background signal because they were observed in negative controls (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B). Next, we tested interactions with VPS33. Again, coexpression of cYFP-VPS33 with nYFP-VPS41 resulted in a punctate pattern indicative of protein–protein interaction (Fig. 4D). When cYFP-VPS33 was coexpressed with nYFP-SYP22, a strong YFP signal was detected in punctate foci (Fig. 4E), supporting the hypothesis that HOPS and SNAREs interact to mediate membrane fusion. Similar to the VPS41 interactions, no YFP fluorescence was detected when cYFP-VPS33 and nYFP-VTI11 were coexpressed, suggesting the absence of close interactions between these two proteins in vivo (Fig. 4F). To further validate these results, the c/nYFP-VPS33 was coexpressed with a n/cYFP- fusion to the aquaporin TIP2;1 as a negative control. No YFP signal was detected in either combination (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 D and E), which confirms the lack of interaction for the negative controls. The two vacuolar SNAREs VTI11 and SYP22 were used as positive controls as they have been shown to interact (21) and localize at the PVC (18, 61). Indeed, coexpression of cYFP-VTI11 with nYFP-SYP22 as well as cYFP-SYP22 with nYFP-VTI11 resulted in similar punctate structures at the periphery of the vacuole (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 C and F). Overall, these data show that VPS33 and VPS41 can assemble in subcellular foci and that both proteins can interact in vivo with SYP22, but not with VTI11. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis for HOPS–SNARE interactions mediating membrane fusion at the vacuole. Fig. 4.

The purified proteins were mixed as indicated, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with an α-HIS antibody. Proteins from 5% of the input, immunoprecipitate (IP), or 5% of the flowthrough were separated by SDS/PAGE, and GST-VPS41 or GST-VPS33 were detected by Western blot with an α-GST antibody.

(H–K) Genetic interaction between hypomorphic HOPS mutant alleles and zig-1. Seedlings were stained for 2 h in LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) and acquired in LSCM. Abnormal vacuole morphology in the maturation zone was observed in zig-1 (H), vps33-1 zig-1 (J), and vps33-2 zig-1 mutants (K). The vacuole phenotype was complemented in the root differentiation zone (DZ) of the double-mutant zig-1 zip2 (I). (L–N) Loss of the VTI11 SNARE induces abnormal VPS41-GFP localization. VPS41-GFP was imaged in the Col-0 WT (L) or the zig-1 mutant background (M and N). The protein was found in bright aggregates at the junction of zig-1 vacuoles or in clusters in the cytosol as shown with the Airyscan mode of the confocal (N). (O–Q). Loss of the VTI11 SNARE induces abnormal VPS33-GFP localization. VPS33-GFP was imaged in the Col-0 WT (O) or zig-1 (P and Q). Details of the aggregates at the junction between unfused vacuoles can be observed in the Airyscan mode (Q). (Scale bars: 10 µm.) VSP33 Interacts Directly with the Qa SNARE SYP22. VPS33 mediates SNARE complex assembly in yeast (29), and we could detect interactions between VPS33, VPS41, and SYP22 by BiFC. Therefore, we tested whether either of the two HOPS subunits could support a direct interaction with SYP22 by in vitro coimmunopreciptation. Proteins were expressed as tagged fusions to either GST (VPS33 and VPS41) or HIS (SYP22 and VTI11), and immunoprecipitation was carried out using an α-HIS antibody. GST-VPS41 was not detected in the α-HIS immunoprecipitate when incubated with either HIS-SYP22 or HIS-VTI11 (Fig. 4G), indicating a lack of direct interaction. In contrast, a direct interaction between GST-VPS33 and HIS-SYP22 was detected using this assay, as GST-VPS33 was detected in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4G). This interaction was confirmed in a complementary experiment where α-GST pulled down both HIS-SYP22 and GST-VPS33 in the coimmunoprecipitate (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Whether or not there were direct interactions with HIS-VTI11 was less definitive. Incubation of GST-VPS33 and HIS-VTI11 with α-HIS produced detectable signals of GST-VPS33 on immunoblots (Fig. 4G), but no signal was detected for HIS-VTI11 when α-GST was used (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Overall, these data provide strong evidence that HOPS–SNARE interactions in plants are mediated by direct interaction of VPS33 and SYP22, most likely due to conserved mechanisms. The HOPS Subunit VPS41 Genetically Interacts with the VTI11 SNARE. The evidence for protein–protein interactions between HOPS subunits and the vacuolar SNARE SYP22 prompted us to test for genetic interactions between the two complexes. zip2, a mutant allele of VPS41 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A), was identified as a suppressor of the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1, a loss-of-function allele of VTI11 (56). To determine whether zip2 suppresses the vacuole phenotype of zig-1, vacuoles from the zig-1 zip2 double mutants were visualized with LysoTracker Red (Fig. 4 H–K). The zig-1 mutant displayed the previously described vacuole phenotype in both the root tip and root maturation zone (2) (Fig. 4H and SI Appendix, Fig. S4H). The zig-1 zip2 still exhibited multiple vacuoles near the root tip (SI Appendix, Fig. S4I), but this phenotype was not observed in the root maturation zone (Fig. 4I). These results indicate that zip2 partially suppresses the zig-1 phenotype at the subcellular level and confirm a genetic interaction between ZIP2/VPS41 and VTI11. Furthermore, this result suggests that the zip2 mutation results in changes in the VPS41 protein structure that may alter the interactions between HOPS and SNAREs. A similar approach was used to test for genetic interactions between VPS33 and VTI11, but unlike zig-1 zip2 doubles, vps33-1 zig-1 and vps33-2 zig-1 double mutants showed the abnormal zig-1 vacuole phenotype in all root cells (Fig. 4 J and K and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 J and K) and the zig-zagged phenotype of the inflorescence. These results indicate that the vps33-1 and vps33-2 mutations failed to complement the vacuole phenotype, perhaps due to their hypomorphic nature, which may have innocuous effects on the VPS33 protein. The proposed interaction between HOPS and SNAREs led us to predict that loss of the VTI11 SNARE from the vacuole could alter the localization of VPS41 or VPS33. We tested this possibility in zig-1 mutants. VPS41-GFP localization in the WT background showed the cytosolic, punctate, and tonoplast localization previously described (Fig. 4L). In contrast, VPS41-GFP was not detected at the tonoplast and only accumulated in bright aggregated patterns in the zig-1 background (Fig. 4M). When visualized using the Airyscan mode of the microscope, these bright patterns were associated with adjacent vacuoles or clusters of small organelles in the cytosol (Fig. 4N). A similar result was obtained with VPS33-GFP. In contrast to the dispersed puncta of VPS33-GFP in the WT (Fig. 4O), zig-1 mutants showed clustered structures labeled with VPS33-GFP (Fig. 4 P and Q). At least some of these clusters represent small vacuoles as similar clusters were detected in zig-1 mutants labeled with RFP-SYP22 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 L–N). These results indicate that a functional SNARE complex is required for the normal localization of VPS41 and VPS33.",
    "discussion": "Discussion The plant HOPS tethering complex is evolutionarily conserved with other eukaryotes (3, 31, 35), is involved in vacuole traffic via a RAB7-mediated pathway, and is critical for homotypic vacuole fusion (3). HOPS shares four subunits with CORVET, a similar conserved complex that mediates tethering of RAB5 endosomes and vacuoles in a plant-specific manner (3). Our results show that stable VPS33–VPS41 interactions predominantly occur in punctate organelles likely to correspond to endosomes as expected for a tether between endosomes and vacuoles. The possibility remains, however, that the functional HOPS complex also assembles transiently at sites of vacuole homotypic fusions, which are not abundant in the cells used in these experiments. HOPS is essential for vacuole membrane fusion in plants. VPS33 and VPS41 are essential in pollen fertility, and in fact, loss of VPS41 function interfered with pollen penetration into the stigma (4). This and previous results (3, 4, 33, 34) indicate that HOPS is essential for plant viability. The increased number of PSVs of hypomorphic mutants zip2, vps33-1, and vps33-2 is indicative of HOPS function in PSV fusion or trafficking, as it has been observed in other vacuolar trafficking mutants (2, 18, 43, 62, 63). Moreover, the inducible amiRNA silencing of VPS41 and VPS11 underscores HOPS function in lytic vacuole fusion. Phosphoinositides and Membrane Curvature Delimit VPS41 and VPS33 Recruitment. VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP localize to late endosomes, which is consistent with a role in membrane fusion at the PVC and vacuole as part of HOPS (31) and with previous results in pollen tubes (4). The exclusive presence of VPS41 at the vacuole, however, was unexpected. One interpretation is that VPS33 recruitment to the vacuole is transient and limited to sites of membrane fusion, while VPS41 binding to the tonoplast is stable and results from specific lipid-binding affinities. Even though both proteins showed affinity for most phosphoinositides in a lipid strip assay, these results do not rule out the possibility of different affinities to specific phosphoinositides or that their recruitment to specific membranes is enhanced by interaction with other proteins. Two other HOPS subunits, VPS18 and VPS39, the latter being HOPS specific, are also absent from the vacuole (3). Given the competing needs of the core subunits VPS33, VPS18, VPS11, and VPS16 for either HOPS or CORVET assembly, the stable recruitment of VPS41 to the tonoplast could serve as a reservoir for this subunit in a way that does not compete for complex assembly. Phosphoinositides recruit HOPS to the vertex ring between two juxtaposed vacuoles undergoing fusion in yeast (27, 52). We hypothesized that these lipids could fulfill a similar role in plants, and this was first supported by VPS41 and VPS33 binding to immobilized phosphoinositides on a membrane. Surprisingly, both VPS33 and VPS41 also bound to membrane liposomes but only in the absence of PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2. This result implicates membrane curvature as an additional factor in the recruitment of HOPS to cellular membranes in plants and highlights the sensitivity of these proteins to both membrane topology and phosphoinositide lipid content. The plant vacuole membrane is a flat surface compared with the late endosomes, and membrane curvature could indeed represent a proxy for organelle identity in plant vacuole traffic. We propose that VPS41 binding to the vacuole membrane entails its recruitment by PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2, since PtdIns(3)P has been detected at the tonoplast, and both are important for vacuolar traffic (64, 65). In contrast, VPS41 binding to curved membranes such as those of late endosomes is independent of and inhibited by phosphoinositides. This model is further supported by the loss of VPS41-GFP from the vacuole membrane but not from late endosomes in Wm-treated cells. The inhibitory effect of phosphoinositides on VPS33 and VPS41 binding to liposomes suggests that plants have evolved different mechanisms of regulating vacuole fusion compared with yeast. In contrast to plants, the complete yeast HOPS complex and VPS41 alone bind to liposomes containing vacuolar phosphoinositides, but they do not bind strongly to bare liposomes (27, 66, 67). Therefore, while phosphoinositides promote recruitment of HOPS to curved membranes in yeast, they have the opposite effect in plants. Current models for vacuole fusion propose that the site of HOPS function, the vertex of two juxtaposed vacuoles, represents a highly curved membrane (68, 69). Moreover, small liposomes may be used as a proxy for HOPS interactions with the membrane at the vertex ring (68). The liposomes used here are not small enough to represent membrane curvature at sites of vacuole fusion, but if phosphoinositides also abolish HOPS binding at these sites, it would be consistent with yet another phenomenon observed only in plants. Our group has shown that Wm induces vacuole fusion in plants, both in developing roots and in guard cells, and we proposed that phosphoinositides function as negative regulators of vacuole fusion (2). This effect of Wm, however, is not observed in yeast vacuoles (48) or animal lysosomes (49), and therefore, plants seemed to have coerced the regulatory role of phosphoinositides into inhibitors rather than promoters of vacuole fusion. This difference may be due to evolutionary changes in the mechanisms by which VPS41 binds to membranes. VPS41 binding to highly curved membranes in yeast is mediated by an amphipathic lipid packing sensor (ALPS) motif, which also contains two important regulatory phosphorylation sites (67). The ALPS motif is not conserved in plants including Arabidopsis (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), which further supports the existence of plant-specific mechanisms for recruitment of HOPS to highly curved membranes. PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 are important phosphoinositides for vacuole traffic and dynamics (64). PtdIns(3,5)P2 is produced by phosphorylation of the PtdIns(3)P precursor by the PI5 kinases FAB1A and FAB1B (70), and FAB1A has been localized to late endosomes (71). A new sensor of PtdIns(3,5)P2 indicates that this lipid accumulates in late endosomes (72), but it is not clear how much can persist after late endosome fusion with the vacuole. The possibility that PtdIns(3,5)P2 accumulates in the tonoplast is supported by the localization of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatases SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN 2–5 (SAC2–5) exclusively to the vacuole membrane (73). Interestingly, Wm treatment resulted in significant dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, which could result from rapid depletion of PtdIns(3,5)P2 specifically in the tonoplast if both synthesis is stalled due to the unavailability of its precursor and active dephosphorylation by SAC phosphatases (73). PtdIns(3,5)P2 has recently emerged as an important regulator of plant growth, development, and stress responses. PtdIns(3,5)P2 is critical for polar growth (74) and is induced under osmotic stress in plants (75) and yeast (76). Loss of FAB1A and FAB1B results in pollen lethality due to the formation of aberrantly large vacuoles during pollen development (77), which implicates PtdIns(3,5)P2 in vacuole biogenesis. Moreover, PtdIns(3,5)P2 was found to be important for vacuole acidification and fragmentation during stomata closing (78), and loss of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatases SAC2–5, which is expected to increase its accumulation in membranes, induces vacuole fragmentation in Arabidopsis roots (73). It is tempting to speculate that these roles of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in promoting vacuole fragmentation in guard cells during stomata closure result from its inhibitory effect on VPS33 and VPS41 recruitment to sites of apposing vacuole membranes, which would be otherwise available for fusion. Our results suggest that vacuolar phosphoinositides are likely to play an important role in vacuole fusion–fragmentation dynamics by controlling the recruitment of HOPS to apposing vacuole membranes. Further research is necessary to test this hypothesis. HOPS–SNARE Interactions Are Mediated by the SYP22 Qa SNARE. The HOPS complex is expected to interact with SNARE proteins to regulate membrane fusion at the vacuole. That zip2/vps41 partially suppressed the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1/vti11 is consistent with functional interactions between HOPS and the vacuole SNARE complexes containing VTI11 and SYP22. The mutation in zip2/vps41 may result in altered HOPS–SNARE interactions or the ability of HOPS to promote or proofread the SNARE complex assembly. Furthermore, the altered localization of VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP in the zig-1 mutant is consistent with a functional interaction between HOPS and SNARE that mediates vacuole fusion. We speculate that the bright punctate localizations of the tagged VPS41 and VPS33 in zig-1 may represent nonfunctional fusogenic complexes where SNAREs and HOPS are retained, with delays in their tonoplast accumulation and recycling. This was also observed when the SYP22 SNARE was localized to the same clusters of organelles. Furthermore, we previously hypothesized that the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1 mutants could result from a putative proofreading activity of HOPS upon the mismatched vacuolar SNARE complex missing VTI11 (2), as it has been shown for yeast (79). The aggregation of VPS41 molecules in zig-1 is consistent with such activity, as HOPS could be loaded onto the abnormal SNARE complex while preventing fusion to occur. Further experiments are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. BiFC experiments showed that both HOPS subunits, VPS33 and VPS41, interacted with SYP22 in vivo, but only the VPS33–SYP22 interaction was detected in vitro. This is consistent with a role of HOPS as a chaperone for SNARE complex assembly (see below) and with coimmunoprecipitation between VCL1 and SYP22 in Arabidopsis seedlings (35). These interactions were detected in punctate structures similar to those of VPS33-VPS41 and VTI11-SYP22, suggesting that HOPS–SNARE interactions probably occur in late endosomes. Neither VPS33 or VPS41 interacted with VTI11 in the BiFC assay, which suggests that SNARE–HOPS interactions are not mediated by VTI11 protein surfaces. Overall, our results are consistent with the current model for HOPS–SNARE interactions that mediate membrane fusion in yeast. In this model, VPS33 binding to the Qa-SNARE Vam3 is the first step for SNARE complex assembly. The VPS33–Qa-SNARE interaction is thought to promote a conformational change, which exposes binding surfaces for other SNAREs on the VPS33 subunit (80). The interactions between VPS33 and SYP22, both in BiFC and in vitro, suggest that this mechanism is conserved in plants. Therefore, initial binding of VPS33 and SYP22 may be the first step in the HOPS–SNARE interactions that mediate vacuole fusion in plants.",

Significance Plant vacuoles are essential organelles and occupy up to 90% of the cell volume. Their roles include regulation of stomata movements, protein storage in seeds, gravity sensing, and ion homeostasis. Vacuole or lysosome fusion in eukaryotes is mediated by two multisubunit complexes, SNARE and homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS), but only the SNARE complex is well characterized in plants. Here, we show that, similar to other eukaryotes, HOPS mediates vacuole fusion in plants by interaction with SNAREs and that the HOPS subunit VPS33 and the SNARE protein SYP22 display the sites for interaction between these complexes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, however, plant HOPS recruitment to liposomes is inhibited by phosphoinositides, which appear to define strict rules for regulating fusion and fragmentation of dynamic vacuoles. Keywords: Arabidopsis, vacuole fusion, HOPS, SNARE, phosphoinositidesAbstract The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germination, stomata opening, and gravity perception. Known components of the vacuole fusion machinery in eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryogenesis and pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that Arabidopsis HOPS subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacuole fragmentation phenotypes and demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide evidence for genetic interactions between VPS41 and VTI11 SNARE that regulate vacuole fusion, and the requirement of a functional SNARE complex for normal VPS41 and VPS33 localization. Finally, we provide evidence to support VPS33 and SYP22 at the initial stage for HOPS–SNARE interactions, which is similar to other eukaryotes. These results highlight both conserved and specific mechanisms for HOPS recruitment and function during vacuole fusion in plants. The plant vacuole is an essential organelle with multiple roles including storage, pH homeostasis, and recycling (1). Vacuole fusion is required for stomata opening, pollen fertility, and embryo viability (2–4). Two types of vacuoles exist in plant cells. Embryos in developing seeds contain multiple protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), which have a neutral pH and accumulate storage proteins such as the 7S and 11S globulins. Cells in most mature tissues, instead, contain one large lytic vacuole, which is acidic, abundant in lytic proteases, and critical for ion homeostasis and cell turgor (5). Transition from PSVs to lytic vacuoles occurs during germination (6) and involves PSV fusion and maturation (7). Vacuoles in root meristematic cells are formed by interconnected tubular structures (8), and membrane fusion is necessary for the establishment of the central lytic vacuole (2). Transient and mobile structures such as transvacuolar strands, sheets, and bulbs contribute to the dynamic nature of plant vacuoles (9–12). In vegetative cells, however, very little vacuole fragmentation occurs and most cells contain a single large vacuole. Two exceptions are the changes in guard cell vacuoles during stomata movements (2, 13, 14) and in the leaf motor cells of the mimosa tree (Albizia julibrissin) (15). In both cases, vacuole remodeling occurs during dramatic changes in cellular turgor that drive organ movements. The changes in guard cell vacuoles that occur during stomata opening require homotypic membrane fusion mediated by the vacuolar soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex containing VTI11 (2). Vacuole fusion is not well characterized in plants, but in eukaryotic cells it requires SNAREs, RAB GTPases, membrane lipids, and a tethering complex. SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion by assembly of a four-helix bundle, or trans-SNARE complex, from one SNARE located in the incoming vesicle and three SNAREs located in the target membrane. The SNARE complex brings the two membranes together via a zippering mechanism that is thought to result in membrane fusion (16). A SNARE complex for plant prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and the vacuole is composed of SYP22/VAM3 (Qa-SNARE), VTI11 (Qb-SNARE, called Vti1p in yeast), SYP51 (Qc-SNARE), and VAMP727 (R-SNARE) (17, 18). The Qabc complex can also associate with the R-SNAREs VAMP711 or VAMP713 (19, 20). A role of these SNAREs in vacuole fusion is evidenced by altered vacuole phenotypes of vti11, syp22, and syp22 vamp727 double mutants (2, 18, 21). The homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex was recently shown to mediate homotypic vacuole fusion in plants (3). HOPS is important for the fusion of vacuoles in yeast (16, 22), and fusion of lysosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans (23) and humans (24). The yeast HOPS complex is the best characterized and is formed by six subunits. Vps39p and Vps41p are HOPS specific, while Vps11p, Vps16p, Vps18p, and Vps33p form the “CORE” and are shared with CORVET, a tethering complex that functions at the early endosome (25, 26). HOPS recruitment to yeast vacuole membranes requires phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(4,5)P2, two important regulatory lipids in vacuole fusion (27). Vps33 belongs to the family of Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, which are implicated in assembly and regulation of SNARE complexes. SM proteins have a three-domain architecture, in which domains 1 and 3 form a cleft that accommodates the SNAREs (28). The X-ray structure of a fungal Vps33 bound to a single SNARE, together with in vitro fusion assays, suggests that VPS33 catalyzes SNARE complex assembly through a specific SNARE motif recognition (29). All other HOPS subunits are predicted to form a β-propeller at the N terminus and an α-solenoid at the C terminus (30). The complete HOPS complex has been detected in Arabidopsis by mass spectrometry (3), and all subunits are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome as single genes (31). VACUOLELESS1 (VCL1), the homolog of yeast Vps16, VPS11, VPS39, and VPS41 are required for vacuole biogenesis and pollen development (3, 4, 32–35). VCL1 interacts with VPS33 and VPS11 and localizes to PVCs and the tonoplast (35). VPS18 and VPS39 were also localized to a subdomain of the tonoplast and to cytosolic organelles (3). The molecular mechanisms for HOPS function and regulation during vacuole fusion in plants are not well characterized. The RAB5 and RAB7 GTPase families have been implicated in regulation of endosomes maturation and membrane fusion at the vacuole (36). RAB5 and RAB7 localize to partially overlapping endosome populations, with only RAB7 detected at the tonoplast (19, 37–41). The current model is that the SAND-CCZ complex is a RAB5 effector, exerts GEF function on RAB7, and is necessary for the conversion of RAB5 to RAB7 in PVCs (42–44). Active RAB7 is required for vacuolar localization of HOPS subunits VPS18 and VPS39 (3). Plant homotypic vacuole fusion is also regulated by phosphoinositides. Pollen grains defective in phosphatidylinositol 4-phophate 5-kinase 1 (PI5K1) and PI5K2 have larger vacuoles than the WT, which implicates PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vacuole biogenesis (45). Depletion of PtdIns(3)P after wortmannin (Wm) treatment induces rapid vacuole membrane fusion in root and hypocotyl cells of vti11/zig1 mutants and in guard cells of WT (2). Wm treatment also induces the swelling of plant PVCs, which results in doughnut-shaped structures known as Wm bodies (46). These effects of Wm are due to its inhibitory action against phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (47) and implicate PtdIns(3)P and other phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion in plants. Interestingly, these effects of Wm have not been observed in yeast or animal cells (48, 49), suggesting the possibility of specific mechanisms for plant vacuole fusion. Here, we characterized VPS41 and VPS33 using reverse genetics, fluorescently tagged proteins, and biochemical analyses. We show that VPS41 and VPS33 are important for pollen fertility and PSV maturation in embryos, and that VPS41 is required for homotypic vacuole fusion in developing seedlings. We demonstrate that both proteins localize to late endosomes, that only VPS41 is detected in the tonoplast, and that they interact with each other and with the vacuolar SNARE SYP22. The VPS41-GFP localization at the tonoplast, but not that at late endosomes, is Wm sensitive. In vitro lipid–protein binding assays show that while VPS33 and VPS41 bind to phosphoinositides on lipid strips, neither protein binds to PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2-containing liposomes, even though they do bind to control liposomes. We speculate that specific affinities for membrane lipids together with membrane curvature are key regulatory mechanisms behind vacuole fusion events mediated by HOPS and SNAREs. Results VPS41 and VPS33 Partially Colocalize with Late Endosomes, but only VPS41 Is Detected at the Tonoplast. VPS41 (AT1G08190) and VPS33 (AT3G54860) share 23.29% and 19.17% sequence identity with yeast Vps41p and Vps33p, respectively. Therefore, VPS33 and VPS41 are likely homologs of these yeast HOPS proteins (31, 50). We first investigated whether VPS41 and VPS33 colocalized in vacuolar or prevacuolar membranes, as expected for HOPS. Transient expression of mRFP-VPS41 and VPS33-GFP under control of UBQ10 promoters in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves indicated that these proteins accumulate in the cytosol and nucleus, and associate with membranes in punctate structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B). RFP-VPS41 and VPS33-GFP colocalized in the majority of the punctate structures and the nucleus, and partially at the cell periphery (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C), which supports their participation in a complex. These experiments, however, do not provide enough resolution to identify the compartments where these proteins accumulate and they may be influenced by overexpression. To better characterize protein localizations, VPS41-GFP (4) and VPS33-GFP were analyzed in stable Arabidopsis transgenic plants using full-length genomic fusions to GFP under native promoters. Both proteins were again detected in the cytosol, but membrane association was more discernible. Similar to its localization in pollen (4), VPS41-GFP was detected at the tonoplast and punctate organelles in roots (Fig. 1A), and this localization was not affected by the location of the fluorescence tag as the localization of YFP-VPS41 was very similar (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). Colocalization with known organelle markers was used to identify the structures labeled with VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP. VPS41-GFP colocalized with the tonoplast marker RFP-SYP22 (18) and confirmed its tonoplast association (Fig. 1 A–C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1E). Furthermore, VPS41-GFP partially colocalized with mCherry-RAB7, a marker for the late stages of PVC maturation (51) (Fig. 1 D–F), consistent with results from pollen (4). Colocalization with the early PVC marker mCherry-RAB5 (51) was detected in only a few organelles (Fig. 1 G–I). These results indicate that VPS41-GFP localizes to the vacuole and late endosomes. Similar experiments with VPS33-GFP indicate that VPS41 and VPS33 have overlapping but not identical localizations. VPS33-GFP rarely colocalized with RFP-SYP22 at the tonoplast, except for a few puncta (Fig. 1 J–L and SI Appendix, Fig. S1F), indicating that this protein is absent from the vacuole. VPS33-GFP is present in the cytosol and in cytosolic punctate structures, where it partially colocalized with mCherry-RAB7 (Fig. 1 M–O) and shows strong colocalization with mCherry-RAB5 (Fig. 1 P–R). Quantification of these colocalization experiments further validates the overlapping but distinct localization of VPS33 and VPS41 (Fig. 1 S and T). Both proteins show significant colocalization with RAB7 endosomes. While VPS33 has the strongest colocalization with RAB5 endosomes, it is weakly colocalized with the tonoplast marker SYP22. In contrast, VPS41 shows significant accumulation at the tonoplast but is not associated with RAB5 endosomes (Fig. 1 S and T). Interestingly, both VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP seem to accumulate in more endosomal compartments when coexpressed with mCherry-RAB5 (compare Fig. 1A with Fig. 1G and Fig. 1J with Fig. 1P). The effect of the mCherry-RAB5 fusion on the recruitment or stability of these proteins at the endosome or the endosomes themselves will require further analysis beyond the scope of this work. Overall, these results suggest that VPS33 and VPS41 are cytosolic proteins that preferentially associate with late endosomal compartments, and this is consistent with a role for HOPS in the tethering of vacuoles or prevacuoles. Interestingly, only VPS41 is detected at the tonoplast, and only VPS33 has significant accumulation in RAB5 endosomes. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Subcellular localization of VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP. Genomic fusion constructs of VPS41 (VPS41-GFP) and VPS33 (VPS33-GFP) driven by native promoters were cotransformed with subcellular markers into Arabidopsis, and root cells were imaged by confocal microscopy. (A–I) Colocalization of VPS41-GFP (A, D, and G) with mRFP-SYP22 (B), mCherry-RAB7 (E), or mCherry-RAB5 (H) in root cells of stably transformed Arabidopsis seedlings. Corresponding merged images are shown (C, F, and I). Arrowheads indicate sites of marker colocalization at the tonoplast, and arrows point to colocalization in endosomes. (Scale bars: 20 µm.) (J–R) Colocalization of VPS33-GFP (J, M, and P) with mRFP-SYP22 (K), mCherry-RAB7 (N), or mCherry-RAB5 (Q). The merged images are shown (L, O, and R).

(S and T) Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients from the colocalization analyses between VPS41-GFP (S) or VPS33-GFP (T) with mRFP-SYP22, mCherry-RAB5, or mChery-RAB7. Thirty-seven to 56 images from nine seedlings combined were used for each analysis. Bars represent SE.VPS41 Tonoplast Association Is Dependent on Phosphoinositides. The distinct localizations of VPS33-GFP and VPS41-GFP prompted us to test whether the two proteins were characterized by different phospholipid binding affinities. This was tested using an in vitro lipid-binding assay with recombinant proteins. GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Purified proteins were incubated on lipid strips, and protein binding was detected with anti-GST. GST alone was used as negative control (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Both GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 show affinity toward all phosphoinositides in this assay, including the two that are most abundant at the late endosomes and vacuole, PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that VPS41 and VPS33 association with membranes may be regulated in part by phosphoinositide binding. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Phosphoinositides regulate the membrane association of VPS41. (A) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to phosphoinositide lipids. GST-VPS41 (Center) and GST-VPS33 (Right) were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Lipid affinity of purified proteins was analyzed using a lipid strip assay. Lipids include the following: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphocholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate. (B) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to liposomes that lack phosphoinositides. Affinity-purified GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 proteins were incubated without liposomes (none) or with PC/PE liposomes bearing no phosphoinositides (control), PtdIns(3)P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2, and protein binding was detected by cosedimentation and immunoblot with α-GST. Incubation with PI(3)P-GRIP was used as positive control, and GST alone was used as negative control. (C–H) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, but not from endosomes. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (C and F) and mCherry-RAB7 (D and G) were treated with DMSO (C–E) or 33 µM Wm (F–H) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. Merged images are shown (E and H). Tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP is indicated with arrowheads. Wm induced the enlargement of RAB7-labeled endosomes (arrows) that retained VPS41-GFP signal. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (I–N) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast. Arabidopsis seedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (I and L) and mRFP-SYP22 (J and M) were treated with DMSO (I–K) or 33 µM Wm (L–N) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. VPS41-GFP signal is depicted using a rainbow LUT (I and L), where high intensity values are represented in red and low intensity values are shown in blue. Red pixels were associated with the tonoplast in the DMSO control only. Merged images are shown using green color for the GFP signal (K and N). (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (O) Quantification of the tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP from I–N. The ratio between the membrane and cytosolic fluorescence intensity of VPS41-GFP was calculated using ImageJ from DMSO or Wm-treated seedlings (N = 27 images from seven to eight seedlings per treatment; *significant in a t test at P < 0.05).To characterize lipid binding in a physiological context, we used a liposome-binding assay that better resembles lipid binding in a bilayer. Phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) liposomes bearing either no phosphoinositide, PtdIns(3)P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2 were incubated in the presence of recombinant proteins, and binding was assayed by cosedimentation. As shown in Fig. 2B, both GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bound to the control liposomes, indicating that these proteins have strong affinity for neutral lipids. Surprisingly, addition of PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2 abolished this binding, which suggests that VPS33 and VPS41 membrane binding is tightly controlled. The PI(3)P-GRIP protein which contains a PtdIns(3)P-binding domain was used as a positive control, and GST was used as a negative control. These results underscore VPS41 and VPS33 sensitivities to phosphoinositides and to the different presentation of these lipids between the flat surface of the lipid strip and the curved membrane of the liposomes. PtdIns(3)P is a negative regulator for homotypic vacuole fusion in plants (2) and recruits HOPS to the vortex ring in yeast (52). Hence, PtdIns(3)P and other phosphoinositides are good candidates to regulate HOPS subunit association with the vacuole and PVC. We therefore asked whether the localizations of GFP-VPS41 was affected by phosphoinositide availability using Wm treatment, which results in PtdIns(3)P depletion from cellular membranes (53). GFP-VPS41 was found at the tonoplast and some mCherry-RAB7-labeled endosomes, in the DMSO control as expected (Fig. 2 C–E). Wm treatment resulted in PVC swelling with the characteristic doughnut-like structures that were decorated with both VPS41-GFP and mCherry-RAB7 (Fig. 2 F–H), which suggests that Wm treatment did not alter the VPS41 association with late endosome membranes. Remarkably, VPS41-GFP was no longer detected at the tonoplast after Wm treatment (Fig. 2 F–H). To quantify the loss of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, we used the RFP-SYP22 marker as a proxy for vacuole membrane localization. As shown in Fig. 2 I–K, the sites of highest VPS41-GFP fluorescence intensity in the control colocalize with RFP-SYP22 at the tonoplast. This tonoplast bright signal is lost after the Wm treatment (Fig. 2 L–N). Quantification of these results further indicates that Wm treatment results in a 35% decrease in the membrane/cytosolic ratio of VPS41-GFP (Fig. 2O). These results indicate that tonoplast association of VPS41 is mediated by phosphoinositide binding, but its association with late endosome membranes is independent of phosphoinositides. Major changes in VPS33-GFP localization were not detected after Wm treatment as a few RAB7 endosomes were still labeled with VPS33-GFP (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 B–G).HOPS Is Essential for Male Fertility and Important for Plant Development. To define the role of VPS41 and VPS33 in vacuole fusion and dynamics, we identified loss-of-function alleles for VPS41 and VPS33 from the SALK T-DNA collection (54). T-DNA insertions were confirmed for vps41-1 (SALK_076372) and vps41-3 (SALK_036406), which carry the T-DNA insertions in the 13th exon and the promoter region of VPS41, respectively. Three T-DNA insertion alleles were confirmed for VPS33, vps33-3 (SALK_016684C), vps33-4 (SALK_151719), and vps33-5 (SALK_143407). These mutants carry the insertions in the 13th intron, the promoter, and the seventh exon of VPS33 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). RT-PCR from homozygous lines showed no altered VPS41 transcript accumulation for vps41-3, and this line was not used further. No homozygous plants were recovered from over 50 progeny of vps41-1/+, vps33-3/+, vps33-4/+, or vps33-5/+, and none had evidence for embryo abortion in siliques from heterozygous plants, which suggested the possibility of gametophyte lethality or sterility. To determine which gametophyte was unfertile, reciprocal crosses were performed between vps41-1/+ or vps33-3/+ and Col-0 WT plants to determine the male and female transmission efficiency (TE) (55) (SI Appendix, Table S1). The results show that transmission through the female gametes is not compromised in either mutant. However, male vps41-1 TE is abolished, indicating that VPS41 is essential for pollen fertility. The vps33-3 pollen, instead, is not completely sterile, but the male TE is strongly reduced to 16.1%. The pollen defects of vps33 and vps41 loss-of-function alleles are consistent with previous reports (4, 32) and, together with the phenotype of vps18 and vps39 mutants recently reported (3), support an important role of the HOPS complex in male gametophyte development. Similar to VPS41-GFP (4), the full-length genomic fusion construct for VPS33-GFP complements the pollen fertility defects of loss-of-function mutants as homozygous vps33-3 can be recovered (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B–D).HOPS Is Important for Vacuole Biogenesis and Fusion. We identified viable weaker alleles to characterize VPS41 and VPS33 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). One EMS allele for VPS41, zip2/vps41 (56), and two viable TILLING (57) alleles of VPS33, vps33-1 and vps33-2, are available. The zip2/vps41 allele was identified from a screen of suppressors of zig-1/vti11 in gravitropism (56). The mutation results in a G721R substitution within an annotated clathrin heavy chain repeat (CHCR) of the VPS41 protein that is predicted to mediate protein–protein interactions (58). The mutations in vps33-1 and vps33-2 result in S95F and V136M substitutions in the VPS33 protein, respectively. Both are predicted to occur in domain 1 of the VPS33 protein, which, together with domain 3, has been shown in fungi and yeast to form a cleft that is thought to accommodate SNARE bundles (28). None of the single mutants shows developmental phenotypes in rosettes or inflorescences under normal growth conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S3E). No vacuole phenotypes were observed in zip2/vps41, vps33-1, or vps33-2 when seedling roots were analyzed using LysoTracker Red staining (SI Appendix, Fig. S3F). However, we observed an increased number of PSVs in mature zip2/vps41, vps33-1, and vps33-2 embryos compared with the WT (Fig. 3 A–D). The number of vacuoles per cell was counted in each genotype to quantify this defect (Fig. 3E). Only cells with a cross-section area between 11 and 15.9 µm2 were included in the analysis. Fifty-three percent of the cells from the WT control have five to six vacuoles per cell, and a smaller fraction (26%) have seven to eight vacuoles. In contrast, only 16.8% of the cells from the zip2/vps41 embryos have five to six vacuoles while the rest (88%) have seven or more. Similar results were detected for vps33-1 where 17% of the cells contain six or fewer vacuoles, while the rest (83%) had seven or more. Finally, almost all of the vps33-2 mutant embryos showed seven to eight vacuoles per cell. These results support the hypothesis that VPS41 and VPS33 are involved in vacuole homotypic fusion and are important for PSV maturation. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab HOPS is required for protein storage and lytic vacuole morphology. (A–D) Morphology of protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) in mature embryos from the WT control (Col-0) (A), zip2/vps41 (B), vps33-1 (C), and vps33-2 (D). Autofluorescence of the PSVs was acquired by CLSM. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (E) Vacuole number distribution in mature embryos. Embryos from WT control (Col-0), vps33-1, vps33-2, and zip2/vps41 were imaged as in A–D, and the number of vacuoles per cell was counted. Only cells with a cross-section area between 11 and 15.9 µm2 were included in the analysis. Bars represent the percentage of cells with less than 4 (blue), 5–6 (orange), 7–8 (gray), 9–10 (red), and 11 or more (green) vacuoles per cell in each genotype. Col-0, n = 165 cells; zip2, n = 146 cells; vps33-1, n = 154 cells; vps33-2, n = 118 cells. (F–N) Vacuole morphology of amiRNA lines after DEX induction. Seedlings from Col-0 WT (control, F–H), amiR-vps41 (I–K), and amiR-vps11 (L–N) were incubated for 72 h with DEX and stained with BCECF and FM4-64. Roots were imaged at the meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ). (Scale bar: 20 µm.)A dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible amiRNA system was used to determine the function of HOPS in developing seedlings. The HOPS-CORE subunit VPS11 and the HOPS-specific subunit VPS41 were targeted by the inducible amiRNA system. WT, amiR-vps41, and amiR-vps11 seedlings were treated with DMSO (control) or DEX for 72 h, and vacuole morphology was observed by 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) staining. Normal vacuole morphology was observed in both amiR-vps11 and amiR-vps41 in the absence of DEX compared with the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S3G) and in the WT after DEX treatment (Fig. 3 F–H). In contrast, dramatic changes in vacuole morphology were observed after DEX induction of the two lines. Both amiR-vps41 (Fig. 3 I–K) and amiR-vps11 (Fig. 3 L–N) seedlings showed highly fragmented vacuoles in meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ) of the root after DEX induction. We note that the phenotype was observed only in cells that were not elongated at the time of induction. This phenotype together with the PSV phenotype of allelic mutants demonstrates a critical role of HOPS for vacuole fusion and biogenesis.VPS41 and VPS33 Interact in Vivo with Each Other and with SYP22 in Specific Foci. If HOPS is involved in membrane fusion at the vacuole, it is likely to interact with the vacuolar SNARE complex (17, 18), including SYP22 and VTI11. To determine whether VPS41 and VPS33 interact with each other and with the vacuolar SNAREs, split YFP fusion proteins were constructed for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments in Nicotiana leaf epidermis (59, 60). Only N-terminal n/cYFP fusions of the SNARE proteins were used because the C termini of vacuolar SNAREs reside in the vacuole lumen. For VPS33 and VPS41, both N- and C-terminal constructs were generated, but none of the C-terminal n/cYFP fusions restored YFP signal in any combination. Coexpression of cYFP-VPS41 with nYFP-VPS33 resulted in a punctate pattern at the vacuole periphery (Fig. 4A), indicating that VPS41 and VPS33 are likely to participate in the HOPS complex. Coexpression of the same cYFP-VPS41 construct with the SNARE fusion nYFP-SYP22 resulted in a punctate pattern as well, indicating that these two proteins interact in vivo (Fig. 4B). In contrast, no YFP fluorescence was detected when cYFP-VPS41 was coexpressed with nYFP-VTI11 (Fig. 4C). Note that broad fluorescent structures (asterisks) in Fig. 4 B and C are likely background signal because they were observed in negative controls (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B). Next, we tested interactions with VPS33. Again, coexpression of cYFP-VPS33 with nYFP-VPS41 resulted in a punctate pattern indicative of protein–protein interaction (Fig. 4D). When cYFP-VPS33 was coexpressed with nYFP-SYP22, a strong YFP signal was detected in punctate foci (Fig. 4E), supporting the hypothesis that HOPS and SNAREs interact to mediate membrane fusion. Similar to the VPS41 interactions, no YFP fluorescence was detected when cYFP-VPS33 and nYFP-VTI11 were coexpressed, suggesting the absence of close interactions between these two proteins in vivo (Fig. 4F). To further validate these results, the c/nYFP-VPS33 was coexpressed with a n/cYFP- fusion to the aquaporin TIP2;1 as a negative control. No YFP signal was detected in either combination (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 D and E), which confirms the lack of interaction for the negative controls. The two vacuolar SNAREs VTI11 and SYP22 were used as positive controls as they have been shown to interact (21) and localize at the PVC (18, 61). Indeed, coexpression of cYFP-VTI11 with nYFP-SYP22 as well as cYFP-SYP22 with nYFP-VTI11 resulted in similar punctate structures at the periphery of the vacuole (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 C and F). Overall, these data show that VPS33 and VPS41 can assemble in subcellular foci and that both proteins can interact in vivo with SYP22, but not with VTI11. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis for HOPS–SNARE interactions mediating membrane fusion at the vacuole. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab VPS41 and VPS33 interact and can bind the SNARE protein SYP22. (A–F) VPS41 and VPS33 interact in vivo and bind the SNARE protein SYP22. BiFC analysis of protein interactions in infiltrated N. benthamiana leaf cells by confocal microscopy. The N-terminal half (nY) or the C-terminal half (cY) of YFP were fused with VPS41, VPS33, SYP22, or VTI11. (A–C) cYFP-VPS41 interacts with nYFP-VPS33 (A), nYFP-SYP22 (B), but not with nYFP-VTI11 (C). (D–F) cYFP-VPS33 interacts with nYFP-VPS41 (D), nYFP-SYP22 (E), but not with nYFP-VTI11 (F). Asterisks indicate background signal that was observed in the negative control. (G) VPS33 binds the SYP22 SNARE in vitro. Recombinant GST-VPS41, GST-VPS33, HIS-SYP22, and HIS-VTI11 protein fusions were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. The purified proteins were mixed as indicated, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with an α-HIS antibody. Proteins from 5% of the input, immunoprecipitate (IP), or 5% of the flowthrough were separated by SDS/PAGE, and GST-VPS41 or GST-VPS33 were detected by Western blot with an α-GST antibody. Arrows indicate the expected sizes of GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33. The positions of 150-kDa (Top) and 100-kDa (Bottom) molecular markers are indicated with arrowheads. (H–K) Genetic interaction between hypomorphic HOPS mutant alleles and zig-1. Seedlings were stained for 2 h in LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) and acquired in LSCM. Abnormal vacuole morphology in the maturation zone was observed in zig-1 (H), vps33-1 zig-1 (J), and vps33-2 zig-1 mutants (K). The vacuole phenotype was complemented in the root differentiation zone (DZ) of the double-mutant zig-1 zip2 (I). (L–N) Loss of the VTI11 SNARE induces abnormal VPS41-GFP localization. VPS41-GFP was imaged in the Col-0 WT (L) or the zig-1 mutant background (M and N). The protein was found in bright aggregates at the junction of zig-1 vacuoles or in clusters in the cytosol as shown with the Airyscan mode of the confocal (N). (O–Q). Loss of the VTI11 SNARE induces abnormal VPS33-GFP localization. VPS33-GFP was imaged in the Col-0 WT (O) or zig-1 (P and Q). Details of the aggregates at the junction between unfused vacuoles can be observed in the Airyscan mode (Q). (Scale bars: 10 µm.)VSP33 Interacts Directly with the Qa SNARE SYP22. VPS33 mediates SNARE complex assembly in yeast (29), and we could detect interactions between VPS33, VPS41, and SYP22 by BiFC. Therefore, we tested whether either of the two HOPS subunits could support a direct interaction with SYP22 by in vitro coimmunopreciptation. Proteins were expressed as tagged fusions to either GST (VPS33 and VPS41) or HIS (SYP22 and VTI11), and immunoprecipitation was carried out using an α-HIS antibody. GST-VPS41 was not detected in the α-HIS immunoprecipitate when incubated with either HIS-SYP22 or HIS-VTI11 (Fig. 4G), indicating a lack of direct interaction. In contrast, a direct interaction between GST-VPS33 and HIS-SYP22 was detected using this assay, as GST-VPS33 was detected in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4G). This interaction was confirmed in a complementary experiment where α-GST pulled down both HIS-SYP22 and GST-VPS33 in the coimmunoprecipitate (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Whether or not there were direct interactions with HIS-VTI11 was less definitive. Incubation of GST-VPS33 and HIS-VTI11 with α-HIS produced detectable signals of GST-VPS33 on immunoblots (Fig. 4G), but no signal was detected for HIS-VTI11 when α-GST was used (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Overall, these data provide strong evidence that HOPS–SNARE interactions in plants are mediated by direct interaction of VPS33 and SYP22, most likely due to conserved mechanisms.The HOPS Subunit VPS41 Genetically Interacts with the VTI11 SNARE. The evidence for protein–protein interactions between HOPS subunits and the vacuolar SNARE SYP22 prompted us to test for genetic interactions between the two complexes. zip2, a mutant allele of VPS41 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A), was identified as a suppressor of the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1, a loss-of-function allele of VTI11 (56). To determine whether zip2 suppresses the vacuole phenotype of zig-1, vacuoles from the zig-1 zip2 double mutants were visualized with LysoTracker Red (Fig. 4 H–K). The zig-1 mutant displayed the previously described vacuole phenotype in both the root tip and root maturation zone (2) (Fig. 4H and SI Appendix, Fig. S4H). The zig-1 zip2 still exhibited multiple vacuoles near the root tip (SI Appendix, Fig. S4I), but this phenotype was not observed in the root maturation zone (Fig. 4I). These results indicate that zip2 partially suppresses the zig-1 phenotype at the subcellular level and confirm a genetic interaction between ZIP2/VPS41 and VTI11. Furthermore, this result suggests that the zip2 mutation results in changes in the VPS41 protein structure that may alter the interactions between HOPS and SNAREs. A similar approach was used to test for genetic interactions between VPS33 and VTI11, but unlike zig-1 zip2 doubles, vps33-1 zig-1 and vps33-2 zig-1 double mutants showed the abnormal zig-1 vacuole phenotype in all root cells (Fig. 4 J and K and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 J and K) and the zig-zagged phenotype of the inflorescence. These results indicate that the vps33-1 and vps33-2 mutations failed to complement the vacuole phenotype, perhaps due to their hypomorphic nature, which may have innocuous effects on the VPS33 protein. The proposed interaction between HOPS and SNAREs led us to predict that loss of the VTI11 SNARE from the vacuole could alter the localization of VPS41 or VPS33. We tested this possibility in zig-1 mutants. VPS41-GFP localization in the WT background showed the cytosolic, punctate, and tonoplast localization previously described (Fig. 4L). In contrast, VPS41-GFP was not detected at the tonoplast and only accumulated in bright aggregated patterns in the zig-1 background (Fig. 4M). When visualized using the Airyscan mode of the microscope, these bright patterns were associated with adjacent vacuoles or clusters of small organelles in the cytosol (Fig. 4N). A similar result was obtained with VPS33-GFP. In contrast to the dispersed puncta of VPS33-GFP in the WT (Fig. 4O), zig-1 mutants showed clustered structures labeled with VPS33-GFP (Fig. 4 P and Q). At least some of these clusters represent small vacuoles as similar clusters were detected in zig-1 mutants labeled with RFP-SYP22 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 L–N). These results indicate that a functional SNARE complex is required for the normal localization of VPS41 and VPS33.Discussion The plant HOPS tethering complex is evolutionarily conserved with other eukaryotes (3, 31, 35), is involved in vacuole traffic via a RAB7-mediated pathway, and is critical for homotypic vacuole fusion (3). HOPS shares four subunits with CORVET, a similar conserved complex that mediates tethering of RAB5 endosomes and vacuoles in a plant-specific manner (3). Our results show that stable VPS33–VPS41 interactions predominantly occur in punctate organelles likely to correspond to endosomes as expected for a tether between endosomes and vacuoles. The possibility remains, however, that the functional HOPS complex also assembles transiently at sites of vacuole homotypic fusions, which are not abundant in the cells used in these experiments. HOPS is essential for vacuole membrane fusion in plants. VPS33 and VPS41 are essential in pollen fertility, and in fact, loss of VPS41 function interfered with pollen penetration into the stigma (4). This and previous results (3, 4, 33, 34) indicate that HOPS is essential for plant viability. The increased number of PSVs of hypomorphic mutants zip2, vps33-1, and vps33-2 is indicative of HOPS function in PSV fusion or trafficking, as it has been observed in other vacuolar trafficking mutants (2, 18, 43, 62, 63). Moreover, the inducible amiRNA silencing of VPS41 and VPS11 underscores HOPS function in lytic vacuole fusion. Phosphoinositides and Membrane Curvature Delimit VPS41 and VPS33 Recruitment. VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP localize to late endosomes, which is consistent with a role in membrane fusion at the PVC and vacuole as part of HOPS (31) and with previous results in pollen tubes (4). The exclusive presence of VPS41 at the vacuole, however, was unexpected. One interpretation is that VPS33 recruitment to the vacuole is transient and limited to sites of membrane fusion, while VPS41 binding to the tonoplast is stable and results from specific lipid-binding affinities. Even though both proteins showed affinity for most phosphoinositides in a lipid strip assay, these results do not rule out the possibility of different affinities to specific phosphoinositides or that their recruitment to specific membranes is enhanced by interaction with other proteins. Two other HOPS subunits, VPS18 and VPS39, the latter being HOPS specific, are also absent from the vacuole (3). Given the competing needs of the core subunits VPS33, VPS18, VPS11, and VPS16 for either HOPS or CORVET assembly, the stable recruitment of VPS41 to the tonoplast could serve as a reservoir for this subunit in a way that does not compete for complex assembly. Phosphoinositides recruit HOPS to the vertex ring between two juxtaposed vacuoles undergoing fusion in yeast (27, 52). We hypothesized that these lipids could fulfill a similar role in plants, and this was first supported by VPS41 and VPS33 binding to immobilized phosphoinositides on a membrane. Surprisingly, both VPS33 and VPS41 also bound to membrane liposomes but only in the absence of PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2. This result implicates membrane curvature as an additional factor in the recruitment of HOPS to cellular membranes in plants and highlights the sensitivity of these proteins to both membrane topology and phosphoinositide lipid content. The plant vacuole membrane is a flat surface compared with the late endosomes, and membrane curvature could indeed represent a proxy for organelle identity in plant vacuole traffic. We propose that VPS41 binding to the vacuole membrane entails its recruitment by PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2, since PtdIns(3)P has been detected at the tonoplast, and both are important for vacuolar traffic (64, 65). In contrast, VPS41 binding to curved membranes such as those of late endosomes is independent of and inhibited by phosphoinositides. This model is further supported by the loss of VPS41-GFP from the vacuole membrane but not from late endosomes in Wm-treated cells. The inhibitory effect of phosphoinositides on VPS33 and VPS41 binding to liposomes suggests that plants have evolved different mechanisms of regulating vacuole fusion compared with yeast. In contrast to plants, the complete yeast HOPS complex and VPS41 alone bind to liposomes containing vacuolar phosphoinositides, but they do not bind strongly to bare liposomes (27, 66, 67). Therefore, while phosphoinositides promote recruitment of HOPS to curved membranes in yeast, they have the opposite effect in plants. Current models for vacuole fusion propose that the site of HOPS function, the vertex of two juxtaposed vacuoles, represents a highly curved membrane (68, 69). Moreover, small liposomes may be used as a proxy for HOPS interactions with the membrane at the vertex ring (68). The liposomes used here are not small enough to represent membrane curvature at sites of vacuole fusion, but if phosphoinositides also abolish HOPS binding at these sites, it would be consistent with yet another phenomenon observed only in plants. Our group has shown that Wm induces vacuole fusion in plants, both in developing roots and in guard cells, and we proposed that phosphoinositides function as negative regulators of vacuole fusion (2). This effect of Wm, however, is not observed in yeast vacuoles (48) or animal lysosomes (49), and therefore, plants seemed to have coerced the regulatory role of phosphoinositides into inhibitors rather than promoters of vacuole fusion. This difference may be due to evolutionary changes in the mechanisms by which VPS41 binds to membranes. VPS41 binding to highly curved membranes in yeast is mediated by an amphipathic lipid packing sensor (ALPS) motif, which also contains two important regulatory phosphorylation sites (67). The ALPS motif is not conserved in plants including Arabidopsis (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), which further supports the existence of plant-specific mechanisms for recruitment of HOPS to highly curved membranes. PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 are important phosphoinositides for vacuole traffic and dynamics (64). PtdIns(3,5)P2 is produced by phosphorylation of the PtdIns(3)P precursor by the PI5 kinases FAB1A and FAB1B (70), and FAB1A has been localized to late endosomes (71). A new sensor of PtdIns(3,5)P2 indicates that this lipid accumulates in late endosomes (72), but it is not clear how much can persist after late endosome fusion with the vacuole. The possibility that PtdIns(3,5)P2 accumulates in the tonoplast is supported by the localization of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatases SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN 2–5 (SAC2–5) exclusively to the vacuole membrane (73). Interestingly, Wm treatment resulted in significant dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, which could result from rapid depletion of PtdIns(3,5)P2 specifically in the tonoplast if both synthesis is stalled due to the unavailability of its precursor and active dephosphorylation by SAC phosphatases (73). PtdIns(3,5)P2 has recently emerged as an important regulator of plant growth, development, and stress responses. PtdIns(3,5)P2 is critical for polar growth (74) and is induced under osmotic stress in plants (75) and yeast (76). Loss of FAB1A and FAB1B results in pollen lethality due to the formation of aberrantly large vacuoles during pollen development (77), which implicates PtdIns(3,5)P2 in vacuole biogenesis. Moreover, PtdIns(3,5)P2 was found to be important for vacuole acidification and fragmentation during stomata closing (78), and loss of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 phosphatases SAC2–5, which is expected to increase its accumulation in membranes, induces vacuole fragmentation in Arabidopsis roots (73). It is tempting to speculate that these roles of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in promoting vacuole fragmentation in guard cells during stomata closure result from its inhibitory effect on VPS33 and VPS41 recruitment to sites of apposing vacuole membranes, which would be otherwise available for fusion. Our results suggest that vacuolar phosphoinositides are likely to play an important role in vacuole fusion–fragmentation dynamics by controlling the recruitment of HOPS to apposing vacuole membranes. Further research is necessary to test this hypothesis.HOPS–SNARE Interactions Are Mediated by the SYP22 Qa SNARE. The HOPS complex is expected to interact with SNARE proteins to regulate membrane fusion at the vacuole. That zip2/vps41 partially suppressed the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1/vti11 is consistent with functional interactions between HOPS and the vacuole SNARE complexes containing VTI11 and SYP22. The mutation in zip2/vps41 may result in altered HOPS–SNARE interactions or the ability of HOPS to promote or proofread the SNARE complex assembly. Furthermore, the altered localization of VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP in the zig-1 mutant is consistent with a functional interaction between HOPS and SNARE that mediates vacuole fusion. We speculate that the bright punctate localizations of the tagged VPS41 and VPS33 in zig-1 may represent nonfunctional fusogenic complexes where SNAREs and HOPS are retained, with delays in their tonoplast accumulation and recycling. This was also observed when the SYP22 SNARE was localized to the same clusters of organelles. Furthermore, we previously hypothesized that the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1 mutants could result from a putative proofreading activity of HOPS upon the mismatched vacuolar SNARE complex missing VTI11 (2), as it has been shown for yeast (79). The aggregation of VPS41 molecules in zig-1 is consistent with such activity, as HOPS could be loaded onto the abnormal SNARE complex while preventing fusion to occur. Further experiments are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. BiFC experiments showed that both HOPS subunits, VPS33 and VPS41, interacted with SYP22 in vivo, but only the VPS33–SYP22 interaction was detected in vitro. This is consistent with a role of HOPS as a chaperone for SNARE complex assembly (see below) and with coimmunoprecipitation between VCL1 and SYP22 in Arabidopsis seedlings (35). These interactions were detected in punctate structures similar to those of VPS33-VPS41 and VTI11-SYP22, suggesting that HOPS–SNARE interactions probably occur in late endosomes. Neither VPS33 or VPS41 interacted with VTI11 in the BiFC assay, which suggests that SNARE–HOPS interactions are not mediated by VTI11 protein surfaces. Overall, our results are consistent with the current model for HOPS–SNARE interactions that mediate membrane fusion in yeast. In this model, VPS33 binding to the Qa-SNARE Vam3 is the first step for SNARE complex assembly. The VPS33–Qa-SNARE interaction is thought to promote a conformational change, which exposes binding surfaces for other SNAREs on the VPS33 subunit (80). The interactions between VPS33 and SYP22, both in BiFC and in vitro, suggest that this mechanism is conserved in plants. Therefore, initial binding of VPS33 and SYP22 may be the first step in the HOPS–SNARE interactions that mediate vacuole fusion in plants.Methods Plant Materials, Growth Conditions, and Transformation. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown as described (2). The ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as WT control. The genomic VPS41-GFP fusion (VPS41p::VPS41-GFP) was described elsewhere (4). Organelle markers mRFP-SYP22 (18), mCherry-RAB5 (mCherry-RabF2a), and mCherry-RAB7 (mCherry-RabG3f) (51) have been previously described. SALK T-DNA insertion lines, including vps41-1 (SALK_076372), vps41-2 (SALK_035406), vps33-3 (SALK_016684C), vps33-4 (SALK_151719), and vps33-5 (SALK_143407), were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR (SI Appendix, Table S4). The zip2 zig-1 mutant was previously characterized (56). The TILLING lines (57) vps33-1 (CS92162) and vps33-2 (CS93595) were obtained from ABRC and backcrossed three times with Col-0 WT. Homozygous vps33-1 and vps33-2 were genotyped by PCR amplification (SI Appendix, Table S4) and restriction digestion with BsmBI (vps33-1) or TspRI (vps33-2). Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown at room temperature for 3–4 wk in Metro-Mix 300 soil with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. Arabidopsis transformation was carried out by floral dip (81) using Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58C1 and GV3101. Transient plant Agro-infiltration of 3- to 4-wk-old N. benthamiana leaves was carried out as described (82). GFP or RFP fluorescence was observed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) 36–48 h after infiltration.Molecular Cloning. The full-length genomic fusion of VPS33 with GFP driven by either 3- or 1-kb native promoters were generated using the GoldenBraid system (83). Primers for VPS33 genomic sequences (SI Appendix, Table S4) were generated by the GB domesticator software (https://gbcloning.upv.es/tools/domestication/), and each part was amplified by PCR (83, 84). Each transcriptional unit (TU) was assembled by restriction–ligation reaction into pUPD2 and sequenced. The full fusion construct containing the VPS33 promoter and genomic sequence, GFP, and the VPS33 terminator sequence was then assembled into pDGB3_alpha1. This cassette was finally inserted into pDGB3_omega1 together with the kanamycin resistance cassette from pGB0184 to generate pVPS33::gVPS33-GFP (VPS33-GFP). All experiments were carried out with the 3-kb promoter, except for Fig. 1 P–R, where the 1-kb promoter was used. UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter-driven and BiFC constructs were generated by Gateway cloning. Coding sequences of VPS41 (At1g08190), VPS33 (At3G54860), VTI11 (At5G39510), SYP22 (AT5G146860), and AtTIP2;1 (AT3G16240) were obtained by RT-PCR. Briefly, total mRNA was extracted from Col-0 WT seedlings using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer’s instruction. cDNAs were synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) and amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (SI Appendix, Table S4) compatible for Gateway cloning. Entry clones were generated in pENTR4 or pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) (SI Appendix, Table S3). Expression clones (SI Appendix, Table S2) were generated by recombination between the entry clones and multiple destination vectors using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). Vectors driven by the pUBQ10 promoter were generated after substitution of the short UBQ promoter of the vector set described in ref. 85 with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596 bp) from pNIGEL07 (51). pDEST15 and pDEST17 destination vectors (Invitrogen) were used for protein expression in bacteria, and N- and C-terminal nEYFP and cEYFP pSITE vectors (86) were used to generate constructs for BiFC. All expression constructs are described in SI Appendix, Table S2. The amiR-vps constructs were cloned using the GreenGate system (87). Specific amiRNA sequences against VPS41 and VPS11 (AT2G05170) were identified with the Web MicroRNA Designer (WMD3) tool (88) at wmd3.weigelworld.org/cgi-bin/webapp.cgi. The amiR-vps sequences were amplified in four independent PCRs (SI Appendix, Table S5) with the pRS300 plasmid containing the miR319a precursor sequence. To be suited for the GreenGate cloning system, primers “A” and “B” were modified with specific overhangs. The final PCR products (fourth reaction) were first digested with Eco31I and then ligated into the preopened intermediate vectors (SI Appendix, Table S5). The resulting vectors (supermodule A and B for each amiR-vps) were sequenced and combined in consecutive GreenGate reactions as described (87). The DEX induction system is based on the p6xOP/LhG4-GR transcription system (89, 90). Primers and vectors used in these experiments are reported in SI Appendix, Tables S3–S5.Microscopy. Zeiss LSM 710 or Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan confocal microscopes were used for all imaging experiments unless specified. The excitation/emission wavelengths for imaging were 488 nm/492–570 nm for GFP and YFP, 561 nm/588–696 nm for mCherry and mRFP, and 561 nm/566–690 nm for LysoTracker Red. Three-day-old seedlings were analyzed with a 40×/1.2 N.A. water-immersion objective. To image PSVs, seeds were imbibed in water for 1 h, and seed coats were peeled off with a sharp needle. Vacuoles in the mature embryos were imaged by capturing PSV autofluorescence (excitation/emission wavelengths were 405/450–510 nm) from a single Z plane per sample. PSV quantification was carried out using Fiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ, based on ImageJ 1.51d; fiji.sc/) (91). Linear (Pearson) and the nonlinear (Spearman’s) correlation coefficients for colocalization analysis were obtained with the PSC colocalization plug-in (92). The threshold level for the noise was set at 4. Membrane/cytosolic ratios of VPS41-GFP were calculated in Fiji by extracting intensity values of VPS41-GFP only from the vacuole membrane. This was accomplished by generating a membrane signal mask by thresholding of the RFP-SYP22 marker in the red channel to 40 or above. The mask was then applied to the GFP channel to extract the histograms of intensity values for VPS41-GFP at the membrane. A “cytosolic” intensity average was calculated by measuring intensity values from four cytosolic regions of interest per image. Live-cell CLSM of vacuoles from amiRNA lines was done using a Leica TCS SP5II microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a Leica HCX PL APO lambda blue 63×/1.20 N.A. UV water-immersion objective. Images were acquired with a lateral pixel resolution between 50 and 96 nm at a speed of 400 Hz with bidirectional scanning and five times line averaging. To reduce background fluorescence, the pinhole was adjusted between 0.75 and 1.0 airy unit (AU). The excitation/emission wavelengths for imaging were 488 nm/495–550 nm for BCECF and 561 nm/600–680 nm for FM4-64. Image postprocessing operations (Gaussian blur between 0.5 and 0.75; adjustment of brightness and contrast of the whole image) were done with Fiji.Chemical Treatments and Fluorescent Dyes. Three- or 4-d-old seedlings were used in all chemical treatments and fluorescent dye stainings. Wm (W3144; Sigma) was diluted in liquid AGM to a final concentration of 33 μM, and the same volume of DMSO was added to the control (1% final). Seedlings were treated for 3 h in the dark at 22 °C. A minimum of three seedlings was analyzed for each treatment, and the experiment was repeated three times. LysoTracker Red staining was carried out by incubation of seedlings in liquid AGM supplemented with 2 μM LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) for 2 h. For amiRNA induction with DEX, 5 d-old seedlings were incubated for 72 h in liquid AGM supplemented with 30 µM DEX, or DMSO (control). Seedlings were stained with 10 µM BCECF, acetoxymethyl ester, and 1 µM FM 4-64 as described (8).Protein Purification. BL21-AI E. coli cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with T7::GST-VPS41, T7::GST-VPS33, T7::GST, T7::HIS-SYP22, or T7::HIS-VTI11. Recombinant bacteria were cultured in 300 mL of LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and 1% glucose at 37 °C to an OD of 0.4–0.6. Expression of the tagged proteins was induced with 0.2% arabinose. Cultures were incubated at 28 °C for 5 h, except for T7::HIS-SYP22, which was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and HIS-VTI11, which was incubated at 16 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors; Roche; #04693132001) and 12 μg/mL lysozyme (Sigma). The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 11,200 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was then added to either a Gluthatione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) or a Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), accordingly. The recombinant proteins were eluted after an overnight incubation at 4 °C in slow rotation following the manufacturer’s recommendations.Lipid–Protein Binding Assays. Phospholipid-coated PIP strips (Echelon) were blocked with TBST buffer [10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20] containing 3% (wt/vol) BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Strips were then incubated with 3 mL of 0.33 nM purified GST-VPS41, GST-VPS33, or GST in TBST and 3% (wt/vol) BSA at 4 °C overnight. Strips were washed three times and incubated with mouse anti-GST primary antibody [1:1,000 dilution in 3% (wt/vol) BSA; Thermo Fisher]. A secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody [diluted 1:2,000 in 3% (wt/vol) BSA; Thermo Fisher Scientific] was used next, and signal was detected by western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) using a G:BOX Chemi XRQ gel documentation system (Syngene). This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. The liposome binding assay was modified from refs. 93 and 94 using PolyPIPosomes (Echelon Biosciences) containing no phosphoinositides (control; catalog #Y-0000), PI(3)P (catalog #Y-003), or PI(3,5)P2 (catalog #Y-035). Proteins were first clarified by ultracentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Then, 2.5 µg of GST-VPS41, 1.7 µg of GST-VPS33, 500 ng of GST alone, and 600 ng of PI(3)P Grip (p40 PX) (Echelon Biosciences) were diluted in a final volume of 95 µL of 1× binding buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4; 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/mL BSA; 0.2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, and 1× protease inhibitors from Roche; #04693132001). Five microliters of the PolyPIPosome was added, and the final 100-µL volume was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with slow rotation. Liposomes were then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature and washed one time in 1× binding buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 30 µl of Laemmli buffer and resolved together with 30% of the supernatant by SDS/PAGE using a 3–8% Tris-acetate protein gel (Invitrogen). Similar results were obtained in three different experiments.In Vitro Protein–Protein Interaction. Mouse anti-GST (catalog #MA4-004; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or mouse Penta-HIS (Qiagen 34660) antibodies were bound to Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. To avoid coelution of the antibodies, we treated the beads with BS3 (Thermo Scientific) cross-linking agent. Beads and antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, treated with 1 M Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, quenching buffer, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes, the different protein combinations were added. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed three times with PBS buffer containing protease inhibitors, and bound proteins were eluted by 5-min denaturation at 90 °C in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved in 10% acrylamide gels or 3–8% Tris-acetate protein gels (Invitrogen).Supplementary Material Supplementary File pnas.1807763115.sapp.pdf (2.5MB, pdf) Acknowledgments We thank J.

    "abstract": "Abstract The spaceflight environment of the International Space Station poses a multitude of stresses on plant growth including reduced gravity. Plants exposed to microgravity and other conditions on the ISS display root skewing, changes in gene expression and protein abundance that may result in changes in cell wall composition, antioxidant accumulation and modification of growth anisotropy. Systematic studies that address the effects of microgravity on cellular organelles are lacking but altered numbers and sizes of vacuoles have been detected in previous flights. The prominent size of plant vacuoles makes them ideal models to study organelle dynamics in space. Here, we used Arabidopsis zigzag-1 (zig-1) as a sensitized genotype to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Wortmannin was used to induce vacuole fusion in seedlings and a formaldehyde-based fixation protocol was developed to visualize plant vacuole morphology after sample return, using confocal microscopy. Our results indicate that microgravity enhances the zig-1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl growth and vacuole fusion in some cells. This study demonstrates the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments for plant cell biology experiments in space. Subject terms: Plant sciences, Cell biology",
    "introduction": "Introduction Growing healthy plants in space is a major goal towards the viability of long-term space missions as plants can provide food for astronauts and benefit mental health. The space environment includes multiple stresses for plant growth including different levels of gravity, radiation, decreased nutrient delivery and water recycling1,2. The International Space Station provides an ideal experimental setting for the study of plant growth and development under space conditions and many experiments have been conducted with plants on the ISS1,3. Reduced gravity on the ISS results in disoriented plant growth unless light is provided to activate directional growth from phototropism. Effects of the spaceflight environment on the ISS include reduced cell elongation4 or altered cell division5 in roots. At the cellular level, the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons as well as the cell wall are altered under microgravity6–8. Other cellular organelles are altered under microgravity conditions include mitochondria, plastids and ER6. Interestingly, vacuole numbers increased in root apical cells for Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the ISS9, and vacuole volume increases in certain cells in microgravity10,11. Moreover, proteins involved in intracellular membrane trafficking were found to show altered abundance in microgravity12–14. Those results suggest vacuolar development as well as trafficking are disrupted in microgravity, but overall, there is a large gap in documenting the effect of spaceflight on the organization of cellular organelles15. The plant vacuole is a large essential organelle in plant cells and is important for cell elongation, recycling, and storage, among many other functions16–18. Vacuole enlargement is concomitant with cell growth along the developmental gradient represented by the longitudinal axis of the root. Vacuole enlargement along this gradient requires homotypic membrane fusion, which is mediated by two conserved complexes, the homotypic vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)19. Both HOPS and the vacuolar SNARE complexes have vacuole or pre-vacuole-specific subunits that provide specificity to membrane fusion. The vacuolar SNARE complex is formed by SYP22, VTI11, SYP51, and either VAMP72720 or VAMP713/VAMP71121–23. A loss of function allele of VTI11, zigzag1(zig-1), has fragmented vacuoles and showed abnormal shoot gravitropism24–26. The zig-1 mutant also has short hypocotyls, small and wrinkled rosette leaves and a zigzag-shaped stem24,25. Wortmannin (WM), a chemical inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), can induce vacuole fusion in zig-1 and partially restore its agravitropic shoot phenotype26,27. WM-induced vacuole fusion in zig-1 is fast and almost complete vacuole fusion can be observed in roots within two hours26,27. Given the large size of the vacuole in plant cells and the efficiency of WM at inducing its fusion, this treatment represents a unique assay for the study of organelle fusion in plants in space. Plant specimens have been sent to space for fundamental biology research since the 1960s1,3,28 and this resulted in the design of specific hardware for optimal growth3,29. The Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) is a fully contained hardware that has been used extensively with small plant seedlings9,30–32 and it is suitable for chemical treatments in space. Previous experiments involved storing liquid media or fixative solution inside the chamber of the PDFU for microbial culture or plant tissue fixation33–35. Cell biology research on the ISS requires sample fixation to preserve cell morphology. Chemical fixation in the ISS has been accomplished with non-coagulant agents such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde9 but the latter has high levels of autofluorescence36. Direct fluorescence microscopy of fluorescent proteins from fixed tissues37,38 is an effective approach to extract quantitative information of cell structure at high samples size, but the viability of fluorescence microscopy of tissues fixed in space has not been demonstrated given the challenges imposed by the BRIC hardware. Here, we took advantage of the WM-induced vacuole fusion in zig-1 to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Formaldehyde-based tissue fixation in the BRIC-PDFU hardware was used and GFP-tagged vacuoles were imaged post-flight by confocal microscopy. We detected a mild but significant decrease in plant vacuole fusion in zig-1 that highlights possible effects of microgravity or other spaceflight stresses on vacuole biogenesis and membrane fusion. This experiment also demonstrates the feasibility of chemical treatment assays on the ISS which may contribute to future cell biology research in this microgravity environment.",
    "methods": "Methods Arabidopsis materials and growth conditions Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0) expressing GFP-TIP2;1 was previously described39 and previously transformed27 with the HDEL-mCherry construct40. The zig-1 mutant was previously described24, and the GFP-TIP2;1 marker was introgressed into this genotype by crossing. The HDEL-mCherry marker40 was separately introduced into zig-1 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation27 and the two markers were combined by crossing and selection of plants in the F2. Seeds were surface sterilized and sown on 0.5 X Arabidopsis growth medium (AGM, 0.5X Murashige and Skoog medium, 10 g/L Gelrite, 1% (w/v) sucrose) in 6 cm diameter petri dishes. Each petri dish contained 30 seeds. Twenty-two Petri dishes were integrated into PDFUs and stored in 4 BRICs for SVT, EVT and flight. BRICs were incubated at 4 °C for 5 days in the dark and transferred to 22 °C growth chamber (SVT, EVT and ground control) or the ISS environment (flight assay) for 3–4 days (Fig. 1). Chemical treatments and fixation Three to four-day-old dark-grown seedlings were used for chemical treatments and fixation. WM (SIGMA, cat# W3144) was diluted to 33 μM in AGM and an equal volume of DMSO (Thermo Scientific, D12345) diluted in AGM was used as the control. For lab testing, seedlings were incubated in WM working solution or DMSO buffer control for 1 or 2 h in the dark. If used in the BRIC-PDFU, WM or DMSO were stored in one of the chambers in the PDFU and an actuator tool was used to push each solution onto the petri dish. Optimization of the seedling fixation protocol involved testing different buffers for the PFA fixative. To mimic the mixing process inside the BRIC-PDFU, one volume of 0.5X AGM was mixed with one volume of 8% Paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences cat# 15700) in the corresponding buffer for a final concentration of 4% PFA. The final concentration for each buffer to test was 0.5X AGM, 0.5X or 0.25X KPBS61, 0.5X or 1X BupHTM PBS (ThermoFisher Scientific cat# 28372), 0.5X or 1X microtubule stabilizing buffer (MTSB)43, 1X Potassium phosphate buffer (PPB) (6.5 mM KH2PO4, 93.5 mM K2HPO4) and 0.25X Sorenson’s buffer62. Seedlings treated with each mixture were immediately stored at 4 °C until confocal microscopy. For SVT, EVT and flight assay, 16% PFA aqueous solutions were diluted to 8% PFA in 0.5X KPBS (SVT) or 1X BupHTM PBS (EVT, flight assay). The final PFA concentration after actuation in the PDFU was around 4% with 0.25X KPBS buffer (SVT) and 0.5X BupHTM PBS buffer (EVT, flight assay). Seedlings were then stored at 4 °C until de-integration of BRIC-PDFU followed by confocal microscopy. Microscopy Fixed seedlings were washed 3 times for 1 min in sterilized water before imaging. A Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope was used for all the imaging. The excitation/emission wavelengths for GFP and mCherry were 488 nm/490–561 nm and 561 nm/570–676 nm respectively. The C-Apochromat 40X/1.2 W Korr FCS M27 water-immersion objective was used. All seedlings were imaged at the root tip transition and elongation zones and in both epidermis and/or cortical cells. The transition zone was defined as the region of the root apex where a doubling in cell length was observed in a specific cell layer, corresponding to the boundary between the meristematic and elongation zones63 and the cell where that doubling occurred was included in the analysis. Cells in the elongation zone were identified as those past the transition zone. Two to three z sections were captured per sample in each cell layer. Cells where the section was too close to the cell cortex were not included and vacuoles were counted by eye as defined by fluorescently-labelled membrane boundaries. Some seedlings were additionally imaged at the root tip columella and hypocotyl endodermis. Image analysis For SVT, EVT and the flight assay, seeds germination rate was calculated from the number of recovered seedlings in each PDFU after de-integration. To measure hypocotyl length, fixed seedlings were arranged on glass slides and imaged using digital cameras. Hypocotyl and root length was measured with Fiji64. To count the number of vacuoles per cell, images from different tissue and cell type was analyzed separately. Only cells with good preservation and strong GFP fluorescence intensity were counted. Three-way ANOVA analysis was applied to compare the cellular vacuole amount among different treatments. Statistical analysis and figure generation were conducted with GraphPad Prism version 9.2.0 for macOS, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com.

    "results": "Results Optimization of BRIC-24 workflow The goal of BRIC-24 was to test whether vacuole fusion is affected by the microgravity environment of the ISS. A previously characterized vacuole fusion assay26,27 was implemented with the BRIC-PDFU hardware. This assay takes advantage of the accumulation of vacuoles in the zig-1 mutant and the rapid induction of vacuole fusion in this mutant upon treatment with Wortmannin (WM)27. Visualization of organelle morphology is accomplished by confocal microscopy of a GFP-tagged vacuolar marker (GFP-TIP2;1)39 and a mCherry-tagged ER marker (HDEL-mCherry)40 previously characterized. Figure 1 describes the BRIC-24 workflow as it was completed as part of the SpaceX-22 mission in July of 2021. Thirty sterile seeds from WT (Columbia-0) or zig-1 were plated directly on Arabidopsis Growth Media (AGM) plates before integration into the BRIC-PDFU hardware at Kennedy Space Center. From this point, plates were maintained cold and in the dark. Each PDFU was separately loaded with a treatment solution (WM or DMSO control in AGM) as well as fixative solution taking advantage of the dual chamber of the PDFU hardware. The fixative solution was infused with N2 gas to enhance its long term stability as described41. Four BRICs containing a total of 22 PDFUs and 2 HOBO temperature recorders were delivered to NASA’s cold stowage facility prior to launch (Supplementary Table 1). Two days after arriving at the ISS, BRICs were unpacked and allowed to come up to the temperature of the ISS environment to promote germination and growth. WM or DMSO control solutions were applied at day 4 of seedling growth followed by fixative solution 2 h later. BRICs were returned to a 4 °C storage compartment until the return flight 4 weeks later, de-integration and confocal analysis at North Carolina State University. Fig. 1. Overview of the BRIC-24 experimental workflow. Open in a new tab Sterilized Arabidopsis seeds (WT and zig-1 with GFP-TIP2;1) were plated onto AGM media and stored at 4 °C before BRIC-PDFU integration. Each petri dish contained 30 seeds. Treatment solution (33 μm WM or DMSO buffer) and fixative were injected into the dual chamber of the PDFU. Plates were placed into each PDFUs and PDFUs were integrated into BRICs. Four BRICs were then stored in a cold bag for the flight. After 4 days of growth on the ISS, WM solution or DMSO control were applied to the seedlings. The treatment lasted for 2 hours. The second actuation was conducted by applying fixative solution to the seedlings. BRICs were then kept at 4 °C and returned to NASA after splash down. Confocal imaging and data analysis were conducted at NCSU.BRIC-24 protocols that fit the constraints of the flight schedule and hardware required considerations for storage of treatment solutions in the BRIC hardware before actuation and the preservation of treated and fixed seedlings for up to 6 weeks before imaging. First, we confirmed that 30 μM working dilutions of WM in liquid AGM buffer are still active after 2 weeks of storage at 4 °C (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, we determined that the formaldehyde-based fixative solution was effective after 2 weeks storage (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results demonstrated the feasibility of the BRIC-24 workflow. Transfer of the treatment and fixative solutions from the liquid chambers of the PDFUs and into the plants is carried out by astronauts in space, but this device does not allow for the removal of the first solution. Therefore, the fixative solution would always mix with the previously applied treatment solution. We then tested the effectiveness of a variety of fixative buffers and PFA concentrations when mixed 1:1 with liquid AGM by visualization the GFP-labeled tonoplast and the mCherry-labeled ER of fixed samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). A 4% working concentration of PFA was used as the fixative agent37,42. When PFA was directly diluted in liquid AGM, the intensity of GFP fluorescence was weak, and the morphology of vacuole and ER were blurry compared to live-seedling controls (Supplementary Fig. 3B, C). As most PFA fixation solutions are made in PBS and many variations exist, we tested different PBS concentrations and mixed them 1:1 with AGM. Fixative solutions in full (1x) PBS buffer as well as 0.5x PBS yielded plants with high intensity of GFP, however, only the PFA solution in 0.5x PBS showed the best preservation of vacuole morphology (Supplementary Fig. 3D, E). In the case of the KPBS buffer, a variation of PBS that contains K+ as an alkali metal cation in addition to Na+ ion, vacuole morphology was acceptable, but GFP intensity was diminished (Supplementary Fig. 3G, H). Weak GFP signal was also detected for samples fixed with fixative in MTSB buffer, a buffer typically used to preserve cytoskeleton in plants43, (Supplementary Fig. 3I, J). PFA solutions in PPB and Sorensen’s buffer were ineffective in preserving vacuole morphology (Supplementary Fig. 3K, L). Preservation of ER morphology as reported by the mCherry-HDEL marker was even more challenging. Most fixative solutions resulted in the accumulation of ER aggregates and overall loss of ER structure, except for a PFA solution in 0.25x KPBS (Supplementary Fig. 3H). This solution, however, was not optimal for visualization of vacuoles. As vacuole fusion was the primary target for this research, we selected the 4% PFA solution in 0.5x PBS (Supplementary Fig. 3E) as the final fixative concentration for the flight experiment and did not analyze ER morphology as part of BRIC-24. One major concern for doing plant cell biology experiments in space is that fixed samples must be stored on the ISS for several weeks before splash-down. We therefore tested whether 4 weeks of storage would affect the intensity of GFP or the overall preservation of vacuole morphology of fixed samples. Several experiments confirmed that long term storage of these samples would not significantly affect their quality of preservation (Supplementary Fig. 4) further supporting the feasibility of BRIC-24. Ground tests demonstrated feasibility of the vacuole fusion assay using the BRIC-PDFU Science (SVT) and Experiment (EVT) Verification Tests were completed at Kennedy Space Center on March and September 2020, respectively, to determine the feasibility of the experimental workflow using the BRIC-PDFU hardware. The PDFU is an enclosed environment where plants are exposed to dark conditions and where plant growth or the effectiveness of chemical treatments cannot be assessed in real time. It was important to test whether WM treatment of WT and zig-1 inside the PDFU was equivalent to treatments regularly done on plastic dishes. Both SVT and EVT were used to optimize growth conditions in the PDFU and to optimize the WM treatment and fixation. Plants were grown for 4 days during SVT, and they were treated with 33 μM WM for 1 h before fixation in 4% formaldehyde in 0.25x KPBS. The germination rate during SVT was not significantly different between genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 5A), but the hypocotyl length of WT was longer than that of zig-1 (Supplementary Fig. 5B) as previously reported24. Fixed seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize the vacuoles in the epidermis and cortex from the root transition and elongation zones (Supplementary Fig. 5C). Visualization of vacuoles after PFA fixation in KPBS buffer results in weak GFP fluorescence. As expected, a single vacuole was observed in most cells of WT roots regardless of chemical treatment. Multiple vacuoles were detected in zig-1 roots in the control treatment and the WM treatment resulted in fewer vacuoles per cell when compared to the control. Most cells did not complete vacuole fusion after 1 h under these conditions and this was unexpected26,27. This result could be due to hardware limitations or suboptimal fixation, and it prompted an increase in the incubation time of the WM in subsequent experiments. A final EVT was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of BRIC-24 before flight. Plants were grown for 3 days and treated with 33 μM WM for 2 h before fixation in 4% formaldehyde in 0.5x PBS to preserve GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 5D, E). Again, no significant differences in seed germination were detected between genotypes but zig-1 hypocotyls were shorter than the WT (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 5D, E). Root cortical cells of the root transition zone were imaged for vacuole morphology (Fig. 2b, c) and most WT cells contained only one vacuole regardless of treatment. Multiple vacuoles per cell were observed in the zig-1 control, and WM treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of vacuoles per cell in the mutant. These results suggest that chemical inhibitor treatments in the BRIC-PDFU are feasible, albeit adjustments must be made to accommodate changes due to the limitations of the hardware. Fig. 2. The WM-induced vacuole fusion assay can be carried out in the BRIC-PDFU. Open in a new tab a Germination rate of WT and zig-1 seeds inside BRIC-PDFU during EVT.

Raw datapoints are represented with filled circles. Error bars represent standard deviation.Even though the feasibility of BRIC-24 was demonstrated during EVT, the overall quality of GFP signal, seedling preservation and WM effectiveness was not on par with similar experiments outside the BRIC-PDFU hardware. This may result from the lack of precision when loading solutions into the dual chamber. We then tested whether deviations from the 1:1 ratio between the WM (or DMSO) solution in AGM and the fixative could affect the quality of cell fixation. Dark grown zig-1 seedlings were fixed in different mixtures of liquid AGM and fixative solution that mimic unequal loading of each solution into the dual chamber. The best cell morphology and GFP signal preservation were obtained when those solutions were mixed with 1:1 ratio. Higher concentrations of fixative induced cell damage while lower concentrations of fixative resulted in lower GFP intensity (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results explain some suboptimal cell preservation and GFP fluorescence during SVT and EVT (Supplementary Fig. 7) and must be considered for future flight experiments using the BRIC-PDFU. Nonetheless, sufficient seedlings with good preservation and bright GFP fluorescence were recovered from EVT to demonstrate flight readiness of BRIC-24. zig-1 showed normal germination but altered hypocotyl growth on the ISS BRIC-24 was flown with the SpaceX-22 mission (Fig. 1). Identical experiments with 4 BRICs containing 22 PDFUs were completed on the ISS (flight) and at Kennedy Space Center (ground control). Due to a power failure, the ground control experiment ran 5 weeks after the flight. We analyzed the germination rate, seedling hypocotyl length of WT and zig-1 from flight assay and compared the data to ground control. Seed germination was not affected by the microgravity environment of the ISS in either genotype (Fig. 3a). Like SVT and EVT experiments, WT hypocotyls were 7.35% and 31.67% longer than those of zig-1 in ground control and flight respectively. However, the ISS environment resulted in 8.46% longer hypocotyls on the WT compared to ground control while the effect in zig-1 was the opposite, where zig-1 plants grown on the ISS were 11.57% shorter than the ground control (Fig. 3b, d). WT roots were 13% longer than zig-1 in both treatments and no differences were detected between the flight and ground controls in either genotype (Fig. 3c, d). These results suggest that seed germination and root growth of zig-1 are not affected by microgravity, but its hypocotyl growth may be inhibited by the stresses imposed by the ISS environment. Fig. 3. WT and zig-1 in BRIC-PDFU can germinate and grow in microgravity environment as on earth.

Error bars represent standard deviation. d Representative seedlings of the WT and zig-1 from either ground control or flight after de-integration of the BRIC-PDFU. Fixed seedlings were taken out of fixative solution and arranged on plate. Scale bar: 1 cm. WM-induced vacuole fusion may be delayed in microgravity The primary goal for this research was to test whether WM can induce vacuole fusion of zig-1 in the microgravity environment of the ISS. For this purpose, all seedlings collected from BRIC-PDFUs of flight assay and ground control were imaged by confocal microscopy for vacuole number analysis. Epidermal and cortical cells within the transition and elongation zones of the root tip were analyzed as changes in vacuole morphology are readily observed in these cell transitions44,45. WT cells had only one vacuole with a few exceptions in the transition zone, regardless of chemical treatment or flight environment (Fig. 4). This suggests that the microgravity environment on the ISS does not induce major delays on vacuole biogenesis in the WT. zig-1 seedlings showed the typical fragmented vacuole phenotype in both the flight assay and the ground control when the DMSO control treatment was applied (Fig. 4). While no differences were observed between flight and ground control in the zig-1 transition zone of roots treated with DMSO (Fig. 4b, f), a small but significant increase in vacuole number was detected in the elongation zone of flight samples in zig-1 (Fig. 4d, h). For example, the average vacuole number per cell was 3.27 for ground control and 3.80 for flight assay in the epidermis of the elongation zone. Therefore, zig-1 may have an enhanced zig-1 phenotype in the microgravity environment of the ISS. Fig. 4. Quantification of WM-induced vacuole fusion. Open in a new tab Vacuole morphology (a, c, e, g) and vacuole number (b, d, f, h) of WT and zig-1 plants expressing GFP-TIP2;1. Seedlings were grown in ground control or the ISS and treated with DMSO buffer (control) or WM solution. Cells were imaged at the root tip epidermis transition zone (a, b), epidermis elongation zone (c, d), cortex transition zone (e, f) or cortex elongation zone (g, h). Four-day-old seedlings were treated with DMSO buffer control or WM solution for 2 h and then seedlings were fixed and kept in 4 °C before confocal imaging. (Three-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison test, ****p < 0.0001; **p < 0.0021; n represents cell number under analysis per genotype per treatment, n > 155). Raw datapoints are represented with filled circles. Error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar: 40 μm.Vacuole numbers in WM-treated plants was used as a proxy for vacuole fusion events (Fig. 4). As expected, the vacuole number per cell in zig-1 treated with WM was smaller than the DMSO control for both flight and ground control samples and in all cells analyzed. This suggests that the WM treatment was effective at inducing vacuole fusion inside the PDFU. Like the EVT experiment, WM did not induce complete vacuole fusion in either flight or ground control as zig-1 cells containing more than one vacuole were observed in all tissues. However, a higher number of vacuoles was observed in the epidermis of WM-treated zig-1 grown on the ISS when compared to the ground (Fig. 4a–d, Supplementary Table 2). These results suggest a small delay in zig-1 vacuole fusion during flight. This hypothesis is supported by the smaller difference in the average vacuole number between DMSO and WM treatments in the epidermis transition zone for the flight samples (0.88) when compared to ground control (1.17). Similar results were found in the epidermis elongation zone, with these differences being 0.91 (flight) and 1.57 (ground), respectively. This sensitivity to the flight environment was not detected in the cortical cells where the difference between WM and DMSO vacuole numbers were similar in the two environments. These results overall suggest a cell-type specific response to the stress conditions of the flight environment that resulted in small decreases in vacuole fusion in the epidermis. Amyloplasts were associated with tonoplast in microgravity Vacuoles are tightly associated with other organelles and vacuole-amyloplasts associations might be involved in gravity sensing27. We took advantage of the strong GFP fluorescence of fixed BRIC-24 samples and the vacuole phenotype of zig-1 to test whether microgravity alters the association of vacuoles with amyloplasts. Statocytes from WT and zig-1 seedlings that were treated with the DMSO buffer were imaged by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. 10). Amyloplasts in hypocotyl endodermal cells were found closely associated with tonoplast both for flight sample and ground control and in both genotypes, and the tonoplast membrane surrounded all plastids (Fig. 5). As expected, WT amyloplasts were found at the bottom of the cell in the ground control samples while they were distributed throughout the cell in the ISS samples. Like previous results27, amyloplasts appeared trapped between fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 for both flight and ground control. Unfortunately, we could not analyze root statocytes in a similar manner due to low GFP fluorescence intensity in root columella cells (Supplementary Fig. 10). These results overall suggest that the microgravity environment of the ISS does not appear to alter the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts at least in hypocotyls. Fig. 5. Visualization of the vacuole and amyloplast inside the hypocotyl endodermal cell. Open in a new tab Amyloplasts (where arrows point at) were associated with tonoplast (labeled by GFP) in hypocotyl endodermis of WT and zig-1 in microgravity environment as on earth.

    "discussion": "Discussion Here, we investigated the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion and the association of vacuoles and plastids. The feasibility of chemical treatments in plants on the ISS was demonstrated using the BRIC-PDFU hardware and an optimized plant fixation protocol. The microgravity environment of the ISS enhanced the phenotype of zig-1. WT seedlings had longer hypocotyls when grown on the ISS and this was consistent with previous experiments with seedlings grown in the dark46–48. No differences in root growth were detected between ground controls and ISS-grown WT plants and similar results are reported elsewhere for Arabidopsis seedlings49,50. The increased elongation of WT hypocotyls in microgravity may result from increased cell wall extensibility and reduced accumulation of xyloglucans46. In addition, an increase in transverse microtubules may also be involved in changing the rate of cell elongation48. On the other hand, zig-1 mutants showed shorter hypocotyls and more vacuoles per cell in some root cells when grown in microgravity. This suggests an enhanced zig-1 phenotype on the ISS. Given the role of VTI11 as a SNARE for protein trafficking51, it is tempting to speculate that the microgravity environment may have a negative effect for endomembrane trafficking overall. Moreover, the enhanced phenotype of zig-1 suggests that microgravity results in a mild decrease in vacuole fusion even though this can only be detected in this sensitized genotype. Cell elongation is in part dependent on the establishment and morphology of the large central vacuole17, and altered vacuole fusion could contribute to the reduction in hypocotyl elongation in flight-grown zig-1. Unfortunately, the low expression of the GFP-TIP2;1 marker in hypocotyl cells precluded a direct analysis of vacuole numbers in that tissue. Given the similar growth of zig-1 roots between ground control and flight, we can not rule out other cellular defects in the microgravity environment of the ISS for the shortened hypocotyls in zig-1. The microgravity environment appears to delay WM-induced vacuole fusion in zig-1 root epidermis. The WM fusion assay is an ideal tool for visualization of cellular membrane fusion in fixed tissues in space. We selected the cortex and epidermis from the transition and early elongation zones of the root because while the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1 is present in most cell types, the WM-induced fusion is best visualized in those root cells26,27. Moreover, root cells undergoing the transition between meristem and elongation zones are well-defined stages of vacuole maturation45,52–54. Overall, we found cells from the transition and early elongation zone to be better preserved than the central elongation or the maturation zones. Given the large numbers of seedlings used, this allowed us to obtain quantitative information for this assay. The vacuole number analysis in epidermis and cortex indicated that WM was overall effective at inducing vacuole fusion of zig-1 in microgravity inside the BRIC-PDFU. This result underscores the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments in plants grown on the ISS. These experiments, however, also exposed limitations rendered by the PDFU hardware as vacuole fusion was incomplete even in the ground control, unlike similar experiments outside the hardware where almost all the zig-1 cells result in having a single vacuole. Given the sealed nature of the PDFU and the mode of actuation, contact of the chemical solution with all the seedlings on the plate may be incomplete and this would be exacerbated by the abnormal movement of liquids under microgravity. Nonetheless, a small but significant delay in WM-induced vacuole fusion was detected in the epidermis of flight-grown zig-1. This result, together with the increased vacuole number in this mutant under microgravity, suggests that microgravity may slow down membrane fusion events in plants but not sufficiently to inhibit growth or be detectable in the WT. This work demonstrated that fixation of fluorescent protein-labeled organelles on the ISS is feasible. Previous cell biology experiments on the ISS relied on tissue fixation followed by electron microscopy9. Fluorescence microscopes have been available at the ISS48,55 which allowed the visualization of GFP tagged proteins in plants56, but these have been limited to tissue expression patterns due to the complexity of high-resolution imaging57. Imaging of plant cells with high resolution requires high numerical aperture objectives with short working distances which require specimens be mounted on slides, something that would require a large amount of astronaut time. Therefore, tissue fixation and post-flight microscopy is still the best option for cell biology when large sample numbers are needed. Electron microscopy of fixed samples provides the best cellular and subcellular resolution but is time consuming. We set out to develop effective protocols for the fixation of Arabidopsis seedlings carrying fluorescently tagged proteins such that we could take advantage of the capabilities and efficiency of confocal microscopy. We were able to obtain good quality fixations in both genotypes that allowed us to quantify vacuoles in sufficient seedlings, but it is important to emphasize that the fixation quality was still diminished compared to similar fixation protocols outside the BRIC-PDFU hardware even on earth. The fixation protocol described here was optimized to follow a chemical treatment in AGM buffer. BRIC-PDFU actuations result in the mixture of fixative and chemical treatment solution as there is no mechanism to remove the first solution. Both the AGM and the fixative buffer contribute to the osmolarity of the final mixture and therefore affect fixation quality. Membrane vesiculation was observed in some fixed seedlings (Supplementary Figs. 3, 7), and further optimization of the fixation protocol may improve the post-flight imaging of stored fixed samples. Similar vesiculation phenomena has been reported in formaldehyde-fixed samples in other systems58. A further challenge of the PDFU hardware that might impinge on fixation quality is the low precision of the volumes used to fill the dual chamber of PDFUs. Our study demonstrated that variations from the 1:1 ratio of AGM to fixative can dramatically alter the fixation quality of plant specimens. Future experiments using this hardware must ensure sufficient sample size to account for the loss of samples due to poor fixation. An improved dual chamber PDFU unit with more precise volume control would augment the use of this hardware in future flight experiments. Tissue fixation protocols that are compatible with fluorescent proteins have been developed for plants37,38,42,59. These protocols were developed to improve imaging depth within plant tissues by clearing cellular structures. Maintaining subcellular structure and fluorescent protein structure and intensity allow for imaging experiments that are incompatible with live-cell imaging such as those conducted in space. We found that the intensity of GFP and mCherry is retained in fixed seedlings even after long storage in the cold. However, GFP intensity was more sensitive than mCherry to buffer composition. Lower concentration of KPBS buffer reduces the intensity of GFP, suggesting the GFP stability can be altered by the concentration of certain salt. Unfortunately, the morphology of the mCherry-tagged ER was poorly preserved with most fixative solutions. Many aggregates of ER membranes were detected while the fluorescence intensity of the mCherry marker was intact. A similar phenomenon was reported in Drosophila cells carrying a BiP-Superfolder GFP-HDEL fusion that labels the ER. In those cells, chemical fixation disrupted the ER morphology and ER tubules appeared to fragment into discrete puncta60. Preservation of ER structures by chemical fixation may require specific chemical compositions.",

Copyright notice ID: 9445043 PMID: 36064795 Abstract The spaceflight environment of the International Space Station poses a multitude of stresses on plant growth including reduced gravity. Plants exposed to microgravity and other conditions on the ISS display root skewing, changes in gene expression and protein abundance that may result in changes in cell wall composition, antioxidant accumulation and modification of growth anisotropy. Systematic studies that address the effects of microgravity on cellular organelles are lacking but altered numbers and sizes of vacuoles have been detected in previous flights. The prominent size of plant vacuoles makes them ideal models to study organelle dynamics in space. Here, we used Arabidopsis zigzag-1 (zig-1) as a sensitized genotype to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Wortmannin was used to induce vacuole fusion in seedlings and a formaldehyde-based fixation protocol was developed to visualize plant vacuole morphology after sample return, using confocal microscopy. Our results indicate that microgravity enhances the zig-1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl growth and vacuole fusion in some cells. This study demonstrates the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments for plant cell biology experiments in space. Subject terms: Plant sciences, Cell biologyIntroduction Growing healthy plants in space is a major goal towards the viability of long-term space missions as plants can provide food for astronauts and benefit mental health. The space environment includes multiple stresses for plant growth including different levels of gravity, radiation, decreased nutrient delivery and water recycling1,2. The International Space Station provides an ideal experimental setting for the study of plant growth and development under space conditions and many experiments have been conducted with plants on the ISS1,3. Reduced gravity on the ISS results in disoriented plant growth unless light is provided to activate directional growth from phototropism. Effects of the spaceflight environment on the ISS include reduced cell elongation4 or altered cell division5 in roots. At the cellular level, the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons as well as the cell wall are altered under microgravity6–8. Other cellular organelles are altered under microgravity conditions include mitochondria, plastids and ER6. Interestingly, vacuole numbers increased in root apical cells for Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the ISS9, and vacuole volume increases in certain cells in microgravity10,11. Moreover, proteins involved in intracellular membrane trafficking were found to show altered abundance in microgravity12–14. Those results suggest vacuolar development as well as trafficking are disrupted in microgravity, but overall, there is a large gap in documenting the effect of spaceflight on the organization of cellular organelles15. The plant vacuole is a large essential organelle in plant cells and is important for cell elongation, recycling, and storage, among many other functions16–18. Vacuole enlargement is concomitant with cell growth along the developmental gradient represented by the longitudinal axis of the root. Vacuole enlargement along this gradient requires homotypic membrane fusion, which is mediated by two conserved complexes, the homotypic vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)19. Both HOPS and the vacuolar SNARE complexes have vacuole or pre-vacuole-specific subunits that provide specificity to membrane fusion. The vacuolar SNARE complex is formed by SYP22, VTI11, SYP51, and either VAMP72720 or VAMP713/VAMP71121–23. A loss of function allele of VTI11, zigzag1(zig-1), has fragmented vacuoles and showed abnormal shoot gravitropism24–26. The zig-1 mutant also has short hypocotyls, small and wrinkled rosette leaves and a zigzag-shaped stem24,25. Wortmannin (WM), a chemical inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), can induce vacuole fusion in zig-1 and partially restore its agravitropic shoot phenotype26,27. WM-induced vacuole fusion in zig-1 is fast and almost complete vacuole fusion can be observed in roots within two hours26,27. Given the large size of the vacuole in plant cells and the efficiency of WM at inducing its fusion, this treatment represents a unique assay for the study of organelle fusion in plants in space. Plant specimens have been sent to space for fundamental biology research since the 1960s1,3,28 and this resulted in the design of specific hardware for optimal growth3,29. The Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) is a fully contained hardware that has been used extensively with small plant seedlings9,30–32 and it is suitable for chemical treatments in space. Previous experiments involved storing liquid media or fixative solution inside the chamber of the PDFU for microbial culture or plant tissue fixation33–35. Cell biology research on the ISS requires sample fixation to preserve cell morphology. Chemical fixation in the ISS has been accomplished with non-coagulant agents such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde9 but the latter has high levels of autofluorescence36. Direct fluorescence microscopy of fluorescent proteins from fixed tissues37,38 is an effective approach to extract quantitative information of cell structure at high samples size, but the viability of fluorescence microscopy of tissues fixed in space has not been demonstrated given the challenges imposed by the BRIC hardware. Here, we took advantage of the WM-induced vacuole fusion in zig-1 to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Formaldehyde-based tissue fixation in the BRIC-PDFU hardware was used and GFP-tagged vacuoles were imaged post-flight by confocal microscopy. We detected a mild but significant decrease in plant vacuole fusion in zig-1 that highlights possible effects of microgravity or other spaceflight stresses on vacuole biogenesis and membrane fusion. This experiment also demonstrates the feasibility of chemical treatment assays on the ISS which may contribute to future cell biology research in this microgravity environment.Results Optimization of BRIC-24 workflow The goal of BRIC-24 was to test whether vacuole fusion is affected by the microgravity environment of the ISS. A previously characterized vacuole fusion assay26,27 was implemented with the BRIC-PDFU hardware. This assay takes advantage of the accumulation of vacuoles in the zig-1 mutant and the rapid induction of vacuole fusion in this mutant upon treatment with Wortmannin (WM)27. Visualization of organelle morphology is accomplished by confocal microscopy of a GFP-tagged vacuolar marker (GFP-TIP2;1)39 and a mCherry-tagged ER marker (HDEL-mCherry)40 previously characterized. Figure 1 describes the BRIC-24 workflow as it was completed as part of the SpaceX-22 mission in July of 2021. Thirty sterile seeds from WT (Columbia-0) or zig-1 were plated directly on Arabidopsis Growth Media (AGM) plates before integration into the BRIC-PDFU hardware at Kennedy Space Center. From this point, plates were maintained cold and in the dark. Each PDFU was separately loaded with a treatment solution (WM or DMSO control in AGM) as well as fixative solution taking advantage of the dual chamber of the PDFU hardware. The fixative solution was infused with N2 gas to enhance its long term stability as described41. Four BRICs containing a total of 22 PDFUs and 2 HOBO temperature recorders were delivered to NASA’s cold stowage facility prior to launch (Supplementary Table 1). Two days after arriving at the ISS, BRICs were unpacked and allowed to come up to the temperature of the ISS environment to promote germination and growth. WM or DMSO control solutions were applied at day 4 of seedling growth followed by fixative solution 2 h later. BRICs were returned to a 4 °C storage compartment until the return flight 4 weeks later, de-integration and confocal analysis at North Carolina State University. Fig. 1. Overview of the BRIC-24 experimental workflow. Open in a new tab Sterilized Arabidopsis seeds (WT and zig-1 with GFP-TIP2;1) were plated onto AGM media and stored at 4 °C before BRIC-PDFU integration. Each petri dish contained 30 seeds. Treatment solution (33 μm WM or DMSO buffer) and fixative were injected into the dual chamber of the PDFU. Plates were placed into each PDFUs and PDFUs were integrated into BRICs. Four BRICs were then stored in a cold bag for the flight. After 4 days of growth on the ISS, WM solution or DMSO control were applied to the seedlings. The treatment lasted for 2 hours. The second actuation was conducted by applying fixative solution to the seedlings. BRICs were then kept at 4 °C and returned to NASA after splash down. Confocal imaging and data analysis were conducted at NCSU.BRIC-24 protocols that fit the constraints of the flight schedule and hardware required considerations for storage of treatment solutions in the BRIC hardware before actuation and the preservation of treated and fixed seedlings for up to 6 weeks before imaging. First, we confirmed that 30 μM working dilutions of WM in liquid AGM buffer are still active after 2 weeks of storage at 4 °C (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, we determined that the formaldehyde-based fixative solution was effective after 2 weeks storage (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results demonstrated the feasibility of the BRIC-24 workflow. Transfer of the treatment and fixative solutions from the liquid chambers of the PDFUs and into the plants is carried out by astronauts in space, but this device does not allow for the removal of the first solution. Therefore, the fixative solution would always mix with the previously applied treatment solution. We then tested the effectiveness of a variety of fixative buffers and PFA concentrations when mixed 1:1 with liquid AGM by visualization the GFP-labeled tonoplast and the mCherry-labeled ER of fixed samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). A 4% working concentration of PFA was used as the fixative agent37,42. When PFA was directly diluted in liquid AGM, the intensity of GFP fluorescence was weak, and the morphology of vacuole and ER were blurry compared to live-seedling controls (Supplementary Fig. 3B, C). As most PFA fixation solutions are made in PBS and many variations exist, we tested different PBS concentrations and mixed them 1:1 with AGM. Fixative solutions in full (1x) PBS buffer as well as 0.5x PBS yielded plants with high intensity of GFP, however, only the PFA solution in 0.5x PBS showed the best preservation of vacuole morphology (Supplementary Fig. 3D, E). In the case of the KPBS buffer, a variation of PBS that contains K+ as an alkali metal cation in addition to Na+ ion, vacuole morphology was acceptable, but GFP intensity was diminished (Supplementary Fig. 3G, H). Weak GFP signal was also detected for samples fixed with fixative in MTSB buffer, a buffer typically used to preserve cytoskeleton in plants43, (Supplementary Fig. 3I, J). PFA solutions in PPB and Sorensen’s buffer were ineffective in preserving vacuole morphology (Supplementary Fig. 3K, L). Preservation of ER morphology as reported by the mCherry-HDEL marker was even more challenging. Most fixative solutions resulted in the accumulation of ER aggregates and overall loss of ER structure, except for a PFA solution in 0.25x KPBS (Supplementary Fig. 3H). This solution, however, was not optimal for visualization of vacuoles. As vacuole fusion was the primary target for this research, we selected the 4% PFA solution in 0.5x PBS (Supplementary Fig. 3E) as the final fixative concentration for the flight experiment and did not analyze ER morphology as part of BRIC-24. One major concern for doing plant cell biology experiments in space is that fixed samples must be stored on the ISS for several weeks before splash-down. We therefore tested whether 4 weeks of storage would affect the intensity of GFP or the overall preservation of vacuole morphology of fixed samples. Several experiments confirmed that long term storage of these samples would not significantly affect their quality of preservation (Supplementary Fig. 4) further supporting the feasibility of BRIC-24.Ground tests demonstrated feasibility of the vacuole fusion assay using the BRIC-PDFU Science (SVT) and Experiment (EVT) Verification Tests were completed at Kennedy Space Center on March and September 2020, respectively, to determine the feasibility of the experimental workflow using the BRIC-PDFU hardware. The PDFU is an enclosed environment where plants are exposed to dark conditions and where plant growth or the effectiveness of chemical treatments cannot be assessed in real time. It was important to test whether WM treatment of WT and zig-1 inside the PDFU was equivalent to treatments regularly done on plastic dishes. Both SVT and EVT were used to optimize growth conditions in the PDFU and to optimize the WM treatment and fixation. Plants were grown for 4 days during SVT, and they were treated with 33 μM WM for 1 h before fixation in 4% formaldehyde in 0.25x KPBS. The germination rate during SVT was not significantly different between genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 5A), but the hypocotyl length of WT was longer than that of zig-1 (Supplementary Fig. 5B) as previously reported24. Fixed seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize the vacuoles in the epidermis and cortex from the root transition and elongation zones (Supplementary Fig. 5C). Visualization of vacuoles after PFA fixation in KPBS buffer results in weak GFP fluorescence. As expected, a single vacuole was observed in most cells of WT roots regardless of chemical treatment. Multiple vacuoles were detected in zig-1 roots in the control treatment and the WM treatment resulted in fewer vacuoles per cell when compared to the control. Most cells did not complete vacuole fusion after 1 h under these conditions and this was unexpected26,27. This result could be due to hardware limitations or suboptimal fixation, and it prompted an increase in the incubation time of the WM in subsequent experiments. A final EVT was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of BRIC-24 before flight. Plants were grown for 3 days and treated with 33 μM WM for 2 h before fixation in 4% formaldehyde in 0.5x PBS to preserve GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 5D, E). Again, no significant differences in seed germination were detected between genotypes but zig-1 hypocotyls were shorter than the WT (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 5D, E). Root cortical cells of the root transition zone were imaged for vacuole morphology (Fig. 2b, c) and most WT cells contained only one vacuole regardless of treatment. Multiple vacuoles per cell were observed in the zig-1 control, and WM treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of vacuoles per cell in the mutant. These results suggest that chemical inhibitor treatments in the BRIC-PDFU are feasible, albeit adjustments must be made to accommodate changes due to the limitations of the hardware. Fig. 2. The WM-induced vacuole fusion assay can be carried out in the BRIC-PDFU. Open in a new tab a Germination rate of WT and zig-1 seeds inside BRIC-PDFU during EVT.

Error bars represent standard deviation.Even though the feasibility of BRIC-24 was demonstrated during EVT, the overall quality of GFP signal, seedling preservation and WM effectiveness was not on par with similar experiments outside the BRIC-PDFU hardware. This may result from the lack of precision when loading solutions into the dual chamber. We then tested whether deviations from the 1:1 ratio between the WM (or DMSO) solution in AGM and the fixative could affect the quality of cell fixation. Dark grown zig-1 seedlings were fixed in different mixtures of liquid AGM and fixative solution that mimic unequal loading of each solution into the dual chamber. The best cell morphology and GFP signal preservation were obtained when those solutions were mixed with 1:1 ratio. Higher concentrations of fixative induced cell damage while lower concentrations of fixative resulted in lower GFP intensity (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results explain some suboptimal cell preservation and GFP fluorescence during SVT and EVT (Supplementary Fig. 7) and must be considered for future flight experiments using the BRIC-PDFU. Nonetheless, sufficient seedlings with good preservation and bright GFP fluorescence were recovered from EVT to demonstrate flight readiness of BRIC-24. zig-1 showed normal germination but altered hypocotyl growth on the ISS BRIC-24 was flown with the SpaceX-22 mission (Fig. 1). Identical experiments with 4 BRICs containing 22 PDFUs were completed on the ISS (flight) and at Kennedy Space Center (ground control). Due to a power failure, the ground control experiment ran 5 weeks after the flight. We analyzed the germination rate, seedling hypocotyl length of WT and zig-1 from flight assay and compared the data to ground control. Seed germination was not affected by the microgravity environment of the ISS in either genotype (Fig. 3a). Like SVT and EVT experiments, WT hypocotyls were 7.35% and 31.67% longer than those of zig-1 in ground control and flight respectively. However, the ISS environment resulted in 8.46% longer hypocotyls on the WT compared to ground control while the effect in zig-1 was the opposite, where zig-1 plants grown on the ISS were 11.57% shorter than the ground control (Fig. 3b, d). WT roots were 13% longer than zig-1 in both treatments and no differences were detected between the flight and ground controls in either genotype (Fig. 3c, d). These results suggest that seed germination and root growth of zig-1 are not affected by microgravity, but its hypocotyl growth may be inhibited by the stresses imposed by the ISS environment.

Error bars represent standard deviation. d Representative seedlings of the WT and zig-1 from either ground control or flight after de-integration of the BRIC-PDFU. Fixed seedlings were taken out of fixative solution and arranged on plate. Scale bar: 1 cm.WM-induced vacuole fusion may be delayed in microgravity The primary goal for this research was to test whether WM can induce vacuole fusion of zig-1 in the microgravity environment of the ISS. For this purpose, all seedlings collected from BRIC-PDFUs of flight assay and ground control were imaged by confocal microscopy for vacuole number analysis. Epidermal and cortical cells within the transition and elongation zones of the root tip were analyzed as changes in vacuole morphology are readily observed in these cell transitions44,45. WT cells had only one vacuole with a few exceptions in the transition zone, regardless of chemical treatment or flight environment (Fig. 4). This suggests that the microgravity environment on the ISS does not induce major delays on vacuole biogenesis in the WT. zig-1 seedlings showed the typical fragmented vacuole phenotype in both the flight assay and the ground control when the DMSO control treatment was applied (Fig. 4). While no differences were observed between flight and ground control in the zig-1 transition zone of roots treated with DMSO (Fig. 4b, f), a small but significant increase in vacuole number was detected in the elongation zone of flight samples in zig-1 (Fig. 4d, h). For example, the average vacuole number per cell was 3.27 for ground control and 3.80 for flight assay in the epidermis of the elongation zone. Therefore, zig-1 may have an enhanced zig-1 phenotype in the microgravity environment of the ISS. Fig. 4. Quantification of WM-induced vacuole fusion. Open in a new tab Vacuole morphology (a, c, e, g) and vacuole number (b, d, f, h) of WT and zig-1 plants expressing GFP-TIP2;1. Seedlings were grown in ground control or the ISS and treated with DMSO buffer (control) or WM solution. Cells were imaged at the root tip epidermis transition zone (a, b), epidermis elongation zone (c, d), cortex transition zone (e, f) or cortex elongation zone (g, h). Four-day-old seedlings were treated with DMSO buffer control or WM solution for 2 h and then seedlings were fixed and kept in 4 °C before confocal imaging. (Three-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison test, ****p < 0.0001; **p < 0.0021; n represents cell number under analysis per genotype per treatment, n > 155). Raw datapoints are represented with filled circles. Error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar: 40 μm.Vacuole numbers in WM-treated plants was used as a proxy for vacuole fusion events (Fig. 4). As expected, the vacuole number per cell in zig-1 treated with WM was smaller than the DMSO control for both flight and ground control samples and in all cells analyzed. This suggests that the WM treatment was effective at inducing vacuole fusion inside the PDFU. Like the EVT experiment, WM did not induce complete vacuole fusion in either flight or ground control as zig-1 cells containing more than one vacuole were observed in all tissues. However, a higher number of vacuoles was observed in the epidermis of WM-treated zig-1 grown on the ISS when compared to the ground (Fig. 4a–d, Supplementary Table 2). These results suggest a small delay in zig-1 vacuole fusion during flight. This hypothesis is supported by the smaller difference in the average vacuole number between DMSO and WM treatments in the epidermis transition zone for the flight samples (0.88) when compared to ground control (1.17). Similar results were found in the epidermis elongation zone, with these differences being 0.91 (flight) and 1.57 (ground), respectively. This sensitivity to the flight environment was not detected in the cortical cells where the difference between WM and DMSO vacuole numbers were similar in the two environments. These results overall suggest a cell-type specific response to the stress conditions of the flight environment that resulted in small decreases in vacuole fusion in the epidermis.Amyloplasts were associated with tonoplast in microgravity Vacuoles are tightly associated with other organelles and vacuole-amyloplasts associations might be involved in gravity sensing27. We took advantage of the strong GFP fluorescence of fixed BRIC-24 samples and the vacuole phenotype of zig-1 to test whether microgravity alters the association of vacuoles with amyloplasts. Statocytes from WT and zig-1 seedlings that were treated with the DMSO buffer were imaged by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. 10). Amyloplasts in hypocotyl endodermal cells were found closely associated with tonoplast both for flight sample and ground control and in both genotypes, and the tonoplast membrane surrounded all plastids (Fig. 5). As expected, WT amyloplasts were found at the bottom of the cell in the ground control samples while they were distributed throughout the cell in the ISS samples. Like previous results27, amyloplasts appeared trapped between fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 for both flight and ground control. Unfortunately, we could not analyze root statocytes in a similar manner due to low GFP fluorescence intensity in root columella cells (Supplementary Fig. 10). These results overall suggest that the microgravity environment of the ISS does not appear to alter the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts at least in hypocotyls. Fig. 5. Visualization of the vacuole and amyloplast inside the hypocotyl endodermal cell. Open in a new tab Amyloplasts (where arrows point at) were associated with tonoplast (labeled by GFP) in hypocotyl endodermis of WT and zig-1 in microgravity environment as on earth. Scale bar: 20 μm.Discussion Here, we investigated the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion and the association of vacuoles and plastids. The feasibility of chemical treatments in plants on the ISS was demonstrated using the BRIC-PDFU hardware and an optimized plant fixation protocol. The microgravity environment of the ISS enhanced the phenotype of zig-1. WT seedlings had longer hypocotyls when grown on the ISS and this was consistent with previous experiments with seedlings grown in the dark46–48. No differences in root growth were detected between ground controls and ISS-grown WT plants and similar results are reported elsewhere for Arabidopsis seedlings49,50. The increased elongation of WT hypocotyls in microgravity may result from increased cell wall extensibility and reduced accumulation of xyloglucans46. In addition, an increase in transverse microtubules may also be involved in changing the rate of cell elongation48. On the other hand, zig-1 mutants showed shorter hypocotyls and more vacuoles per cell in some root cells when grown in microgravity. This suggests an enhanced zig-1 phenotype on the ISS. Given the role of VTI11 as a SNARE for protein trafficking51, it is tempting to speculate that the microgravity environment may have a negative effect for endomembrane trafficking overall. Moreover, the enhanced phenotype of zig-1 suggests that microgravity results in a mild decrease in vacuole fusion even though this can only be detected in this sensitized genotype. Cell elongation is in part dependent on the establishment and morphology of the large central vacuole17, and altered vacuole fusion could contribute to the reduction in hypocotyl elongation in flight-grown zig-1. Unfortunately, the low expression of the GFP-TIP2;1 marker in hypocotyl cells precluded a direct analysis of vacuole numbers in that tissue. Given the similar growth of zig-1 roots between ground control and flight, we can not rule out other cellular defects in the microgravity environment of the ISS for the shortened hypocotyls in zig-1. The microgravity environment appears to delay WM-induced vacuole fusion in zig-1 root epidermis. The WM fusion assay is an ideal tool for visualization of cellular membrane fusion in fixed tissues in space. We selected the cortex and epidermis from the transition and early elongation zones of the root because while the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1 is present in most cell types, the WM-induced fusion is best visualized in those root cells26,27. Moreover, root cells undergoing the transition between meristem and elongation zones are well-defined stages of vacuole maturation45,52–54. Overall, we found cells from the transition and early elongation zone to be better preserved than the central elongation or the maturation zones. Given the large numbers of seedlings used, this allowed us to obtain quantitative information for this assay. The vacuole number analysis in epidermis and cortex indicated that WM was overall effective at inducing vacuole fusion of zig-1 in microgravity inside the BRIC-PDFU. This result underscores the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments in plants grown on the ISS. These experiments, however, also exposed limitations rendered by the PDFU hardware as vacuole fusion was incomplete even in the ground control, unlike similar experiments outside the hardware where almost all the zig-1 cells result in having a single vacuole. Given the sealed nature of the PDFU and the mode of actuation, contact of the chemical solution with all the seedlings on the plate may be incomplete and this would be exacerbated by the abnormal movement of liquids under microgravity. Nonetheless, a small but significant delay in WM-induced vacuole fusion was detected in the epidermis of flight-grown zig-1. This result, together with the increased vacuole number in this mutant under microgravity, suggests that microgravity may slow down membrane fusion events in plants but not sufficiently to inhibit growth or be detectable in the WT. This work demonstrated that fixation of fluorescent protein-labeled organelles on the ISS is feasible. Previous cell biology experiments on the ISS relied on tissue fixation followed by electron microscopy9. Fluorescence microscopes have been available at the ISS48,55 which allowed the visualization of GFP tagged proteins in plants56, but these have been limited to tissue expression patterns due to the complexity of high-resolution imaging57. Imaging of plant cells with high resolution requires high numerical aperture objectives with short working distances which require specimens be mounted on slides, something that would require a large amount of astronaut time. Therefore, tissue fixation and post-flight microscopy is still the best option for cell biology when large sample numbers are needed. Electron microscopy of fixed samples provides the best cellular and subcellular resolution but is time consuming. We set out to develop effective protocols for the fixation of Arabidopsis seedlings carrying fluorescently tagged proteins such that we could take advantage of the capabilities and efficiency of confocal microscopy. We were able to obtain good quality fixations in both genotypes that allowed us to quantify vacuoles in sufficient seedlings, but it is important to emphasize that the fixation quality was still diminished compared to similar fixation protocols outside the BRIC-PDFU hardware even on earth. The fixation protocol described here was optimized to follow a chemical treatment in AGM buffer. BRIC-PDFU actuations result in the mixture of fixative and chemical treatment solution as there is no mechanism to remove the first solution. Both the AGM and the fixative buffer contribute to the osmolarity of the final mixture and therefore affect fixation quality. Membrane vesiculation was observed in some fixed seedlings (Supplementary Figs. 3, 7), and further optimization of the fixation protocol may improve the post-flight imaging of stored fixed samples. Similar vesiculation phenomena has been reported in formaldehyde-fixed samples in other systems58. A further challenge of the PDFU hardware that might impinge on fixation quality is the low precision of the volumes used to fill the dual chamber of PDFUs. Our study demonstrated that variations from the 1:1 ratio of AGM to fixative can dramatically alter the fixation quality of plant specimens. Future experiments using this hardware must ensure sufficient sample size to account for the loss of samples due to poor fixation. An improved dual chamber PDFU unit with more precise volume control would augment the use of this hardware in future flight experiments. Tissue fixation protocols that are compatible with fluorescent proteins have been developed for plants37,38,42,59. These protocols were developed to improve imaging depth within plant tissues by clearing cellular structures. Maintaining subcellular structure and fluorescent protein structure and intensity allow for imaging experiments that are incompatible with live-cell imaging such as those conducted in space. We found that the intensity of GFP and mCherry is retained in fixed seedlings even after long storage in the cold. However, GFP intensity was more sensitive than mCherry to buffer composition. Lower concentration of KPBS buffer reduces the intensity of GFP, suggesting the GFP stability can be altered by the concentration of certain salt. Unfortunately, the morphology of the mCherry-tagged ER was poorly preserved with most fixative solutions. Many aggregates of ER membranes were detected while the fluorescence intensity of the mCherry marker was intact. A similar phenomenon was reported in Drosophila cells carrying a BiP-Superfolder GFP-HDEL fusion that labels the ER. In those cells, chemical fixation disrupted the ER morphology and ER tubules appeared to fragment into discrete puncta60. Preservation of ER structures by chemical fixation may require specific chemical compositions.Methods Arabidopsis materials and growth conditions Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0) expressing GFP-TIP2;1 was previously described39 and previously transformed27 with the HDEL-mCherry construct40. The zig-1 mutant was previously described24, and the GFP-TIP2;1 marker was introgressed into this genotype by crossing. The HDEL-mCherry marker40 was separately introduced into zig-1 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation27 and the two markers were combined by crossing and selection of plants in the F2. Seeds were surface sterilized and sown on 0.5 X Arabidopsis growth medium (AGM, 0.5X Murashige and Skoog medium, 10 g/L Gelrite, 1% (w/v) sucrose) in 6 cm diameter petri dishes. Each petri dish contained 30 seeds. Twenty-two Petri dishes were integrated into PDFUs and stored in 4 BRICs for SVT, EVT and flight. BRICs were incubated at 4 °C for 5 days in the dark and transferred to 22 °C growth chamber (SVT, EVT and ground control) or the ISS environment (flight assay) for 3–4 days (Fig. 1).Chemical treatments and fixation Three to four-day-old dark-grown seedlings were used for chemical treatments and fixation. WM (SIGMA, cat# W3144) was diluted to 33 μM in AGM and an equal volume of DMSO (Thermo Scientific, D12345) diluted in AGM was used as the control. For lab testing, seedlings were incubated in WM working solution or DMSO buffer control for 1 or 2 h in the dark. If used in the BRIC-PDFU, WM or DMSO were stored in one of the chambers in the PDFU and an actuator tool was used to push each solution onto the petri dish. Optimization of the seedling fixation protocol involved testing different buffers for the PFA fixative. To mimic the mixing process inside the BRIC-PDFU, one volume of 0.5X AGM was mixed with one volume of 8% Paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences cat# 15700) in the corresponding buffer for a final concentration of 4% PFA. The final concentration for each buffer to test was 0.5X AGM, 0.5X or 0.25X KPBS61, 0.5X or 1X BupHTM PBS (ThermoFisher Scientific cat# 28372), 0.5X or 1X microtubule stabilizing buffer (MTSB)43, 1X Potassium phosphate buffer (PPB) (6.5 mM KH2PO4, 93.5 mM K2HPO4) and 0.25X Sorenson’s buffer62. Seedlings treated with each mixture were immediately stored at 4 °C until confocal microscopy. For SVT, EVT and flight assay, 16% PFA aqueous solutions were diluted to 8% PFA in 0.5X KPBS (SVT) or 1X BupHTM PBS (EVT, flight assay). The final PFA concentration after actuation in the PDFU was around 4% with 0.25X KPBS buffer (SVT) and 0.5X BupHTM PBS buffer (EVT, flight assay). Seedlings were then stored at 4 °C until de-integration of BRIC-PDFU followed by confocal microscopy.Microscopy Fixed seedlings were washed 3 times for 1 min in sterilized water before imaging. A Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope was used for all the imaging. The excitation/emission wavelengths for GFP and mCherry were 488 nm/490–561 nm and 561 nm/570–676 nm respectively. The C-Apochromat 40X/1.2 W Korr FCS M27 water-immersion objective was used. All seedlings were imaged at the root tip transition and elongation zones and in both epidermis and/or cortical cells. The transition zone was defined as the region of the root apex where a doubling in cell length was observed in a specific cell layer, corresponding to the boundary between the meristematic and elongation zones63 and the cell where that doubling occurred was included in the analysis. Cells in the elongation zone were identified as those past the transition zone. Two to three z sections were captured per sample in each cell layer. Cells where the section was too close to the cell cortex were not included and vacuoles were counted by eye as defined by fluorescently-labelled membrane boundaries. Some seedlings were additionally imaged at the root tip columella and hypocotyl endodermis.Image analysis For SVT, EVT and the flight assay, seeds germination rate was calculated from the number of recovered seedlings in each PDFU after de-integration. To measure hypocotyl length, fixed seedlings were arranged on glass slides and imaged using digital cameras. Hypocotyl and root length was measured with Fiji64. To count the number of vacuoles per cell, images from different tissue and cell type was analyzed separately. Only cells with good preservation and strong GFP fluorescence intensity were counted. Three-way ANOVA analysis was applied to compare the cellular vacuole amount among different treatments. Statistical analysis and figure generation were conducted with GraphPad Prism version 9.2.0 for macOS, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com.Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplemental Material (8MB, pdf) Reporting Summary (1.5MB, pdf) Acknowledgements Special thanks to Dr. Ye Zhang from Kennedy Space Center, Gerard Newsham, Donald Houze, Susan Manning-Roach and Anne Marie Campbell form MEI Technologies for help with the SVT, EVT, and Flight assays.

    "title": "Hypergravity disruption of homeorhetic adaptations to lactation in rat dams include changes in circadian clocks",

    "abstract": "Summary Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation (hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and reproductive systems. Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day [P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however, HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and insulin levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were altered by HG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core clock genes in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. Gravity load alterations in dam's circadian system may have impacted homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation. Keywords: Circadian, Hypergravity, Homeorhesis, Lactation, Mammary, Pregnancy",
    "introduction": "Introduction At varying phases of the life cycle, there are differential nutrient requirements. During pregnancy and lactation, an immense demand for nutrients sustains these challenging physiological states in the mother and fosters growth and development of the fetus and neonate. To support fetal and neonatal growth, major changes in the partitioning of available nutrients occur in maternal tissues, including coordinated shifts in mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism that do not jeopardize maternal homeostasis or fetal and neonatal health (Bauman and Currie, 1980). Homeorhetic adaptations are the “coordinated changes in metabolism of body tissues necessary to support a (dominant) developmental or physiological process” (Bauman and Currie, 1980; Bell and Bauman, 1997). Whereas homeostasis is widely understood to describe compensatory mechanisms that preserve the relative constancy of functions despite external challenges, homeorhesis refers to regulatory processes that support developmental or physiological processes of highest priority (Bauman et al., 1982). Homeorhetic controls regulate nutrient partitioning during pregnancy, thereby assuring growth of the conceptus as well as development of the mammary gland. With the onset of lactation, many maternal tissues undergo further adaptations to support milk synthesis. During gestation, the endocrine system coordinates the mother's metabolic activities with the physiological requirements of the fetuses and subsequent nutritional demands of the suckling offspring. Mammary gland development and differentiation during pregnancy is the direct result of a network of changes in hormone levels, substrate availability and behavioral adaptations that collectively result in optimal milk production during lactation. During pregnancy, estrogen, progesterone, placental lactogen and the anterior pituitary hormone, prolactin (PRL), stimulate mammary growth and differentiation. At parturition, changes in these hormones act to stimulate the onset of lactation (Tucker, 1987; Freeman et al., 2000; Neville et al., 2001; Kelly et al., 2002). Periparturient changes in maternal metabolism include: 1) increased hepatic gluconeogenesis from endogenous substrates, 2) decreased peripheral tissue glucose utilization, 3) increased fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue, and 4) increased amino acid mobilization from muscle (Chaves and Herrera, 1978; Martin-Hidalgo et al., 1994; Bell, 1995). Thus to insure adequate milk production and simultaneously maintain maternal homeostasis, the lactating dam utilizes homeorhetic processes to shift her metabolism. The dam's normal homeorhetic response to the increased nutrient and energy demands of milk synthesis were mediated in part by global changes in gene transcription in mammary, liver and adipose including changes in clock genes that regulate circadian rhythms (Casey et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2011). Changes in molecular clocks during the transition from pregnancy to lactation in relation to other transcriptional profiles of mammary, liver and adipose tissues suggested that homeorhetic adaptation to lactation may be by coordinated in part by the circadian system. Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes and can be entrained by external cues (Hastings et al., 2007). Although light is the primary environmental cue that entrains circadian clocks, gravity significantly affects circadian patterns of behavior, hormones, body temperature, and metabolism (Czeisler et al., 1991; Whitson et al., 1995; Fuller et al., 2000; Murakami and Fuller, 2000; Robinson and Fuller, 2000; Dijk et al., 2001; Fuller et al., 2002; Holley et al., 2003). Gravity is an environmental stimulus that exerts major influences on animal physiology and behavior (Sonnenfeld, 2005). Similar to other environmental stimuli, such as temperature and light, animals have adapted to the Earth's gravitational force. In mammals, sudden deviations from Earth's 1-g environment are associated with significant physiological changes, including altered reproductive capability (Tou et al., 2002). Studies investigating the effects of gravity and circadian rhythms on reproducing and developing mammals can provide unique biomedical perspectives on these life processes on Earth (Ronca, 2007). We previously identified gravity as an environmental variable that produces major graded changes in mammary metabolic activity and reduces pup survival (Ronca et al., 2001; Plaut et al., 2003). We and others showed that survival rates of pups born to rat dams exposed to 1.5- to 2-times Earth's gravity during the latter half of pregnancy were reduced by 5 to 40% (Megory and Oyama, 1984; Baer et al., 2000; Ronca et al., 2001). However, if neonatal pups were removed from the hypergravity environment and cross fostered to non-manipulated dams, mortality did not occur (Baer et al., 2000). These data suggest that the dam's normal homeorhetic response to the onset of lactation was altered in hypergravity, thereby decreasing her ability to nurture pups. Although HG dams had reduced body fat and mass, these factors did not account for altered rates of lipid metabolism in mammary, liver and adipose tissues or decreased neonatal survival (Lintault et al., 2007). Further, neither prolactin nor glucocorticoid supplementation reversed the HG induced reduction in metabolic rates, suggesting that factors other than circulating lactogenic hormone levels and dam body composition were negatively impacting the dams' homeorhetic response to pregnancy and lactation (Patel et al., 2008). Collectively, these findings indicate a disruption of homeorhetic mechanisms that normally allow the dam to maintain homeostasis while simultaneously providing for growing fetuses and neonates. In the present study, we measured the effect of exposure to 2-g from mid-gestation (gestational day [G]11 of the rat's 22-day pregnancy) throughout early lactation (until Postnatal day [P]3) on metabolic activity of mammary, liver and adipose tissue as well as circulating hormone and metabolite levels, and maternal behavior in relation to pup survival. We tested whether hypergravity affects homeorhetic responses in the dam thereby affecting lipid metabolism and pup survival. We also examined the hypothesis that alterations to the dam's circadian system induced by changes in gravitational force may limit homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals and treatment conditions All animal procedures were approved by the NASA Ames Research Center IACUC. Sixty-four time-bred female Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus; Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA), weighing between 190–280g, were used. Animals were assigned to one of five stages (n = 16 per group) corresponding to different time-points across the periparturient period. These were: G20, G21, P0 (birth), P1 (onset of lactation) and P3 (lactation day 3). During the period G2–G6, the dams were individually housed in maternity cages (47cm ×26cm ×21cm) lined with corncob bedding and maintained under standard colony conditions (12∶12 light/dark cycle [0600∶1800]; 21±1°C at 30–50% humidity). On G7, the dams were housed in custom designed metabolic cages allowing for the clean separation of urine and feces for collection and analysis. Standard rat chow (Purina #5012, pellets in maternity cages and powdered in metabolic cages) and water were available ad libitum. On G9, dams were assigned to the either hypergravity (HG) (n = 8) or control (n = 8) conditions with body weights matched across groups. Hypergravity (HG) dams were placed on the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) 24 ft centrifuge and exposed to continuous 2-g (20.1 rpm). The centrifuge was stopped daily (approximately 1h duration) for animal maintenance, veterinary inspection and data collection. Control dams were housed in the metabolic cages in the same room as the experimental dams. Both groups were therefore exposed to identical environmental conditions (light, sound, temperature, and humidity). On G21, the day prior to birth, dams were transferred from metabolic cages to standard maternity cages. Real time videography onboard the rotating centrifuge was used to identify the precise time of birth for each dam. For the P0 group, the centrifuge was briefly (<15 min) stopped three times per day at eight hr intervals to retrieve dams that were undergoing labor contractions or birth. For the P1 group, animals were retrieved within 18 to 36 h following birth. In polytocous species, milk yield and body weight gain per pup are inversely related to litter size (Kumaresan et al., 1967). Therefore, on P1, HG and control litters were yoked and their sizes adjusted so that numbers and genders of pups comprising each litter were matched across conditions. Litter size was further adjusted daily by noting the numbers of dead or missing neonates in HG litters, and then removing the equivalent number of offspring from the corresponding control litter. Gender composition of the matched HG litter was preserved in litter adjustments. Animals were euthanized at the same time of day in both groups to account for circadian variations. Dam body mass, organ mass and body composition Dams in each condition were weighed daily throughout the study. Dam body composition was analyzed using TOBEC® (Total Body Electrical Conductivity) instrumentation (EM-SCAN Inc., Springfield, IL, USA) just prior to euthanasia. Briefly, the TOBEC® instrument measures energy absorption in the presence of a radio-frequency electromagnetic field, calibrated to match the response of a conductivity sensing element. Energy absorption is increased in conductive materials (i.e., hydrated, lean tissue) as compared to highly resistive materials (i.e., fur, body fat) (Harrison and Van Itallie, 1982; Bracco et al., 1983; Presta et al., 1983). Following euthanasia of the dams, selected organ weights were measured. Offspring body mass, crown-rump length (CRL) and placental mass Fetuses in the G20 and G21 age groups were surgically delivered from anesthetized dams. Neonatal rats in the P0, P1 and P3 conditions underwent vaginal delivery on G22 or 23. Pup survival was determined by counting the total number of pups at the time of birth and again during subsequent centrifuge stops. Body mass and crown-rump length (CRL) were measured at each perinatal age. Placental mass was measured on G20 and G21. Maternal behavior analysis Housing enclosures were configured for high-resolution video recording, including red illumination to permit recording during the dark phase of the circadian cycle. Beginning on G22, HG-exposed and control dams were continuously videotaped using a 24h timelapse (12∶1 record:playback ratio) system. During playback of the videotapes, detailed analyses of overall activity, self-grooming, eating and drinking, tail chasing, digging and nest building, licking pups, retrieving pups and ingesting carcasses of moribund and/or dead pups using a time locked computer analysis system according to Ronca et al. (Ronca et al., 2001). Blood collection and analysis Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture from the anesthetized dams, and plasma was prepared and immediately frozen for later analysis. In order to establish basal hormonal levels, dams were removed from their pups 2h prior to anesthesia. Commercially available radioimmunoassay and ELISA kits were used for measurement of plasma concentrations of PRL, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH; both from Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA), triiodothryronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA, USA), and corticosterone (Cort, Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX, USA). INS and leptin (LEP) levels were determined using kits from Linco Research (Irvine, CA, USA). Blood glucose, cholesterol, total protein and triglyceride levels were measured using the Dade Behring Dimension® XpandT Clinical Chemistry System (Dade Behring, Newark DE, USA). Dam tissue collection and metabolic assays At each experimental time-point, mammary gland #4, liver and abdominal adipose tissues were collected from anesthetized dams. Mammary and liver tissues were kept on ice in tris sucrose and adipose tissue was kept at 37°C in a saline solution until processing. Tissues were sliced into 0.5 mm sections with a hand-held Stadie Riggs microtome. Sliced sections weighing 100–180 mg were used immediately to measure glucose metabolism in vitro. Remaining tissue was immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for later isolation of total RNA. To determine metabolic rate, tissues were placed in stoppered flasks containing Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 10mM glucose, 1μg/ml INS and 1μCi/flask of uniformly labeled [14C]-glucose to measure the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids (Bauman et al., 1970; Plaut et al., 2003). Adipose, liver and mammary tissues were incubated for 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively. During lactation (P1 and P3), adipose tissue lipolysis was measured. Therefore, glycerol release, rather than glucose incorporation into lipids, was measured. Adipose slices were placed in Krebs-Ringer Buffer in the absence of INS and incubated for 2 h. Media and tissue were collected and frozen. Glycerol released into media was measured using an enzymatic assay (R-Biopharm, Inc., Cat. No.: E 0148 270) with modifications described by McNamara and Hillers (McNamara and Hillers, 1986). The method used to measure metabolic rate has been previously described and validated to confirm that values represent actual mammary tissue metabolism (Bauman et al., 1970; Bauman et al., 1973; Plaut et al., 1999b; Plaut et al., 2003). Preliminary studies were also performed to validate metabolic rate measures in liver and adipose tissue. Optimal buffer choice, tris-sucrose or saline, and the temperature at which to hold the tissues (4°C, 37°C) prior to the assay were also determined. Optimal incubation time for these two tissues was determined by comparing metabolic rates following 1, 2, 3 or 4h of incubation. As shown by Etherton and Allen (Etherton and Allen, 1980), it was necessary to keep adipose tissue warm (37°C) in a saline solution prior to assay to prevent tissue hardening and death. Adipose tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 2h of incubation. Activity reached a plateau and then began to decline after 2–3h. Therefore, optimal measures of adipose tissue metabolism were obtained after 2 h of incubation. Optimal buffer and holding temperature for liver prior to assay were determined to be tris-sucrose buffer on ice. Liver tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 4–5h of incubation, thus liver tissue was incubated for 4h to measure metabolism. In addition, numerous studies utilizing metabolic assays to study toxicology and drug metabolism have determined that liver slices incubated for at least 4h and up to 20h remain viable during this time (Smith et al., 1985; Dogterom, 1993; Ekins, 1996; de Graaf et al., 2000; Maas et al., 2000; de Graaf et al., 2002). Isolation of total RNA and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR) Total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissue collected from G20 and P1 HG-treated and control dams and used to analyze gene expression of lipid metabolic enzymes and hormone receptors using RTq-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from frozen mammary, liver and adipose tissue using Trizol® Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples were DNase treated using the DNA-freeTM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Total RNA was extracted from frozen visceral adipose tissue and DNase treated using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) following manufacturer's suggested protocol. Quantity and quality of the RNA was assessed with the Nanodrop® ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and on the Nanochip using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA), respectively. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the GeneAmp® kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). RT-qPCR analysis was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) and a unique TaqMan® Assays-on-DemandTM Gene Expression kit (Applied Biosystems) specific for rat: ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) (Rn00566411_m1), acetyl co-A carboxylase (Acaca) (Rn00573474_m1), fatty acid synthetase (Fasn) (Rn00589037_m1), lipoprotein lyase (Lpl; Rn00561482_m1), glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1; Rn00561369_m1), prolactin receptor (Prlr; Rn00561795_m1), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl; Rn00577590_m1), RAR-related orphan receptor A (Rora; Rn01173769_m1), Neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 2 (Npas2; Rn01438223_m1), basic helix-loop-helix family, member e40 (Bhlhe40; Rn00584155_m1), Casein kinase I isoform epsilon (Csnk1e; Rn00581130_m1), nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Nr1d1; Rn00595671_m1), and beta-2microglobulin (B2m; Rn00560865_m1) and beta-actin (Actb; Rn00667869_m1), which were used as the reference genes. Relative gene expression (RQ) was calculated according to the following equations: ΔCT (individual animal) = CT (target gene) − CT (reference gene); ΔΔCT (individual animal) = ΔCT (individual animal) − ΔCT (mean G20 stationary control); relative expression (RQ) = 2−ΔΔCT. Statistical analysis Throughout the experiments, parametric data were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects with the minimal level of significance set at p<0.05. Original means and standard error of mean (SEM) were used for presentation of results and discussion.",
    "results": "Results Effects of gravity load on dam body mass, organ mass, and body composition Body mass was 21%, 19%, 10%, 17% and 13% lower in G20, G21, P0, P1 and P3 HG dams versus control dams, respectively (supplementary material Table S1). Mammary glands were significantly (p<0.05) smaller in HG (1.80±0.12g) versus control (2.19±0.11g) dams on G20; however, the change in size was proportional to the change in overall body mass (0.6% for both treatments). Increased gravity-load did not significantly affect liver mass of pregnant dams. Body composition differed across conditions with HG dams having significantly less body fat than control dams (percent total body fat on P1: control, 27.1±1.2, HG, 18.7±2.2; on P3: control, 19.3±1.9, HG, 13.4±1.5; p<0.05). Effects of gravity load on mortality, body mass and body composition of fetal and neonatal rats There were no differences between HG and control in the numbers of fetuses on either G20 or G22 or in proportions of live births on P0. Gestational length was comparable for HG and control dams, as evidenced by day of parturition (G22/23). There were no differences in the overall amount of time spent in labor and parturition. The increased gravitational load did not affect litter size (No. pups per litter: HG 12±3; control 12±3) or male: female ratio (control % male: female, 47±3: 53±3; HG % male: female, 48±3: 52.±3). However, there was a significant (p<0.05) difference in pup survival across treatment conditions (HG: P0, 95%, P1, 57%, P3, 48%; Control: 100% at all ages). During late pregnancy, G20 and G22 fetuses exposed to 2-g hypergravity weighed 27% less than fetuses from control dams (p<0.05) (Table 1). Furthermore, placental weights were reduced, but were proportional to the body mass of the fetus. During early lactation, although HG pups increased body mass, they weighed approximately 20% and 30% less than control pups on P1 and P3, respectively (p<0.05) (Table 1). Though not different in fetuses, crown rump length was shorter in HG animals after birth (Table 1). Table 1. The effect of hypergravity exposure on fetal and neonatal body mass, crown rump length (CRL) and placental mass. Open in a new tab Effects of gravity load on maternal behavior In the first four days after initial exposure to hypergravity (G12–15), control and HG dams exhibited similar levels of overall activity during the light phase of the circadian cycle, but HG dams showed significantly reduced activity as compared to control dams during the dark phase (p<0.05) (Fig. 1). During the 48 h just prior to parturition (G20–21), control dams reduced their overall activity during the dark phase of the cycle but HG dams maintained higher activity levels (p<0.05). An analysis of specific behavioral activities revealed that compared to control dams, HG dams spent more time eating/drinking and more time digging/nest-building but less time self-grooming and rearing offspring. Fig. 1. Dam activity during light (L) and dark (D) phases of 12h:12h LD cycles in control and hypergravity environments during mid and late gestation. Open in a new tab Values are mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05.Following birth (P1), HG dams were less active and spent less time self-grooming and eating/drinking than controls (Table 2). Self-grooming, but not other general activities, remained low on P3. On P1 maternal behavior differed between HG and control dams. HG dams spent more time building nests and nursing, but time spent licking and time spent retrieving pups were not significantly altered (Table 2). Table 2. The effect of hypergravity exposure on duration (min)a and percentage of overall activity, species-typical behavior and pup-oriented maternal care in hypergravity (HG) and control dams on the first (P1) and third (P3) days of lactation. Open in a new tab Effects of gravity load on hormone and blood chemistry concentrations of pregnant or lactating dams On PO, plasma PRL levels were 5 times greater in HG dams than in control dams (p<0.05) (Fig. 2A). There were no differences in plasma PRL concentrations between the treatments on any other day. Although plasma levels of corticosteroids did not vary by day of pregnancy or lactation in either treatment group, the plasma Cort levels were reduced by approximately 50% in HG versus control dams at all periparturient stages (p<0.05) (Fig. 2B). INS was higher at G21 then decreased for the remainder of the study in both control and HG dams. INS concentrations differed between the treatments only on P3 (p<0.05) (Fig. 2C). On P3 concentrations of TSH, T4 and T3 were not altered in HG compared to control treated dams (data not shown). LEP levels on P3 were significantly reduced (p<0.05) in HG (13.5±4.2ng/ml) compared to control (48.7±13.1ng/ml) dams. Plasma cholesterol was increased on G21 in HG but subsequently values were reduced on P0 and P1 (Table 3). Plasma triglyceride levels were significantly altered in HG dams on G20 and P3; however, glucose and total protein concentrations were not altered by HG (Table 3). Fig. 2.

Open in a new tab Effects of gravity load on mammary metabolic activity during the periparturient period Hypergravity exposure had an overall effect of reducing the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 in mammary tissue across all days measured in the peripartuirent period (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3A). The difference in glucose oxidation in mammary tissue was most pronounced on P1, when mammary tissue from control animals oxidized 2.7 times more glucose to CO2 in 1h than mammary tissue from HG dams (Fig. 3A). Glucose incorporation into lipids was also affected by increased g-load. During lactation P1 dams exhibited a six-fold reduction in the rate of lipid synthesis from glucose (Fig. 3B). Metabolic activity was decreased from 996±147nmoles of glucose/h in control dams to 150±147nmoles of glucose/h in HG dams (p<0.0001). After 3 days of lactation this difference was still evident, as 1.7 times more nmoles of glucose/h were incorporated into lipids in mammary tissue from control versus HG dams (p<0.03) (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3. Rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 or incorporation into lipids in mammary, liver and adipose tissues from dams exposed to HG (black bars) or a control (open bars) environment during the periparturient period. Open in a new tab Tissue slices were incubated in Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) buffer in the presence of 1μCi/flask U-14C-glucose as a tracer. Glucose oxidation to CO2 was measured and expressed as nmoles of glucose utilized per 100mg tissue/hr. Rate of glucose incorporation into lipids was measured and expressed as nmoles glucose incorporated into lipids/100mg tissue/hr. Values are expressed as mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05.

(F) Glucose incorporation to lipids in adipose tissue; expressed as 1 hr per 1 million adipocytes. Effects of gravity load on liver metabolic activity during the periparturient period Increased gravity-load significantly reduced the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 in liver tissue from periparturient dams (p<0.005) (Fig. 3C). The difference was most pronounced in rats on P3. Control animals oxidized 40% more glucose to CO2 than HG treated dams (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3C). Although there were significant differences in the rates of glucose incorporation into lipids between treatments (p<0.005), the rates were very low in liver tissue from all groups examined, regardless of physiological state or gravitational force. There was a significant interaction in liver lipid synthesis between pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy, lipid synthesis from glucose was higher in HG dams than control. On G21, liver tissue from HG dams incorporated approximately 2.7 fold more glucose into lipids than liver tissue from control dams (p<0.05) (Fig. 3D). During lactation, the relationship reversed, with liver tissue from control dams having a greater rate of glucose incorporation into lipids than HG treated dams. Control dams incorporated approximately 4-fold more glucose into lipids than liver tissue from HG dams at both P1 and P3 (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3D). Since glucose is not a major substrate for lipid synthesis in liver tissue, and low levels of liver lipid synthesis from glucose has been previously reported (Clark et al., 1974), we verified findings using acetate as a substrate and observed much higher rates of lipid synthesis, but found exactly the same pattern of response (data not shown). Effects of gravity load on adipose tissue metabolic activity during the periparturient period Glucose oxidation to CO2 in adipose tissue was reduced in dams exposed to 2-g. At all time-points, except during labor and delivery, glucose incorporation into lipids was reduced by at least 70% in HG dams, regardless of whether data were expressed as per mg of tissue or per million adipocytes (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3E). On P1, adipose tissue from control dams incorporated 2.5 times more glucose into lipids than HG treated dams (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3F). Lypolysis, measured as glycerol release, was significantly reduced in HG dams when compared to control dams. On P1, the amount of glycerol released due to lypolysis was 80% more in adipose tissue from control dams than from HG dams (p<0.05) (data not shown). On P3, the rate of glycerol released during 1h was 60% greater in tissue from control dams versus HG treated dams (p<0.05) (data not shown). Effects of gravity load on gene expression of hormone receptors and enzymes that regulate lipid metabolism Gene expression of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and hormone receptors for glucocorticoids and PRL were measured in total RNA isolated from mammary, liver, and adipose tissue collected on G20 and P1 from HG and control treated dams. Importantly, there was no difference in levels of housekeeping genes between the treatments. There was a significant day, treatment, and day by treatment interaction in mammary tissue. In general lipid metabolic enzymes increased from pregnancy to lactation and were reduced in HG treated dams relative to controls. Mammary specific gene expression of Acaca, Acly, and Lpl increased significantly from G20 to P1 with a 5.6 fold, 3.2 fold and 4.7 fold increase, respectively, (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4) in control dams. Expression of the Prlr also increased significantly from late pregnancy to day 1 lactation, by 5.6 fold (p<0.001) (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4) in control dams. Gene expression of Acaca, Acly, Lpl and the hormone receptors were significantly reduced in mammary tissue from HG dams relative to control dams on G20 and P1. Expression of Acaca was 4.5 times greater in mammary tissue from control versus HG dams on G20 and this difference increased to 11 times greater in control versus HG dams on P1. The increased difference between gene expression from pregnancy to lactation between mammary tissue from control and HG dams was due to the relatively small changes in gene expression that occurred in mammary tissue from HG dams. Thus a significant interaction between stage and g-load treatment resulted for the metabolic enzymes and the Prlr because the magnitude of increase in gene expression from pregnancy to lactation was minimal in HG animals (supplementary material Table S2). In fact the expression of Lpl was reduced by 45% from G20 to P1 in HG rats. Expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) in mammary tissue from HG dams was reduced compared to control; however, its expression was not different with physiological state (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Effect of gravity and stage on relative expression levels of lipid metabolic and hormone receptor genes. Open in a new tab Total RNA was isolated from (A) mammary, (B) liver, and (C) adipose of late pregnant (G20) and early lactation (P1) control and HG treated dams. Expression of Acaca, Acyl, Lpl, GR and Prlr were measured using rt-q-PCR. Actb and B2m were used as reference genes and relative gene expression (RQ) was calculated using the delta-delta CT method with mean G20 control delta CT as normalizer. Values are expressed as mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05.In liver tissue from control dams, gene expression of Acaca, Acly, the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) and Prlr decreased between late pregnancy and lactation by approximately 50%, 25%, 33% and 75%, respectively (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). There was no change in Fasn or Lpl gene expression between late pregnancy and the first day of lactation in liver tissue from control dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Acaca, Acly, and glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) expression were significantly reduced by hypergravity exposure (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). There was a significant treatment by stage interaction in all genes except Acaca (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). On the first day of lactation the expression Acly was 53% lower and Fasn was 69% lower in liver tissue from hypergravity treated dams versus the controls, while expression of Lpl, glucocorticoid receptor and Prlr did not change due to hypergravity. Similar to control dams, liver tissue from HG dams also exhibited a decrease in, Acaca, Acly, and Prlr gene expression from G20 to P1; however, the differences were greater between these days for HG dams, with a 60%, 67%, and 82% decrease in expression, respectively, relative to control dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Fasn gene expression decreased 78% and Lpl gene expression decreased 50% from pregnancy to lactation in HG dams versus no change in gene expression in liver tissue from control dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). There were no significant changes from G20 to P1 in the gene expression of the lipid metabolic enzymes or the hormone receptors measured in adipose tissue from control or HG dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Furthermore there was no difference in expression of metabolic genes or hormone receptors due to hypergravity exposure (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Effects of gravity load on molecular clock gene expression in mammary and liver Expression of the positive limb core molecular clock genes (Arntl, Npas2) and genes that regulate (Rora, Nr1d1, Csnk1e, Bhlhe40) molecular clocks were measured in mammary and liver from control and HG dams to determine if changes in gravity impacted circadian clocks (Fig. 5). Expression of the core clock genes Arntl and Npas2 in mammary were significantly greater (p<0.05) (Fig. 5A) on P1 compared to G20 at the same time-point (approximately 6 h after lights on) in control dams. There was no significant difference in expression of Arntl and Npas2 between G20 and P1 in HG dams, and expression of these genes were significantly less on P1 in HG versus control dams. Expression of Rora, a gene that stimulates expression of Arntl, was significantly higher on P1 compared to G20 in both treatments; however, in mammary of HG dams Rora was approximately 46% less than the control level. Mammary expression of Bhlh40e, Cnskle, and Nr1d1, were significantly decreased (p<0.05) on P1 compared to G20 in both control and HG dams, and expression of Bhlh40e was significantly less in HG compared to control dams on G20.

    "discussion": "Discussion Our data suggest that hypergravity exposure causes a shift in maternal metabolism from reproductive to maternal survival at the expense of pup survival. These results have made us keenly aware of the vital role of environmental adaptation in long-term species survival. Hypergravity exposure decreases pup survival and alters dam behavior Exposure of pregnant rat dams starting in mid-pregnancy to hypergravity resulted in decreased fetal-pup body mass, reductions in total body fat, and a reduction in survival. The presence of a similar number of fetuses and live births at the normal delivery time between treatments suggest that prenatal development continues to proceed in HG. However, 24 hours after birth survival was significantly reduced. Reduced pup survival was likely due to changes in maternal-pup interactions or changes in maternal physiology, as when pups were removed from the hypergravity environment at birth and cross fostered to non-manipulated dams, mortality did not occur (Baer et al., 2000). Thus the present study focused on the behavioral and physiological status of the dams during the periparturient period. During the first 24 hours after birth, approximately 50% of the pups survived at 2-g. Pup mortality coincided with altered maternal behavior in HG animals, which was marked by less time digging/nesting behavior and self-care (eating, drinking and grooming). These observations are consistent with previous reports of periparturient rats exposed to 1.5-g (Ronca et al., 2001), and may reflect a reduction in types of behaviors that require effort against the gravity vector. HG dams also spent significantly more time nursing, which is consistent with our previous observation that primiparous dams exposed to hypergravity spend more overall time nursing with increased interruption of nursing bouts due to digging/nest-building behavior (Baer et al., 2005). Pups of HG dams showed evidence of milk in the stomach (visualized through the pups' translucent skin), although limited analysis of milk bands revealed that they weighed less than the controls. Maternal care of pups in the hypergravity environment was intact as measured by licking, retrieving and nursing pups. It is not clear whether increased nursing may have contributed to pup mortality, for example by smothering pups during extended nursing bouts. Increased nursing time and smaller milk bands may reflect complications with lactation or inefficient milk transfer. Focus was therefore directed at alterations in dam metabolism specifically geared toward lactation. Dams exposed to 2-g had significantly reduced body mass, 17% less than controls, and the reduction in body mass persisted throughout the study. Dam body mass decreased during the first 3 days of hypergravity exposure due to reduced daily food and water intake. After 3 days the animals acclimated to the hypergravity, food intake increased and weight gain rate became similar to controls (for details, see Lintault et al., 2007). Although the litters from HG dams were 20% smaller, it only accounted for 8g (7g for pups and 1g due to placental mass) of the total the difference in average dam mass (59g) between the treatments (supplementary material Table S1). Therefore the majority of difference in dam body mass was not due to the smaller litters, rather it was due to loss of maternal tissue, as was evident in mammary glands, which were significantly smaller in HG dams on G20 and accounted for approximately 4g of tissue loss. Hypergravity exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the mean size of adipocytes (data not shown), and overall reduction in total body fat of dams (for details, see Lintault et al., 2007). The reduction in dam body fat is likely due to increased energy demands in the hypergravity environment, and may cause a conflict between meeting maternal and pup energy needs. Exposure to HG during pregnancy and lactation overrides normal metabolic response to the reproductive cycle As anticipated, mammary metabolic rate increased from pregnancy to lactation in both HG and control dams. However, hypergravity exposure decreased lipid synthesis by approximately 70% and glucose oxidation by approximately 25% at all stages, which is consistent with our previous findings (Plaut et al., 1999a; Plaut et al., 2003). The reduction in mammary metabolism may play a significant role in neonatal mortality. Analysis of expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolic rate: ATP-citrate lyase (Acly), acetyl co-A carboxylase (Acaca), fatty acid synthetase (Fasn) and lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) revealed a dramatic increase from late pregnancy to the first day of lactation in mammary gland of control dams. However, the change in gene expression between late pregnancy and the first day of lactation was greatly diminished in mammary tissue from HG treated dams relative to control dams. These data suggest that the decrease in mammary lipid metabolic rate and suppression of genes involved in lipid metabolism resulted in impaired milk production in HG dams. Mammary composition was not evaluated in our study, but it may have affected mammary metabolic output. For example milk production is believed to be a function of the number and secretory activity of epithelial cells (Knight and Peaker, 1982), so if there was less parenchymal tissue in HG dams, it would be expected that they have a decreased ability to produce milk. Secondly, the first fat for milk synthesis is likely mobilized from what is remaining of the mammary fat pad during the early postpartum period (Rudolph et al., 2007), and thus a lower mammary fat content may limit the energy content of milk. To determine whether the metabolic response was limited to mammary tissue or if it also occurred in tissues that worked in concert with mammary tissue during lactation, glucose metabolism was measured in adipose and liver tissue. Our data demonstrate that both g-load and gestation day influenced glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. Increased gravity-load decreased metabolic rate in adipose tissue, including rate of lipolysis during lactation. Adipose tissue is a major source of metabolic fuel stored as triglycerides (Frühbeck et al., 2001), and at the onset of lactation, fat depots are mobilized through an increased rate of lipolysis, which accommodates the high energy demands of milk synthesis in the mammary gland (Williamson, 1986). Lower rates of adipose tissue metabolism in the hypergravity environment may be indicative of limited supplies of triglycerides for milk fat synthesis. During lactation glucose oxidation to CO2 in liver tissue of HG dams was less than in control dams. The rate of glucose incorporation into lipid increased almost 4-fold from late pregnancy to the onset of lactation in control dams, demonstrating the increase in hepatic capacity at the onset of lactation to supply fatty acids to the mammary gland for milk synthesis (Williamson, 1980; Williamson, 1986). This increase did not occur in HG dams, which had suppressed rates of glucose incorporation into lipids compared to controls during lactation. At the molecular level expression of the lipid metabolic genes Acaca, Acly and Fasn were lower in liver tissue from HG versus control dams on the first day of lactation. Together, metabolic data revealed that exposure to increased gravity load caused a decrease in the capacity to oxidize glucose or incorporate glucose into lipid in all three tissues during lactation. This shift in tissue metabolic capacity is likely indicative of an extra energy investment in the hypergravity environment that overrides the normal maternal homeorhetic adaptation to lactation. Alteration of lactogenic hormone levels during exposure to hypergravity are not likely primary cause of hypergravity induced changes in maternal behavior and tissue metabolism The regulation of metabolism in the lactating rats, in particular milk production, is dependent on PRL, cortisol, INS, and thyroid hormones (Williamson, 1986). In the present study there were no significant alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations. In an earlier study, we reported TSH to be elevated only at one time-point post-delivery (P15) with no other differences noted over time in TSH, T3 or T4 (Sajdel-Sulkowska et al., 2001). Therefore, it appears that thyroid status does not contribute to alterations in maternal metabolism or behavior leading to reduced pup survival. Surprisingly, PRL concentrations were significantly higher at P0 in HG dams but not different from controls at any other time-point, although the data were extremely variable. The higher plasma PRL levels may reflect the lower expression of Prlr in HG dams (Fig. 4) since low receptor levels may trigger PRL secretion (Holcomb et al., 1976; Durand and Djiane, 1977) or may be an effort by the body to increase receptor levels, as PRL is known to auto-induce its own receptor at delivery (McNeilly and Friesen, 1977). In contrast to our study, others reported reduced PRL levels in pregnant and lactating dams exposed to hypergravity (Megory and Oyama, 1984; Megory and Oyama, 1985; Baer et al., 2002). Discrepancy in results among studies may be due to variations in sampling times in relation to parturition, suckling or circadian rhythms. Thus it is unclear if the observed treatment differences in PRL concentrations contribute to the differences in maternal behavior, pup mortality, or metabolic rate between control and HG dams. Although, it is important to note that our previous study showed daily PRL administration could not reverse impact of hypergravity on tissue metabolic rate (Patel et al., 2008). Plasma Cort levels were significantly reduced in HG compared to control dams at all time-points. Decreased levels of plasma Cort in HG dams coincide with changes in rates of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in mammary, liver and adipose tissue. However, it is not likely that lower Cort levels caused these changes, as when HG treated pregnant rat dams were supplemented with Cort, we found no effect on rates of glucose oxidation or lipogenesis in any of the three tissues (Patel et al., 2008), thus indicating that the lower levels of Cort alone do not cause the observed alterations in rates of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis. INS levels were significantly less in lactating HG treated animals compared to controls. Lower INS concentrations accompanied no change in plasma glucose concentrations, suggesting an increase in INS sensitivity in hypergravity, as the glucose to INS ratio was greater. LEP levels were also significantly less in lactating HG treated dams, which corresponded with the significantly lower circulating levels of cholesterol and triglyceride as well as reduced body fat in these dams on P3. Serum levels of LEP reflect the amount of energy stored in adipose tissue as well as short-term energy imbalance. Hormonal factors also regulate LEP levels. LEP functions to communicate the status of energy reserves with the central nervous system for the purpose of regulating metabolic stores (Rosenbaum et al., 2001). Thus the lower levels of LEP are consistent with the other changes observed in HG including reduced body fat stores, and decreased INS and Cort concentrations. Changes in circadian clocks relative to changes in metabolism, endocrine milieu and behavior Our previous studies and findings in this study suggest regulatory mechanisms outside of the endocrine system are causing the alterations to the normal maternal homeorhetic response to lactation in the hypergravity environment. Homeorhetic adaptations are time dependent changes in metabolism to establish a new physiological state, such as pregnancy or lactation. Likewise the ability of animals to adapt to changes in their environment including photoperiod, heat, stress, gravity and nutrition also require time-dependent integrative homeorhetic regulation (D.E. Bauman, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, personal communication). Recently, we put forth the hypothesis that during the periparturient period, the circadian system mediates homeorhetic adaptations to lactation (Casey et al., 2009). We envision that during this period the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei integrates environmental and physiological cues that it receives. In turn, the central clock responds to these cues and coordinates behavioral and physiological changes across the dams by sending humoral and neural signals to multiple tissues, which stimulate changes in core molecular clocks of peripheral tissues including endocrine glands, mammary, and liver. Changes to the core clocks in turn effectively change the proteome and metabolome of the dam to support lactation. In addition, it is probable that the dam's capacity to produce milk and cope with metabolic stress during lactation is related to her ability to set circadian rhythms. Chronic exposure to hypergravity has pronounced effects on circadian and homeostatic regulation of body temperature, activity, heart rate, and feeding (Fuller et al., 2000; Murakami and Fuller, 2000; Robinson and Fuller, 2000; Warren et al., 2000). Exposure of adult male mice to 2g hypergravity caused an immediate 4-day loss in circadian rhythm in both core body temperature and activity. Acclimation to hypergravity resulted in recovery of circadian rhythms with new, but lower, basal levels of temperature and activity (Murakami and Fuller, 2000). Similar to findings in adult male mice, our analysis of circadian behavioral data revealed hypergravity exposed pregnant females spent the first 5 days acclimating to the environment and were in a state of hypoactivity during the dark, but not the light phase of the cycle. However, in late pregnancy, day 20 and 21, HG dams became hyperactive relative control dams, suggesting that impact of gravity load on circadian behavior was dependent on physiological state of dams. Offspring of homozygous female Clock mutant mice, which have a genetic mutation that disrupts circadian rhythms, fail to thrive. Clock mutant dams are deficient nest builders and exhibited disrupted nursing. Pup mortality is increased and growth rates slowed in litters of Clock mutant dams compared to wild-type dams, suggesting that milk production of the Clock mutant is not adequate enough to nourish offspring (Dolatshad et al., 2006). Our findings derived from HG dams reveal some major parallels with Clock mutant dams. First, there was a dampening of circadian cyclicity in overall activity beginning 24 h after HG exposure. Second, HG dams had lower nursing bout durations coupled with greater numbers of nursing bouts, and an aberrant pattern of digging/nest-building activity. Third, offspring body weights lagged in the HG condition and pup mortality was significantly increased. Finally post-weaning obesity has been reported in Clock offspring (Turek et al., 2005), and we previously reported significantly elevated body weights in post-weaning rats reared during HG exposure (Baer et al., 2005). Collectively, these findings provide initial support for the hypothesis that disruptions in the circadian timing system underlie the reported gravity-related changes in maternal behavior and offspring development. Examination of differences in expression of core clock genes and genes that regulate molecular clocks in mammary and liver, suggest that hypergravity exposure impacted molecular clocks that generate circadian rhythms. Since data were only available for one time-point on each day, it is not known how circadian rhythms were affected by hypergravity, and thus observed differences between treatments may be indicative of changes in rhythm amplitude, phase or period. Differences in endocrine milieu in hypergravity treated dams may also be indicative of changes in the circadian system. Exposure to microgravity causes shifts in circadian rhythms and increases basal levels of cortisol in humans and rodents (Grigoriev et al., 1987; Dijk et al., 2001; Macho et al., 2001b; Macho et al., 2001a). Preflight circadian adaptation countermeasures revealed that altered lighting schedules during spaceflight caused phase shifts in plasma hormone rhythms; however, changes in basal cortisol levels were a result of alterations in gravity load (Czeisler et al., 1991; Whitson et al., 1995). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that changes in basal cortisol due to changes in gravitational force are analogous, but distinct, from the circadian system mediated seasonal changes in hormone levels that are governed by changes in photoperiod length (Lincoln and Richardson, 1998; Dardente, 2007; Ebling and Barrett, 2008; Nakao et al., 2008), and may quite possibly be mediated through a hypothalmic-vestibular connection (Fuller et al., 2002; Murakami et al., 2002). Conclusion Endogenous clocks enable organisms to anticipate periodic changes in the environment and to adapt their physiology accordingly. The transition from pregnancy to lactation represents a major physiological change requiring coordinated adjustments in physiology and metabolism to support milk production. Previous studies from our lab revealed that changes in molecular clocks are coordinated among multiple tissues during the transition from pregnancy to lactation, and suggest that the circadian system may be important in coordinating the metabolic and hormonal changes needed to initiate and sustain lactation. Homeorhetic adaptations to lactation can be affected by physiological and environmental factors. Photoperiod is an example of an environmental factor that affects energy balance, reproduction and lactation (Dahl et al., 2000; Lincoln et al., 2006; Duncan, 2007; Dardente et al., 2010; Silveyra et al., 2010). Photoperiodic information is received and integrated across the circadian system, which effectively coordinates the animal's physiology and metabolome to photoperiod length, including seasonal changes in milk quality and quantity. Similarly, we propose that hypergravity induced alterations in homeorhetic adaptations to lactation including changes in dam metabolic capacity and behavior are due to the impact of increased gravity load on circadian clocks. Changes in circadian clocks affect output of multiple organs resulting in reduced quality and quantity of milk and therefore decreased pup survival in the hypergravity environment.",

Copyright notice ID: 3509447 PMID: 23213450 Summary Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation (hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and reproductive systems. Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day [P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however, HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and insulin levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were altered by HG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core clock genes in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. Gravity load alterations in dam's circadian system may have impacted homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation. Keywords: Circadian, Hypergravity, Homeorhesis, Lactation, Mammary, PregnancyIntroduction At varying phases of the life cycle, there are differential nutrient requirements. During pregnancy and lactation, an immense demand for nutrients sustains these challenging physiological states in the mother and fosters growth and development of the fetus and neonate. To support fetal and neonatal growth, major changes in the partitioning of available nutrients occur in maternal tissues, including coordinated shifts in mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism that do not jeopardize maternal homeostasis or fetal and neonatal health (Bauman and Currie, 1980). Homeorhetic adaptations are the “coordinated changes in metabolism of body tissues necessary to support a (dominant) developmental or physiological process” (Bauman and Currie, 1980; Bell and Bauman, 1997). Whereas homeostasis is widely understood to describe compensatory mechanisms that preserve the relative constancy of functions despite external challenges, homeorhesis refers to regulatory processes that support developmental or physiological processes of highest priority (Bauman et al., 1982). Homeorhetic controls regulate nutrient partitioning during pregnancy, thereby assuring growth of the conceptus as well as development of the mammary gland. With the onset of lactation, many maternal tissues undergo further adaptations to support milk synthesis. During gestation, the endocrine system coordinates the mother's metabolic activities with the physiological requirements of the fetuses and subsequent nutritional demands of the suckling offspring. Mammary gland development and differentiation during pregnancy is the direct result of a network of changes in hormone levels, substrate availability and behavioral adaptations that collectively result in optimal milk production during lactation. During pregnancy, estrogen, progesterone, placental lactogen and the anterior pituitary hormone, prolactin (PRL), stimulate mammary growth and differentiation. At parturition, changes in these hormones act to stimulate the onset of lactation (Tucker, 1987; Freeman et al., 2000; Neville et al., 2001; Kelly et al., 2002). Periparturient changes in maternal metabolism include: 1) increased hepatic gluconeogenesis from endogenous substrates, 2) decreased peripheral tissue glucose utilization, 3) increased fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue, and 4) increased amino acid mobilization from muscle (Chaves and Herrera, 1978; Martin-Hidalgo et al., 1994; Bell, 1995). Thus to insure adequate milk production and simultaneously maintain maternal homeostasis, the lactating dam utilizes homeorhetic processes to shift her metabolism. The dam's normal homeorhetic response to the increased nutrient and energy demands of milk synthesis were mediated in part by global changes in gene transcription in mammary, liver and adipose including changes in clock genes that regulate circadian rhythms (Casey et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2011). Changes in molecular clocks during the transition from pregnancy to lactation in relation to other transcriptional profiles of mammary, liver and adipose tissues suggested that homeorhetic adaptation to lactation may be by coordinated in part by the circadian system. Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes and can be entrained by external cues (Hastings et al., 2007). Although light is the primary environmental cue that entrains circadian clocks, gravity significantly affects circadian patterns of behavior, hormones, body temperature, and metabolism (Czeisler et al., 1991; Whitson et al., 1995; Fuller et al., 2000; Murakami and Fuller, 2000; Robinson and Fuller, 2000; Dijk et al., 2001; Fuller et al., 2002; Holley et al., 2003). Gravity is an environmental stimulus that exerts major influences on animal physiology and behavior (Sonnenfeld, 2005). Similar to other environmental stimuli, such as temperature and light, animals have adapted to the Earth's gravitational force. In mammals, sudden deviations from Earth's 1-g environment are associated with significant physiological changes, including altered reproductive capability (Tou et al., 2002). Studies investigating the effects of gravity and circadian rhythms on reproducing and developing mammals can provide unique biomedical perspectives on these life processes on Earth (Ronca, 2007). We previously identified gravity as an environmental variable that produces major graded changes in mammary metabolic activity and reduces pup survival (Ronca et al., 2001; Plaut et al., 2003). We and others showed that survival rates of pups born to rat dams exposed to 1.5- to 2-times Earth's gravity during the latter half of pregnancy were reduced by 5 to 40% (Megory and Oyama, 1984; Baer et al., 2000; Ronca et al., 2001). However, if neonatal pups were removed from the hypergravity environment and cross fostered to non-manipulated dams, mortality did not occur (Baer et al., 2000). These data suggest that the dam's normal homeorhetic response to the onset of lactation was altered in hypergravity, thereby decreasing her ability to nurture pups. Although HG dams had reduced body fat and mass, these factors did not account for altered rates of lipid metabolism in mammary, liver and adipose tissues or decreased neonatal survival (Lintault et al., 2007). Further, neither prolactin nor glucocorticoid supplementation reversed the HG induced reduction in metabolic rates, suggesting that factors other than circulating lactogenic hormone levels and dam body composition were negatively impacting the dams' homeorhetic response to pregnancy and lactation (Patel et al., 2008). Collectively, these findings indicate a disruption of homeorhetic mechanisms that normally allow the dam to maintain homeostasis while simultaneously providing for growing fetuses and neonates. In the present study, we measured the effect of exposure to 2-g from mid-gestation (gestational day [G]11 of the rat's 22-day pregnancy) throughout early lactation (until Postnatal day [P]3) on metabolic activity of mammary, liver and adipose tissue as well as circulating hormone and metabolite levels, and maternal behavior in relation to pup survival. We tested whether hypergravity affects homeorhetic responses in the dam thereby affecting lipid metabolism and pup survival. We also examined the hypothesis that alterations to the dam's circadian system induced by changes in gravitational force may limit homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation.Results Effects of gravity load on dam body mass, organ mass, and body composition Body mass was 21%, 19%, 10%, 17% and 13% lower in G20, G21, P0, P1 and P3 HG dams versus control dams, respectively (supplementary material Table S1). Mammary glands were significantly (p<0.05) smaller in HG (1.80±0.12g) versus control (2.19±0.11g) dams on G20; however, the change in size was proportional to the change in overall body mass (0.6% for both treatments). Increased gravity-load did not significantly affect liver mass of pregnant dams. Body composition differed across conditions with HG dams having significantly less body fat than control dams (percent total body fat on P1: control, 27.1±1.2, HG, 18.7±2.2; on P3: control, 19.3±1.9, HG, 13.4±1.5; p<0.05).Effects of gravity load on mortality, body mass and body composition of fetal and neonatal rats There were no differences between HG and control in the numbers of fetuses on either G20 or G22 or in proportions of live births on P0. Gestational length was comparable for HG and control dams, as evidenced by day of parturition (G22/23). There were no differences in the overall amount of time spent in labor and parturition. The increased gravitational load did not affect litter size (No. pups per litter: HG 12±3; control 12±3) or male: female ratio (control % male: female, 47±3: 53±3; HG % male: female, 48±3: 52.±3). However, there was a significant (p<0.05) difference in pup survival across treatment conditions (HG: P0, 95%, P1, 57%, P3, 48%; Control: 100% at all ages). During late pregnancy, G20 and G22 fetuses exposed to 2-g hypergravity weighed 27% less than fetuses from control dams (p<0.05) (Table 1). Furthermore, placental weights were reduced, but were proportional to the body mass of the fetus. During early lactation, although HG pups increased body mass, they weighed approximately 20% and 30% less than control pups on P1 and P3, respectively (p<0.05) (Table 1). Though not different in fetuses, crown rump length was shorter in HG animals after birth (Table 1). Table 1. The effect of hypergravity exposure on fetal and neonatal body mass, crown rump length (CRL) and placental mass. Open in a new tabEffects of gravity load on maternal behavior In the first four days after initial exposure to hypergravity (G12–15), control and HG dams exhibited similar levels of overall activity during the light phase of the circadian cycle, but HG dams showed significantly reduced activity as compared to control dams during the dark phase (p<0.05) (Fig. 1). During the 48 h just prior to parturition (G20–21), control dams reduced their overall activity during the dark phase of the cycle but HG dams maintained higher activity levels (p<0.05). An analysis of specific behavioral activities revealed that compared to control dams, HG dams spent more time eating/drinking and more time digging/nest-building but less time self-grooming and rearing offspring.

Self-grooming, but not other general activities, remained low on P3. On P1 maternal behavior differed between HG and control dams. HG dams spent more time building nests and nursing, but time spent licking and time spent retrieving pups were not significantly altered (Table 2). Table 2.

Although plasma levels of corticosteroids did not vary by day of pregnancy or lactation in either treatment group, the plasma Cort levels were reduced by approximately 50% in HG versus control dams at all periparturient stages (p<0.05) (Fig. 2B). INS was higher at G21 then decreased for the remainder of the study in both control and HG dams. INS concentrations differed between the treatments only on P3 (p<0.05) (Fig. 2C). On P3 concentrations of TSH, T4 and T3 were not altered in HG compared to control treated dams (data not shown). LEP levels on P3 were significantly reduced (p<0.05) in HG (13.5±4.2ng/ml) compared to control (48.7±13.1ng/ml) dams. Plasma cholesterol was increased on G21 in HG but subsequently values were reduced on P0 and P1 (Table 3). Plasma triglyceride levels were significantly altered in HG dams on G20 and P3; however, glucose and total protein concentrations were not altered by HG (Table 3). Fig. 2.

Open in a new tabEffects of gravity load on mammary metabolic activity during the periparturient period Hypergravity exposure had an overall effect of reducing the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 in mammary tissue across all days measured in the peripartuirent period (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3A). The difference in glucose oxidation in mammary tissue was most pronounced on P1, when mammary tissue from control animals oxidized 2.7 times more glucose to CO2 in 1h than mammary tissue from HG dams (Fig. 3A). Glucose incorporation into lipids was also affected by increased g-load. During lactation P1 dams exhibited a six-fold reduction in the rate of lipid synthesis from glucose (Fig. 3B). Metabolic activity was decreased from 996±147nmoles of glucose/h in control dams to 150±147nmoles of glucose/h in HG dams (p<0.0001). After 3 days of lactation this difference was still evident, as 1.7 times more nmoles of glucose/h were incorporated into lipids in mammary tissue from control versus HG dams (p<0.03) (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3.

Open in a new tab Tissue slices were incubated in Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) buffer in the presence of 1μCi/flask U-14C-glucose as a tracer.

Rate of glucose incorporation into lipids was measured and expressed as nmoles glucose incorporated into lipids/100mg tissue/hr. Values are expressed as mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05.

(F) Glucose incorporation to lipids in adipose tissue; expressed as 1 hr per 1 million adipocytes.Effects of gravity load on liver metabolic activity during the periparturient period Increased gravity-load significantly reduced the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 in liver tissue from periparturient dams (p<0.005) (Fig. 3C). The difference was most pronounced in rats on P3. Control animals oxidized 40% more glucose to CO2 than HG treated dams (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3C). Although there were significant differences in the rates of glucose incorporation into lipids between treatments (p<0.005), the rates were very low in liver tissue from all groups examined, regardless of physiological state or gravitational force. There was a significant interaction in liver lipid synthesis between pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy, lipid synthesis from glucose was higher in HG dams than control. On G21, liver tissue from HG dams incorporated approximately 2.7 fold more glucose into lipids than liver tissue from control dams (p<0.05) (Fig. 3D). During lactation, the relationship reversed, with liver tissue from control dams having a greater rate of glucose incorporation into lipids than HG treated dams. Control dams incorporated approximately 4-fold more glucose into lipids than liver tissue from HG dams at both P1 and P3 (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3D). Since glucose is not a major substrate for lipid synthesis in liver tissue, and low levels of liver lipid synthesis from glucose has been previously reported (Clark et al., 1974), we verified findings using acetate as a substrate and observed much higher rates of lipid synthesis, but found exactly the same pattern of response (data not shown).Effects of gravity load on adipose tissue metabolic activity during the periparturient period Glucose oxidation to CO2 in adipose tissue was reduced in dams exposed to 2-g. At all time-points, except during labor and delivery, glucose incorporation into lipids was reduced by at least 70% in HG dams, regardless of whether data were expressed as per mg of tissue or per million adipocytes (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3E). On P1, adipose tissue from control dams incorporated 2.5 times more glucose into lipids than HG treated dams (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3F). Lypolysis, measured as glycerol release, was significantly reduced in HG dams when compared to control dams. On P1, the amount of glycerol released due to lypolysis was 80% more in adipose tissue from control dams than from HG dams (p<0.05) (data not shown). On P3, the rate of glycerol released during 1h was 60% greater in tissue from control dams versus HG treated dams (p<0.05) (data not shown).Effects of gravity load on gene expression of hormone receptors and enzymes that regulate lipid metabolism Gene expression of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and hormone receptors for glucocorticoids and PRL were measured in total RNA isolated from mammary, liver, and adipose tissue collected on G20 and P1 from HG and control treated dams. Importantly, there was no difference in levels of housekeeping genes between the treatments. There was a significant day, treatment, and day by treatment interaction in mammary tissue. In general lipid metabolic enzymes increased from pregnancy to lactation and were reduced in HG treated dams relative to controls. Mammary specific gene expression of Acaca, Acly, and Lpl increased significantly from G20 to P1 with a 5.6 fold, 3.2 fold and 4.7 fold increase, respectively, (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4) in control dams. Expression of the Prlr also increased significantly from late pregnancy to day 1 lactation, by 5.6 fold (p<0.001) (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4) in control dams. Gene expression of Acaca, Acly, Lpl and the hormone receptors were significantly reduced in mammary tissue from HG dams relative to control dams on G20 and P1. Expression of Acaca was 4.5 times greater in mammary tissue from control versus HG dams on G20 and this difference increased to 11 times greater in control versus HG dams on P1. The increased difference between gene expression from pregnancy to lactation between mammary tissue from control and HG dams was due to the relatively small changes in gene expression that occurred in mammary tissue from HG dams. Thus a significant interaction between stage and g-load treatment resulted for the metabolic enzymes and the Prlr because the magnitude of increase in gene expression from pregnancy to lactation was minimal in HG animals (supplementary material Table S2). In fact the expression of Lpl was reduced by 45% from G20 to P1 in HG rats. Expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) in mammary tissue from HG dams was reduced compared to control; however, its expression was not different with physiological state (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Effect of gravity and stage on relative expression levels of lipid metabolic and hormone receptor genes. Open in a new tab Total RNA was isolated from (A) mammary, (B) liver, and (C) adipose of late pregnant (G20) and early lactation (P1) control and HG treated dams. Expression of Acaca, Acyl, Lpl, GR and Prlr were measured using rt-q-PCR. Actb and B2m were used as reference genes and relative gene expression (RQ) was calculated using the delta-delta CT method with mean G20 control delta CT as normalizer. Values are expressed as mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05.In liver tissue from control dams, gene expression of Acaca, Acly, the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) and Prlr decreased between late pregnancy and lactation by approximately 50%, 25%, 33% and 75%, respectively (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). There was no change in Fasn or Lpl gene expression between late pregnancy and the first day of lactation in liver tissue from control dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Acaca, Acly, and glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) expression were significantly reduced by hypergravity exposure (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). There was a significant treatment by stage interaction in all genes except Acaca (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). On the first day of lactation the expression Acly was 53% lower and Fasn was 69% lower in liver tissue from hypergravity treated dams versus the controls, while expression of Lpl, glucocorticoid receptor and Prlr did not change due to hypergravity. Similar to control dams, liver tissue from HG dams also exhibited a decrease in, Acaca, Acly, and Prlr gene expression from G20 to P1; however, the differences were greater between these days for HG dams, with a 60%, 67%, and 82% decrease in expression, respectively, relative to control dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Fasn gene expression decreased 78% and Lpl gene expression decreased 50% from pregnancy to lactation in HG dams versus no change in gene expression in liver tissue from control dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). There were no significant changes from G20 to P1 in the gene expression of the lipid metabolic enzymes or the hormone receptors measured in adipose tissue from control or HG dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Furthermore there was no difference in expression of metabolic genes or hormone receptors due to hypergravity exposure (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4).Effects of gravity load on molecular clock gene expression in mammary and liver Expression of the positive limb core molecular clock genes (Arntl, Npas2) and genes that regulate (Rora, Nr1d1, Csnk1e, Bhlhe40) molecular clocks were measured in mammary and liver from control and HG dams to determine if changes in gravity impacted circadian clocks (Fig. 5). Expression of the core clock genes Arntl and Npas2 in mammary were significantly greater (p<0.05) (Fig. 5A) on P1 compared to G20 at the same time-point (approximately 6 h after lights on) in control dams. There was no significant difference in expression of Arntl and Npas2 between G20 and P1 in HG dams, and expression of these genes were significantly less on P1 in HG versus control dams. Expression of Rora, a gene that stimulates expression of Arntl, was significantly higher on P1 compared to G20 in both treatments; however, in mammary of HG dams Rora was approximately 46% less than the control level. Mammary expression of Bhlh40e, Cnskle, and Nr1d1, were significantly decreased (p<0.05) on P1 compared to G20 in both control and HG dams, and expression of Bhlh40e was significantly less in HG compared to control dams on G20. Fig. 5. Effect of gravity and stage on relative expression levels of molecular core clock and clock regulatory genes. Open in a new tab Total RNA was isolated from (A) mammary and (B) liver of late pregnant (G20) and early lactation (P1) control and HG treated dams. Expression of Arntl, Npas2, Rora, Bhlh40e, Csnk1e, and Nr1d1 were measured using rt-q-PCR. Actb and B2m were used as reference genes in mammary and liver, respectively, and relative gene expression (RQ) was calculated using the delta-delta CT method with mean G20 control delta CT as normalizer. Values are expressed as mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05.Expression of Arntl and Npas2 were significantly (p<0.05) (Fig. 5B) increased from G20 to P1 in the liver of control (approximately 10-fold and 16-fold, respectively) and HG (2-fold and 4.4-fold, respectively) dams. On G20, expression of Arntl was 18-fold and Npas2 was almost 6-fold higher in HG versus control dams (p<0.05). Expression of Arntl and Npas2 were also significantly greater on P1 in HG versus control dams (p<0.05; 2.3-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively). There was no significant difference in Rora expression in liver from late pregnant versus early lactation dams in both treatments, but on P1 expression of Rora was 50% higher in HG dams (p<0.05). There were no differences in expression of Csnk1e between late pregnancy and lactation within treatments or between treatments on G20 or P1. There was a significantly lower level of Nr1d1 liver expression on P1 compared to G20 in control animals, but the difference between Nr1d1 expression on G20 and P1 was not different in liver of HG animals. On both days expression of Nr1d1was significantly less in HG dams compared to control dams.Discussion Our data suggest that hypergravity exposure causes a shift in maternal metabolism from reproductive to maternal survival at the expense of pup survival. These results have made us keenly aware of the vital role of environmental adaptation in long-term species survival. Hypergravity exposure decreases pup survival and alters dam behavior Exposure of pregnant rat dams starting in mid-pregnancy to hypergravity resulted in decreased fetal-pup body mass, reductions in total body fat, and a reduction in survival. The presence of a similar number of fetuses and live births at the normal delivery time between treatments suggest that prenatal development continues to proceed in HG. However, 24 hours after birth survival was significantly reduced. Reduced pup survival was likely due to changes in maternal-pup interactions or changes in maternal physiology, as when pups were removed from the hypergravity environment at birth and cross fostered to non-manipulated dams, mortality did not occur (Baer et al., 2000). Thus the present study focused on the behavioral and physiological status of the dams during the periparturient period. During the first 24 hours after birth, approximately 50% of the pups survived at 2-g. Pup mortality coincided with altered maternal behavior in HG animals, which was marked by less time digging/nesting behavior and self-care (eating, drinking and grooming). These observations are consistent with previous reports of periparturient rats exposed to 1.5-g (Ronca et al., 2001), and may reflect a reduction in types of behaviors that require effort against the gravity vector. HG dams also spent significantly more time nursing, which is consistent with our previous observation that primiparous dams exposed to hypergravity spend more overall time nursing with increased interruption of nursing bouts due to digging/nest-building behavior (Baer et al., 2005). Pups of HG dams showed evidence of milk in the stomach (visualized through the pups' translucent skin), although limited analysis of milk bands revealed that they weighed less than the controls. Maternal care of pups in the hypergravity environment was intact as measured by licking, retrieving and nursing pups. It is not clear whether increased nursing may have contributed to pup mortality, for example by smothering pups during extended nursing bouts. Increased nursing time and smaller milk bands may reflect complications with lactation or inefficient milk transfer. Focus was therefore directed at alterations in dam metabolism specifically geared toward lactation. Dams exposed to 2-g had significantly reduced body mass, 17% less than controls, and the reduction in body mass persisted throughout the study. Dam body mass decreased during the first 3 days of hypergravity exposure due to reduced daily food and water intake. After 3 days the animals acclimated to the hypergravity, food intake increased and weight gain rate became similar to controls (for details, see Lintault et al., 2007). Although the litters from HG dams were 20% smaller, it only accounted for 8g (7g for pups and 1g due to placental mass) of the total the difference in average dam mass (59g) between the treatments (supplementary material Table S1). Therefore the majority of difference in dam body mass was not due to the smaller litters, rather it was due to loss of maternal tissue, as was evident in mammary glands, which were significantly smaller in HG dams on G20 and accounted for approximately 4g of tissue loss. Hypergravity exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the mean size of adipocytes (data not shown), and overall reduction in total body fat of dams (for details, see Lintault et al., 2007). The reduction in dam body fat is likely due to increased energy demands in the hypergravity environment, and may cause a conflict between meeting maternal and pup energy needs.Exposure to HG during pregnancy and lactation overrides normal metabolic response to the reproductive cycle As anticipated, mammary metabolic rate increased from pregnancy to lactation in both HG and control dams. However, hypergravity exposure decreased lipid synthesis by approximately 70% and glucose oxidation by approximately 25% at all stages, which is consistent with our previous findings (Plaut et al., 1999a; Plaut et al., 2003). The reduction in mammary metabolism may play a significant role in neonatal mortality. Analysis of expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolic rate: ATP-citrate lyase (Acly), acetyl co-A carboxylase (Acaca), fatty acid synthetase (Fasn) and lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) revealed a dramatic increase from late pregnancy to the first day of lactation in mammary gland of control dams. However, the change in gene expression between late pregnancy and the first day of lactation was greatly diminished in mammary tissue from HG treated dams relative to control dams. These data suggest that the decrease in mammary lipid metabolic rate and suppression of genes involved in lipid metabolism resulted in impaired milk production in HG dams. Mammary composition was not evaluated in our study, but it may have affected mammary metabolic output. For example milk production is believed to be a function of the number and secretory activity of epithelial cells (Knight and Peaker, 1982), so if there was less parenchymal tissue in HG dams, it would be expected that they have a decreased ability to produce milk. Secondly, the first fat for milk synthesis is likely mobilized from what is remaining of the mammary fat pad during the early postpartum period (Rudolph et al., 2007), and thus a lower mammary fat content may limit the energy content of milk. To determine whether the metabolic response was limited to mammary tissue or if it also occurred in tissues that worked in concert with mammary tissue during lactation, glucose metabolism was measured in adipose and liver tissue. Our data demonstrate that both g-load and gestation day influenced glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. Increased gravity-load decreased metabolic rate in adipose tissue, including rate of lipolysis during lactation. Adipose tissue is a major source of metabolic fuel stored as triglycerides (Frühbeck et al., 2001), and at the onset of lactation, fat depots are mobilized through an increased rate of lipolysis, which accommodates the high energy demands of milk synthesis in the mammary gland (Williamson, 1986). Lower rates of adipose tissue metabolism in the hypergravity environment may be indicative of limited supplies of triglycerides for milk fat synthesis. During lactation glucose oxidation to CO2 in liver tissue of HG dams was less than in control dams. The rate of glucose incorporation into lipid increased almost 4-fold from late pregnancy to the onset of lactation in control dams, demonstrating the increase in hepatic capacity at the onset of lactation to supply fatty acids to the mammary gland for milk synthesis (Williamson, 1980; Williamson, 1986). This increase did not occur in HG dams, which had suppressed rates of glucose incorporation into lipids compared to controls during lactation. At the molecular level expression of the lipid metabolic genes Acaca, Acly and Fasn were lower in liver tissue from HG versus control dams on the first day of lactation. Together, metabolic data revealed that exposure to increased gravity load caused a decrease in the capacity to oxidize glucose or incorporate glucose into lipid in all three tissues during lactation. This shift in tissue metabolic capacity is likely indicative of an extra energy investment in the hypergravity environment that overrides the normal maternal homeorhetic adaptation to lactation.Alteration of lactogenic hormone levels during exposure to hypergravity are not likely primary cause of hypergravity induced changes in maternal behavior and tissue metabolism The regulation of metabolism in the lactating rats, in particular milk production, is dependent on PRL, cortisol, INS, and thyroid hormones (Williamson, 1986). In the present study there were no significant alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations. In an earlier study, we reported TSH to be elevated only at one time-point post-delivery (P15) with no other differences noted over time in TSH, T3 or T4 (Sajdel-Sulkowska et al., 2001). Therefore, it appears that thyroid status does not contribute to alterations in maternal metabolism or behavior leading to reduced pup survival. Surprisingly, PRL concentrations were significantly higher at P0 in HG dams but not different from controls at any other time-point, although the data were extremely variable. The higher plasma PRL levels may reflect the lower expression of Prlr in HG dams (Fig. 4) since low receptor levels may trigger PRL secretion (Holcomb et al., 1976; Durand and Djiane, 1977) or may be an effort by the body to increase receptor levels, as PRL is known to auto-induce its own receptor at delivery (McNeilly and Friesen, 1977). In contrast to our study, others reported reduced PRL levels in pregnant and lactating dams exposed to hypergravity (Megory and Oyama, 1984; Megory and Oyama, 1985; Baer et al., 2002). Discrepancy in results among studies may be due to variations in sampling times in relation to parturition, suckling or circadian rhythms. Thus it is unclear if the observed treatment differences in PRL concentrations contribute to the differences in maternal behavior, pup mortality, or metabolic rate between control and HG dams. Although, it is important to note that our previous study showed daily PRL administration could not reverse impact of hypergravity on tissue metabolic rate (Patel et al., 2008). Plasma Cort levels were significantly reduced in HG compared to control dams at all time-points. Decreased levels of plasma Cort in HG dams coincide with changes in rates of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in mammary, liver and adipose tissue. However, it is not likely that lower Cort levels caused these changes, as when HG treated pregnant rat dams were supplemented with Cort, we found no effect on rates of glucose oxidation or lipogenesis in any of the three tissues (Patel et al., 2008), thus indicating that the lower levels of Cort alone do not cause the observed alterations in rates of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis. INS levels were significantly less in lactating HG treated animals compared to controls. Lower INS concentrations accompanied no change in plasma glucose concentrations, suggesting an increase in INS sensitivity in hypergravity, as the glucose to INS ratio was greater. LEP levels were also significantly less in lactating HG treated dams, which corresponded with the significantly lower circulating levels of cholesterol and triglyceride as well as reduced body fat in these dams on P3. Serum levels of LEP reflect the amount of energy stored in adipose tissue as well as short-term energy imbalance. Hormonal factors also regulate LEP levels. LEP functions to communicate the status of energy reserves with the central nervous system for the purpose of regulating metabolic stores (Rosenbaum et al., 2001). Thus the lower levels of LEP are consistent with the other changes observed in HG including reduced body fat stores, and decreased INS and Cort concentrations.Changes in circadian clocks relative to changes in metabolism, endocrine milieu and behavior Our previous studies and findings in this study suggest regulatory mechanisms outside of the endocrine system are causing the alterations to the normal maternal homeorhetic response to lactation in the hypergravity environment. Homeorhetic adaptations are time dependent changes in metabolism to establish a new physiological state, such as pregnancy or lactation. Likewise the ability of animals to adapt to changes in their environment including photoperiod, heat, stress, gravity and nutrition also require time-dependent integrative homeorhetic regulation (D.E. Bauman, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, personal communication). Recently, we put forth the hypothesis that during the periparturient period, the circadian system mediates homeorhetic adaptations to lactation (Casey et al., 2009). We envision that during this period the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei integrates environmental and physiological cues that it receives. In turn, the central clock responds to these cues and coordinates behavioral and physiological changes across the dams by sending humoral and neural signals to multiple tissues, which stimulate changes in core molecular clocks of peripheral tissues including endocrine glands, mammary, and liver. Changes to the core clocks in turn effectively change the proteome and metabolome of the dam to support lactation. In addition, it is probable that the dam's capacity to produce milk and cope with metabolic stress during lactation is related to her ability to set circadian rhythms. Chronic exposure to hypergravity has pronounced effects on circadian and homeostatic regulation of body temperature, activity, heart rate, and feeding (Fuller et al., 2000; Murakami and Fuller, 2000; Robinson and Fuller, 2000; Warren et al., 2000). Exposure of adult male mice to 2g hypergravity caused an immediate 4-day loss in circadian rhythm in both core body temperature and activity. Acclimation to hypergravity resulted in recovery of circadian rhythms with new, but lower, basal levels of temperature and activity (Murakami and Fuller, 2000). Similar to findings in adult male mice, our analysis of circadian behavioral data revealed hypergravity exposed pregnant females spent the first 5 days acclimating to the environment and were in a state of hypoactivity during the dark, but not the light phase of the cycle. However, in late pregnancy, day 20 and 21, HG dams became hyperactive relative control dams, suggesting that impact of gravity load on circadian behavior was dependent on physiological state of dams. Offspring of homozygous female Clock mutant mice, which have a genetic mutation that disrupts circadian rhythms, fail to thrive. Clock mutant dams are deficient nest builders and exhibited disrupted nursing. Pup mortality is increased and growth rates slowed in litters of Clock mutant dams compared to wild-type dams, suggesting that milk production of the Clock mutant is not adequate enough to nourish offspring (Dolatshad et al., 2006). Our findings derived from HG dams reveal some major parallels with Clock mutant dams. First, there was a dampening of circadian cyclicity in overall activity beginning 24 h after HG exposure. Second, HG dams had lower nursing bout durations coupled with greater numbers of nursing bouts, and an aberrant pattern of digging/nest-building activity. Third, offspring body weights lagged in the HG condition and pup mortality was significantly increased. Finally post-weaning obesity has been reported in Clock offspring (Turek et al., 2005), and we previously reported significantly elevated body weights in post-weaning rats reared during HG exposure (Baer et al., 2005). Collectively, these findings provide initial support for the hypothesis that disruptions in the circadian timing system underlie the reported gravity-related changes in maternal behavior and offspring development. Examination of differences in expression of core clock genes and genes that regulate molecular clocks in mammary and liver, suggest that hypergravity exposure impacted molecular clocks that generate circadian rhythms. Since data were only available for one time-point on each day, it is not known how circadian rhythms were affected by hypergravity, and thus observed differences between treatments may be indicative of changes in rhythm amplitude, phase or period. Differences in endocrine milieu in hypergravity treated dams may also be indicative of changes in the circadian system. Exposure to microgravity causes shifts in circadian rhythms and increases basal levels of cortisol in humans and rodents (Grigoriev et al., 1987; Dijk et al., 2001; Macho et al., 2001b; Macho et al., 2001a). Preflight circadian adaptation countermeasures revealed that altered lighting schedules during spaceflight caused phase shifts in plasma hormone rhythms; however, changes in basal cortisol levels were a result of alterations in gravity load (Czeisler et al., 1991; Whitson et al., 1995). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that changes in basal cortisol due to changes in gravitational force are analogous, but distinct, from the circadian system mediated seasonal changes in hormone levels that are governed by changes in photoperiod length (Lincoln and Richardson, 1998; Dardente, 2007; Ebling and Barrett, 2008; Nakao et al., 2008), and may quite possibly be mediated through a hypothalmic-vestibular connection (Fuller et al., 2002; Murakami et al., 2002).Conclusion Endogenous clocks enable organisms to anticipate periodic changes in the environment and to adapt their physiology accordingly. The transition from pregnancy to lactation represents a major physiological change requiring coordinated adjustments in physiology and metabolism to support milk production. Previous studies from our lab revealed that changes in molecular clocks are coordinated among multiple tissues during the transition from pregnancy to lactation, and suggest that the circadian system may be important in coordinating the metabolic and hormonal changes needed to initiate and sustain lactation. Homeorhetic adaptations to lactation can be affected by physiological and environmental factors. Photoperiod is an example of an environmental factor that affects energy balance, reproduction and lactation (Dahl et al., 2000; Lincoln et al., 2006; Duncan, 2007; Dardente et al., 2010; Silveyra et al., 2010). Photoperiodic information is received and integrated across the circadian system, which effectively coordinates the animal's physiology and metabolome to photoperiod length, including seasonal changes in milk quality and quantity. Similarly, we propose that hypergravity induced alterations in homeorhetic adaptations to lactation including changes in dam metabolic capacity and behavior are due to the impact of increased gravity load on circadian clocks. Changes in circadian clocks affect output of multiple organs resulting in reduced quality and quantity of milk and therefore decreased pup survival in the hypergravity environment.Materials and Methods Animals and treatment conditions All animal procedures were approved by the NASA Ames Research Center IACUC. Sixty-four time-bred female Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus; Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA), weighing between 190–280g, were used. Animals were assigned to one of five stages (n = 16 per group) corresponding to different time-points across the periparturient period. These were: G20, G21, P0 (birth), P1 (onset of lactation) and P3 (lactation day 3). During the period G2–G6, the dams were individually housed in maternity cages (47cm ×26cm ×21cm) lined with corncob bedding and maintained under standard colony conditions (12∶12 light/dark cycle [0600∶1800]; 21±1°C at 30–50% humidity). On G7, the dams were housed in custom designed metabolic cages allowing for the clean separation of urine and feces for collection and analysis. Standard rat chow (Purina #5012, pellets in maternity cages and powdered in metabolic cages) and water were available ad libitum. On G9, dams were assigned to the either hypergravity (HG) (n = 8) or control (n = 8) conditions with body weights matched across groups. Hypergravity (HG) dams were placed on the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) 24 ft centrifuge and exposed to continuous 2-g (20.1 rpm). The centrifuge was stopped daily (approximately 1h duration) for animal maintenance, veterinary inspection and data collection. Control dams were housed in the metabolic cages in the same room as the experimental dams. Both groups were therefore exposed to identical environmental conditions (light, sound, temperature, and humidity). On G21, the day prior to birth, dams were transferred from metabolic cages to standard maternity cages. Real time videography onboard the rotating centrifuge was used to identify the precise time of birth for each dam. For the P0 group, the centrifuge was briefly (<15 min) stopped three times per day at eight hr intervals to retrieve dams that were undergoing labor contractions or birth. For the P1 group, animals were retrieved within 18 to 36 h following birth. In polytocous species, milk yield and body weight gain per pup are inversely related to litter size (Kumaresan et al., 1967). Therefore, on P1, HG and control litters were yoked and their sizes adjusted so that numbers and genders of pups comprising each litter were matched across conditions. Litter size was further adjusted daily by noting the numbers of dead or missing neonates in HG litters, and then removing the equivalent number of offspring from the corresponding control litter. Gender composition of the matched HG litter was preserved in litter adjustments. Animals were euthanized at the same time of day in both groups to account for circadian variations.Dam body mass, organ mass and body composition Dams in each condition were weighed daily throughout the study. Dam body composition was analyzed using TOBEC® (Total Body Electrical Conductivity) instrumentation (EM-SCAN Inc., Springfield, IL, USA) just prior to euthanasia. Briefly, the TOBEC® instrument measures energy absorption in the presence of a radio-frequency electromagnetic field, calibrated to match the response of a conductivity sensing element. Energy absorption is increased in conductive materials (i.e., hydrated, lean tissue) as compared to highly resistive materials (i.e., fur, body fat) (Harrison and Van Itallie, 1982; Bracco et al., 1983; Presta et al., 1983). Following euthanasia of the dams, selected organ weights were measured.Offspring body mass, crown-rump length (CRL) and placental mass Fetuses in the G20 and G21 age groups were surgically delivered from anesthetized dams. Neonatal rats in the P0, P1 and P3 conditions underwent vaginal delivery on G22 or 23. Pup survival was determined by counting the total number of pups at the time of birth and again during subsequent centrifuge stops. Body mass and crown-rump length (CRL) were measured at each perinatal age. Placental mass was measured on G20 and G21.Maternal behavior analysis Housing enclosures were configured for high-resolution video recording, including red illumination to permit recording during the dark phase of the circadian cycle. Beginning on G22, HG-exposed and control dams were continuously videotaped using a 24h timelapse (12∶1 record:playback ratio) system. During playback of the videotapes, detailed analyses of overall activity, self-grooming, eating and drinking, tail chasing, digging and nest building, licking pups, retrieving pups and ingesting carcasses of moribund and/or dead pups using a time locked computer analysis system according to Ronca et al. (Ronca et al., 2001).Blood collection and analysis Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture from the anesthetized dams, and plasma was prepared and immediately frozen for later analysis. In order to establish basal hormonal levels, dams were removed from their pups 2h prior to anesthesia. Commercially available radioimmunoassay and ELISA kits were used for measurement of plasma concentrations of PRL, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH; both from Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA), triiodothryronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA, USA), and corticosterone (Cort, Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX, USA). INS and leptin (LEP) levels were determined using kits from Linco Research (Irvine, CA, USA). Blood glucose, cholesterol, total protein and triglyceride levels were measured using the Dade Behring Dimension® XpandT Clinical Chemistry System (Dade Behring, Newark DE, USA).Dam tissue collection and metabolic assays At each experimental time-point, mammary gland #4, liver and abdominal adipose tissues were collected from anesthetized dams. Mammary and liver tissues were kept on ice in tris sucrose and adipose tissue was kept at 37°C in a saline solution until processing. Tissues were sliced into 0.5 mm sections with a hand-held Stadie Riggs microtome. Sliced sections weighing 100–180 mg were used immediately to measure glucose metabolism in vitro. Remaining tissue was immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for later isolation of total RNA. To determine metabolic rate, tissues were placed in stoppered flasks containing Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 10mM glucose, 1μg/ml INS and 1μCi/flask of uniformly labeled [14C]-glucose to measure the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids (Bauman et al., 1970; Plaut et al., 2003). Adipose, liver and mammary tissues were incubated for 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively. During lactation (P1 and P3), adipose tissue lipolysis was measured. Therefore, glycerol release, rather than glucose incorporation into lipids, was measured. Adipose slices were placed in Krebs-Ringer Buffer in the absence of INS and incubated for 2 h. Media and tissue were collected and frozen. Glycerol released into media was measured using an enzymatic assay (R-Biopharm, Inc., Cat. No.: E 0148 270) with modifications described by McNamara and Hillers (McNamara and Hillers, 1986). The method used to measure metabolic rate has been previously described and validated to confirm that values represent actual mammary tissue metabolism (Bauman et al., 1970; Bauman et al., 1973; Plaut et al., 1999b; Plaut et al., 2003). Preliminary studies were also performed to validate metabolic rate measures in liver and adipose tissue. Optimal buffer choice, tris-sucrose or saline, and the temperature at which to hold the tissues (4°C, 37°C) prior to the assay were also determined. Optimal incubation time for these two tissues was determined by comparing metabolic rates following 1, 2, 3 or 4h of incubation. As shown by Etherton and Allen (Etherton and Allen, 1980), it was necessary to keep adipose tissue warm (37°C) in a saline solution prior to assay to prevent tissue hardening and death. Adipose tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 2h of incubation. Activity reached a plateau and then began to decline after 2–3h. Therefore, optimal measures of adipose tissue metabolism were obtained after 2 h of incubation. Optimal buffer and holding temperature for liver prior to assay were determined to be tris-sucrose buffer on ice. Liver tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 4–5h of incubation, thus liver tissue was incubated for 4h to measure metabolism. In addition, numerous studies utilizing metabolic assays to study toxicology and drug metabolism have determined that liver slices incubated for at least 4h and up to 20h remain viable during this time (Smith et al., 1985; Dogterom, 1993; Ekins, 1996; de Graaf et al., 2000; Maas et al., 2000; de Graaf et al., 2002).Isolation of total RNA and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR) Total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissue collected from G20 and P1 HG-treated and control dams and used to analyze gene expression of lipid metabolic enzymes and hormone receptors using RTq-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from frozen mammary, liver and adipose tissue using Trizol® Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples were DNase treated using the DNA-freeTM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Total RNA was extracted from frozen visceral adipose tissue and DNase treated using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) following manufacturer's suggested protocol. Quantity and quality of the RNA was assessed with the Nanodrop® ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and on the Nanochip using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA), respectively. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the GeneAmp® kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). RT-qPCR analysis was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) and a unique TaqMan® Assays-on-DemandTM Gene Expression kit (Applied Biosystems) specific for rat: ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) (Rn00566411_m1), acetyl co-A carboxylase (Acaca) (Rn00573474_m1), fatty acid synthetase (Fasn) (Rn00589037_m1), lipoprotein lyase (Lpl; Rn00561482_m1), glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1; Rn00561369_m1), prolactin receptor (Prlr; Rn00561795_m1), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl; Rn00577590_m1), RAR-related orphan receptor A (Rora; Rn01173769_m1), Neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 2 (Npas2; Rn01438223_m1), basic helix-loop-helix family, member e40 (Bhlhe40; Rn00584155_m1), Casein kinase I isoform epsilon (Csnk1e; Rn00581130_m1), nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Nr1d1; Rn00595671_m1), and beta-2microglobulin (B2m; Rn00560865_m1) and beta-actin (Actb; Rn00667869_m1), which were used as the reference genes. Relative gene expression (RQ) was calculated according to the following equations: ΔCT (individual animal) = CT (target gene) − CT (reference gene); ΔΔCT (individual animal) = ΔCT (individual animal) − ΔCT (mean G20 stationary control); relative expression (RQ) = 2−ΔΔCT.Statistical analysis Throughout the experiments, parametric data were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects with the minimal level of significance set at p<0.05. Original means and standard error of mean (SEM) were used for presentation of results and discussion.Supplementary Material Supplementary Material supp_1_6_570__index.html (1.6KB, html) Acknowledgments In terms of funding, this project was supported by NASA NCC2-1373, NASA EPSCoR NCC5-581, NASA Grant NNA04CK83, and  Grant HD50201.Footnotes Competing interests: The authors declare that there are no competing interests.References Baer L.
