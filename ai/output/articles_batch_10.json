The patented Techshot Cell Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA)1 were operated in different orientations to determine their impact on macrophage growth and differentiation. Bone marrow cell parameters were determined after cells were grown in FPAs incubated at 37°C in vertical or horizontal orientations, and macrophage cell recovery was significantly higher from FPAs that were incubated in the horizontal orientation compared to “vertical” FPAs. Similarly, when bone marrow cells were grown in the Techshot bioreactor, there were significant differences in the numbers of macrophages recovered after 7 days, depending on movement and orientation of the bioreactor. Macrophage recovery was highest when the patented bioreactor was rotated in the horizontal, x-axis plane (merry-go-round fashion) compared to static and vertically, y-axis plane rotated (Ferris wheel fashion) bioreactors. In addition, the expression of F4/80 and other differentiation markers varied depending on whether macrophages differentiated in FPAs or in bioreactors.

    "introduction": "Introduction Spaceflight and/or microgravity can alter the immune system at organismic levels [1, 2]as well as cellular levels [3–5]. In particular, the hematopoietic system that generates cells in the monocyte/macrophage lineage may be a target. In 1986, Taylor et al. [6]detected monocytopenia post flight in seven out of 11 astronauts that flew on the space shuttle. In addition, some astronauts exhibited changes in insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor expression on monocytes post flight [7]. Changes in colony forming units-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) and colony forming units-macrophage (CFU-M) were seen in rats, post flight on biosatellites [8, 9]and during the Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS)-2 space lab flight on space transportation system (STS)-58. [10]. However, comparison of CFU-M after two 7-day space shuttle flights found that there were inconsistencies in CFU-M in the bone marrow of rats post flight [11]. We also found different outcomes when we measured the development of CFU-M in vitro after three different shuttle missions (Figure 1). During STS-69, a 260 hr. mission, we found that significantly more CFU-M developed in cultures grown in space compared to ground controls. In contrast, during STS-73, a 382 hr space-flight mission, we found the opposite result with inhibited CFU-M generation in space-flight cultures compared to ground controls (Figure 1). There was no impact of space flight on CFU-M generation during the STS-77 shuttle mission, a 240 hr. mission. Figure 1. CFU-M development on STS-69, 73 and 77. Open in a new tab Soft agar colony assays to detect CFU-M (macrophage colony forming units) were conducted in FPAs as described [12]. Colony assays were set up for shuttle flight on STS-69 and 73 (and the associated ground controls) approximately 48 hours prior to turnover to the shuttle loading crew. The FPAs were equilibrated for 12 hours at 37° C and 8% CO2capped with rubber septa to trap equilibrated air, and shipped at ambient temperature to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for integration into Group Activation Packs (GAPs) [21]. To control for transportation of the FPAs to KSC, ground controls were conducted at KSC and in our laboratory at Kansas State University (KSU). Colony assays set up for shuttle flight and ground controls for STS-73 were set by harvesting bone marrow cells at KSU which were immediately shipped in RPMI10 (on ice) to KSC. Ammonium Chloride lysis of red blood cells and all subsequent assay procedures were performed in the laboratory facilities at KSC Space Life Science Support Facility (SLSL). These assays were set up approximately 20 hours prior to turnover to the shuttle loading crew. As a result of the assay setup being conducted at KSC there were no ground controls conducted at KSU. Space flight experiments are extraordinarily challenging. Not only do you have to modify experimental conditions and equipment for the space-flight environment, the ability to reproduce the exact flight conditions from flight-to-flight is next to impossible. Occasionally, one finds that equipment used for space flight is an advance on the technique used for normal ground experiments [12], but this is rare. Frequently, secondary payloads are at the mercy of the requirements of the primary payloads. Therefore, variables such as temperature, astronaut time for manipulations and time-lines are not optimal. The assay of macrophage hematopoietic precursors can be done two ways. To identify the number of precursors, bone marrow cells are isolated and cultured in soft agar containing growth factors such as macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at appropriate concentrations [13]. Assessment of how many colonies grow provides an estimate about the number of CFU-M or CFU-GM that are present in the stem cell population [14]. Alternatively, macrophages can be induced to differentiate in M-CSF and the cells that differentiate into macrophages in 6–8 days can be phenotyped based on their cell-surface molecules, assayed for functional assays, or used for other kinds of analyses [15]. Our group had an opportunity to determine if macrophage development was affected in vitro on the space shuttle flights STS-57, STS-60 and STS-62 [16]. Mouse bone marrow stem cells were incubated in liquid culture in medium containing M-CSF during the space flights. The differentiated macrophages were fixed during flight and phenotyped by flow cytometry and the supernatants were collected from viable cells and were assayed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) post flight. However, because these experiments were secondary payloads, the temperature conditions were not physiological and some questions about the results remained[16]. Therefore, we explored additional opportunities to attempt to resolve the issue about the impacts of space flight on macrophage development at the cellular level.",

Therefore, we explored additional opportunities to attempt to resolve the issue about the impacts of space flight on macrophage development at the cellular level.Preflight Verification Tests Although space flight offers the opportunity to do research in microgravity, there is also the challenge of adapting tissue culture methods for the space environment. For our experiments, two possible hardware configurations were tested. One was the Cell Cult Bioreactor from Techshot (Formerly Space Hardware Optimization Technology, Inc. Greenville, IN) [17–19]. The patented bioreactor vessel [19] holds approximately 50 ml of culture medium and is approximately 6 cm (diameter) × 2.7 cm (height) in size (Figure 2). The bioreactor in its final assembled configuration was computer controlled with flexible feeding and collection schedules and volumes. The bioreactor could be rotated at 1 revolution per minute (RPM) during flight to allow for adequate mixing of fresh culture medium or fixative. We also tested the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA)[16, 20–22]. These culture vessels are 1.35 cm diameter (1.31 mm thickness) glass barrels that are 11.70 cm long (Figure 3 A-C). Transfer of the medium from one chamber to another is accomplished through a bypass on one side of the tube (Figure 3A). These culture devices allow the incubation of cells in a volume of 3.0 ml which can be supplemented with one or two additional 1.5 ml medium supplements or one feeding and the addition of fixatives/preservatives. Detailed set up of the equipment for bone marrow cells has been described by our group previously [5, 16]. Figure 2. Bioreactor configuration. Open in a new tab The Techshot bioreactor vessel is a 6 cm (diameter) × 2.7 cm (height) culture vessel (Panel A) that is connected via rotary unions to medium feeding lines (Panel B, removed and viewed from below). The bioreactor is served by peristaltic pumps (Panel C) and computer controlled solenoid valves (Panel D) that control fresh medium or waste flow from or into Teflon bags (Panel E). The completed assembly (Panel F) can be inserted into a middeck-sized locker for use in space flight [17, 18].Figure 3. Fluid Processing Apparatus and Techshot bioreactor orientations. Open in a new tab FPA diagram (A) shows a loaded example in which 1×107 cells were placed in three ml of medium in chamber 1 (yellow) separated by two rubber septa. The FPA is engineered with a bypass so that when the second septum from the right crosses the bypass during motion from left to right the medium in the second chamber (red, 1.5 ml) will mix with the material in chamber 1 and the first two septa from the right will compress together. The next two septa also compress with additional movement to mix the contents of chamber 3 (green, 1.5 ml) with the contents previously mixed; showing vertical (B) or horizontal (C) orientation. The Techshot bioreactor was incubated in a vertical (Ferris wheel) or (E) horizontal (merry-go-round) configurations and rotated at 1 RPM.There were significant differences in the complexity and capabilities of the culture systems available to us which presented some questions about the data each system was capable of providing. This is not a new concept. Others have compared hardware in ground based experiments to determine strengths and weaknesses of systems like rapidly rotating clinostats and random positioning machines [23]. For shuttle-flight experiments, most comparisons are made to samples incubated on Earth, although some space-flight experiments have been developed with controls in 1xg centrifuges that were also in space [24–26]. Comparisons have also been made with animals subjected to space flight and antiorthostatic suspension on Earth [9]. However, for our in vitro experiments, the orientation of the culture devices became a concern to us, especially for our Earth controls. In particular, the bioreactor could be oriented in “Ferris wheel” (Figure 3D) or “merry-go-round”(Figure 3E) orientations. We compared cell recovery {% cell recovery = (# viable cells recovered/ # viable cells added to the culture vessel)x100}from bioreactors that were rotated (at 1 RPM) or kept stationary that were incubated in both horizontal and vertical orientations (Table 1). One-third or fewer viable cells were recovered from bioreactors that were not rotated compared to bioreactors that were rotated at 1 RPM. In addition, approximately 80% more viable cells were obtained from bioreactors incubated in the horizontal orientation compared to the vertical orientation (Table 1). When we differentiated macrophages in FPAs incubated in vertical (Figure 3B) or horizontal orientations (Figure 3C), we also found that there were differences in the numbers of cells recovered. We averaged 3.7±0.9×106 cells per FPA after 7 days in M-CSF (15 ng/ml) when FPAs were stored in the vertical position. In contrast, we averaged 1.2±0.3×107 cells per FPA when the FPAs were stored in a horizontal position when bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages in medium containing M-CSF. The cell input recovered was 120% vs. 37% for horizontal and vertical FPAs, respectively. In general, the surface area that cells had to spread on was greater in both the bioreactor and the FPAs when the culture units were in the horizontal compared to the vertical orientation. It suggests that cell recovery is improved with greater surface area, independent of fluid volume. FPA’s were generally more efficient in viable cell numbers recovered compared to the larger bioreactors. Table 1.

They were fed with 15 ml fresh medium on days 3 and 5. 3% Cell input Recovered=(# of viable cells recovered/# viable cells added to the culture vessel)×100 We examined the cell surface phenotype of macrophages that differentiated in FPAs or the bioreactor. Cells were incubated in 15 ng/ml of M-CSF for 7 days and assessed for the expression of several cell surface molecules commonly found on macrophages. Both the FPAs and bioreactors were oriented in the horizontal positions and the bioreactors were rotated at 1 RPM. The bioreactors were fed with 15 ml of medium (with M-CSF) on days 3 and 5. The FPAs were stationary except when they were fed with 1.5 ml of medium (with M-CSF) on days 3 and 5 of the 7 day culture period. Cells were stained with fluorochrome-labelled antibodies specific for macrophage surface proteins c-fms [27–29], Mac-2 [30, 31], F4/80 [32, 33] and Ly6G [34–36]. Freshly harvested bone marrow cells are generally smaller with several subpopulations of cells, reflecting the large number of neutrophils in mouse bone marrow [37] and other populations of cells including undiffererentiated stem cells [38–41]. In FPAs the cells expressing Ly6G fall into two subpopulations. There is a small, less granular subpopulation and a large, granular Ly6G-negative subpopulation (Figure 4B and E). This contrasts bone marrow macrophages that differentiate in bioreactors which were mostly Ly6G positive and had continuums of sizes and granularities (Figure4C and F). For F4/80 expression, most of the cells recovered from FPAs and bioreactors were F4/80 positive (Figure 5). However, the cells in FPAs were smaller and agranular (Figure 5B and E) compared to cells collected from bioreactors after 7 days of differentiation, which expressed a continuum of granularities and sizes (Figure 5C and F). We saw similar trends for Mac-2 (Figure 6) and c-fms (Figure 7) expression. Macrophages were clearly differentiating in both culture devices over the 7-day differentiation period. However, the data clearly demonstrate that the properties of the cells were very distinct based on size, granularity and antibody staining. This is an important insight because it illustrates that just like the number of macrophages that develop in each type of culture device, the cell phenotype is hardware dependent. It is not clear why the cell phenotypes were so distinct when bone marrow cells were incubated in the two different hardware. The smaller fluid volume of the FPA may have had an impact. Although the numbers of cells in each of the hardware (1×107 vs. 3×108) was adjusted, the final cell concentration in an FPA was 1.7×106 cells/ml (after all septa movements) compared to 6×106 cells per ml in the Techshot bioreactor. Perhaps the increased cell concentration induced more culture stress. Alternatively, the distinct shapes of the devices may have influenced the data. This hypothesis is supported by the experiments presented here. When we changed the orientations of FPAs or the Techshot bioreactor, there were distinct changes in the culture outcomes. Additional experiments will be needed to test these hypotheses. Figure 4. Flow cytometric analysis of Ly6G on bone marrow derived macrophages.

However, the loss of the space shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003 and the announcement on April 4, 2006 of a change in the NASA strategic plan[42], restricted access to the space shuttle laboratory. In 2008, we secured another opportunity to fly an experiment on the space shuttle Endeavour, STS-126. This 14-day flight provided the opportunity to assess bone marrow macrophage differentiation in vitro in response to recombinant mouse M-CSF using FPA hardware[5]. Cells were fixed with formalin and RNA was preserved at day 14 of the space flight (Figure 8). Cells were returned to Earth for cell surface molecule assessments and transcriptional arrays were performed using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array [5]. Figure 8. Time-line of activities for bone marrow macrophage differentiation on STS-126. Open in a new tab The FPAs were prepared as previously described [5] and were shipped to the NASA SLSL at KSC 2 days before launch. The FPAs were loaded into GAPs and placed at 37°C in the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA). Parallel temperature and activation profile conditions were maintained on GAPs kept at the SLSL. The cells in the FPAs were re-fed with 1.5 ml of medium supplemented with rmM-CSF on day 5 of the spaceflight by combining chambers 1 and 2 (See Figure 3). On day 14 of spaceflight, the content of the FPAs’ third chamber were mixed with the cell suspension in the previously merged chambers to preserve RNA or to fix or maintain cells until processing after landing. STS-126 landing occurred at the Edwards Air Force Base in California after 16 days of space flight. Samples were placed at 4° C and transported to the SLSL in Florida.We discovered that cells proliferated more in space compared to ground-incubated cells. There were also several changes in cell surface molecules on macrophages differentiated in space compared to ground controls [5]. We saw significant shifts in the distribution of cells expressing CD31, Ly6C, CD11b, F4/80, Mac-2 and c-fos in cells differentiated in space flight compared to ground controls [5]. The transcript levels in macrophages differentiated in space were also different from those inground controls. Six hundred and seven genes had transcript levels >1.5 fold higher for flight samples than ground controls. In contrast, we found that 1071 genes had gene transcript levels >1.5 fold lower than ground controls (P < 0.05)[5]. The genes were sorted into biological function categories using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software and 33 genes were identifiedin the M-CSF/c-fms pathway. Bone marrow stem cells differentiate into macrophages in the presence of M-CSF in an ordered fashion from myeloid pluripotent precursors to monoblasts to macrophages (Figure 9). Gene expression occurs concomitantly during this process [43–46]. When we compared transcript levels of genes that were higher or lower in cells differentiated during space flight compared to ground controls, we found several genes that were significantly up or down regulated in the M-CSF/c-fms pathway (Figure 9). Moreover, the down regulation of Rbl-1 and E2f4 transcripts would be expected because of their roles in proliferation [47, 48] and cell differentiation [49]. Hoxb3 and Hoxb4 molecules are necessary for myeloid cell proliferation early in differentiation [44, 45] and the patterns of the transcripts seen in the space-flight samples were consistent with the increased proliferation we detected in space flight compared to ground controls [5].

The preflight verification tests comparing the Techshot bioreactor to FPAs prepared us for the flight. In our proposal to NASA, we showed that we could obtain meaningful data using the FPA hardware and that we understood the culture system. Results from STS-126 were validated by the consistency between the transcript expression data and the functional cell proliferation data [5]. This also provides strong justification for NASA to provide investigators ample opportunities to validate their culture systems because the acquired data may be dependent on the culture system. This will be especially important because of the retirement of the space shuttle and the readjustment of cell culture systems to new space platforms [50].Acknowledgements We thank Dr. Alan Forsman for help with STS-69, -73 and -77, Michelle Pate for her help with the preflight verification tests and Nanyan Lu for help with the array data from STS-126.

    "abstract": "Abstract Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes Tnfa, Il6, and Ccl2. In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine.",
    "introduction": "",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods Animals Five-week-old WT male C57BL/6J recipient mice, 10-week-old male WT, and db/db donor mice on the C57BL/6J background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were subjected to whole-body irradiation with a single 10-Gy dose from a 137Cs γ-source. Bone marrow cells were subsequently collected from WT and db/db mice by flushing long bones with sterile PBS containing 50 μg/mL gentamycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Recipient mice were each reconstituted with 2 × 107 WT (n = 8) or db/db (n = 8) bone marrow cells through retro-orbital iv injection. Four irradiated mice were not reconstituted and were used to confirm irradiation effectiveness by measuring circulating leukocytes. Reconstituted mice were housed in laminar-flow isolators and received acidified water ad lib supplemented with 100 mg/L neomycin and 10 mg/L polymyxin B sulfate 1 week before and 2 weeks after irradiation according to an established protocol (21). Reconstituted mice received an irradiated normal-fat diet (D12450B, 10% calories from fat; Research Diets Inc) for 6 weeks at the end of which reconstitution was confirmed by measuring circulating T and B cells by fluorescence analysis and comparing with nonirradiated controls. At that time, mice were moved to standard housing and were fed a HFD (D12492, 45% calories from fat; Research Diets Inc) for 16 weeks. Body weights and food intake were measured weekly. At study termination, mice were euthanized by isoflurane inhalation, and AT pads were dissected, weighed, and processed as described below. All animal procedures were performed with previous approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Kansas State University and the University of Kansas Medical Center. Serum analysis Insulin, leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, IL-6, and TNF-α were measured in serum of fasted mice by fluorescent immunoassay using a Milliplex MAP kit (Millipore) at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of dietary treatment. Fasting blood glucose was measured at each blood withdrawal using a digital glucometer (Contour Blood Glucose Monitoring System; Bayer). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the following formula: fasting blood glucose (milligrams per deciliter) × fasting insulin (microunits per milliliter)/405 (22). RNA isolation and gene expression quantification AT RNA was extracted with the Trizol method. RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA with the RT2 First Strand cDNA Kit (SABiosciences). AT cDNA was used to measure transcripts of interest by real-time PCR using a customized SYBR Green real-time PCR detection superarray from SABiosciences. Sequences coding for Tnfa, Il6, Ccl2, Ccr2, Mgl1, and Lep were targeted by the assay. Actb (β-actin), used as the internal standard for normalization and reverse transcription, and genomic DNA were assessed for each sample as quality controls. ATM sorting Gonadal white AT (gWAT) was digested as previously described (23), and the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) pellet was collected. Cells were blocked with 50% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 minutes at 4°C and incubated with F4/80 and CD11b antibodies for 1 hour at 4°C followed by 2 washes in PBS. ATMs were then sorted by coexpression of F4/80 and CD11b using a MoFLO XDP cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). AT immunohistochemistry Samples from gWAT were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 24 hours before embedding in paraffin. Sections (10 μm thick) were cut and deparaffinized with xylene and decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by immersing the slides in citrate buffer (10mM citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20 [pH 6.0]) for 30 minutes at 90°C to 95°C. Sections were stained overnight at 4°C with antimouse F4/80, MGL1, and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) antibodies (AbD Serotec). Sections were examined using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL). Statistical analysis Data are displayed as mean ± SEM. Mean comparison analysis was performed using a simple t test. All analyses was performed using SPSS software. For all analyses, statistical significance was considered at P < .05.",
    "results": "Results and Discussion Effect of bone marrow leptin receptor deficiency on body weight and body composition We generated bone marrow chimeric mice, reconstituted with either WT or db/db bone marrow, to investigate whether leptin signaling is involved in ATM recruitment and promotion of a proinflammatory condition in AT. We observed that WT/db mice experienced significantly less weight gain on HFD (Figure 1, A and B) and lower total adiposity (Figure 1C) compared with mice that received WT bone marrow. The lower adiposity in WT/db mice compared with WT/WT mice was driven by lower gWAT, inguinal WAT (iWAT), and retroperitoneal WAT mass in the former compared with the latter (Figure 1C). No difference was observed in brown AT. Both groups had equal food intake (Figure 1D). However, WT/db mice were considerably less energy-efficient than their WT/WT counterparts (Figure 1E). It is known that irradiation affects non–bone-marrow tissues, including AT (24, 25). Furthermore, our data show that WT mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow have even greater resistance to HFD-induced weight gain and adiposity than irradiated WT mice (WT/WT) on HFD. Therefore, leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells must play a role in body weight regulation in response to HFD, independently of its known role in preventing weight gain and fat mass accumulation (20). It has been suggested that reducing inflammation in AT could prevent weight gain associated with HFD feeding (26, 27). However, attenuation of AT inflammation did not endow mice with the ability to resist weight gain and fatness in response to HFD (28–30). Therefore, reduced AT inflammation is unlikely to be the cause of the reduced body weight observed in WT/db mice. Although we did not investigate possible mechanisms underlying this surprising phenotype of HFD-fed WT/db mice, several factors might be involved. These include the inhibition of adipogenesis or differentiation of bone marrow-derived stem cells into adipocytes (31). In that regard, although WT/db mice had smaller gWAT, their average adipocyte size was larger than WT/WT (3.7 ± 1.2 vs 2.7 ± 0.6 μm2 [×103]) with fewer number of cells (25 ± 5 vs 32 ± 7 × 103 cells/cm2), suggesting a compromised adipogenesis. It is conceivable that leptin signaling may be involved in adipocyte recruitment into AT. Certainly, leptin and leptin receptor expression is vital for normal adipocyte commitment and maturation (32). It is also plausible that loss of bone density contributes to reduction in WT/db body weight gain compared with WT/WT mice. Our observation that WT/db mice experienced significantly less weight gain on HFD contrasts with the work of Gove et al (33). They found that chow-fed WT mice reconstituted with db/db or WT bone marrow exhibited similar body weight profiles 4 weeks after irradiation (33). In our study, WT/WT and WT/db mice on a normal-fat diet started showing a difference in body weight at 18 weeks after irradiation, although the difference was not significant (data not shown). At this point, we cannot rule out that the difference in body weight might have reached significance at later stages. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Anthropometric and food intake of WT/WT and WT/db mice on an HFD. A–C, WT male mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-deficient (WT/db) bone marrow gained significantly less weight at the end of a 16-week HFD challenge (A), with a significantly different cumulative weight gain (B) and significantly lower ratio adipose tissue pads to body weight (C) compared with controls (WT/WT). D and E, This occurred with no difference in food intake (D) and significantly different energy efficiency between groups (E). *, P < .05. Abbreviations: BAT, brown AT; rpWAT, retroperitoneal WAT. Proinflammatory macrophage recruitment to AT Obesity is associated with increased proinflammatory ATMs arranged in CLSs surrounding adipocytes. The high prevalence of CLS is highly correlated with AT inflammation and metabolic disorder (13). We observed significantly fewer CLSs in gWAT from WT/db HFD-fed mice compared with WT/WT HFD-fed mice (Figure 2A). Leptin induces mitogenesis (34), and to rule out that the decrease in CLS numbers was not secondary to an inhibition of mitosis, we measured the amount of macrophages in the SVF of both WT/WT and WT/db mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Both WT/WT and WT/db groups had similar total macrophage infiltration in their gWAT as measured by the percentage F4/80+/CD11b+ cells in the SVF (33% and 10% of all SVF cells in gWAT and iWAT, respectively, in both groups, P > .05). However, although most ATMs in WT/WT mice were CCR2+, most ATMs in WT/db mice were MGL1+/CCR2− (Figure 2B). Anti-inflammatory macrophages secrete catecholamines inducing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in AT (35). We report a prevalence of anti-inflammatory ATMs in WT/db mice, which might induce an increase in UCP1 and can explain the difference in body and fat mass weight. Although we did not measure UCP1, we believe that exploring this hypothesis is warranted in the future. Both the presence of CLSs and the expression of CCR2+ ATMs correlate with AT inflammation (8, 36). Moreover, leptin signaling deficiency in HFD-fed WT mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-null bone marrow resulted in greater than 2-fold reduction in the expression transcript levels for Il6 and Ccl2 in gonadal fat and almost 2-fold for Tnfa (Table 1), indicative of a proinflammatory environment. Conversely, the increased prevalence of MGL1+ cells in WT/db AT compared with WT/WT AT (Figure 2B) is indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype of infiltrated macrophages. Although more than 80% of AT macrophages in gonadal and sc fat from lean mice are MGL1+, this value falls to 50% in obese mice, thus serving as a key determinant of pro- vs anti-inflammatory macrophage properties (9). We know that leptin is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes/macrophages in vitro (37, 38) and induces a proinflammatory phenotype in T cells (39) and primes macrophages to secrete inflammatory cytokines under septic conditions (40). However, at this point, we cannot rule out that the difference in AT inflammation is secondary to reduced weight gain in WT/db mice. Future studies examining more detailed kinetic changes are warranted to address this issue. Nevertheless, our findings for the first time implicate leptin in the phenotypic switch of ATMs from anti-inflammatory (M2) to proinflammatory (M1) in vivo. Figure 2.

B, Immunohistochemistry of gWAT labeled with F4/80, CCR2, and MGL1 antibodies shows a prevalence of MGL1+/CCR2− ATMs in WT/db mice, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype as compared with a more CCR2+ ATMs in WT/WT mice. **, P < .01.

Effect of bone marrow leptin receptor deficiency on insulin sensitivity We measured fasting serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, leptin, insulin, and glucose in all mice at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of the study. No differences were observed in IL-6, TNF-α, or MCP-1 serum levels between the 2 experimental groups (data not shown). Paralleling fat mass data, leptin serum levels were lower in the WT/db mice compared with WT/WT with a borderline statistically significant difference between groups (P = .06, Figure 3A). Fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR index were measured to assess glucose metabolism. HOMA-IR is a predictor for insulin resistance in rodents (22). Fasting blood glucose was not different between the WT/WT and WT/db mice (Figure 3B). Both insulin and HOMA were lower in WT/db mice compared with WT/WT with insulin levels being statistically lower (P < .05) and HOMA-IR approaching statistical significance (P = .06) (Figure 3, C and D). These data suggest that WT HFD-fed mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow might be more insulin-sensitive compared with HFD-fed WT mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow. Although we used HOMA-IR to assess insulin resistance in this study, future studies measuring glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance are warranted to more conclusively assess glucose homeostasis in this model. It is probable that reduced AT inflammation in WT/db mice is the causal factor underlying the improved glucose homeostasis in these mice. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, which in our study was close to 2-fold lower (mRNA) in WT/db AT compared with that of WT/WT mice (Table 1), directly contributes to insulin resistance through suppression of glucose transporter GLUT4 gene expression (41) and induction of serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (42). The elevation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α can also inhibit insulin signaling by activating Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) (43). CCL2 mRNA, which was reduced in AT of WT/db mice compared with WT/WT mice, is also directly involved in insulin function. CCL2 induces insulin resistance on adipocytes in an autocrine fashion by decreasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (28, 44). Our findings of reduced proinflammatory cytokine transcripts (Table 1) and reduced insulin levels (Figure 3B) in WT/db mice on an HFD support a role for leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived macrophage infiltration in obesity-associated insulin resistance. Many studies investigating ATM involvement in obesity-associated insulin resistance have used HFDs with a higher fat content (60%) (28, 45) than the diet used (45% calories from fat) in this study. Perhaps the use of a more aggressive dietary approach would reveal more pronounced differences in the proinflammatory response to HFD between WT/WT and WT/db mice. Figure 3.

    "discussion": "Results and Discussion Effect of bone marrow leptin receptor deficiency on body weight and body composition We generated bone marrow chimeric mice, reconstituted with either WT or db/db bone marrow, to investigate whether leptin signaling is involved in ATM recruitment and promotion of a proinflammatory condition in AT. We observed that WT/db mice experienced significantly less weight gain on HFD (Figure 1, A and B) and lower total adiposity (Figure 1C) compared with mice that received WT bone marrow. The lower adiposity in WT/db mice compared with WT/WT mice was driven by lower gWAT, inguinal WAT (iWAT), and retroperitoneal WAT mass in the former compared with the latter (Figure 1C). No difference was observed in brown AT. Both groups had equal food intake (Figure 1D). However, WT/db mice were considerably less energy-efficient than their WT/WT counterparts (Figure 1E). It is known that irradiation affects non–bone-marrow tissues, including AT (24, 25). Furthermore, our data show that WT mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow have even greater resistance to HFD-induced weight gain and adiposity than irradiated WT mice (WT/WT) on HFD. Therefore, leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells must play a role in body weight regulation in response to HFD, independently of its known role in preventing weight gain and fat mass accumulation (20). It has been suggested that reducing inflammation in AT could prevent weight gain associated with HFD feeding (26, 27). However, attenuation of AT inflammation did not endow mice with the ability to resist weight gain and fatness in response to HFD (28–30). Therefore, reduced AT inflammation is unlikely to be the cause of the reduced body weight observed in WT/db mice. Although we did not investigate possible mechanisms underlying this surprising phenotype of HFD-fed WT/db mice, several factors might be involved. These include the inhibition of adipogenesis or differentiation of bone marrow-derived stem cells into adipocytes (31). In that regard, although WT/db mice had smaller gWAT, their average adipocyte size was larger than WT/WT (3.7 ± 1.2 vs 2.7 ± 0.6 μm2 [×103]) with fewer number of cells (25 ± 5 vs 32 ± 7 × 103 cells/cm2), suggesting a compromised adipogenesis. It is conceivable that leptin signaling may be involved in adipocyte recruitment into AT. Certainly, leptin and leptin receptor expression is vital for normal adipocyte commitment and maturation (32). It is also plausible that loss of bone density contributes to reduction in WT/db body weight gain compared with WT/WT mice. Our observation that WT/db mice experienced significantly less weight gain on HFD contrasts with the work of Gove et al (33). They found that chow-fed WT mice reconstituted with db/db or WT bone marrow exhibited similar body weight profiles 4 weeks after irradiation (33). In our study, WT/WT and WT/db mice on a normal-fat diet started showing a difference in body weight at 18 weeks after irradiation, although the difference was not significant (data not shown). At this point, we cannot rule out that the difference in body weight might have reached significance at later stages. Figure 1.

Proinflammatory macrophage recruitment to AT Obesity is associated with increased proinflammatory ATMs arranged in CLSs surrounding adipocytes. The high prevalence of CLS is highly correlated with AT inflammation and metabolic disorder (13). We observed significantly fewer CLSs in gWAT from WT/db HFD-fed mice compared with WT/WT HFD-fed mice (Figure 2A). Leptin induces mitogenesis (34), and to rule out that the decrease in CLS numbers was not secondary to an inhibition of mitosis, we measured the amount of macrophages in the SVF of both WT/WT and WT/db mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Both WT/WT and WT/db groups had similar total macrophage infiltration in their gWAT as measured by the percentage F4/80+/CD11b+ cells in the SVF (33% and 10% of all SVF cells in gWAT and iWAT, respectively, in both groups, P > .05). However, although most ATMs in WT/WT mice were CCR2+, most ATMs in WT/db mice were MGL1+/CCR2− (Figure 2B). Anti-inflammatory macrophages secrete catecholamines inducing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in AT (35). We report a prevalence of anti-inflammatory ATMs in WT/db mice, which might induce an increase in UCP1 and can explain the difference in body and fat mass weight. Although we did not measure UCP1, we believe that exploring this hypothesis is warranted in the future. Both the presence of CLSs and the expression of CCR2+ ATMs correlate with AT inflammation (8, 36). Moreover, leptin signaling deficiency in HFD-fed WT mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-null bone marrow resulted in greater than 2-fold reduction in the expression transcript levels for Il6 and Ccl2 in gonadal fat and almost 2-fold for Tnfa (Table 1), indicative of a proinflammatory environment. Conversely, the increased prevalence of MGL1+ cells in WT/db AT compared with WT/WT AT (Figure 2B) is indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype of infiltrated macrophages. Although more than 80% of AT macrophages in gonadal and sc fat from lean mice are MGL1+, this value falls to 50% in obese mice, thus serving as a key determinant of pro- vs anti-inflammatory macrophage properties (9). We know that leptin is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes/macrophages in vitro (37, 38) and induces a proinflammatory phenotype in T cells (39) and primes macrophages to secrete inflammatory cytokines under septic conditions (40). However, at this point, we cannot rule out that the difference in AT inflammation is secondary to reduced weight gain in WT/db mice. Future studies examining more detailed kinetic changes are warranted to address this issue. Nevertheless, our findings for the first time implicate leptin in the phenotypic switch of ATMs from anti-inflammatory (M2) to proinflammatory (M1) in vivo. Figure 2.

Abstract Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes Tnfa, Il6, and Ccl2. In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine. Obesity is positively correlated with a plethora of inflammatory diseases and a higher susceptibility to infections (1). Therefore, investigating the link between obesity and immune system function is of utmost importance. The close interplay between metabolic and inflammatory pathways is beneficial under physiological conditions but becomes deleterious with either nutrient scarcity or nutrient excess (2). Indeed, obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade inflammation (3) in which increased levels of inflammatory markers and leptin prevail in the expanding adipose tissue (AT) (4, 5). This chronic low-grade inflammation is believed to be the origin of most the obesity-associated diseases (2). Macrophages have been identified as the major secretory cells in AT, contributing to systemic and local inflammation in obesity (6, 7). AT macrophage (ATM) recruitment is increased dramatically with the expansion of fat mass, comprising up to 50% of AT cells in the obese state (6). In addition to being more numerous in obese subjects, ATMs differ in localization, phenotype, and function between lean and obese individuals. In the lean state, resident (type II) macrophages display an anti-inflammatory phenotype with high gene expression of Il10, Mgl1 (macrophage galactose-type-C-type lectin 1), and Arg1 (8). Type II macrophages are mouse EGF-like module containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 positive (F4/80+), cluster of differentiation molecule 11c negative (CD11c−), MGL1+ (CD301) (9), and dispersed in the interstitial space between adipocytes (10) where they are believed to play a role in preserving AT integrity and maintenance. Conversely, obesity-recruited (type I) macrophages display a proinflammatory phenotype (9), have a high level of expression of Tnfa, Il6 and Nos2 (11) transcripts, and are F4/80+, CD11c+, and MGL1− (8, 12). These cells form what is known as crown-like structures (CLSs) surrounding adipocytes and are involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (13). Although macrophage involvement in AT inflammation with obesity is well characterized, little is known about the mechanistic basis for ATM accumulation. Leptin is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity (14). The long leptin receptor isoform (LepRb), responsible for leptin's physiological activities (15), has been identified on most immune cells including monocytes and macrophages (16–19). Leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice exhibit less macrophage infiltration and inflammatory gene expression in AT, despite increased weight gain and adiposity (7). Moreover, obesity is accompanied by sustained elevated circulating concentrations of leptin, resulting in leptin resistance (20). In the present study, we investigated whether leptin signaling in white blood cells was involved in the recruitment of proinflammatory ATMs in diet-induced obesity. We demonstrated that the absence of leptin-receptor signaling in white blood cells led to reduced weight gain and adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed db/db bone marrow-transplanted wild-type (WT) mice compared with HFD-fed mice that received WT bone marrow transplants. Mice that received db/db bone marrow also exhibited decreased AT inflammation. Materials and Methods Animals Five-week-old WT male C57BL/6J recipient mice, 10-week-old male WT, and db/db donor mice on the C57BL/6J background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were subjected to whole-body irradiation with a single 10-Gy dose from a 137Cs γ-source. Bone marrow cells were subsequently collected from WT and db/db mice by flushing long bones with sterile PBS containing 50 μg/mL gentamycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Recipient mice were each reconstituted with 2 × 107 WT (n = 8) or db/db (n = 8) bone marrow cells through retro-orbital iv injection. Four irradiated mice were not reconstituted and were used to confirm irradiation effectiveness by measuring circulating leukocytes. Reconstituted mice were housed in laminar-flow isolators and received acidified water ad lib supplemented with 100 mg/L neomycin and 10 mg/L polymyxin B sulfate 1 week before and 2 weeks after irradiation according to an established protocol (21). Reconstituted mice received an irradiated normal-fat diet (D12450B, 10% calories from fat; Research Diets Inc) for 6 weeks at the end of which reconstitution was confirmed by measuring circulating T and B cells by fluorescence analysis and comparing with nonirradiated controls. At that time, mice were moved to standard housing and were fed a HFD (D12492, 45% calories from fat; Research Diets Inc) for 16 weeks. Body weights and food intake were measured weekly. At study termination, mice were euthanized by isoflurane inhalation, and AT pads were dissected, weighed, and processed as described below. All animal procedures were performed with previous approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Kansas State University and the University of Kansas Medical Center.Serum analysis Insulin, leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, IL-6, and TNF-α were measured in serum of fasted mice by fluorescent immunoassay using a Milliplex MAP kit (Millipore) at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of dietary treatment. Fasting blood glucose was measured at each blood withdrawal using a digital glucometer (Contour Blood Glucose Monitoring System; Bayer). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the following formula: fasting blood glucose (milligrams per deciliter) × fasting insulin (microunits per milliliter)/405 (22).RNA isolation and gene expression quantification AT RNA was extracted with the Trizol method. RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA with the RT2 First Strand cDNA Kit (SABiosciences). AT cDNA was used to measure transcripts of interest by real-time PCR using a customized SYBR Green real-time PCR detection superarray from SABiosciences. Sequences coding for Tnfa, Il6, Ccl2, Ccr2, Mgl1, and Lep were targeted by the assay. Actb (β-actin), used as the internal standard for normalization and reverse transcription, and genomic DNA were assessed for each sample as quality controls.ATM sorting Gonadal white AT (gWAT) was digested as previously described (23), and the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) pellet was collected. Cells were blocked with 50% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 minutes at 4°C and incubated with F4/80 and CD11b antibodies for 1 hour at 4°C followed by 2 washes in PBS. ATMs were then sorted by coexpression of F4/80 and CD11b using a MoFLO XDP cell sorter (Becton Dickinson).AT immunohistochemistry Samples from gWAT were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 24 hours before embedding in paraffin. Sections (10 μm thick) were cut and deparaffinized with xylene and decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by immersing the slides in citrate buffer (10mM citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20 [pH 6.0]) for 30 minutes at 90°C to 95°C. Sections were stained overnight at 4°C with antimouse F4/80, MGL1, and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) antibodies (AbD Serotec). Sections were examined using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL).Statistical analysis Data are displayed as mean ± SEM. Mean comparison analysis was performed using a simple t test. All analyses was performed using SPSS software. For all analyses, statistical significance was considered at P < .05.Results and Discussion Effect of bone marrow leptin receptor deficiency on body weight and body composition We generated bone marrow chimeric mice, reconstituted with either WT or db/db bone marrow, to investigate whether leptin signaling is involved in ATM recruitment and promotion of a proinflammatory condition in AT. We observed that WT/db mice experienced significantly less weight gain on HFD (Figure 1, A and B) and lower total adiposity (Figure 1C) compared with mice that received WT bone marrow. The lower adiposity in WT/db mice compared with WT/WT mice was driven by lower gWAT, inguinal WAT (iWAT), and retroperitoneal WAT mass in the former compared with the latter (Figure 1C). No difference was observed in brown AT. Both groups had equal food intake (Figure 1D). However, WT/db mice were considerably less energy-efficient than their WT/WT counterparts (Figure 1E). It is known that irradiation affects non–bone-marrow tissues, including AT (24, 25). Furthermore, our data show that WT mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow have even greater resistance to HFD-induced weight gain and adiposity than irradiated WT mice (WT/WT) on HFD.

Effect of bone marrow leptin receptor deficiency on insulin sensitivity We measured fasting serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, leptin, insulin, and glucose in all mice at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of the study. No differences were observed in IL-6, TNF-α, or MCP-1 serum levels between the 2 experimental groups (data not shown). Paralleling fat mass data, leptin serum levels were lower in the WT/db mice compared with WT/WT with a borderline statistically significant difference between groups (P = .06, Figure 3A). Fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR index were measured to assess glucose metabolism. HOMA-IR is a predictor for insulin resistance in rodents (22). Fasting blood glucose was not different between the WT/WT and WT/db mice (Figure 3B). Both insulin and HOMA were lower in WT/db mice compared with WT/WT with insulin levels being statistically lower (P < .05) and HOMA-IR approaching statistical significance (P = .06) (Figure 3, C and D). These data suggest that WT HFD-fed mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow might be more insulin-sensitive compared with HFD-fed WT mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow. Although we used HOMA-IR to assess insulin resistance in this study, future studies measuring glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance are warranted to more conclusively assess glucose homeostasis in this model. It is probable that reduced AT inflammation in WT/db mice is the causal factor underlying the improved glucose homeostasis in these mice. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, which in our study was close to 2-fold lower (mRNA) in WT/db AT compared with that of WT/WT mice (Table 1), directly contributes to insulin resistance through suppression of glucose transporter GLUT4 gene expression (41) and induction of serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (42). The elevation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α can also inhibit insulin signaling by activating Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) (43). CCL2 mRNA, which was reduced in AT of WT/db mice compared with WT/WT mice, is also directly involved in insulin function. CCL2 induces insulin resistance on adipocytes in an autocrine fashion by decreasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (28, 44). Our findings of reduced proinflammatory cytokine transcripts (Table 1) and reduced insulin levels (Figure 3B) in WT/db mice on an HFD support a role for leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived macrophage infiltration in obesity-associated insulin resistance. Many studies investigating ATM involvement in obesity-associated insulin resistance have used HFDs with a higher fat content (60%) (28, 45) than the diet used (45% calories from fat) in this study. Perhaps the use of a more aggressive dietary approach would reveal more pronounced differences in the proinflammatory response to HFD between WT/WT and WT/db mice. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Fasting serum levels of leptin and insulin and measures of HOMA-IR at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of HFD treatment. A–D, Mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-deficient bone marrow (WT/db) had lower serum leptin (A) (P = .06), fasting blood glucose (B) (P > .05), serum insulin (C) (P < .05), and HOMA-IR (D) (P = .06) compared with WT/WT mice.In summary, the data presented support the hypothesis that leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells is important for the development of the AT inflammation that accompanies obesity and possibly the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.Acknowledgments We thank Dr Bruce Kimler at Kansas University Medical Center for generously performing the irradiation procedures.

    "abstract": "Abstract Metabolic and immune mediators activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation. Keywords: Macrophages, Leptin receptor, Immortal cell line",
    "introduction": "Introduction Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a 16 kDa peptide hormone predominantly secreted by white adipocytes (Ahima and Flier 2000; Zhang et al. 1994). Leptin is structurally similar to type I cytokines and referred to as an adipokine or adipocytokine (Otero et al. 2005). Leptin signals through its receptor (LepR) encoded by the Lepr gene (Chen et al. 1996). The LepR exists in six alternatively spliced isoforms (Lee et al. 1996). The long isoform of LepR is a member of the interleukin-6 receptor family of class 1 cytokine receptors, and is responsible for most of leptin’s physiological activities (Baumann et al. 1996; Tartaglia et al. 1995). Leptin is involved in a plethora of physiological actions, and plays a major role in the regulation of neuroendocrine function and energy homeostasis (Chan et al. 2003). Leptin stimulates the production of anorectic neuropeptides and suppresses the action of orexigenic peptides in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Cheung et al. 1997; Schwartz et al. 1997; Thornton et al. 1997), where LepR is highly expressed (Elmquist et al. 1998). In addition, leptin exerts other physiological effects that impact reproduction, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and immunity (Wauters et al. 2000). Leptin’s effects are exerted through the expression of LepR on different types of tissues and cells throughout the body; these are often referred to as leptin’s peripheral effects. Furthermore, leptin plays an important role in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity (La Cava and Matarese 2004; Matarese et al. 2005), and different immune cells express LepR, which supports the notion that leptin plays a direct role in immune function (Matarese et al. 2005). T-cells (Batra et al. 2009), B-cells (Papathanassoglou et al. 2006), neutrophils (Caldefie-Chezet et al. 2003), monocytes (Raso et al. 2002), dendritic cells (Mattioli et al. 2005) and NK cells (Tian et al. 2002) all express LepR, and leptin has been shown to modulate their functions in vivo and in vitro (Papathanassoglou et al. 2006). Leptin induces diapedesis of monocytes and macrophages through an epithelial layer in vitro and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from both cell types (Curat et al. 2004; Gruen et al. 2007). In macrophages, leptin augments LPS-induced cytokine secretion (Gainsford et al. 1996; Loffreda et al. 1998) via IRAK-1 up-regulation, (Vaughan and Li 2010) and potentiates IFN-γ-induced expression of nitric oxide synthase (Raso et al. 2002). Non-genetic obesity is characterized by a hyperleptinemic state (Considine et al. 1996) and a compromised immune system (Falagas and Kompoti 2006). In addition, there is increased pro-inflammatory macrophage recruitment in the adipose tissue of obese individuals (Weisberg et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003), and “obese” macrophages have impaired phagocytic activity (Krishnan et al. 1982; Mancuso et al. 2002). It remains unclear what promotes a proinflammatory state in obese animals and people and their higher susceptibility to infections. Our central hypothesis is that leptin contributes directly to this problem by regulating macrophage function. Our objective here was to create a continuous macrophage cell line to allow for investigation of LepR’s impact on macrophage function. We detail the properties of this new leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1 in this paper.",

    "results": "Results Establishment of DB-1 cell line We established an immortal leptin receptor-deficient cell line from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow cells from leptin receptor deficient mice (db/db) were collected and cultured in biomedium as described in the Materials and Methods section. Differentiated macrophages were passaged at confluency. Cells were kept in biomedium for 6 months when the cells appeared to grow at a stable rate after twenty passages. At that time, we did two consecutive limiting dilution cloning procedures. The DB-1 cells were selected from cloned cells from the second cloning. DB-1 cells lost their dependency to M-CSF during the cloning process. They were propagated and shifted to a regular medium, DMEM supplemented with 2 % Nu serum and 2 % FBS. DB-1 cells exhibit morphological properties characteristic of macrophages, and are adherent with multiple processes (Fig. 1). To confirm the genotype of the DB-1 cells as leptin-receptor deficient, we used qRT-PCR to confirm the absence of LepR. Similarly to primary peritoneal db/db macrophages, DB-1 had low levels of Lepr transcripts, and expression ranged from 0.1 to 12 % of WT macrophages (p < 0.05, Table 1). Fig. 1.

The DB-1 cell line was homogenous consisting of diploid cells, of which 90–95 % cells were in G1 phase, 3–9 % in G2 phase and 0–2 % in S phase (Fig. 2a, b). 50 metaphase-stage cells (See Fig. 2c for an example) were analyzed for chromosome number and 49 out of 50 cells examined contained the normal complement of 38 chromosomes with one X and one Y chromosome (Fig. 2d); confirming the origin of the cells from a male mouse.

Cell growth plateaued after 4–5 days and the cells became contact inhibited and remained stable for as long as 3 weeks, which was the longest we ran the experiment. The slow growth rate along with the growth arrest at confluency is consistent with a cell line that is non-transformed and contact inhibited (Schuler et al. 1977) but it is unclear how these cells became immortalized. The fact that most cells are in the G1 phase of the cell cycle is consistent with the quiescent nature of the cells. Detailed sequencing of the DB-1 cell genome will be necessary to determine possible causes but these analyses are beyond the scope of this study. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Growth of DB-1 cells. Cell growth was assayed at 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, days after seeding of 5 × 105 DB-1 cells in 6-well plates. Cells were counted as described in the “Materials and methods” section. Each time point value is the mean of two independent experiments ± SD, 3 replicates per experiment Cell surface phenotype To verify that DB-1 cells were in the monocyte/macrophage lineage, we compared their cell surface molecule phenotype to primary peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 4a, b). Primary macrophages had similar levels of F4/80 and MAC-2, regardless of their expression of LepR (Fig. 4b). Bone marrow-derived macrophages had less expression of CD11b and higher expression of Ly6C compared to the peritoneal macrophages. All cell types, including the DB-1 macrophages had minimal expression of Ly6G, the granulocyte marker, on their surface. DB-1 macrophages displayed MAC-2 in similar amounts as both bone marrow-derived and peritoneal WT and db/db macrophages. In contrast, F4/80 was minimally expressed and CD11b was not expressed at all in DB-1 macrophages. Ly6C was expressed by DB-1 macrophages at an intermediate level between that of the bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4b). These data suggest that the DB-1 macrophages are in the macrophage lineage (Leenen et al. 1990) with high MAC2 expression, lower expression of F4/80 and low levels of Ly6C (Geissmann et al. 2010). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab a Flow cytometry analysis of DB-1 cells. Forward-scatter versus Side-scatter (Column A) of peritoneal macrophages (Top two rows) and DB-1 macrophage cells (bottom two rows). Cells were analyzed for CD11b (column B) or F4/80 (column A). Cells were gated (oval in dot plot in column A) based on forward-scatter and side-scatter. Isotype controls (rows 1 and 3, columns B and C) were used to set gates to determine the % positive cells. b CD11b, MAC-2, F4/80, Ly-6C and Ly6G cell surface expression in peritoneal (PEC WT) macrophages, peritoneal (PEC db/db) macrophages, primary WT bone marrow (BM WT), primary db/db bone marrow (BM db/db) and DB-1 macrophages (DB) using flow cytometry. Data represent means ± SD, from two independent experiments, n = 2–5 replicates per experiment, each n from one or a pool of 2 mice. Significance between different cell types and DB-1 are reported as follows: ***p < 0.0001 compared to DB-1, **p < 0.001 compared to DB-1, *p < 0.5 compare to DB-1. Analysis were performed using one-way ANOVA and Tuckey for post hoc test Phagocytic activity To assess whether DB-1 cells display functional macrophage characteristics, we measured the phagocytic activity of DB-1 cells and compared this to that of primary macrophages. We found that all five cell-types—including the DB-1 macrophages—had similar phagocytic indices based on a 1-h phagocytosis assay (Fig. 5, p > 0.05). Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Phagocytic activity of DB-1, peritoneal (PEC) and bone-marrow (BM) derived WT and db/db macrophages after incubation with fluorescent beads. Phagocytic activity assessed via the percentage of phagocytosed beads using flow cytometry. Data represent means ± SD, from one or two independent experiments, n = 3–6 replicates per experiment, each n from one or a pool of 2 mice DB-1 activation To test whether DB-1 macrophages respond to a stimulus in a similar fashion as primary macrophages, DB-1 macrophages were stimulated with IFN-γ and transcript levels of Nos2 were quantified. We found that Nos2 transcript levels were higher after IFN-γ treatment with levels similar to peritoneal db/db macrophages (p < 0.05, Table 2). Consistent with transcriptional activation, they also secreted 15, 66 and 131 uM of nitrite in response to 1, 10 and 100 U/ml of IFN-γ, respectively. We also found that DB-1 macrophages secreted 155 ± 48, 385 ± 38 and 538 ± 192 pg/ml of IL-6 in response to LPS, LPS + IFNγ or IFNγ treatments, respectively, compared to low (0 pg/ml) secretion by unstimulated cells.

We found that DB-1 macrophages were activated to migrate when activated with 10 μl of PMA (10 μg/ml; positive control, p < 0.05), but that they failed to respond to the chemotactic signals from the ACM as well as the medium supplemented with leptin (Fig. 6). On the other hand, primary WT macrophages had a significant increase in migration when cultured with either the ACM or leptin (p < 0.01; comparison to medium alone) with no statistically significant difference between the two media (p > 0.05; Fig. 6); suggesting that most of the ACM chemotactic potential is mediated by leptin, and dependent on the presence of a functional LepR.

In the transwell system the lower chamber was supplemented with control medium (CM), adipocyte conditioned medium (ACM), CM supplemented with 10 ng/ml rm-leptin. To show that DB-1 cells could respond chemotactic stimuli not dependent on the LepR, DB-1 macrophages were stimulated with CM supplemented with 2 µM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA).

    "discussion": "Discussion We created a leptin-receptor deficient cell line, DB-1, that has some phenotypic and functional properties characteristic of primary macrophages. It is diploid, has the normal complement of chromosomes, lacks the long isoform of the leptin receptor, and is unresponsive to leptin. DB-1 cells are in the macrophage lineage based on their selection in macrophage colony stimulating factor over several months’ time and because of their phenotypic properties. Indeed, the DB-1 cells have many of the characteristics of ex vivo bone marrow-derived macrophages, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal WT and primary leptin receptor-deficient macrophages, which the DB-1 cells are hoped to replace in assays. However, their phenotypes are not completely consistent with mouse bone marrow derived macrophages that have been differentiated for 7 days in M-CSF (Leenen et al. 1994b). Although the DB-1 cells exhibit higher levels of MAC-2 expression and lower levels of Ly6G, indicative of cells in the macrophage lineage (Leenen et al. 1994a), the low expression of F4/80, CD11b and Ly6C would indicate that the cells may be less differentiated. Bone marrow-derived, primary macrophages from LepR knock-out mice had a phenotype similar to wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages. Therefore, it appears that in response to M-CSF, the bone marrow stem cells began to differentiate into macrophages. MAC2 was the first of these surface molecules to be expressed. Under normal circumstances, the differentiating cells would go on to express F4/80 and Ly6C by 7 days of stimulation with M-CSF (See Fig. 7). DB-1 macrophages don’t appear to have reached that stage. Macrophages that extravasate into the peritoneal cavity lose expression of Ly6C and go from low expression of CD11b to high expression of the molecule. DB-1 also do not have that phenotype; suggesting that DB-1 cells are early differentiated macrophages (Chan et al. 1998; Geissmann et al. 2010) (Fig. 7). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the DB-1 macrophages are responsive to IFN-γ and LPS stimuli; a property of macrophages (MacMicking et al. 1997). The strong phagocytic activity of the DB-1 cells supports that these cells are in the macrophage lineage as well (Leenen et al. 1986). In our study, the LepR did not appear to contribute to macrophage phagocytosis. The lack of the leptin gene (Lep) as well as Lepr have been associated with an enhanced susceptibility to infections and a higher mortality rate in rodents following bacterial infection (Ikejima et al. 2005; Mancuso et al. 2002; Ordway et al. 2008; Park et al. 2009). This increased risk of infection has been attributed to a decrease in phagocytic and bactericidal activity of ob/ob and db/db macrophages in vitro (Loffreda et al. 1998; Mancuso et al. 2002; Park et al. 2009). The difference in phagocytic activity between our DB-1 macrophages and that of ob/ob and db/db primary macrophages evaluated in other studies might be explained by the fact that we used inert fluorescent beads in our study compared to actual infectious agents (Loffreda et al. 1998; Mancuso et al. 2002; Park et al. 2009). However, we found that DB-1 macrophages’s ability to phagocytose fluorescent Ehrlichia chaffeensis bacteria was comparable to that of primary macrophages (data not shown). Therefore, the difference between our study and data presented by others may be due to other physiological factors such as a compromised oxidative response (Hsu et al. 2007) in immune cells or inefficient leukotriene production (Mancuso et al. 2002); products that were compromised in primary db/db and ob/ob macrophages. It is also possible that physiological factors associated with diabetes such as hyperglycemia may have an impact. Park et al. (2009) showed similar infection rates in mice between 8–11 week-old db/db mice and WT controls but older (20 weeks and more) db/db mice were significantly more susceptible to S. aureus infection. The DB-1 cells would not be subject to the physiological regulation of the in vivo macrophages because they are maintained in vitro. Obesity is associated with an increase in inflammatory macrophage recruitment to the expanding fat mass (Weisberg et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003). Studies have recognized MCP-1 as the major adipocyte-derived chemokine responsible for this effect (Kanda et al. 2006; Weisberg et al. 2006). Nevertheless, recent studies have questioned this chemokine’s role in the enhanced recruitment of macrophages into the adipose tissue of obese mice (Inouye et al. 2007). Leptin is another candidate adipokine/chemokine that might be responsible for this recruitment effect. Indeed, our data show that ACM as well as leptin-supplemented media have the same positive chemotactic effect on WT macrophages. Our DB-1 cell line, which lacks the functional LepR, failed to respond to both leptin-supplemented as well as adipocyte-conditioned media although our cell line responded to PMA. The differences between the WT macrophages and the DB-1 cells in their responsiveness to leptin can be directly attributed to the absence of LepR on the DB-1 cells which supports the studies of Gruen et al. (2007), who have shown leptin‘s chemotactic effects at levels as low as 1 pg/ml and illustrates their value in investigating the impact of the LepR in macrophage function. In an era characterized by increasing obesity rates (Ogden et al. 2006), it is of central importance that the immunological consequences of excessive body weight be further elucidated. The newly established DB-1 cell line can serve as an important and reliable tool to study the link between leptin and innate immune function. For example, future studies on the impact of LepR on antigen processing, cell trafficking or the recruitment of other inflammatory cells can be done either in vitro or in vivo. Because the cells are contact inhibited and do not appear to be tumorigenic, we can envision adoptive transfer studies similar to what were done with the C2D macrophage cell line (Ortega et al. 2011; Xie et al. 2010). These cells will be useful to any study investigating the role of the leptin receptor in cell function.",

Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation. Keywords: Macrophages, Leptin receptor, Immortal cell lineIntroduction Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a 16 kDa peptide hormone predominantly secreted by white adipocytes (Ahima and Flier 2000; Zhang et al. 1994). Leptin is structurally similar to type I cytokines and referred to as an adipokine or adipocytokine (Otero et al. 2005). Leptin signals through its receptor (LepR) encoded by the Lepr gene (Chen et al. 1996). The LepR exists in six alternatively spliced isoforms (Lee et al. 1996). The long isoform of LepR is a member of the interleukin-6 receptor family of class 1 cytokine receptors, and is responsible for most of leptin’s physiological activities (Baumann et al. 1996; Tartaglia et al. 1995). Leptin is involved in a plethora of physiological actions, and plays a major role in the regulation of neuroendocrine function and energy homeostasis (Chan et al. 2003). Leptin stimulates the production of anorectic neuropeptides and suppresses the action of orexigenic peptides in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Cheung et al. 1997; Schwartz et al. 1997; Thornton et al. 1997), where LepR is highly expressed (Elmquist et al. 1998). In addition, leptin exerts other physiological effects that impact reproduction, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and immunity (Wauters et al. 2000). Leptin’s effects are exerted through the expression of LepR on different types of tissues and cells throughout the body; these are often referred to as leptin’s peripheral effects. Furthermore, leptin plays an important role in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity (La Cava and Matarese 2004; Matarese et al. 2005), and different immune cells express LepR, which supports the notion that leptin plays a direct role in immune function (Matarese et al. 2005). T-cells (Batra et al. 2009), B-cells (Papathanassoglou et al. 2006), neutrophils (Caldefie-Chezet et al. 2003), monocytes (Raso et al. 2002), dendritic cells (Mattioli et al. 2005) and NK cells (Tian et al. 2002) all express LepR, and leptin has been shown to modulate their functions in vivo and in vitro (Papathanassoglou et al. 2006). Leptin induces diapedesis of monocytes and macrophages through an epithelial layer in vitro and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from both cell types (Curat et al. 2004; Gruen et al. 2007). In macrophages, leptin augments LPS-induced cytokine secretion (Gainsford et al. 1996; Loffreda et al. 1998) via IRAK-1 up-regulation, (Vaughan and Li 2010) and potentiates IFN-γ-induced expression of nitric oxide synthase (Raso et al. 2002). Non-genetic obesity is characterized by a hyperleptinemic state (Considine et al. 1996) and a compromised immune system (Falagas and Kompoti 2006). In addition, there is increased pro-inflammatory macrophage recruitment in the adipose tissue of obese individuals (Weisberg et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003), and “obese” macrophages have impaired phagocytic activity (Krishnan et al. 1982; Mancuso et al. 2002). It remains unclear what promotes a proinflammatory state in obese animals and people and their higher susceptibility to infections. Our central hypothesis is that leptin contributes directly to this problem by regulating macrophage function. Our objective here was to create a continuous macrophage cell line to allow for investigation of LepR’s impact on macrophage function. We detail the properties of this new leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1 in this paper.Materials and methods Animals Male leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice as well as gender- and aged-matched wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice controls were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All animal procedures were performed with prior approval and regular monitoring of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Kansas State University.Reagents Biomedium was prepared using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Atlanta Biologicals, Lawerenceville, GA, USA) supplemented with 5 % Nu Serum (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA, USA), 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals), 10 % Opti-MEM reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 50 μg per ml gentamicin (Atlanta Biologicals; DMEM10) and 1.5 ng per ml recombinant mouse M-CSF (rmM-CSF) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Cell culture medium was prepared using DMEM supplemented with 10 % Opti-MEM, 15 mmol/L HEPES and 100 μg per ml gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Recombinant mouse leptin (rm-leptin) and IFN-γ were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. Fluorescent spheres were purchased from Invitrogen. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and aliquoted at 10 μg/ml concentrations and stored at −80 °C. Cells were stimulated with 10 μl of freshly thawed aliquots.Collection of peritoneal macrophages Peritoneal exudate macrophages from WT and db/db mice were induced by i.p. injection of 1.5 ml of sterile, 2.9 % thioglycollate (DIFCO, Detroit, MI, USA). Four days after injection, mice were anesthetized via isoflurane (IsoFlo, Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA) inhalation and euthanized via cervical dislocation. Peritoneal exudate macrophages were collected by washing the peritoneal cavity twice with 12 ml of ice-cold PBS.Differentiation of Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages Bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice (db/db) were collected by flushing the humeri, tibiae and femora as previously described (Armstrong et al. 1993). The undifferentiated cells were resuspended in biomedium containing rmM-CSF (Metcalf et al. 1982), needed for macrophage differentiation, counted and plated at a density of 3–5 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 8 % CO2 and non-adherent cells were removed. Cells were adherent and were dispersed with trypsin/EDTA (10 % trypsin, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA; Atlanta Biologicals) to passage the cells. Cells were passed twenty times until spontaneous immortalization occurred as was described previously (Beharka et al. 1998). For activation and phagocytosis assays, bone marrow cells from db/db and WT mice, and for cytokine assays bone marrow WT mouse cells were allowed to mature for 7–10 days in biomedium before primary macrophages were used.Limiting dilution cloning of cell lines Cells were dispersed with trypsin/EDTA as described above and resuspended in DMEM10. Cells were counted and each dilution was plated in 48 wells of a Costar 96-well, flat-bottom tissue culture plate. A 1:10 serial dilution scheme was used starting at 100 cells/well in 100 μl DMEM10 and ending at 0.01 cell/well. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 8 % CO2. Only clones that grew from dilutions having less than a 30 % positive growth were selected and expanded. The limiting dilution was repeated twice to ensure pure clones. Two final clones were selected and characterization experiments were performed using these clones. The cells were confirmed to be of mouse origin by positive PCR of mouse Actb gene and the positive staining of the cells for mouse-specific MAC2 antigens between July and August 2009.Genotyping of cell line Transcript expression of the long isoform (LepR) of the Lepr gene ( 16847) was assessed using qRT-PCR and the following primers: Lepr forward 5′-GCA ACC CAC CAT GAT TTC ACC ACA-3′; reverse 3′-AGG ATT CCT GCC TCA CCA GTC AAA-5′. The internal control gene used was β-actin ( number 11461) with the following primers: Actb forward, 5′-TGT GAT GGT GGG AAT GGG TCA GAA-3′; Actb reverse, 3′-TGT GGT GCC AGA TCT TCT CCA TGT-5′. Fold change in transcript level of each cell type was quantified using the method described by Pfaffl (2001), and the formula using WT macrophages as the reference group: Foldchange=EΔcttargetgenereference -exp/EΔcthousekeepinggenereference - exp; where E is the efficiency of the primers, and the housekeeping gene is ActB (encodes for β-actin).Cell cycle determination Cell cycle determination and ploidy of the cell line was determined using flow cytometry. Briefly, cells in culture were dispersed, collected and counted. A total of 2 × 106 cells were transferred to 12 × 75-mm polystyrene tubes (Falcon, Brookings, SD, USA). Vindelov’s propidium iodide (PI) solution was added and cells were incubated for 5–10 min at 4 °C (Vindelov et al. 1983). Ploidy analysis was analyzed with singlet discrimination to detect PI-stained mononuclear cells.Assessment of cell growth Cell growth of the leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1, was determined by counting the cells. DB-1 cells were seeded (5 × 105 cells/well) in 6-well plates. At each time point, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 days) the medium was aspirated from three plates and the cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA. Live cells were assessed by trypan blue exclusion and counted on a hemacytometer.Antibody phenotyping of macrophage cell lines and flow cytometry Macrophage cell line (DB-1), peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages were probed with antibodies specific for the following surface markers: CD11b, F4/80, MAC-2, Ly6G (e-Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and Ly6C (BD Pharmigen, San Diego, CA, USA) after culture for at least 24 h. Appropriate isotype controls were used for each antibody as the negative control for FACS analysis. Briefly, macrophages were recovered and plated at 1 × 105 cells per well of 96-well tissue culture plates. Fc receptors were blocked by incubating the cells with 50 % goat serum (Atlanta Biologicals) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Antibodies and respective isotype controls were added at the appropriate concentrations and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with Hank’s buffered salt solution (HBSS). Cells were transferred to 12 × 75-mm polystyrene tubes (Falcon), washed once with HBSS and resuspended in 200 μl of 1 % formalin/HBSS. The cells were placed on ice and amount of staining of each marker was assessed by flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur analytical flow cytometer (Becton Dickson, San Jose, CA, USA) measuring 5,000 events per sample. Data analysis was performed with WinList software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA). The amount of staining of each marker was assessed after subtracting the percent positively stained cells in the isotype control groups.Giemsa staining of metaphase chromosomes 5 × 106 DB-1 cells were allowed to attach for 8 h in a 100-mm tissue culture plate. Cells were washed and incubated with 10 μg/ml of colchicine (Colcemid, GIBCO-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) overnight. Cells were dispersed with trypsin/EDTA as described above, added to 5 ml of PBS and were centrifuged at 350×g for 5 min. PBS was removed and the pellet was loosened by gently flicking the base of the tube and 2 ml of freshly made 0.l M KCL were added to the loosened pellet in a drop-by-drop fashion. Two additional ml of 0.1 M KCL were added and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. Cells were fixed with methanol and acetic acid (3:1) by adding 10 drops of fixative (room temperature) to the cell suspension and incubating at 23 °C for 10 min. Cells were gently pelleted at 300×g for 5 min and 2 ml of fixative were added to the cells. Cells were resuspended in fixative and were immediately dropped onto tilted glass slides 3–6 drops per slide to optimize cell spreads. Slides were air dried and stained with a 1:50 dilution of Giemsa stain (KaryoMax Giemsa Stain, GIBCO-Life Technologies). Slides were washed by sequential dipping in PBS and water. Cells were air dried, mounted with permount (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ, USA) and viewed on a compound microscope and imaged. 50 cells in apparent metaphase arrest were scored for chromosome number and one representative cell was analyzed and presented.Cytokine secretion Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using DB-1 macrophage supernatants. DB-1 macrophages were seeded in a 24-well plate (1 × 105 cells/well) and cells were stimulated with IFN-γ (10 U/ml) for 4 h and/or LPS (15 µg/ml) overnight. Supernatants were then collected, centrifuged at 350g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and IL-6 cytokine concentrations were determined from freshly collected supernatants.Phagocytosis assays Bone marrow-derived, peritoneal and DB-1 macrophages that were in culture for at least 24 h. were dispersed with trypsin/EDTA, recovered, and 1 × 106 cells were seeded per well in 24-well tissue culture plates. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 8 % CO2 for 2 h. Cytochalasin D from Zygosporium mansonii (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the negative control plates to inhibit phagocytosis. These plates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h to further inhibit phagocytosis. Experimental plates were kept at 37 °C. Red fluorescent beads (diameter, 0.2 μm; Invitrogen) were added to each well to a final concentration of 0.1 %. Phagocytosis was stopped after 60 min by centrifuging the 24-well plates at 350×g for 5 min, removing the supernatant, and washing twice with PBS. The cells were transferred to 12 × 75-mm polystyrene tubes (Falcon), washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of 1 % formalin/PBS. The cells were placed on ice and phagocytosis was assessed by flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur analytical flow cytometer (Becton Dickson) and measuring 10,000 events per sample. The percentage of phagocytosis in the experimental groups was assessed after subtracting the percentage phagocytosis of the negative control treatment group.Activation of DB-1 with rm-IFNγ To determine whether DB-1 macrophages respond to IFN-γ in the same fashion as primary macrophages, the DB-1 cells were stimulated with IFN-γ, and expression of nos2 was assessed using qRT-PCR. Briefly, primary WT, db/db and DB-1 macrophages were plated separately in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well and incubated with or without IFN-γ (100 U/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 16 h. RNA was collected using TRI reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and further purified with DNAse using the E.Z.N.A Total RNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA). Gene expression of nos2 ( number 18126) was quantified using qRT-PCR with the following primers: nos2 forward, 5′-CTG CTG GTG GTG ACA AGC ACA TTT-3′; nos2 reverse, 3′-ATG TCA TGA GCA AAG GCG CAG AAC-5′. Actb was quantified using the previously mentioned primers. Fold change in transcript level of each cell type was quantified using the Pfaffl method (2001) as described above. For nitric oxide (nitrite determinations), cells were incubated overnight in 0, 1, 10 and 100 U/ml of IFN-γ. Nitrite concentrations were determine in the supernatant 16 h. later as described previously (Mordica et al. 2009).Adipocyte collection and conditioned-medium preparation Adipocytes from epididymal and inguinal fat pads of obese and lean male C57BL/6 mice were collected in cell culture medium, pooled and minced into small pieces. Tissue was digested in Krebs–Ringer Buffer (KRB) containing 1 mg/ml type II collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) in an orbital shaker for 40 min at 37 °C. The digested tissue was filtered through nylon cell strainers (100 µm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA, USA), washed with KRB, and separated by centrifugation for 1 min at 350×g. The floating adipocytes were collected and cultured in DMEM at 37 °C, 8 % CO2 for 24 h. The adipocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) containing all factors released by the adipocytes was collected and used for migration experiments with thioglycollate elicited peritoneal and cell line DB-1 macrophages. Control medium (CM) was obtained using the same protocol but without adding adipocytes. Media were stored at −80 °C until use.Migration assay Wild-type peritoneal macrophages were collected as described above and suspended in serum-free culture medium. Cells were placed in the upper chamber of a 5 μm polystyrene filter (6-transwell format; Corning, Lowell, MA, USA). Cells were left to adhere for 3 h; at which point medium in the lower chamber was replaced with either medium (CM, negative control), CM supplemented with 10 ng/ml rm-leptin (ACM), or CM supplemented with 2 µM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, positive control). After 3 h of incubation, cells that had not migrated and remained in the upper chamber were removed by gently swiping the filters with cotton swabs. Filters were fixed in 2 % ethanol for 5 min. Cells located on the lower side of the filter were stained with Diff-Quick (Dade Diagnostics, Aguada, PR, USA), and counted as migrated cells. These cells were quantified from 5 to 10 fields/condition and cell type.Statistical analysis Results are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise specified. ANOVA analysis was performed and least significant differences (LSD) were calculated when appropriate. Analysis was done using SPSS software for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was determined at p value <0.05.Results Establishment of DB-1 cell line We established an immortal leptin receptor-deficient cell line from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow cells from leptin receptor deficient mice (db/db) were collected and cultured in biomedium as described in the Materials and Methods section. Differentiated macrophages were passaged at confluency. Cells were kept in biomedium for 6 months when the cells appeared to grow at a stable rate after twenty passages. At that time, we did two consecutive limiting dilution cloning procedures. The DB-1 cells were selected from cloned cells from the second cloning. DB-1 cells lost their dependency to M-CSF during the cloning process. They were propagated and shifted to a regular medium, DMEM supplemented with 2 % Nu serum and 2 % FBS. DB-1 cells exhibit morphological properties characteristic of macrophages, and are adherent with multiple processes (Fig. 1). To confirm the genotype of the DB-1 cells as leptin-receptor deficient, we used qRT-PCR to confirm the absence of LepR. Similarly to primary peritoneal db/db macrophages, DB-1 had low levels of Lepr transcripts, and expression ranged from 0.1 to 12 % of WT macrophages (p < 0.05, Table 1). Fig. 1.

The DB-1 cell line was homogenous consisting of diploid cells, of which 90–95 % cells were in G1 phase, 3–9 % in G2 phase and 0–2 % in S phase (Fig. 2a, b). 50 metaphase-stage cells (See Fig. 2c for an example) were analyzed for chromosome number and 49 out of 50 cells examined contained the normal complement of 38 chromosomes with one X and one Y chromosome (Fig. 2d); confirming the origin of the cells from a male mouse.

Cell growth plateaued after 4–5 days and the cells became contact inhibited and remained stable for as long as 3 weeks, which was the longest we ran the experiment. The slow growth rate along with the growth arrest at confluency is consistent with a cell line that is non-transformed and contact inhibited (Schuler et al. 1977) but it is unclear how these cells became immortalized. The fact that most cells are in the G1 phase of the cell cycle is consistent with the quiescent nature of the cells. Detailed sequencing of the DB-1 cell genome will be necessary to determine possible causes but these analyses are beyond the scope of this study. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Growth of DB-1 cells. Cell growth was assayed at 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, days after seeding of 5 × 105 DB-1 cells in 6-well plates. Cells were counted as described in the “Materials and methods” section. Each time point value is the mean of two independent experiments ± SD, 3 replicates per experimentCell surface phenotype To verify that DB-1 cells were in the monocyte/macrophage lineage, we compared their cell surface molecule phenotype to primary peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 4a, b). Primary macrophages had similar levels of F4/80 and MAC-2, regardless of their expression of LepR (Fig. 4b). Bone marrow-derived macrophages had less expression of CD11b and higher expression of Ly6C compared to the peritoneal macrophages. All cell types, including the DB-1 macrophages had minimal expression of Ly6G, the granulocyte marker, on their surface. DB-1 macrophages displayed MAC-2 in similar amounts as both bone marrow-derived and peritoneal WT and db/db macrophages. In contrast, F4/80 was minimally expressed and CD11b was not expressed at all in DB-1 macrophages. Ly6C was expressed by DB-1 macrophages at an intermediate level between that of the bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4b). These data suggest that the DB-1 macrophages are in the macrophage lineage (Leenen et al. 1990) with high MAC2 expression, lower expression of F4/80 and low levels of Ly6C (Geissmann et al. 2010).

Analysis were performed using one-way ANOVA and Tuckey for post hoc testPhagocytic activity To assess whether DB-1 cells display functional macrophage characteristics, we measured the phagocytic activity of DB-1 cells and compared this to that of primary macrophages. We found that all five cell-types—including the DB-1 macrophages—had similar phagocytic indices based on a 1-h phagocytosis assay (Fig. 5, p > 0.05). Fig. 5.

Data represent means ± SD, from one or two independent experiments, n = 3–6 replicates per experiment, each n from one or a pool of 2 miceDB-1 activation To test whether DB-1 macrophages respond to a stimulus in a similar fashion as primary macrophages, DB-1 macrophages were stimulated with IFN-γ and transcript levels of Nos2 were quantified. We found that Nos2 transcript levels were higher after IFN-γ treatment with levels similar to peritoneal db/db macrophages (p < 0.05, Table 2). Consistent with transcriptional activation, they also secreted 15, 66 and 131 uM of nitrite in response to 1, 10 and 100 U/ml of IFN-γ, respectively. We also found that DB-1 macrophages secreted 155 ± 48, 385 ± 38 and 538 ± 192 pg/ml of IL-6 in response to LPS, LPS + IFNγ or IFNγ treatments, respectively, compared to low (0 pg/ml) secretion by unstimulated cells.

We found that DB-1 macrophages were activated to migrate when activated with 10 μl of PMA (10 μg/ml; positive control, p < 0.05), but that they failed to respond to the chemotactic signals from the ACM as well as the medium supplemented with leptin (Fig. 6). On the other hand, primary WT macrophages had a significant increase in migration when cultured with either the ACM or leptin (p < 0.01; comparison to medium alone) with no statistically significant difference between the two media (p > 0.05; Fig. 6); suggesting that most of the ACM chemotactic potential is mediated by leptin, and dependent on the presence of a functional LepR. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Migration assay of WT peritoneal (PEC) and DB-1 macrophages. In the transwell system the lower chamber was supplemented with control medium (CM), adipocyte conditioned medium (ACM), CM supplemented with 10 ng/ml rm-leptin. To show that DB-1 cells could respond chemotactic stimuli not dependent on the LepR, DB-1 macrophages were stimulated with CM supplemented with 2 µM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA).

Open in a new tab Placement of DB-1 macrophage cells in the macrophage lineage. The high expression of MAC2 antigen the low expression of F4/80 and Ly6C antigens and the absence of CD11b and Ly6G molecules suggest that DB-1 macrophage cells are early in macrophage differentiationDiscussion We created a leptin-receptor deficient cell line, DB-1, that has some phenotypic and functional properties characteristic of primary macrophages. It is diploid, has the normal complement of chromosomes, lacks the long isoform of the leptin receptor, and is unresponsive to leptin. DB-1 cells are in the macrophage lineage based on their selection in macrophage colony stimulating factor over several months’ time and because of their phenotypic properties. Indeed, the DB-1 cells have many of the characteristics of ex vivo bone marrow-derived macrophages, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal WT and primary leptin receptor-deficient macrophages, which the DB-1 cells are hoped to replace in assays. However, their phenotypes are not completely consistent with mouse bone marrow derived macrophages that have been differentiated for 7 days in M-CSF (Leenen et al. 1994b). Although the DB-1 cells exhibit higher levels of MAC-2 expression and lower levels of Ly6G, indicative of cells in the macrophage lineage (Leenen et al. 1994a), the low expression of F4/80, CD11b and Ly6C would indicate that the cells may be less differentiated. Bone marrow-derived, primary macrophages from LepR knock-out mice had a phenotype similar to wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages. Therefore, it appears that in response to M-CSF, the bone marrow stem cells began to differentiate into macrophages. MAC2 was the first of these surface molecules to be expressed. Under normal circumstances, the differentiating cells would go on to express F4/80 and Ly6C by 7 days of stimulation with M-CSF (See Fig. 7). DB-1 macrophages don’t appear to have reached that stage. Macrophages that extravasate into the peritoneal cavity lose expression of Ly6C and go from low expression of CD11b to high expression of the molecule. DB-1 also do not have that phenotype; suggesting that DB-1 cells are early differentiated macrophages (Chan et al. 1998; Geissmann et al. 2010) (Fig. 7). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the DB-1 macrophages are responsive to IFN-γ and LPS stimuli; a property of macrophages (MacMicking et al. 1997). The strong phagocytic activity of the DB-1 cells supports that these cells are in the macrophage lineage as well (Leenen et al. 1986). In our study, the LepR did not appear to contribute to macrophage phagocytosis. The lack of the leptin gene (Lep) as well as Lepr have been associated with an enhanced susceptibility to infections and a higher mortality rate in rodents following bacterial infection (Ikejima et al. 2005; Mancuso et al. 2002; Ordway et al. 2008; Park et al. 2009). This increased risk of infection has been attributed to a decrease in phagocytic and bactericidal activity of ob/ob and db/db macrophages in vitro (Loffreda et al. 1998; Mancuso et al. 2002; Park et al. 2009). The difference in phagocytic activity between our DB-1 macrophages and that of ob/ob and db/db primary macrophages evaluated in other studies might be explained by the fact that we used inert fluorescent beads in our study compared to actual infectious agents (Loffreda et al. 1998; Mancuso et al. 2002; Park et al. 2009). However, we found that DB-1 macrophages’s ability to phagocytose fluorescent Ehrlichia chaffeensis bacteria was comparable to that of primary macrophages (data not shown). Therefore, the difference between our study and data presented by others may be due to other physiological factors such as a compromised oxidative response (Hsu et al. 2007) in immune cells or inefficient leukotriene production (Mancuso et al. 2002); products that were compromised in primary db/db and ob/ob macrophages. It is also possible that physiological factors associated with diabetes such as hyperglycemia may have an impact. Park et al. (2009) showed similar infection rates in mice between 8–11 week-old db/db mice and WT controls but older (20 weeks and more) db/db mice were significantly more susceptible to S. aureus infection. The DB-1 cells would not be subject to the physiological regulation of the in vivo macrophages because they are maintained in vitro. Obesity is associated with an increase in inflammatory macrophage recruitment to the expanding fat mass (Weisberg et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003). Studies have recognized MCP-1 as the major adipocyte-derived chemokine responsible for this effect (Kanda et al. 2006; Weisberg et al. 2006). Nevertheless, recent studies have questioned this chemokine’s role in the enhanced recruitment of macrophages into the adipose tissue of obese mice (Inouye et al. 2007). Leptin is another candidate adipokine/chemokine that might be responsible for this recruitment effect. Indeed, our data show that ACM as well as leptin-supplemented media have the same positive chemotactic effect on WT macrophages. Our DB-1 cell line, which lacks the functional LepR, failed to respond to both leptin-supplemented as well as adipocyte-conditioned media although our cell line responded to PMA. The differences between the WT macrophages and the DB-1 cells in their responsiveness to leptin can be directly attributed to the absence of LepR on the DB-1 cells which supports the studies of Gruen et al. (2007), who have shown leptin‘s chemotactic effects at levels as low as 1 pg/ml and illustrates their value in investigating the impact of the LepR in macrophage function. In an era characterized by increasing obesity rates (Ogden et al. 2006), it is of central importance that the immunological consequences of excessive body weight be further elucidated. The newly established DB-1 cell line can serve as an important and reliable tool to study the link between leptin and innate immune function. For example, future studies on the impact of LepR on antigen processing, cell trafficking or the recruitment of other inflammatory cells can be done either in vitro or in vivo. Because the cells are contact inhibited and do not appear to be tumorigenic, we can envision adoptive transfer studies similar to what were done with the C2D macrophage cell line (Ortega et al. 2011; Xie et al. 2010). These cells will be useful to any study investigating the role of the leptin receptor in cell function.Acknowledgments This project has been supported by the American Heart Association Grant 0950036G,  Grants AI088070, RR17686, RR17708, NASA grant NNX08BA91G and The Kansas State Agricultural Experiment Station.

Keywords: Immunoglobulin Gene Use, Next Generation Sequencing, BioinformaticsINTRODUCTION For B cell development and specificity, there are a large number of heavy chain (IgH) and kappa light chain (Igκ) gene segments that are used to produce the Ig (antibody) receptor population repertoire (de Bono et al., 2004). This antibody repertoire is quite large and the possible specificities can theoretically exceed the number of actual antibody molecules in the host (Georgiou et al., 2014). In antibodies, the antigen binding region is formed by six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that loop out from the V region backbone formed by two beta-pleated sheets (Haidar et al., 2014; Saul and Poljak, 1992). The germline V gene segment repertoire is necessary for host responses to pathogens and CDR1 and CDR2 are completely encoded for by variable (V region) gene segments (Lu et al., 2014). Therefore, knowing which V gene segments are utilized is fundamental to understanding B-cell specificity and the development of effective immune responses. The CDR3 of both the heavy and light chains are highly variable due to their unique generation. During the creation of each Ig sequence, partially random splicing between V, D (heavy chain), and J gene segments occurs and random base insertions occur, called “n-nucleotide” additions. One hypothesis is that V gene segments have been maintained in the genome because of their importance in binding specific pathogens and provide essential host defense functions. However, CDR3 may be important because it is highly variable. Its role as a highly diverse and variable region is what provides the essential key to determining antigen specificity (Xu and Davis, 2000). The spaceflight environment can impact many parameters critical to the host immune response. In multiple species spaceflight affects the total body, thymus and spleen mass (Allebban et al., 1996; Chapes et al., 1999; Congdon et al., 1996; Durnova et al., 1976; Grindeland et al., 1990; Grove et al., 1995; Jahns et al., 1992; Nash and Mastro, 1992; Pecaut et al., 2000; Serova, 1980; Udden et al., 1995; Wronski et al., 1998), circulating corticosterone (Blanc et al., 1998; Chapes et al., 1999; Lesnyak et al., 1993; Meehan et al., 1993; Merrill et al., 1992; Stein and Schluter, 1994; Stowe et al., 2001a; Stowe et al., 2001b; Stowe et al., 1999; Wronski et al., 1998), mitogen-induced proliferation, cytokine production and reactivity (Bikle et al., 1994; Chapes et al., 1999; Cogoli et al., 1990; Fuchs and Medvedev, 1993; Gould et al., 1987; Grigoriev et al., 1993; Hughes-Fulford, 1991; Konstantinova et al., 1973; Lesnyak et al., 1996; Lesnyak et al., 1993; Mandel and Balish, 1977; Miller et al., 1995; Nash et al., 1992; Nash and Mastro, 1992; Sonnenfeld et al., 1998; Sonnenfeld et al., 1992; Sonnenfeld et al., 1990; Stein and Schluter, 1994; Taylor and Dardano, 1983; Taylor et al., 1986), and lymphocyte subpopulation distributions (Allebban et al., 1994; Berry, 1970; Ichiki et al., 1996; Meehan et al., 1992; Pecaut et al., 2000; Sonnenfeld et al., 1998; Sonnenfeld et al., 1992). B cells are among the immune components that are affected by spaceflight. The number of B cells in the spleen was reduced in mice flown on the space shuttle flight, STS-35 (Gridley et al., 2009). The percentage of B cells in the bone marrow and spleen also is reduced in mice subjected to hindlimb unloading (Gaignier et al., 2014; Lescale et al., 2015). When rats were injected with sheep red blood cells 8 days prior to an 18.5-day COSMOS flight there were lower IgG concentrations compared to both immunized and non-immunized ground controls after landing (Lesnyak et al., 1993). IgM production was virtually eliminated in lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) on the International Space Station (ISS) when compared to similarly activated ground controls. Furthermore, when cells were activated on Earth, frozen down, and then put back into suspension in space to assess IgM secretion, Fitzgerald et al. found that IgM secretion was significantly slower than similarly treated ground-based controls (Fitzgerald et al., 2009). Our group is interested in the impact of spaceflight on B-cell immunoglobulin gene usage. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) now allows us to analyze the repertoire of Ig gene segments that are used in the assembly of immunoglobulins that are transcribed by B cells and that are present in the host. NGS allows the determination of V, D and J gene usage, CDR3 assembly and the assessment of mutations that occur in response to immune challenge. In microgravity, there exist certain limitations associated with tissue collection and storage methods traditionally used on the ground. In preparation for sending mice to the ISS our group needed to validate our procedures and our ability to obtain high-quality RNA that could be used for NGS for the assessment of Ig gene usage. Our group also sought to validate the usage of RNA extracted from whole tissue collected and stored with these limitations in mind. It was also necessary to develop a workflow that would facilitate the analysis of large amounts of data that would be generated during this project. In this manuscript, we describe the development of our workflow and validation of mouse NGS data for use with space flight experiments.MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation and RNA Extraction Spleens were removed from four 11-week-old, specific pathogen-free, female C57BL/6J mice housed in the Division of Biology vivarium at Kansas State University. One-half of each spleen was homogenized with a 70 µM sieve to generate a single-cell suspension designated, “cells”. Spleen cells were pelleted at 350 × g and were resuspended in 5 mL of ice-cold ACK lysing buffer (155mM NH4Cl, 10mM KHC03, 0.1mM EDTA) to lyse red blood cells. After five minutes, 10 mL of ice-cold isotonic medium was added to the suspension and cells were again pelleted at 350 × g and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in Trizol LS (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for RNA extraction. The remaining spleen half was immediately placed into Trizol LS for RNA extraction, and designated “tissue”. RNA extraction was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNAsin (40 units) was added to each RNA aliquot and stored in −80°C. RNA quality was assessed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).MiSeq Sequencing One microgram of high-quality total RNA was used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) library construction using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the following modification: one minute fragmentation time was applied to allow for longer RNA fragments. The obtained RNA-seq libraries were analyzed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer. The tissue sample described previously was then subjected to size selection and designated “size selected”. Selection of sequences 375–900 nucleotides (nt) in length (275–800 nt sequences plus 50 nt sequencing adaptors on each end of the cDNA) was performed using the Pippin Prep system (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). All libraries were then quantified with qPCR according to Illumina recommendations. The sequencing was performed at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility on the MiSeq personal sequencing system (Illumina) using the 600 cycles MiSeq reagent v3 kit (Illumina) according to Illumina instructions, resulting in 2 × 300 nt reads.MiSeq Reference Mapping The bioinformatics workflow used in our study is outlined in Figure 1. FASTQ sequencing files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v9.5.1 (CLC bio, Aaarhus, Denmark) (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/). Data were cleaned in the CLC program to remove low quality and short sequences. Due to Illumina sequencing artifacts, the first 12 nt were removed from each sequence. Sequences were quality cleaned by retaining the longest region of the sequences with at least 97% of the sequence with Phred scores over 20. Sequences with fewer than 40 nt were removed. Reads remained with paired-end sequences, designated “paired”, and, in cases of overlapping sequence pairs, reads were merged, designated as “merged” (Figure 1a, light blue line). Sequences were merged using a match score of +1, mismatch cost of −2, a gap cost of −3, and a minimum score of 10. Cleaned paired (Figure 1a, purple lines) and merged (Figure 1a, red lines) sequences were mapped to specific C57BL/6 V gene sequences obtained from  for the immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (Igκ) chains. The paired and merged sequences were mapped using a match score of +1 and a mismatch score of −2. Additional putative antibody sequences were obtained by mapping sequences to the IgH and Igκ loci and the whole genome using the same scores. Mapped MiSeq sequences were combined and submitted to ImMunoGeneTics’s (IMGT) High-V Quest (Figure 1a, green lines) (Alamyar et al., 2012). Functionally productive heavy chain sequences were imported into CLC and constant regions were determined using a motif search for the first 20 nt in each constant region that are provided in Table 1 (dashed line). Motifs were reassociated with their original sequences in Microsoft Excel for complete antibody (V[D]JC) identification. While two IgG subclass motifs were used to identify IgGs, they share partial sequence homology, therefore all IgG subclasses were combined resulting in an overarching IgG isotype. Kappa chain sequences were processed directly (Figure 1a, dotted line). Figure 1. Bioinformatic analysis workflows.

Failure to remove these duplicated sequences would lead to incorrect frequency assessments. Figure 2 outlines the procedure for duplicate sequencing read removal. Sequences were identified by their original MiSeq identification numbers for sorting. To retain the sequence with the most information and most accurate mapping, sequences were assessed based on functionality, constant region identification, V region score, and strand. Only one sequence per MiSeq identification number was retained and used for subsequent data compilation. Data from the remaining productive and unknown functionality antibody sequences were compiled for V, D (IgH only), and J gene segment usage, CDR3 length, and CDR3 amino acid (AA) composition. Figure 2. Decision-making matrix to remove duplicate sequence reads after IMGT processing. Open in a new tab Mapped sequences that were identified using Illumina sequence identification tags and sequences identified multiple times were removed as outlined.HiSeq Reference Mapping The MiSeq workflow described above was modified to analyze mouse liver transcriptomic data from the Rodent Research 1 (RR1) NASA validation flight provided by the NASA GeneLab program (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/, Accession Numbers: GLDS-47, GLDS-48). These data include sequences from the livers of ground control and flight mice from two separate cohorts, CASIS (GLDS-47) and NASA (GLDS-48), that were generated using Illumina HiSeq (1 × 50 nt reads). Raw sequencing reads were imported into CLC and quality cleaned as described with the exception of short read removal as quality cleaned reads were below the threshold utilized in the original workflow (Figure 1b). Reads were then mapped to the Vκ references identified above. Total Vκ mapping counts were collected and analyzed in Excel.MiSeq and HiSeq Genome Mapping FASTQ files were imported into CLC and quality cleaned as described previously (Figure 1c). MiSeq reads were merged as described previously (Figure 1c, blue arrow). Paired and merged MiSeq and unpaired HiSeq reads (Figure 1c, purple arrow) were mapped using the RNA-Seq tool in CLC to the current mouse reference genome (GRCm38). A match score of +1, a mismatch score of −2, and insertion and deletion scores of −3 were used to map reads to the genome. Due to the short read lengths of the HiSeq data, V gene segment usage was compiled directly after the RNA-Seq analysis (Figure 1c, green arrow). For MiSeq data, reads were collected, submitted to IMGT, duplicates removed and usage statistics compiled as described above (Figure 1c, dashed box).NASA RNA Preparation and Sequencing Tissues from two sets of mice were analyzed. The first set of spleens and livers were removed from five 35-week-old female C57BL/6Tac mice aboard the ISS 21–22 days after launch (CASIS Flight, SpaceX-4). Five 35-week old female mice housed in the ISS Environmental Simulator were processed similarly with a four-day delay (CASIS Ground Controls) (Figliozi, 2014). Spleens and livers were placed in RNALater (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) for at least 24 hours at 4°C and then stored at −80°C while aboard the ISS, during transport, and upon return to Earth. The second set of tissues were isolated from seven 21-week-old female C57BL/6J were euthanized aboard the ISS 37 days post launch (NASA Flight, SpaceX-4). Carcasses were immediately frozen (−80°C) and after arriving at Earth, were dissected. Livers were preserved in RNALater for at least 24 hours at 4°C and then frozen at −80°C. RNA was extracted from the tissues using Trizol (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resultant RNA was then processed through an RNeasey mini column (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was assessed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and stored at −80°C. RNA was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq with single reads of 50nt (1× 50nt).RESULTS Size Selection Yields Highest Number of Antibody Sequences Most studies of Ig gene-segment use frequency have used single-cell suspensions or sorted to isolate specific cell populations (Aoki-Ota et al., 2012; Collins et al., 2015; Kaplinsky et al., 2014; Kramer et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2014). The advantage of these preparations is the exclusion of extraneous tissues and cells, which can enhance recovery of Ig sequences. Our goal was to assess Ig gene segment usage in mice housed on the ISS. Due to limitations of animal and tissue handling on the ISS, only whole tissues would be available for analysis. To determine if we could obtain a sufficient number of Ig sequences from alternative sample preparations, we examined the total Ig sequence results from three different RNA preparation and sequencing treatment groups. The first two treatment groups comprised of RNA prepared from cells or whole tissue. A third treatment group was the same RNA from the tissue, which was subsequently size selected at 275–800 nt and sequenced independently. We selected this range of lengths because the IgH VDJ recombination sequences are generally require 350–450 nt to gather information on V/D/J/C usage. Size selection also allows us to eliminate the inherent Illumina bias for short reads, while maintaining total transcriptome integrity for later data mining purposes. Total sequence numbers generated were similar among the treatment groups with the cells treatment group resulting in 23.9 million reads, tissue treatment group with 25.9 million, and size selected treatment group with 21.5 million reads, as shown in Table 2. After cleaning, 18.7 million reads remained in the cells treatment group, 20.3 million in the tissue treatment group, and 12 million in the size selected group (Table 2). Mapping was performed as described in the materials and methods for both the IgH and Igκ loci and VH- and Vκ-gene segments. Locus mapping returned higher levels of probable Ig sequences than V-gene segment specific mapping. V-gene segment IgH- and Igκ-mapped sequences were lowest in the cells treatment group (1.56% IgH and 1.38% Igκ) and highest in the size selected treatment group (3.1% IgH and 1.99% IGκ). Table 2. Sequencing and mapping results from the cells, tissue, and size selected treatment groups.

Unknown functionality sequences were comprised of partial sequences lacking CDR3 information to determine functionality. The total number of antibody sequences obtained for the IgH and Igκ was lowest in the cells treatment group and highest in the size selected treatment group, (Table 2) mirroring the V-gene segment mapping results. Both productive and unknown IgH and Igκ antibody sequence counts were also lowest in the cells treatment group and highest in the size selected treatment group. This trend also described Igκ sequences, with more unknown than productive sequences being identified. The size selected treatment group produced both the highest number of productive antibody sequences and the highest total number of identified Ig sequences among treatment groups.Comparison of Immunoglobulin Gene Segment Usage Among Treatment Groups We compared IgH and Igκ gene segment frequency using multiple metrics across all three treatment groups; the first of which is V gene segment usage. To assess the frequency of each VH- and Vκ- gene segment in normal mouse spleen, the total frequency of each V-gene segment was tabulated in Figures 3 and 4 as a percentage of the total repertoire for our cells, tissue, and size selected treatment groups. VH-gene segment usage was similar among all three treatment groups (Figure 3A). V-gene segment V1–80 was detected most frequently, followed by V1–18, and V1–26 gene segments. The gene segment V1–80 was ranked either first or third as a percentage of the total repertoire in all three treatment groups (Figure 3B). The gene segment V1–18 ranged between the first and third most frequently used gene segment. V1–26 was the second to fifth most frequently used VH-gene segment. While gene frequency detection rankings among cells, tissue and size selected treatment groups were not identical, there was high similarity in overall VH-gene segment detection and in repertoire usage. Correlations between treatment groups produced an R2 of at least 0.7562 (p<0.0001, data not shown) between the cells and size selected treatment groups. The R2 between cells and tissue treatment group was higher (R2=0.8149, p<0.0001, data not shown). Tissue and size selected treatment groups had the highest correlation (R2= 0.9645, p<0.0001 data not shown). Figure 3. Top ten VH gene segments used among treatment groups.

(B) Top ten VH gene segments are listed by rank order (most frequent to least frequent). Dark red indicates higher rank moving to white, of lower rank. VH-gene segments with identical ranks are displayed as ties.Figure 4. Top ten Vк used among treatment groups.

(B) The top ten Vк gene segments are listed by rank order (most frequent to least frequent). Dark red indicates higher rank moving to white, lower rank. VH-gene segments with identical ranks are displayed as ties.Kappa chain V-gene segment usage was also compared among the different treatment groups. Figure 4 shows the percent of repertoire for the top ten most abundant Vκ gene-segments of each treatment group. There was significant overlap in the top Vκ of each treatment group when assessed as either percent of repertoire detected (Figure 4A) or when ranked from highest to lowest frequency (Figure 4B). Greater similarities in Vκ existed between tissue and tissue size selected treatments. Correlations between Vκ in treatment groups produced an R2 of at least 0.7813 (p<0.0001, data not shown), with tissue and size selected treatment groups having the highest correlation (R2=0.8335, p<0.0001, data not shown). The frequency of D- and JH-gene segment use in normal mice was also assessed. Figure 5 shows that the cells, tissue and size selected D- and JH-gene-segment usage frequency was similar. D1-1 was the most frequently discovered D-gene segment in all three treatment groups, comprising almost 30% of the repertoire (Figure 5A). Due to the short length of the D gene, it was often difficult to properly determine which D gene was used in an antibody. When a D gene was identified, but was attributed to a non-strain-specific D gene, they were labeled “undetermined”. These D-gene segments were also very common, occurring between 26%-28% of the time, in all three treatment groups. Gene segments D2–4, D4-1, D-5, D2–3, and “no” D-gene (labeled NONE) were the next most frequent assignments, ranging from about six percent to eight percent of D-gene frequency. Figure 5.

(C) Jк gene segment usage by percent of repertoire. (D) Heavy chain constant region usage by percent of repertoire.We found that JH-gene segment usage was the same for the cells, tissue and size selected treatment groups (Figure 5B). JH2 was the most frequently used J-gene segment followed by JH1, JH4, and JH3, respectively. Gene segment usage in kappa chains was also similar in all three treatment groups, with Jκ1 as the most frequently used, followed by Jκ5, Jκ2 and Jκ4 respectively (Figure 5C). When less than six nucleotides from the J gene segment were identified, they were marked as <6 nt. Five heavy chains, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG (all subfamilies), and IgM are part of the normal mouse Ig repertoire. Almost 80% of the repertoire used the IgM constant region (Figure 5D). IgD, IgA, and IgG were detected at frequencies between three percent and twelve percent of the total repertoire and were evenly distributed among cells, tissue and size selected treatment groups. IgE was not detected in any of the treatment groups.CDR3 AA Sequence Determination CDR3 is highly variable and it may be critical in determining antigen specificity (Xu and Davis, 2000). Therefore, we assessed individual CDR3 frequency from each treatment group. The top five most common CDR3s from each treatment group for the heavy chain were compiled and shown in Figure 6A, resulting in a total of ten unique CDR3s among treatment groups. The tissue and size selected treatment groups contained all of the most common CDR3s, however, the cells treatment group lacked the CARGIYYGSYFDYW sequence, which ranked as the second most common in the tissue data set (Figure 6B). We detected one hundred sixty-four CDR3 AA sequences in all three data sets at least once (Figure 6C). The tissue and size selected treatment data sets shared 607 CDR3 sequences. Thirty-eight and 82 CDR3 AA sequences were shared between cells and tissue and cells and size selected treatment groups, respectively. Each treatment group data set also contained a large number of unique CDR3 reads. Figure 6. CDR3 AA sequence usage among treatment groups.

One CDR3 sequence was not found in all three datasets, CALWYSNHWF, however, all other top CDR3 sequences appeared in at least the top 42 CDR3 sequences of the other treatment groups (Figure 6E). Figure 6F shows the diversity of kappa chain CDR3 sequences. The total number of CDR3 amino acid sequences that were unique to each treatment groups was 957, 1454, and 2838 in cells, tissue, and tissue size selected treatment groups, respectively. Three-hundred and eighty-seven unique kappa chain CDR3 sequences are shared among all three treatment groups.Application of MiSeq Workflow to RR1 HiSeq Data The MiSeq workflow was adapted to process the liver Illumina HiSeq data from the RR1 validation flight. Due to short read length (38 nt), only V-gene segment usage was assessed. Due to low IgH read numbers, only Vκ information is presented. The Vκ percent of repertoire from each HiSeq RR1 mouse cohort (CASIS Ground, CASIS Flight, NASA Ground, and NASA Flight) was compared to the Vκ percent abundance of the cell, tissue, and size selected HiSeq datasets. Table 3 shows poor correlation between reference mapped RR1 HiSeq cohorts and the MiSeq datasets described in the previous section. As all mice represented in this comparison are C57BL/6 mice, though ages and experimental conditions varied, we were concerned that the lack of concurrence in Vκ gene-segment usage of the RR1 mice and those used in the workflow discussed above may reflect the bioinformatic treatment of the data. To test this hypothesis, we modified the workflow to map sequencing reads to the entire Mus musculus genome rather than mapping reads to Vκ reference sequences, as genome mapping is commonly employed in transcriptomics analysis. This bioinformatic treatment yielded a higher correlation with the MiSeq datasets. Table 3 shows that the distribution of Vκ percent abundance was dependent on the mapping technique used for the HiSeq datasets. Table 3. Comparison of mapping techniques in HiSeq datasets.

HiSeq datasets included sequencing data from CASIS and NASA ground (G) or flight (F) RR1 mice. The comparison groups are as follows: 2Vκ gene segment usage from reference-mapped HiSeq data versus Vκ gene segment usage of MiSeq sample preparation datasets. 3Vκ gene segment usage from genome-mapped HiSeq data versus Vκ gene segment usage of MiSeq sample preparation datasets. 4Vκ gene segment usage from reference-mapped HiSeq Data versus Vκ gene segment usage of genome-mapped HiSeq data. Reference/IgH Locus Mapping is Comparable to Whole Genome RNA-Seq Methods Because the data obtained from the HiSeq data set using reference mapping techniques were less correlative to Vκ gene use to our previously obtained MiSeq data for normal mice we were concerned that our initial bioinformatics techniques for MiSeq data may not be appropriate. To validate the accuracy of our bioinformatic treatments of the sequencing data that were submitted to IMGT, two different mapping methods were compared. The reference mapping approach, used previously, mapped sequences to both the IgH V-gene segments (251 segments) and the entire IgH locus (2.8Mb) obtained from  (NC_000078.6, 113258768 to 116009954) or Igκ V-gene segments (164 segments) and the entire Igκ locus (3.2Mb) obtained from  (NC_000072.6, 67555636 to 70726754). Therefore, we used the whole genome mapping outlined above to compare to our reference mapping. Results were obtained by using the RNA-Seq analysis tool in CLC to map reads to the entire genome with the IgH and Igκ loci selected for submission to IMGT. The IMGT output was processed similarly for both (genome vs. reference) mapping strategies. The median frequency of all VH- and Vκ-gene segments was compared if it was detected in at least one of the three treatment groups (cells, tissue or size-selected), and the data were compiled for both reference- and genome-mapping options. V-gene segments not detected in a treatment group were assigned a “zero” frequency. Assessment of the median frequencies of the two methods by linear regression in Figure 7 revealed that the frequency data for VH-gene segment usage was very similar regardless of the mapping technique (R2 = 0.9973, p = <0.0001) (Figure 7A). There was also a strong correlation of Vκ usage between the two methods (R2=0.9923, p<0.0001) (Figure 7B). Comparisons of D-gene segment, J-gene segment, constant region frequency and CDR3 lengths were also highly correlated using both techniques (data not shown). Therefore, we are confident that our reference mapping bioinformatics strategy is providing an accurate picture of V-gene usage. Figure 7.

Normal preparation methods such as the creation of single-cell suspensions are difficult and normal tissue preservations methods such as the use of liquid nitrogen are unavailable. In an effort to determine the acceptability of whole tissue preparations compared to more traditional single cell suspensions, we examined the differences in Ig sequences obtained from both treatment groups. We were concerned that tissue isolation methods may introduce artifacts into the data since many studies specifically focus on single cell suspensions; often sorted, to isolate B cells specifically (Greiff et al., 2014; Kaplinsky et al., 2014; Kramer et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2015). Our data indicate that comparable results were obtained from both the tissue and the cells treatment groups. There were strong correlations in V-gene usage and the CDR3 sequences identities were very similar. In an effort to reduce Illumina bias towards short reads seen in the cells and tissue treatment groups, ten months later, we sequenced the same tissue total RNA using size selection. This extended storage time after initial sequencing and additional freeze/thaw cycles are likely the cause of reduced numbers of post-cleaning reads due to RNA degradation. Nevertheless, the size-selected data set still provided the highest number of productive and unknown antibodies. Subsequent preparations have verified that size selection is helpful in providing the highest number of antibody sequences (data not shown). Therefore, we have chosen to include size selection in our protocol for NGS assessment of Ig V-gene usage. The antibody repertoires from numerous species have been analyzed using a variety of amplification, sequencing, and analysis techniques (Benichou et al., 2012; Greiff et al., 2014). We chose to assess Ig gene usage without using amplification. Although many studies use amplification in order to obtain a higher number of reads, this may lead to bias into the repertoire (Benichou et al., 2012; Georgiou et al., 2014). Bias may be introduced due to primers or to errors created during the PCR reaction (Benichou et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2014). The large number of primers needed to amplify all the V genes in mice also presents some obstacles. Some have used 5’ RACE with primers based on the constant region (Benichou et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2006). However, in order to amplify the entire repertoire, multiple 5’ RACE primers are required, which still increases the chances for primer bias and increases costs significantly. Our goal was to examine the breadth of the antibody repertoire by gathering information about V, D, J, constant region usage and CDR3 composition. The detected V-gene and CDR3 sequences appear to parallel the repertoires reported using more focused amplification methods. Therefore, we have a methodology for future studies that will examine the immune response to vaccination. During the course of our studies, we had the opportunity to work with both HiSeq and MiSeq data. While Illumina sequencing (HiSeq and MiSeq) produces a higher volume of sequence reads, they are shorter and more prone to errors than sequencing with 454 or Sanger methods (Benichou et al., 2012). However, Illumina sequencing has improved over time and is arguably now the NGS of choice. Our sequencing with Illumina MiSeq allowed us to obtain reads of up to 560 nt when forward and reverse sequencing ends were paired. This provides enough sequencing length to capture information from the V-gene segment to the constant region of both the heavy and light chains. We also found that as the sequences became longer, there was a drop off in sequencing quality, which has been previously reported (Minoche et al., 2011). Our workflow for Ig sequence isolation selected for sequences with the most information. This required the merging of overlapping read pairs to provide sequences long enough to identify the V, D, J, and constant regions. In order to collect the highest number of possible Ig sequences, we used multiple mapping techniques to both the V-gene segment and the locus in an effort to collect every possible Ig sequence. Preliminary workflow attempts found that each mapping technique isolated some unique sequences and that locus mapping resulted in a high number of “false positive” sequences. Subsequent sequence removal in Excel selected for antibodies containing the most data retaining productive antibodies with constant regions and high V-gene scores, a measure of the length and accuracy of match to the germline V gene segment. By utilizing multiple mapping methods and subsequent selection for the sequence with the most information, we are able to obtain a relatively large number of antibody sequences without introducing primer bias or PCR-induced sequencing errors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data set of tissue based, non-amplified MiSeq analysis of the antibody repertoire. While our results are not a direct technique match to other published data sets, our normal mouse V-gene usage is consistent with other’s findings. For example, Collins used 5’ RACE from the constant region followed by sequencing using 454 on a splenic cell suspension (Collins et al., 2015). Of the top ten VH-gene segments identified by Collins, we identified five of the same VH genes within our top ten most frequently detected. All except the V1–59 gene segment were among the highest contributors to our repertoire (Collins et al., 2015). In addition, JH-gene segment frequencies were also relatively uniform with the J2 gene segment as the most frequently used (Collins et al., 2015). Yang performed sequencing on cell sorted B cells isolated from the spleen followed by amplification with primers specific for many, but not all, of the V heavy chains of mice and constant region primers to amplify V, D, J and part of the constant region (Yang et al., 2015). Their PCR products were then sequenced on the Illumina platform and aligned to known VH-gene segments (Yang et al., 2015). They identified V1–26 as their most common V-gene segment, which ranked between the second and fifth most common V gene in our data sets. V-gene segments V1–82, V1–-64, and V1–55 were also identified as common V-gene segments in their analysis, all of which were frequently detected in our data (Yang et al., 2015). Kaplinski also examined sorted spleen cells, amplified with PCR and sequenced on MiSeq with 2 × 150 nt reads (Kaplinsky et al., 2014). Sequencing results were analyzed through idAB for identification (Kaplinsky et al., 2014). In contrast to our data analysis, Kaplinski examined only V gene segments found in productive antibodies, where we compiled all V gene segments identified in productive and unknown functionality sequences (Kaplinsky et al., 2014). Of the most common VH-gene segments provided, four, V1–80, V1–26, V1–53, and V1–82 were identified in our top ten grouping (Kaplinsky et al., 2014). Our data sets also isolated D1-1 as the most common D-gene segment. Kramer et al. examined sorted splenic follicular B cells, using IgM restricted PCR and sequenced using the Sanger method (Kramer et al., 2016). As we discovered, Kramer et al.’s most common VH family was V1, followed by V2 and V5 at relatively equal levels (Kramer et al., 2016). In contrast, we found that the V6 gene-segment family was detected at a higher level than found in the Kramer analysis (Kramer et al., 2016). The J4 gene segment was also used more than detected in our data set (Kramer et al., 2016). We both identified D1 and D2 as the most common D gene-segment families. We also compared our data to Igκ gene family usage. Aoki-Ota assessed skewed Vκ gene segment usage and V-J gene segment usage in unimmunized C57BL/6 mice using primer amplified total RNA of B cells from spleen, bone marrow and lymph node using 454 pyrosequencing (Aoki-Ota et al., 2012). Their sequencing data was analyzed using the  basic local alignment tool with reference sequences for Vκ and Jκ obtained from the IMGT data base. The top seven V gene segments identified in their study were also found to be among the most abundant Vκ gene segments in all of our treatment groups. Additionally, V-J pairing of their top gene segments paralleled our data. Lu examined the effects of primer bias and mouse to mouse variation in Vκ- and Jκ-gene segments and CDR3 regions using primer amplified total RNA isolates of Balb/c splenic B cells on the 454 pyrosequencing platform (Lu et al., 2014). As with our study, sequencing reads were submitted to the IMGT HighV-quest tool, however, only functionally productive immunoglobulins were used in their analysis (Lu et al., 2014). In spite of the strain differences between our studies, of the Vκ-gene segments representing over one-percent of the antibody repertoire reported by Lu et al., at least 80% of those gene segments appearing at a frequency 0.5% or higher in our analyses. Although there was not 100% agreement among our study and the others, there was a high degree of consistency. Variations in data may result from sequencing and tissue isolation techniques and natural variation among animals, including mouse strain. In addition, since we did not amplify for IgV gene segments, we likely may have missed rarer B cell clones. Primer biases in other studies may have also contributed to some of the differences. Nevertheless, it is clear that our approach provided an unbiased, representative sample of actively transcribing B cells. Our group utilized liver Rodent Research One sequencing data sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform (1 × 50 nt) that was available from the NASA Genelab project. The sequencing length was the largest limitation of these data. Our MiSeq data were sequenced in both directions at a length of 300 nt. Some paired-end reads also contained overlaps, allowing us to merge these sequences and provide reads up to around 560 nt. HiSeq sequencing reads were not of sufficient length to obtain CDR3 composition from the IMGT HighV-Quest tool, limiting the analyses that could be used to assess the antibody repertoire. Therefore, the applicability of publically available datasets to independent research questions is dependent upon the sequencing method used to acquire the data. For Ig gene repertoire studies, we recommend the use of sequencing methods that result in longer reads, though short reads may be useful for other research questions. Initial comparisons to assess similarity of the different mouse cohorts showed a lack of correlation between the HiSeq RR1 data to the normal mouse MiSeq Vκ usage. We thought that part of the discrepancy may be from problems with the short HiSeq sequences, specifically when forced to align to V-gene segments when multiple matches are excluded. Mapping short HiSeq reads to the entire mouse genome remedied the inconsistencies observed between RR1 and normal mouse MiSeq data, likely due to the limitations of the RNA-Seq analysis employed. This demonstrates that the bioinformatic treatment of the data can impact results. We found that mapping longer MiSeq sequencing reads from RNA isolated from mice within the CASIS ground RR1 cohort to both the whole mouse genome and Vκ reference sequences yielded a strong correlation. This validates the applicability of the MiSeq workflow described in this work on additional MiSeq datasets and reinforces that sequence read length must be taken into account when selecting bioinformatics methods. In conclusion, our goals for this project were to examine the breadth of the antibody repertoire gathering information about V, D, J, and constant region usage and CDR3 composition and to lay the foundation for future studies that will examine the immune response to vaccination during space flight. We have determined that whole tissue preparations as will be available from the ISS will yield similar results when examining the antibody repertoire. We also determined that performing a size selection to isolate likely antibody sequences provided the highest number of Ig reads. A novel workflow using multiple mapping methods to characterize NGS data for Ig repertoire data was developed and genome and reference mapping methods were validated through the use of publically available datasets. This novel workflow can be used for future studies on the antibody repertoire regardless of whether they are ISS- or ground-based.Acknowledgments This work was supported by NASA grants NNX13AN34G and NNX15AB45G,  grant GM103418, the Molecular Biology Core supported by the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University, and the Kansas State University Johnson Cancer Center.

    "abstract": "Abstract Antibody specificity and diversity are generated through the enzymatic splicing of genomic gene segments within each B cell. Antibodies are heterodimers of heavy- and light-chains encoded on separate loci. We studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presents a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.",
    "introduction": "Introduction B cells are an important part of the adaptive immune system, arising from hematopoietic stem cell precursors. These cells express surface immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors and secrete these same proteins as antibodies into the serum after differentiation into plasma cells [1, 2]. As B cells develop, they rearrange Variable- (V), Diversity- (D), and Joining- (J) gene segments, which combine with a constant region to form the antibody structure [3, 4]. Antibodies consist of heterodimers of heavy and light chains [4]. The heavy chain is formed from V-, D-, and J-gene segments combined with a constant region [5], while light chains lack a D-gene segment. [3, 6]. There are three complementarity determining regions (CDR). CDR1 and CDR2 are encoded in the V-gene segment. CDR3 consists of a combination of V-, (D-, heavy-chain), and J-gene segments [7]. Of the CDRs, CDR3 contributes the most to binding specificity. Antibodies are further characterized by the constant region, or isotype, which is influenced by the stage of B-cell development and antigen specificity [8]. The total collection of antibody specificities present within an individual is known as the antibody repertoire. Diversity of the antibody repertoire results from four main components: the initial germ line (inherited), diversity from recombination of that germline, the imprecisions during V(D)J recombination, and somatic mutations [9–11]. The antibody repertoire has been examined in many studies by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and fully mapped in the zebrafish [12]. Repertoires can serve as a fingerprint or snapshot of the current immune-system status and these types of data have been used to explore the development of host defense to infectious disease [13–18], cancer [19–22], autoimmune disease [23, 24], and early disease detection [25]. With the development of HTS, we are now able to detect the differences between or among B-cell repertoires such as B2 (adaptive antibodies) and B1 (natural antibodies) B cells [11] or memory and naïve repertoires [26, 27]. HTS has accelerated the characterization of the widely differing human Ig haplotypes [28–32], and strain-specific gene segment usage in mice [33]. Our long-term goals are to investigate the repertoire of B cells in mice in space and how it changes in response to antigen challenge. More specifically, our lab is interested antibody repertoire dynamics within the context of spaceflight. Due to the cost of these experiments, creating datasets that can be mined by our lab or others is important. The antibody repertoire is traditionally assessed through the amplification of Ig sequences that have been isolated from sorted B cell populations [34]. While these practices increase the likelihood of recovering rare Ig sequences and allow for the dissection of the antibody repertoire by B-cell populations, cell sorting may not be possible within the design of certain experiments. During the development of methodology to assess Ig-gene usage by mice subjected to space flight we performed multiple HTS runs to validate sample preparation, bioinformatic methodology, and reproducibility [35]. We also wanted some background data about the Ig repertoire in the normal B6 mouse population. Knowing that there can be significant mouse-to-mouse variability in the Ig repertoire [36, 61] and to minimize the impact any one mouse might have in the validation data set, we chose to pool multiple mice specifically for these validation experiments [35]. We now present these data on the splenic repertoire of conventionally housed, unimmunized, unchallenged, adult C57BL/6J mice.",

    "results": "Results VH- and Vκ-gene segment usage We obtained between 8,714 and 11,200 IgH individual productive reads, and between 14,271 and 28,756 individual IgH reads of unknown functionality as identified by IMGT HighV-Quest (Table 1). Between 11,968 and 18,643 individual Igκ productive, and 12,602 and 39,410 individual Igκ reads of unknown functionality were identified by IMGT HighV-Quest (Table 1). Overall, we identified 132 VH- and 109 Vκ-gene segments within the repertoires of our mouse pools (S1 Fig). As a general trend, the three pools resulted in similar frequencies and similar ranks for V-gene usage among groups. The ten most common V-gene segments from each pool were compiled, resulting in a total use of 14 VH-gene segments and 17 Vκ-gene segments (Fig 1). Table 1.

V-gene segment usage among unimmunized mouse pools. Open in a new tab Sequencing reads mapped to each individual gene segment were divided by the total sequencing reads of all identified gene segments from each mouse pool for a normalized comparison between pools. (A) The VH representing the ten most abundant gene segments from each mouse pool are displayed. (B) The rankings of each gene segment contained within the top 10 most abundant VH from at least one of the mouse pools are compared. The most abundant gene segment is ranked as 1. Dark red indicates higher rank moving to white, of lower rank. Similarly, the top 10 abundant Vκ are displayed (C-D).The most common VH-gene segment in pools one and two was V1-80 (Figs 1A and S1A). V1-80 was the seventh most common gene segment used in pool three. V6-3 was the most common VH-gene segment in pool three, but ranked seventh and sixth in pools one and two, respectively (Fig 1B). V1-26 was the next most common VH-gene segment, ranking second in pools one and two, and third in pool three. Among the top ten most common VH-gene segments, most gene segments ranked between first and 17th within their pools, however, three outliers were found within these groups. V1-50 ranked 23rd in pool one, but it was ninth and second in pools two and three, respectively. V1-78 was ranked 31st in pool two, but ranked tenth and 17th in pools one and three, respectively. V1-18 was ranked 32nd in pool three but third and fourth in pools one and two, respectively. VH-gene usage between pools was well correlated (1 vs 2 R2 = 0.8427, 2 vs 3 R2 = 0.7054, 1 vs 3 R2 = 0.5842, all p = <0.0001). Seventeen Vκ-gene segments were among the top 10 most abundant Vκ of the repertoire in at least one of the three mouse pools, with five Vκ-gene segments appearing in the top ten of all three mouse pools (Figs 1 and S1B). Pool one appeared enriched for V5-39, comprising 10.33% of the repertoire as compared to 1.03% in pool two and 2.84% in pool three (Fig 1C). Excluding this difference, V1-110, V1-117, V10-96, and V4-55 were the four most abundant gene segments in all three mouse pools. The lowest ranking of the most abundant Vκ in any of the mouse pools were V5-39, ranking 32nd in pool two, while ranking first and seventh in pools one and three, respectively and V10-94, ranking 32nd in pool one, but fifth in pool two and 13th in pool three. (Fig 1D). All top Vκ that showed any variation in abundance among pools were still within the top 32 Vκ-gene segments. Vκ usage between pools was correlated, although not as highly as VH (1 vs 2 R2 = 0.3684, 2 vs 3 R2 = 0.6700, 1 vs 3 R2 = 0.6414, all p = <0.0001). With 113 productive VH and 93 productive Vκ described in IMGT by chromosomal location, each gene segment would be expected to appear as part of the repertoire roughly 0.84% and 1.06% of the time for VH and Vκ, respectively, if gene segment usage was random (Fig 2). When we assessed usage frequency, there was a non-random distribution of both VH- (Fig 2A) and Vκ- (Fig 2B) gene segments (Chi-square analyses; all pools p<0.0001). Fig 2. Open in a new tab V-gene segment usage among unimmunized mouse pools for IgH (A) and Igκ (B) by chromosomal location. Gene segments are shown in order of chromosomal position (5’ to 3’). The average value from three mouse pools for each CDR3 length is shown. Distribution was assessed via Chi-square analysis in R (version 3.4.2) (all pools, p<0.0001).We also assessed gene segment usage by chromosomal location in the IgH and Igκ loci as gene-segment spacing was not evenly distributed along the chromosome. Based on 5’ nucleotide position, Q1-4 contained 22, 23, 33, and 33 VH-gene segments or 18, 21, 24, and 30 Vκ-gene segments, respectively. Since V-gene segment usage appears skewed, we tested whether the total expression of V-gene segments within a quadrant defined by nucleotide position was randomly distributed. We found that the expression within each quadrant was not randomly distributed, for both IgH and Igκ, suggesting that V-gene expression may be influenced by chromosomal location (all pools, p<0.0001). DH-, JH-gene segment and IgH constant region usage We identified ten different D-gene segments used in our repertoires (Fig 3A). We also added one additional category for our analyses, termed “undetermined”. This label was applied to D-gene segments that were assigned by IMGT to non-C57BL/6J genes and antibody sequences containing a V- and J-gene segment, but not containing an identifiable D-gene segment. Due to the very short length of D-gene segments combined with alterations during recombination, D-gene segments were bioinformatically difficult to identify. Fig 3. Open in a new tab Percent abundance of IgH D- (A) and J- (B) gene segments, IgH constant regions (C) and Igκ J-gene segments (D). Sequencing reads corresponding to each gene segment or constant region were divided by the total number of gene segments or constant regions identified in each mouse pool for normalized comparison between pools (left side). The most abundant gene segment is ranked as one (right side). Dark red indicates higher rank moving to blue (A) or white (B-D), of lower rank. Sequencing reads designated undetermined (undeter) where portions of a D- or J-gene segment were identified but unable to be assigned to a specific C57BL/6J D- or J-gene segment.For all three groups, the D1-1 gene segment was the most common segment identified comprising 26–28% of the repertoire. Undetermined D-gene segments, however, made up a large part of the D-gene segment repertoire, comprising 31–33% of the repertoire. D2-3, D2-4, D4-1, and D2-5 were found in similar frequencies ranging from six to fifteen percent of the data set. D3-2, D3-1, D6-3, D5-5, D5-2, and D6-4 were found at low levels in all data sets; comprising under three percent of the total repertoire. Four JH-gene segments were identified, with JH2 being the most common among all three groups (Fig 3B). The remaining J-gene segments, JH4, JH3, and JH1, were found at similar levels among groups totaling between 19% and 27% of the repertoire. IgM was overwhelmingly the most commonly identified constant region making up between 78% and 84% of the total repertoire (Fig 3C). IgG was the next most common between seven and eleven percent of the total repertoire. IgA and IgD were rare totaling between two and six percent of the repertoire. IgE was only detected in pool three at less than one percent. It was not detected in pools one and two. Jκ-gene segment usage A total of four Jκ-gene segments were identified, with similar distribution of Jκ-gene segments between mouse pools (Fig 3D). Due to the even distribution of the three most abundant Jκ, the ranking of each gene segment varied slightly among the three mouse pools. Within each mouse pool, there was a small portion of Jκ that contained too few nucleotides to be assigned to a specific gene segment (0.03–0.38%). IgH- and Igκ- gene segment combinations VH, DH, and JH family combination frequency was examined. Some preferential bias for specific gene segments seemed to exist (Fig 4A). For example, the JH4/DH2 combination appeared at a high frequency with VH1 (4.5% of repertoire), but not with any other VH gene family to the same degree. IgH gene segment recombination frequency correlated with gene segment abundance. VH1, which contains over half of all possible V-gene segments, also was the most commonly used VH family, which is seen as the dominant band in the Circos plot (Fig 4B). Fig 4. Open in a new tab Combinations of V-gene families with DJ-gene segments for IgH (A) and J-gene segments for Igκ (C). Increasing pairing frequency of V(D)J is represented by larger circles. Sequencing reads in which more than one C57BL/6 J-gene segment was attributed or too few nucleotides were present in the J-gene segment for designation by IMGT have been classified as undetermined (U). Pairing frequency is also represented by Circos graphs for IgH (B) and Igκ (D). Circos Plot Labels (starting at 12:00 position and the largest arc and continuing clockwise with occasional color references) B–J1 (red), J2, J3, J4, U (yellow), V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7 (Teal), V8, V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14 (purple), V15 D–J1 (red), J2, J4, J5, U, V1 (yellow), V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7 (black sliver), V8, V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, V15 (royal blue), V16, V17, V18, V19, V20 (black sliver, if present).The pairing of Vκ families to individual Jκ was also assessed (Fig 4C and 4D). Overall, the pairing of Vκ families with Jκ appeared random, however, certain Vκ families preferentially paired with specific Jκ-gene segments. For example, V4 paired less efficiently with J1, while V3 paired more efficiently with J1 (Fig 4C). Unlike VH, no single Vκ family was exceedingly dominant. Although V4 was the most represented gene family, its expression level was close to that of the second next most prominent gene families, which varied by mouse pool as shown in the Circos plot (Fig 4D). The percent of repertoire that each VJ-gene segment combination comprised within each mouse pool was compared by linear regression. Mouse pools showed modest correlation levels of VJ-gene segment recombination frequency in IgH (1 vs 2 R2 = 0.6055, 2 vs 3 R2 = 0.4419, 1 vs 3 R2 = 0.4399, all p = <0.0001) and Igκ (1 vs 2 R2 = 0.2340, 2 vs 3 R2 = 0.3598, 1 vs 3 R2 = 0.4607, all p = <0.0001), with some enrichment for certain combinations within each mouse pool. V-(D)-J combinations were within bubble charts generate a visual comparison of pairing (Fig 4A–4C). IgH and Igκ CDR3 The average IgH CDR3 (H-CRD3) length of all three data sets was 11 amino acid (AAs) long (Fig 5A). The lengths of the H-CDR3s followed a normal distribution except all three groups were enriched for five AA H-CDR3s. H-CDR3 AA length ranged from one to twenty-three amino acids in length with 11 AAs being the average for all three pools. Igκ chain CDR3 length was conserved at nine AAs, comprising 87–90% of the repertoire (Fig 5B). While nine AAs was the most frequent κ-CDR3 length, one κ-CDR3 with a length of seven AAs was observed in the top CDR3 sequences. The distribution of CDR3 lengths was even among pools for both IgH and Igκ (S2 Fig). Four κ-CDR3 sequences that fit the conserved kappa chain C-xx-F motif identified within the mouse pools (data not shown), while no such hyperlengthy H-CDR3 sequences fitting the C-xx-W motif were identified. Fig 5. Open in a new tab CDR3 length for IgH (A) and Igκ (B). The average percent of repertoire of each CDR3 amino acid length from three mouse pools is displayed.A total of 17,216 unique H-CDR3 AA sequences were identified among all three data pools. Among those identified, the majority (16,783) were identified in only one pool (Fig 6A). Of the remaining CDR3s, 358 were identified in only two pools and 75 were identified in all three pools. Fig 6. Top CDR3 AA sequences and overlap of unique CDR3 sequences within mouse pools. Open in a new tab A Venn diagram displays the overlap of the number of unique CDR3 amino acid sequences among mouse pools for IgH (A) and Igκ (C). The percent of repertoire for the top five CDR3 amino acid from each mouse pool are shown for IgH (B) and Igκ (D).Interestingly, many of these H-CDR3s, though found in all three pools, were not necessarily common H-CDR3s. Only one H-CDR3, CARGAYW, was found among the top ten most common H-CDR3s of each pool. One additional H-CDR3, CARDYYGSSWYFDVW, was found in the top five of pools two and three. Of the 75 total H-CDR3s that appeared in all three pools, frequencies varied drastically, from being the most common to only being detected once (Fig 6A). Of the top five most common H-CDR3s in each data set, only three, CARGAYW, CARGGYW, and CMRYSNYWYFDVW occurred in all three data sets (Figs 6B and S3A). CARGSYW occurred in pools one and two, CARRWLHYAMDYW in pools two and three, and CARYAPYYFDYW in pools one and three. The remaining most common H-CDR3s occurred in only one pool. A heatmap of all 75 shared H-CDR3 is shown in S3A Fig. There were 3,217 total unique κ-CDR3 amino acid sequences identified among all three mouse pools (Fig 6C). While there were 2,345 individual κ-CDR3 amino acid sequences that were unique to the individual mouse pools, there were also 475 κ-CDR3 shared among all three pools. None of these 475 shared κ-CDR3 were found within the top five κ-CDR3s of all three mouse pools (Fig 6D). There were 14 total κ-CDR3 sequences that were found within the top five κ-CDR3 for each mouse pool (Figs 6D and S3B). There were no CDR3 sequences that were found within the top five κ-CDR3 in all three mouse pools. Comparison of alignments of CDR3s To assess the heterogeneity in B-cell idiotypes created by the differential splicing of Ig genes, we compared B cells that used the same V-, D- and J-genes. Two gene combinations containing complete V-, D-, and J-segments common to top 35 gene combinations found in all three mouse pools were selected for this analysis (Fig 7A–7C). Fig 7. Open in a new tab Comparison of CDR3 alignments in gene segment combinations (IGHV1-26, IGHD1-1, IGHJ1) coding for a predominantly short (A), median length (B), and long (C) H-CDR3 region and κ-CDR3 (IGκV1-110, IGκJ-2) (D). The germline nucleotide (G.L.) sequence is identified at the top of each alignment. Each nucleotide sequence is labeled with its corresponding amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequences coding for identical amino acid sequences are labeled with numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) corresponding with the alignment order. The V and J-gene segments for each alignment are labeled, however due to the variability in the D-gene segment it is not bracketed, but is identifiable by the germline sequence provided.One heavy-chain VDJ-gene combination displaying a CDR3 region of variable length was selected from the 15 most common gene combinations among the three mouse pools and aligned to its germline sequence. From the full alignment, one short (four to eight AAs, Fig 7A), one medium (11 AAs, Fig 7B), and one long (14 AAs, Fig 7C) selection of nucleotide sequences were isolated and compared. Although the three groups were encoded by the same V-, D-, and J-gene segments, gene segment representation across each sample was variable. Most variability occurred in or around the D-gene segment, which could be due to splicing, N- and P-nucleotide additions, and deletions during somatic recombination. D-gene usage also appeared to be a factor determining CDR3 length. This was evidenced by increasing D-gene representation across CDR3 selections of decreasing length compared to the relative conservation of the V- and J-gene segments, though J-gene conservation seemed to decrease among extremely short CDR3s. Overall, the V-gene segment appeared to remain the most uniform. While Igκ contains mostly CDR3 sequences that are nine amino acids in length, many highly abundant VJ-gene segment combinations (such as V110 and J2) contained CDR3s of multiple lengths. Unlike IgH, the alignments of VJ pairings were relatively uniform among Igκ as compared to the germline sequence in CDR3 sequences that were eight, nine and ten amino acids in length (Fig 7D).",
    "discussion": "Discussion To our knowledge, these data are the first unamplified sampling of the normal mouse antibody repertoire that has been described. Others have looked at Ig-gene segment usage with other strategies [26, 36, 41–43] but we wanted to determine if a straight-forward RNA-Seq approach would provide us with a reasonable assessment of B cell Ig-segment use without the limitations that amplification methods introduce (Rettig et al., In Revision). To minimize potential single animal aberrations and repertoire skewing, we pooled splenic tissue of four unimmunized mice in three biological replicates. This approach was successful since we saw less variation with pooled samples compared to data sets that are made up of single mice [61]. Grieff et al. demonstrated that CDR3 and VDJ composition in pooled mouse samples were less polarized than that of an individually sequenced mouse subjected to antigen challenge [44]. Therefore, our data are consistent with that study. We also did the technical replication of material in pool one and found that there was good reproducibility (R2 = 0.7562) [35]. Therefore, the data in the individual normal mouse pools and a compiled summary of those data are a strong reflection of the normal mouse repertoire. The most common VH-gene segment was V1-80, which was the most common in pools one and two. V6-3 was the most common in pool three. In selecting the ten most common VH-gene segments from each pool, we identified 14 different VH-gene segments, with heavy overlap among pools. All VH-gene segments isolated comprised between 1% to 8% of the repertoire. This VH V-gene variation is consistent with previous observations [25] but the pools ameliorated the extreme variations that was reported by that group. We also saw that Vκ-gene segment usage was comparable among mouse pools, with 17 gene segments comprising between 1% and 13% of the repertoire. Although we have found that gene segment use among all three pooled sample groups was similar, there were some differences. V5-39 was observed at a high frequency in pool one (10%) as compared to pools two (1%) and three (3%). This skewing could be the result of a mouse within pool one responding to a specific antigen that other mice did not respond to or more likely, represents the natural variability of mice [36]. Nevertheless, even pooling samples maintains the randomness of antibody gene selection and rearrangement and a pool of four individuals still has relative uniqueness. Some have suggested that V-gene segment usage may be skewed [45]. Chi-square analyses of VH- and Vκ-gene segment use in our data set would support this contention since several VH and Vκ-gene segments were used more frequently than expected. Even though we have analyzed three independent biological samples made of pools of four mice, we recognize that an even larger data set will be needed to conclusively settle this discussion. Studies on humans have revealed similar V(D)J usage in spite of them being outbred populations [27] which also supports that there is some inherent selection in V-gene selection regardless of genetics. Additional studies looking at epigenetic changes or other transcriptional regulatory elements such as the characterization performed by Choi et al. [46] might also help understand mechanisms of V-gene segment selection. For the D-gene segment, three usage levels were detected. D1-1 was the most used gene segment in all three pools; comprising around 26% of the total repertoire. Over 36% of D-gene segments could not be identified, likely due to the short length of the D-gene segment. Nevertheless, we do see different populations of antibodies even when they do share similar D-genes segments. Some have large D-gene segments where others have little recognizable sequence. JH-gene segment usage was relatively uniform. J2 was the most common among all three pools, with over 32% use in the repertoire. J1, J3, and J4 were evenly represented among all three pools totaling between 19–27% of the repertoire. Gene segments with less than six nucleotides were unable to be identified and occur at less than 0.1% of the heavy-chain repertoire. Jκ-gene segment usage is somewhat evenly distributed among J1, J2, and J5 comprising between 25–32% of the repertoire, in agreement with the findings of Aoki-ota et al.[45], Lu et al. found a slightly different Jκ expression profile, possibly reflecting strain specific usage of Jκ [26]. As paralleled in the heavy-chain data, gene segments with less than six nucleotides were rare; occurring in less than 0.4% of the total repertoire. Constant region usage in the heavy-chain was heavily dominated by IgM, which reflects the “naïve” status of our mice. Although IgM comprised over 78% of the total identified constant regions we did see the expression of IgG, IgA and IgD. IgE was rare, being detected in only pool three. However, when compared to serum data, even in naïve mice, there was a high level of circulating IgGs, which was not reflected in spleen tissue sequencing, which instead shows very high levels of IgM [47]. This could be due to a large B-cell population in the spleen that is not secreting antibody at high levels into the bloodstream [36]. We looked at the common H-CDR3 sequences among the three mouse pools. There was little overlap; with only 75 H-CDR3s detected in all three pools and between 92 and 163 common H-CDR3s when we just looked at two pools. We detected between 4.6k to 6.2k unique sequences found only in each respective pool. While we sampled a small fraction of CDR3s present in the total antibody repertoire, Lu et al. and Greiff et al. used primer amplification to enrich for IgH transcripts and still found high CDR3 variability among individuals [26, 36].Similarly, in a study comparing monozygotic twins, Glanville et al., also demonstrated that CDR3 profiles between the individuals were quite diverse despite similar gene family usage between the twins [48]. Therefore, the pooling methodology that we employed did not significantly diminish the detection of the unique CDR3 repertoires that individuals have. When we examined the κ-CDR3 usage among the three biological samples, there was a higher proportion of common κ-CDR3s. Unique κ-CDR3s within each pool ranged from 688 to 832 CDR3 identified within all three pools and between 108 and 178 CDR3 identified in only two pools. One explanation for light-chain CDR3 length homogeneity may be selection due to light-chain editing that occurs during B-cell maturation and the need to be able to interchange the light chains. The small numbers of overlapping CDR3 sequences among our three pooled samples suggests that significant variation in the idiotypes could develop, even within an inbred population of mice and reinforces the idea of unique generation of B-cell diversity in inbred and outbred populations [27, 48]. Moreover, we were curious if the size of the total pool of B cells could be estimated from our data. Using a model of capture-recapture methodology [49], the Chapman estimator, [50] and the number of common heavy-chain CDR3 sequences seen in each of our samplings, we estimated our B-cell pool to range from 1.5–14 x 106 cells. If we assume that there are 5 x 106 B cells in a nine to eleven-week-old female C57BL/6J mouse spleen, and our mouse pools were made up of four spleens, this estimate of the possible splenic B-cell pool is reasonably accurate, especially if we take into account some of the CDR3 sequences were detected multiple times (multiple B cells with the same IgH). While CDR3 is commonly used to describe the antibody repertoire, many studies have reported the combinations of the V(D)J [20, 44, 51–53]. Compiling CDR3 nucleotide alignments allowed us to visualize the significance of individual gene segment involvement with the CDR3 in the context of specific V(D)J combinations. Sequencing outside of CDR3 also can reveal biologically relevant information about antigen binding and allows for further characterization of B-cell ontogeny. Our approach allowed us to identify V(D)J-gene segments in addition to the constant region and provided insight into the pairing of V-gene segments with (D)J-gene segments. The information about the unchallenged Ig-gene repertoire also has other uses. It provides a comparative foundation when looking at host response to antigen [54] and has been used to isolated therapeutic antibodies. Antibodies for influenza in a mouse model and were a valuable tool in the detection of antigen specific responses [16, 34]. While a lack of amplification may extricate primer bias, we knew that it would come at the cost of potentially excluding rare B-cell clones. In humans, for example, a single clone may only comprise 0.1% to 0.3% of the repertoire [55]. We have explored the differences between samples that have and have not been amplified and found a moderate correlation (R2 = 0.5815, 0.5855, p<0.0001, Rettig et al., In Revision). While some of the differences arose from expected depth-of-sequencing issues, we unexpectedly found that discrepancies also resulted from gene segments being detected in the unamplified data set not detected in the amplified data sets (Rettig et al., In Revision). It is also important to note that the number of immunoglobulin reads detected in our RNASeq library equaled or exceeded those in other HTS studies [55]. Therefore, we are aware of the tradeoffs and benefits of the HTS strategy we have used. Another issue which may affect the data presented stems from the use of whole spleen tissue rather than isolated B-cell populations [34]. Although our approach was necessary to accommodate requirements of a separate investigation [35], we are aware that the inclusion of extraneous cells as result of using whole tissue could reduce the recovery of rare B-cell clones. In addition, some bias might be introduced because of cell subpopulation stability and frequency in whole spleen tissue [56, 57]. Nevertheless, in spite of the limitations of our methodology, it appears that the repertoire we detected correlated with mouse studies that have used selection and amplification methods of various kinds. For example, Collins et al. detected five of the same VH genes that we detected among our highest 10 used VH-gene segments. JH2 was also the most frequently detected in both of our studies [33]. Yang and Kaplinski detected V-gene segment use that paralleled our findings with V1-26 identified by them as the most frequently used [11, 42]. Few studies have explored the light chain repertoire; however, more characterization will be possible with increasing use of single cell amplification [58–60]. While strain specificity has been reported [33, 36], many Vκ-gene segments that were represented over one-percent of the time in unimmunized BALB/c mice were also identified in our study [26]. Aoki-Ota et al. also noted Vκ-gene segment skewing in their assessment of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice [45]. These similarities also suggest that the lack of amplification did not dramatically affect our assessment of the B-cell repertoire, and the differences seen are likely due to mouse-to-mouse variation that still manifests in our pooled samples. In conclusion, we have presented an unamplified view of the conventionally housed, unimmunized, antibody repertoire. It appears that an RNASeq approach without amplification can provide an accurate assessment of V-gene use as well as a snapshot of the CDR3 present in the population; and helps validate this as a reasonable scientific approach. In addition, we lay the foundation for future work in our lab to characterize the unamplified whole tissue repertoire of the immunized C57BL/6 mouse.",

Copyright notice ID: 5761896 PMID: 29320559 Abstract Antibody specificity and diversity are generated through the enzymatic splicing of genomic gene segments within each B cell. Antibodies are heterodimers of heavy- and light-chains encoded on separate loci. We studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presents a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.Introduction B cells are an important part of the adaptive immune system, arising from hematopoietic stem cell precursors. These cells express surface immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors and secrete these same proteins as antibodies into the serum after differentiation into plasma cells [1, 2]. As B cells develop, they rearrange Variable- (V), Diversity- (D), and Joining- (J) gene segments, which combine with a constant region to form the antibody structure [3, 4]. Antibodies consist of heterodimers of heavy and light chains [4]. The heavy chain is formed from V-, D-, and J-gene segments combined with a constant region [5], while light chains lack a D-gene segment. [3, 6]. There are three complementarity determining regions (CDR). CDR1 and CDR2 are encoded in the V-gene segment. CDR3 consists of a combination of V-, (D-, heavy-chain), and J-gene segments [7]. Of the CDRs, CDR3 contributes the most to binding specificity. Antibodies are further characterized by the constant region, or isotype, which is influenced by the stage of B-cell development and antigen specificity [8]. The total collection of antibody specificities present within an individual is known as the antibody repertoire. Diversity of the antibody repertoire results from four main components: the initial germ line (inherited), diversity from recombination of that germline, the imprecisions during V(D)J recombination, and somatic mutations [9–11]. The antibody repertoire has been examined in many studies by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and fully mapped in the zebrafish [12]. Repertoires can serve as a fingerprint or snapshot of the current immune-system status and these types of data have been used to explore the development of host defense to infectious disease [13–18], cancer [19–22], autoimmune disease [23, 24], and early disease detection [25]. With the development of HTS, we are now able to detect the differences between or among B-cell repertoires such as B2 (adaptive antibodies) and B1 (natural antibodies) B cells [11] or memory and naïve repertoires [26, 27]. HTS has accelerated the characterization of the widely differing human Ig haplotypes [28–32], and strain-specific gene segment usage in mice [33]. Our long-term goals are to investigate the repertoire of B cells in mice in space and how it changes in response to antigen challenge. More specifically, our lab is interested antibody repertoire dynamics within the context of spaceflight. Due to the cost of these experiments, creating datasets that can be mined by our lab or others is important. The antibody repertoire is traditionally assessed through the amplification of Ig sequences that have been isolated from sorted B cell populations [34]. While these practices increase the likelihood of recovering rare Ig sequences and allow for the dissection of the antibody repertoire by B-cell populations, cell sorting may not be possible within the design of certain experiments. During the development of methodology to assess Ig-gene usage by mice subjected to space flight we performed multiple HTS runs to validate sample preparation, bioinformatic methodology, and reproducibility [35]. We also wanted some background data about the Ig repertoire in the normal B6 mouse population. Knowing that there can be significant mouse-to-mouse variability in the Ig repertoire [36, 61] and to minimize the impact any one mouse might have in the validation data set, we chose to pool multiple mice specifically for these validation experiments [35]. We now present these data on the splenic repertoire of conventionally housed, unimmunized, unchallenged, adult C57BL/6J mice.Materials and methods RNA extraction and sequencing Tissue extraction and sequencing were performed as described previously [35]. Briefly, spleens were collected from three independent pools of four, specific pathogen-free (based on the RADIL Advantage Basic profile), female, C57BL/6J mice nine-to-eleven weeks old. Animals were euthanized with isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation. Briefly, mice were exposed to 400μL isoflurane in a gauze-pad enclosed in a histopathology cassette in a 450 mL chamber as was described by Huerkamp et al [37]. Animals used in pool one were raised in the Laboratory Animal Care Services (LACS) facility (breeder stock renewed less than 2 years previous) in the Division of Biology at Kansas State University. Mice from pools two and three were received directly from Jackson Laboratories and were house in the LACS facility. Mice were fed LabDiet 5001 and had access to water and food ad libitum. Mice were maintained on a 12/12 light/dark cycle. Mice for pools two and three were allowed to acclimate in the vivarium for 22–31 days prior to sacrifice. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kansas State University. After euthanasia, spleen tissue was processed immediately for RNA extraction with Trizol LS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pool one contained RNA from one-half of the spleen tissue while pools two and three contained RNA extracted from complete spleens. Equal concentrations of total splenic RNA (RIN>8) were pooled and mixed from each of the four mice, resulting in three final pools. At least one microgram of RNA from each pool was submitted for size selection (275–800 nucleotides) and sequencing on Illumina MiSeq at 2x300 nucleotides as described previously [35]. Sequencing was performed at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility using the standard Illuimna sequencing protocol, including oligo-dT-bead selection of mRNA and reverse transcription to cDNA. A reduced fragmentation time (one minute) was used to yield longer transcripts [35]. To avoid potential primer bias and maintain a dataset that could be further mined, we did not amplify Ig sequences. The authors note that a subset of mouse pool one data was used in a methods paper presented by our group. The context and focus of that previous manuscript does not overlap with the current work [35].Bioinformatics Sequence selection, mapping, and final processing was performed as outlined previously [35]. Briefly, sequences were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v9.5.1 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) and cleaned to obtain high quality reads using a quality score of 97% of the sequencing containing a Phred score over 20. Both paired and merged (overlapping pairs) were mapped to V-gene segments and the loci using a match score of +1 and a mismatch score of -2 to identify potential antibody sequences. The sequences were collected and submitted to ImMunoGenTics’s (IMGT) High-V Quest for identification [38]. Due to the chances of collecting the same read multiple times through the mapping and identification process, only one sequence per sequence ID was analyzed (procedure outlined in Rettig et al [35]). Productive and unknown functionality sequences were identified via IMGT and used for subsequent analyses. Productive antibody sequences were defined as in frame and did not contain a stop codon. However, binding abilities were not assessed. Unknown sequences did not contain enough sequencing information to determine functionality. Gene segments were identified using IMGT’s nomenclature and using IMGT’s list of gene segments, including functional and open reading frame-defined gene segments. We implemented two procedural changes to further define the repertoire that are different from the methodology presented in Rettig et al. [35]. In this current manuscript, when calculating the percent abundance in the repertoire, we also include V-gene segments where one or two possible V-gene segments were detected. When one single V-gene segment was detected in a sequence, it was assigned a value of one. When two potential V-gene segments were detected each gene segment was assigned a value of 0.5. The totals were then tabulated as described in Rettig et al [35]. Additionally, CDR3 sequences that did not fit the C-xx-W motif for IgH (heavy-chain) were reclassified as unknown functionality, unless a class-switched isotype (IgA, IgD, IgE) was detected. CDR3 sequences for Igκ (kappa-chain) that did not fit the C-xx-F motif were classified as unknown functionality. Sequencing reads containing hyperlengthy (greater than 2x the average, or 18 amino acids (AAs)) κ-CDR3 that fit the C-xx-F motif were also removed from analysis as we believed they were falsely identified through bioinformatic or sequencing errors. Initial nucleotide alignments were created with MAFFT [39] using portions of the germline and CDR3 nucleotide sequences provided by IMGT. Sequences were sorted by identity, compared to the germline and the sequence order was then adjusted to group similarly-aligned sequences. Nucleotide sequences of identical length were then isolated from the full alignment and aligned with each other while retaining all previously-inserted gaps.V(D)J pairing frequency Pairing frequency was assessed in productive sequencing reads from both IgH and Igκ datasets. All pairing of V-gene segments was only assessed from productive IgH and Igκ sequencing reads, referred to as VH and Vκ, respectively. Sequences identifying more than one possible V-gene segment were excluded from this analysis. For both IgH and Igκ, J- and D-gene segments designated as undetermined (U) were either not reported by IMGT, contained less than six nucleotides, or multiple gene segments were assigned to a single sequencing read. Total counts from VJ pairings for heavy- and light-chains were tabulated and Circos graphs were generated using Circos Online [40].Statistical analysis and graphics Linear Regressions were performed by comparing the percent of repertoire of V-gene segment or V(D)J combinations from pools 1 vs 2, 2 vs 3, and 1 vs 3 using the linear regression analysis tool in GraphPad (Version 6.0). Chi-square analysis of V-gene segment usage was performed on raw sequencing read counts using R version 3.4.2 (https://www.r-project.org/). All productive VH- and Vκ-gene segments and open reading frames listed on IMGT for the B6 mouse were analyzed and gene segments not found in our datasets were assigned a read count of zero. The IMGT productive list includes all gene segments detected in the  annotation of the mouse genome. The IMGT chromosomal locations were also used for any chromosomal analysis, though not all gene segments have a defined chromosomal location. Gene segments that were not defined by location in IMGT were excluded from any chromosomal analysis. These analyses were performed on each mouse pool separately by comparing the observed raw-read count values of V-gene segments to an expected theoretical number of reads which was based on the null hypothesis that all V-gene segments will have the same number of raw reads. This value was determined by dividing the total number of antibody reads observed in a mouse pool by the number of possible gene segments. The analysis of gene-segment usage by chromosomal location was performed by dividing gene segments into four quadrants based on nucleotide position. A quadrant was defined as one-fourth of the entire locus, as determined by number of nucleotides in the locus. Gene segment location was defined as the first nucleotide of the gene segment. A Chi-square analysis was performed on each mouse pool by summing the raw-read counts of all gene segments containing a 5’ nucleotide position within each quadrant and comparing the observed total reads within a quadrant to an expected theoretical number of reads for each quadrant which was based on the null hypothesis that the number of raw reads is not statistically different between defined quadrants. Percent of repertoire values were determined by dividing sequencing reads corresponding to each gene segment, constant region, or CDR3 length by the total number of gene segments, constant regions, or CDR identified in each mouse pool for normalized comparison between pools. Percent of repertoire for these variables were displayed as bar graphs, generated in GraphPad v6.0, or as heat maps, generated in Microsoft Excel. In addition to visualization of gene segment combinations through Circos graphs, the percent of repertoire for gene segment pairings was also visualized using the bubble chart tool in Microsoft Excel.Results VH- and Vκ-gene segment usage We obtained between 8,714 and 11,200 IgH individual productive reads, and between 14,271 and 28,756 individual IgH reads of unknown functionality as identified by IMGT HighV-Quest (Table 1). Between 11,968 and 18,643 individual Igκ productive, and 12,602 and 39,410 individual Igκ reads of unknown functionality were identified by IMGT HighV-Quest (Table 1). Overall, we identified 132 VH- and 109 Vκ-gene segments within the repertoires of our mouse pools (S1 Fig). As a general trend, the three pools resulted in similar frequencies and similar ranks for V-gene usage among groups. The ten most common V-gene segments from each pool were compiled, resulting in a total use of 14 VH-gene segments and 17 Vκ-gene segments (Fig 1). Table 1.

V-gene segment usage among unimmunized mouse pools. Open in a new tab Sequencing reads mapped to each individual gene segment were divided by the total sequencing reads of all identified gene segments from each mouse pool for a normalized comparison between pools. (A) The VH representing the ten most abundant gene segments from each mouse pool are displayed. (B) The rankings of each gene segment contained within the top 10 most abundant VH from at least one of the mouse pools are compared. The most abundant gene segment is ranked as 1. Dark red indicates higher rank moving to white, of lower rank. Similarly, the top 10 abundant Vκ are displayed (C-D).The most common VH-gene segment in pools one and two was V1-80 (Figs 1A and S1A). V1-80 was the seventh most common gene segment used in pool three. V6-3 was the most common VH-gene segment in pool three, but ranked seventh and sixth in pools one and two, respectively (Fig 1B). V1-26 was the next most common VH-gene segment, ranking second in pools one and two, and third in pool three. Among the top ten most common VH-gene segments, most gene segments ranked between first and 17th within their pools, however, three outliers were found within these groups. V1-50 ranked 23rd in pool one, but it was ninth and second in pools two and three, respectively. V1-78 was ranked 31st in pool two, but ranked tenth and 17th in pools one and three, respectively. V1-18 was ranked 32nd in pool three but third and fourth in pools one and two, respectively. VH-gene usage between pools was well correlated (1 vs 2 R2 = 0.8427, 2 vs 3 R2 = 0.7054, 1 vs 3 R2 = 0.5842, all p = <0.0001). Seventeen Vκ-gene segments were among the top 10 most abundant Vκ of the repertoire in at least one of the three mouse pools, with five Vκ-gene segments appearing in the top ten of all three mouse pools (Figs 1 and S1B). Pool one appeared enriched for V5-39, comprising 10.33% of the repertoire as compared to 1.03% in pool two and 2.84% in pool three (Fig 1C). Excluding this difference, V1-110, V1-117, V10-96, and V4-55 were the four most abundant gene segments in all three mouse pools. The lowest ranking of the most abundant Vκ in any of the mouse pools were V5-39, ranking 32nd in pool two, while ranking first and seventh in pools one and three, respectively and V10-94, ranking 32nd in pool one, but fifth in pool two and 13th in pool three. (Fig 1D). All top Vκ that showed any variation in abundance among pools were still within the top 32 Vκ-gene segments. Vκ usage between pools was correlated, although not as highly as VH (1 vs 2 R2 = 0.3684, 2 vs 3 R2 = 0.6700, 1 vs 3 R2 = 0.6414, all p = <0.0001). With 113 productive VH and 93 productive Vκ described in IMGT by chromosomal location, each gene segment would be expected to appear as part of the repertoire roughly 0.84% and 1.06% of the time for VH and Vκ, respectively, if gene segment usage was random (Fig 2). When we assessed usage frequency, there was a non-random distribution of both VH- (Fig 2A) and Vκ- (Fig 2B) gene segments (Chi-square analyses; all pools p<0.0001). Fig 2. Open in a new tab V-gene segment usage among unimmunized mouse pools for IgH (A) and Igκ (B) by chromosomal location. Gene segments are shown in order of chromosomal position (5’ to 3’). The average value from three mouse pools for each CDR3 length is shown. Distribution was assessed via Chi-square analysis in R (version 3.4.2) (all pools, p<0.0001).We also assessed gene segment usage by chromosomal location in the IgH and Igκ loci as gene-segment spacing was not evenly distributed along the chromosome. Based on 5’ nucleotide position, Q1-4 contained 22, 23, 33, and 33 VH-gene segments or 18, 21, 24, and 30 Vκ-gene segments, respectively. Since V-gene segment usage appears skewed, we tested whether the total expression of V-gene segments within a quadrant defined by nucleotide position was randomly distributed. We found that the expression within each quadrant was not randomly distributed, for both IgH and Igκ, suggesting that V-gene expression may be influenced by chromosomal location (all pools, p<0.0001).DH-, JH-gene segment and IgH constant region usage We identified ten different D-gene segments used in our repertoires (Fig 3A). We also added one additional category for our analyses, termed “undetermined”. This label was applied to D-gene segments that were assigned by IMGT to non-C57BL/6J genes and antibody sequences containing a V- and J-gene segment, but not containing an identifiable D-gene segment. Due to the very short length of D-gene segments combined with alterations during recombination, D-gene segments were bioinformatically difficult to identify. Fig 3. Open in a new tab Percent abundance of IgH D- (A) and J- (B) gene segments, IgH constant regions (C) and Igκ J-gene segments (D). Sequencing reads corresponding to each gene segment or constant region were divided by the total number of gene segments or constant regions identified in each mouse pool for normalized comparison between pools (left side). The most abundant gene segment is ranked as one (right side). Dark red indicates higher rank moving to blue (A) or white (B-D), of lower rank. Sequencing reads designated undetermined (undeter) where portions of a D- or J-gene segment were identified but unable to be assigned to a specific C57BL/6J D- or J-gene segment.For all three groups, the D1-1 gene segment was the most common segment identified comprising 26–28% of the repertoire. Undetermined D-gene segments, however, made up a large part of the D-gene segment repertoire, comprising 31–33% of the repertoire. D2-3, D2-4, D4-1, and D2-5 were found in similar frequencies ranging from six to fifteen percent of the data set. D3-2, D3-1, D6-3, D5-5, D5-2, and D6-4 were found at low levels in all data sets; comprising under three percent of the total repertoire. Four JH-gene segments were identified, with JH2 being the most common among all three groups (Fig 3B). The remaining J-gene segments, JH4, JH3, and JH1, were found at similar levels among groups totaling between 19% and 27% of the repertoire. IgM was overwhelmingly the most commonly identified constant region making up between 78% and 84% of the total repertoire (Fig 3C). IgG was the next most common between seven and eleven percent of the total repertoire. IgA and IgD were rare totaling between two and six percent of the repertoire. IgE was only detected in pool three at less than one percent. It was not detected in pools one and two.Jκ-gene segment usage A total of four Jκ-gene segments were identified, with similar distribution of Jκ-gene segments between mouse pools (Fig 3D). Due to the even distribution of the three most abundant Jκ, the ranking of each gene segment varied slightly among the three mouse pools. Within each mouse pool, there was a small portion of Jκ that contained too few nucleotides to be assigned to a specific gene segment (0.03–0.38%).IgH- and Igκ- gene segment combinations VH, DH, and JH family combination frequency was examined. Some preferential bias for specific gene segments seemed to exist (Fig 4A). For example, the JH4/DH2 combination appeared at a high frequency with VH1 (4.5% of repertoire), but not with any other VH gene family to the same degree. IgH gene segment recombination frequency correlated with gene segment abundance. VH1, which contains over half of all possible V-gene segments, also was the most commonly used VH family, which is seen as the dominant band in the Circos plot (Fig 4B). Fig 4. Open in a new tab Combinations of V-gene families with DJ-gene segments for IgH (A) and J-gene segments for Igκ (C). Increasing pairing frequency of V(D)J is represented by larger circles. Sequencing reads in which more than one C57BL/6 J-gene segment was attributed or too few nucleotides were present in the J-gene segment for designation by IMGT have been classified as undetermined (U). Pairing frequency is also represented by Circos graphs for IgH (B) and Igκ (D). Circos Plot Labels (starting at 12:00 position and the largest arc and continuing clockwise with occasional color references) B–J1 (red), J2, J3, J4, U (yellow), V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7 (Teal), V8, V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14 (purple), V15 D–J1 (red), J2, J4, J5, U, V1 (yellow), V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7 (black sliver), V8, V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, V15 (royal blue), V16, V17, V18, V19, V20 (black sliver, if present).The pairing of Vκ families to individual Jκ was also assessed (Fig 4C and 4D). Overall, the pairing of Vκ families with Jκ appeared random, however, certain Vκ families preferentially paired with specific Jκ-gene segments. For example, V4 paired less efficiently with J1, while V3 paired more efficiently with J1 (Fig 4C). Unlike VH, no single Vκ family was exceedingly dominant. Although V4 was the most represented gene family, its expression level was close to that of the second next most prominent gene families, which varied by mouse pool as shown in the Circos plot (Fig 4D). The percent of repertoire that each VJ-gene segment combination comprised within each mouse pool was compared by linear regression. Mouse pools showed modest correlation levels of VJ-gene segment recombination frequency in IgH (1 vs 2 R2 = 0.6055, 2 vs 3 R2 = 0.4419, 1 vs 3 R2 = 0.4399, all p = <0.0001) and Igκ (1 vs 2 R2 = 0.2340, 2 vs 3 R2 = 0.3598, 1 vs 3 R2 = 0.4607, all p = <0.0001), with some enrichment for certain combinations within each mouse pool. V-(D)-J combinations were within bubble charts generate a visual comparison of pairing (Fig 4A–4C).IgH and Igκ CDR3 The average IgH CDR3 (H-CRD3) length of all three data sets was 11 amino acid (AAs) long (Fig 5A). The lengths of the H-CDR3s followed a normal distribution except all three groups were enriched for five AA H-CDR3s. H-CDR3 AA length ranged from one to twenty-three amino acids in length with 11 AAs being the average for all three pools. Igκ chain CDR3 length was conserved at nine AAs, comprising 87–90% of the repertoire (Fig 5B). While nine AAs was the most frequent κ-CDR3 length, one κ-CDR3 with a length of seven AAs was observed in the top CDR3 sequences. The distribution of CDR3 lengths was even among pools for both IgH and Igκ (S2 Fig). Four κ-CDR3 sequences that fit the conserved kappa chain C-xx-F motif identified within the mouse pools (data not shown), while no such hyperlengthy H-CDR3 sequences fitting the C-xx-W motif were identified. Fig 5. Open in a new tab CDR3 length for IgH (A) and Igκ (B). The average percent of repertoire of each CDR3 amino acid length from three mouse pools is displayed.A total of 17,216 unique H-CDR3 AA sequences were identified among all three data pools. Among those identified, the majority (16,783) were identified in only one pool (Fig 6A). Of the remaining CDR3s, 358 were identified in only two pools and 75 were identified in all three pools. Fig 6. Top CDR3 AA sequences and overlap of unique CDR3 sequences within mouse pools. Open in a new tab A Venn diagram displays the overlap of the number of unique CDR3 amino acid sequences among mouse pools for IgH (A) and Igκ (C). The percent of repertoire for the top five CDR3 amino acid from each mouse pool are shown for IgH (B) and Igκ (D).Interestingly, many of these H-CDR3s, though found in all three pools, were not necessarily common H-CDR3s. Only one H-CDR3, CARGAYW, was found among the top ten most common H-CDR3s of each pool. One additional H-CDR3, CARDYYGSSWYFDVW, was found in the top five of pools two and three. Of the 75 total H-CDR3s that appeared in all three pools, frequencies varied drastically, from being the most common to only being detected once (Fig 6A). Of the top five most common H-CDR3s in each data set, only three, CARGAYW, CARGGYW, and CMRYSNYWYFDVW occurred in all three data sets (Figs 6B and S3A). CARGSYW occurred in pools one and two, CARRWLHYAMDYW in pools two and three, and CARYAPYYFDYW in pools one and three. The remaining most common H-CDR3s occurred in only one pool. A heatmap of all 75 shared H-CDR3 is shown in S3A Fig. There were 3,217 total unique κ-CDR3 amino acid sequences identified among all three mouse pools (Fig 6C). While there were 2,345 individual κ-CDR3 amino acid sequences that were unique to the individual mouse pools, there were also 475 κ-CDR3 shared among all three pools. None of these 475 shared κ-CDR3 were found within the top five κ-CDR3s of all three mouse pools (Fig 6D). There were 14 total κ-CDR3 sequences that were found within the top five κ-CDR3 for each mouse pool (Figs 6D and S3B). There were no CDR3 sequences that were found within the top five κ-CDR3 in all three mouse pools.Comparison of alignments of CDR3s To assess the heterogeneity in B-cell idiotypes created by the differential splicing of Ig genes, we compared B cells that used the same V-, D- and J-genes. Two gene combinations containing complete V-, D-, and J-segments common to top 35 gene combinations found in all three mouse pools were selected for this analysis (Fig 7A–7C). Fig 7. Open in a new tab Comparison of CDR3 alignments in gene segment combinations (IGHV1-26, IGHD1-1, IGHJ1) coding for a predominantly short (A), median length (B), and long (C) H-CDR3 region and κ-CDR3 (IGκV1-110, IGκJ-2) (D). The germline nucleotide (G.L.) sequence is identified at the top of each alignment. Each nucleotide sequence is labeled with its corresponding amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequences coding for identical amino acid sequences are labeled with numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) corresponding with the alignment order. The V and J-gene segments for each alignment are labeled, however due to the variability in the D-gene segment it is not bracketed, but is identifiable by the germline sequence provided.One heavy-chain VDJ-gene combination displaying a CDR3 region of variable length was selected from the 15 most common gene combinations among the three mouse pools and aligned to its germline sequence. From the full alignment, one short (four to eight AAs, Fig 7A), one medium (11 AAs, Fig 7B), and one long (14 AAs, Fig 7C) selection of nucleotide sequences were isolated and compared. Although the three groups were encoded by the same V-, D-, and J-gene segments, gene segment representation across each sample was variable. Most variability occurred in or around the D-gene segment, which could be due to splicing, N- and P-nucleotide additions, and deletions during somatic recombination. D-gene usage also appeared to be a factor determining CDR3 length. This was evidenced by increasing D-gene representation across CDR3 selections of decreasing length compared to the relative conservation of the V- and J-gene segments, though J-gene conservation seemed to decrease among extremely short CDR3s. Overall, the V-gene segment appeared to remain the most uniform. While Igκ contains mostly CDR3 sequences that are nine amino acids in length, many highly abundant VJ-gene segment combinations (such as V110 and J2) contained CDR3s of multiple lengths. Unlike IgH, the alignments of VJ pairings were relatively uniform among Igκ as compared to the germline sequence in CDR3 sequences that were eight, nine and ten amino acids in length (Fig 7D).Discussion To our knowledge, these data are the first unamplified sampling of the normal mouse antibody repertoire that has been described. Others have looked at Ig-gene segment usage with other strategies [26, 36, 41–43] but we wanted to determine if a straight-forward RNA-Seq approach would provide us with a reasonable assessment of B cell Ig-segment use without the limitations that amplification methods introduce (Rettig et al., In Revision). To minimize potential single animal aberrations and repertoire skewing, we pooled splenic tissue of four unimmunized mice in three biological replicates. This approach was successful since we saw less variation with pooled samples compared to data sets that are made up of single mice [61]. Grieff et al. demonstrated that CDR3 and VDJ composition in pooled mouse samples were less polarized than that of an individually sequenced mouse subjected to antigen challenge [44]. Therefore, our data are consistent with that study. We also did the technical replication of material in pool one and found that there was good reproducibility (R2 = 0.7562) [35]. Therefore, the data in the individual normal mouse pools and a compiled summary of those data are a strong reflection of the normal mouse repertoire. The most common VH-gene segment was V1-80, which was the most common in pools one and two. V6-3 was the most common in pool three. In selecting the ten most common VH-gene segments from each pool, we identified 14 different VH-gene segments, with heavy overlap among pools. All VH-gene segments isolated comprised between 1% to 8% of the repertoire. This VH V-gene variation is consistent with previous observations [25] but the pools ameliorated the extreme variations that was reported by that group. We also saw that Vκ-gene segment usage was comparable among mouse pools, with 17 gene segments comprising between 1% and 13% of the repertoire. Although we have found that gene segment use among all three pooled sample groups was similar, there were some differences. V5-39 was observed at a high frequency in pool one (10%) as compared to pools two (1%) and three (3%). This skewing could be the result of a mouse within pool one responding to a specific antigen that other mice did not respond to or more likely, represents the natural variability of mice [36]. Nevertheless, even pooling samples maintains the randomness of antibody gene selection and rearrangement and a pool of four individuals still has relative uniqueness. Some have suggested that V-gene segment usage may be skewed [45]. Chi-square analyses of VH- and Vκ-gene segment use in our data set would support this contention since several VH and Vκ-gene segments were used more frequently than expected. Even though we have analyzed three independent biological samples made of pools of four mice, we recognize that an even larger data set will be needed to conclusively settle this discussion. Studies on humans have revealed similar V(D)J usage in spite of them being outbred populations [27] which also supports that there is some inherent selection in V-gene selection regardless of genetics. Additional studies looking at epigenetic changes or other transcriptional regulatory elements such as the characterization performed by Choi et al. [46] might also help understand mechanisms of V-gene segment selection. For the D-gene segment, three usage levels were detected. D1-1 was the most used gene segment in all three pools; comprising around 26% of the total repertoire. Over 36% of D-gene segments could not be identified, likely due to the short length of the D-gene segment. Nevertheless, we do see different populations of antibodies even when they do share similar D-genes segments. Some have large D-gene segments where others have little recognizable sequence. JH-gene segment usage was relatively uniform. J2 was the most common among all three pools, with over 32% use in the repertoire. J1, J3, and J4 were evenly represented among all three pools totaling between 19–27% of the repertoire. Gene segments with less than six nucleotides were unable to be identified and occur at less than 0.1% of the heavy-chain repertoire. Jκ-gene segment usage is somewhat evenly distributed among J1, J2, and J5 comprising between 25–32% of the repertoire, in agreement with the findings of Aoki-ota et al.[45], Lu et al. found a slightly different Jκ expression profile, possibly reflecting strain specific usage of Jκ [26]. As paralleled in the heavy-chain data, gene segments with less than six nucleotides were rare; occurring in less than 0.4% of the total repertoire. Constant region usage in the heavy-chain was heavily dominated by IgM, which reflects the “naïve” status of our mice. Although IgM comprised over 78% of the total identified constant regions we did see the expression of IgG, IgA and IgD. IgE was rare, being detected in only pool three. However, when compared to serum data, even in naïve mice, there was a high level of circulating IgGs, which was not reflected in spleen tissue sequencing, which instead shows very high levels of IgM [47]. This could be due to a large B-cell population in the spleen that is not secreting antibody at high levels into the bloodstream [36]. We looked at the common H-CDR3 sequences among the three mouse pools. There was little overlap; with only 75 H-CDR3s detected in all three pools and between 92 and 163 common H-CDR3s when we just looked at two pools. We detected between 4.6k to 6.2k unique sequences found only in each respective pool. While we sampled a small fraction of CDR3s present in the total antibody repertoire, Lu et al. and Greiff et al. used primer amplification to enrich for IgH transcripts and still found high CDR3 variability among individuals [26, 36].Similarly, in a study comparing monozygotic twins, Glanville et al., also demonstrated that CDR3 profiles between the individuals were quite diverse despite similar gene family usage between the twins [48]. Therefore, the pooling methodology that we employed did not significantly diminish the detection of the unique CDR3 repertoires that individuals have. When we examined the κ-CDR3 usage among the three biological samples, there was a higher proportion of common κ-CDR3s. Unique κ-CDR3s within each pool ranged from 688 to 832 CDR3 identified within all three pools and between 108 and 178 CDR3 identified in only two pools. One explanation for light-chain CDR3 length homogeneity may be selection due to light-chain editing that occurs during B-cell maturation and the need to be able to interchange the light chains. The small numbers of overlapping CDR3 sequences among our three pooled samples suggests that significant variation in the idiotypes could develop, even within an inbred population of mice and reinforces the idea of unique generation of B-cell diversity in inbred and outbred populations [27, 48]. Moreover, we were curious if the size of the total pool of B cells could be estimated from our data. Using a model of capture-recapture methodology [49], the Chapman estimator, [50] and the number of common heavy-chain CDR3 sequences seen in each of our samplings, we estimated our B-cell pool to range from 1.5–14 x 106 cells. If we assume that there are 5 x 106 B cells in a nine to eleven-week-old female C57BL/6J mouse spleen, and our mouse pools were made up of four spleens, this estimate of the possible splenic B-cell pool is reasonably accurate, especially if we take into account some of the CDR3 sequences were detected multiple times (multiple B cells with the same IgH). While CDR3 is commonly used to describe the antibody repertoire, many studies have reported the combinations of the V(D)J [20, 44, 51–53]. Compiling CDR3 nucleotide alignments allowed us to visualize the significance of individual gene segment involvement with the CDR3 in the context of specific V(D)J combinations. Sequencing outside of CDR3 also can reveal biologically relevant information about antigen binding and allows for further characterization of B-cell ontogeny. Our approach allowed us to identify V(D)J-gene segments in addition to the constant region and provided insight into the pairing of V-gene segments with (D)J-gene segments. The information about the unchallenged Ig-gene repertoire also has other uses. It provides a comparative foundation when looking at host response to antigen [54] and has been used to isolated therapeutic antibodies. Antibodies for influenza in a mouse model and were a valuable tool in the detection of antigen specific responses [16, 34]. While a lack of amplification may extricate primer bias, we knew that it would come at the cost of potentially excluding rare B-cell clones. In humans, for example, a single clone may only comprise 0.1% to 0.3% of the repertoire [55]. We have explored the differences between samples that have and have not been amplified and found a moderate correlation (R2 = 0.5815, 0.5855, p<0.0001, Rettig et al., In Revision). While some of the differences arose from expected depth-of-sequencing issues, we unexpectedly found that discrepancies also resulted from gene segments being detected in the unamplified data set not detected in the amplified data sets (Rettig et al., In Revision). It is also important to note that the number of immunoglobulin reads detected in our RNASeq library equaled or exceeded those in other HTS studies [55]. Therefore, we are aware of the tradeoffs and benefits of the HTS strategy we have used. Another issue which may affect the data presented stems from the use of whole spleen tissue rather than isolated B-cell populations [34]. Although our approach was necessary to accommodate requirements of a separate investigation [35], we are aware that the inclusion of extraneous cells as result of using whole tissue could reduce the recovery of rare B-cell clones. In addition, some bias might be introduced because of cell subpopulation stability and frequency in whole spleen tissue [56, 57]. Nevertheless, in spite of the limitations of our methodology, it appears that the repertoire we detected correlated with mouse studies that have used selection and amplification methods of various kinds. For example, Collins et al. detected five of the same VH genes that we detected among our highest 10 used VH-gene segments. JH2 was also the most frequently detected in both of our studies [33]. Yang and Kaplinski detected V-gene segment use that paralleled our findings with V1-26 identified by them as the most frequently used [11, 42]. Few studies have explored the light chain repertoire; however, more characterization will be possible with increasing use of single cell amplification [58–60]. While strain specificity has been reported [33, 36], many Vκ-gene segments that were represented over one-percent of the time in unimmunized BALB/c mice were also identified in our study [26]. Aoki-Ota et al. also noted Vκ-gene segment skewing in their assessment of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice [45]. These similarities also suggest that the lack of amplification did not dramatically affect our assessment of the B-cell repertoire, and the differences seen are likely due to mouse-to-mouse variation that still manifests in our pooled samples. In conclusion, we have presented an unamplified view of the conventionally housed, unimmunized, antibody repertoire. It appears that an RNASeq approach without amplification can provide an accurate assessment of V-gene use as well as a snapshot of the CDR3 present in the population; and helps validate this as a reasonable scientific approach. In addition, we lay the foundation for future work in our lab to characterize the unamplified whole tissue repertoire of the immunized C57BL/6 mouse.Supporting information S1 FigV gene segment rankings among the three mouse pools for both IgH (A) and Igκ (B).

    "abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Igκ gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.

    "introduction": "1. Introduction Spaceflight presents a unique set of challenges to the immune system. For example, spaceflight alters T- and B-lymphocyte functions, including recall responses in astronauts aboard the space shuttle and cytokine responses after missions to the international space station (ISS) (Berry, 1970, Crucian et al., 2013, Crucian et al., 2014b, Grigoriev et al., 1993, Stein and Schluter, 1994, Taylor and Dardano, 1983, Taylor et al., 1986, Rykova et al., 2008). In addition to functional changes, lymphocyte subpopulations are altered. CD8+ T-cell numbers were increased during flight while other T-cell subsets were decreased (Crucian et al., 2013). Similar changes in phenotype also occur in animal and tissue culture systems during spaceflight or ground-based spaceflight analogs such as anti-orthostatic suspension (AOS) (Chapes et al., 1993, Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016, Crucian et al., 2014a, Nickerson et al., 2003, Sonnenfeld, 2005). Lymphocyte subpopulations change in response to spaceflight (Allebban et al., 1994, Chapes et al., 1999a, Gridley et al., 2009, Gridley et al., 2013, Ichiki et al., 1996, Pecaut et al., 2003, Sonnenfeld et al., 1990, Sonnenfeld et al., 1992) and AOS (Gaignier et al., 2014, Wei et al., 2003). Splenic T- and B-lymphocyte counts were decreased in mice flown on the 13-day mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavor (STS-118) compared to ground controls (Gridley et al., 2009). In the AOS model, Wei et al. found a reduced number of both T and B lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen of hindlimb unloaded Balb/c mice compared to normal controls (Wei et al., 2003). Reductions in the mass of lymphoid organs has also been observed (Armstrong et al., 1993, Baqai et al., 2009, Chapes et al., 1999b, Chapes et al., 1999a, Congdon et al., 1996, Durnova et al., 1976, Gaignier et al., 2014, Grove et al., 1995, Pecaut et al., 2000). Spaceflight altered the phenotype of immune cells in the bone marrow, the lymphoid organ in which hematopoiesis occurs (Ortega et al., 2009), and AOS reduced the number of bone marrow B-cell progenitors (Lescale et al., 2015). While many studies have characterized T-cell response to spaceflight (Chapes et al., 1999a, Cooper et al., 2001, Grove et al., 1995, Lesnyak et al., 1993, Lesnyak et al., 1996, Nash et al., 1992, Nash and Mastro, 1992, Sanzari et al., 2013, Sonnenfeld et al., 1998, Cogoli et al., 1984, Cogoli-Greuter, 2004, Chang et al., 2012, Gridley et al., 2009, Hwang et al., 2015, Martinez et al., 2015, Tauber et al., 2015), fewer studies have characterized the impact of spaceflight on B-cell populations. The characterization of B-cell receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Igs), is of particular interest due to the (IgH) and light chains, which are encoded on separate loci (Tonegawa, 1983). The heavy chain locus encodes multiple Variable- (V), Diversity- (D) and Joining- (J) gene segments, while the functionally equivalent κ (Igκ) and (Ig) light chain loci contain only V- and J-gene segments (Early et al., 1980, Sakano et al., 1979). During early B-cell development in the bone marrow, B cells undergo recombination of heavy and light chain Ig loci, in which only one of each V(D)J-gene segment is selected for Ig use (Hozumi and Tonegawa, 1976, Tonegawa, 1983). Random and palindromic nucleotide insertion at splice sites adds to Ig diversity (Alt et al., 1984, Gilfillan et al., 1993, Komori et al., 1993). In the Ig molecule, complementarity determining regions (CDR) confer binding specificity. CDR1 and CDR2 are encoded entirely within the V-gene segment, while CDR3 contains a portion of the 3’ end of the V-gene segment, the entire D-gene segment, and a portion of the 5’ end of the J gene segment (Kabat et al., 1979, Tonegawa, 1983, Xu and Davis, 2000). As a result of somatic recombination, B cells collectively express individual Igs that theoretically can bind virtually any pathogen. An individual’s Ig repertoire can be characterized using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using either genomic DNA or messenger RNA sequences isolated from B-cell populations (Georgiou et al., 2014, Rettig et al., 2017, Wardemann, 2017). B cells will clonally expand after antigen-Ig receptor engagement, resulting in a higher portion of target-specific Ig receptors within the B-cell population. There have been a number of HTS-based Ig repertoire studies in human disease, ranging from infectious disease (Ademokun et al., 2011, Khurana et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2016, Parameswaran et al., 2013), autoimmunity (Tan et al., 2014, Tan et al., 2016, Zuckerman et al., 2010), and cancer (Bashford-Rogers et al., 2016, Jiang et al., 2015, Logan et al., 2011, Montesinos-Rongen et al., 2014, Tschumper et al., 2012). Greiff, et al. developed a profiling framework using the Ig repertoire as an indicator of an individual's immunological status (Greiff et al., 2015). Some have explored the impact of spaceflight on Ig repertoires. In vitro challenge of human B cells during spaceflight resulted in lower concentrations of secreted Ig (Fitzgerald et al., 2009). There was no significant difference in pre- and post-flight Ig levels in peripheral blood of astronauts who flew aboard the ISS (Stowe et al., 1999, Rykova et al., 2008, Voss, 1984). These samples, however, were not taken after challenge with a specific antigen. Rats immunized intraperitoneally with sheep red blood cells prior to spaceflight produced significantly less serum IgG compared to immunized ground control animals (Lesnyak et al., 1993). Although some have explored Ig gene segment changes in the context of spaceflight or model analogs (Boxio et al., 2005, Bascove et al., 2009, Bascove et al., 2011, Huin-Schohn et al., 2013), little has been done to characterize the impact of spaceflight on the Ig repertoire in mice. Given that changes in B cells and Ig concentrations occur during spaceflight conditions, we tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the Ig repertoire of mice flown on the ISS. We examined individual Ig gene segment usage, gene segment combinations, CDR3 composition, and frame work and CDR mutations in 35-week-old, unimmunized, female C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS using high throughput sequencing.",
    "methods": "2. Materials and Methods 2.1 Tissue Samples RNA samples were provided by the NASA Ames Research Center. RNA was extracted from the spleen and liver of 35-week-old female C57BL/6Tac mice that were either housed in the ISS environmental simulator (ground control, n=5), or flown aboard the ISS via SpaceX-4 (n=5). Tissues from flight animals were collected on board the ISS 21–22 days post-launch in flight animals while tissues from ground control animals were processed similarly on a four-day delay. Upon collection, spleens and livers were stored at 4°C in RNAlater (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) for at least 24 hours and then stored at −80°C. RNA extraction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions with the RNeasy mini column (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and stored at −80°C. This was a secondary science experiment and the dissection and timing of the experiment were dictated by the primary validation experiment. Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NASA Ames Research Center. 2.2 Illumina MiSeq Sequencing RNA samples were subjected to Illumina MiSeq sequencing at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility as previously outlined in Rettig et al (Rettig et al., 2017). Briefly, sequencing was performed using the standard MiSeq protocol which includes oligo-dT-bead selection and reverse transcription of mRNA to cDNA. Ig-specific primer amplification was not utilized. Additionally, fragmentation was limited to one minute to reduce fragmentation and maintain longer reads. Illumina MiSeq with paired reads of 300 base pairs was performed on size selected (275–800 nt) total RNA isolated from the liver and spleen of three ground control and three flight animals based on highest RIN values (Spleen RIN:5.9–8.9, Liver RIN: 6.2–7.8) (Ground animals: G1, G2, G3; Flight animals: F1, F2, F3). Illumina MiSeq data from both spleen and liver are available by NASA GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov, GLDS-ID Pending). 2.3 Bioinformatic Workflow Illumina MiSeq sequencing reads were processed as described previously (Rettig et al., 2017). Briefly, FASTQ files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v9.5.1 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) and were quality trimmed and filtered to remove sequences less than 40 nt in length to prevent false V-gene segment assignment. Paired-end sequences and overlapping-paired (merged) sequences were mapped to both V-gene segment references obtained from the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database (251 IgH segments, 135 Igκ segments), and to entire IgH and Igκ loci obtained from  (NC_000078.6, 113258768 to 116009954, and NC_000072.6, 67555636 to 70726754, respectively). Mapped sequencing reads were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for characterization of functionality and junctional analysis. Only one sequence per sequencing cluster was retained for further analysis as outlined in Rettig et al (Rettig et al., 2017). Briefly, per sequencing organization ID, the read with the most information is saved for further analysis. Antibody sequences can differ by as little as a single nucleotide and without a unique barcoding step during amplification, removing similar, but not identical sequences, could limit the breadth of the repertoire sampled. Due to this, no further filtering was performed on sequences. A motif search was performed in CLC on IgH sequences that were identified by IMGT as productive to determine their respective constant regions. 2.4 Gene Segment Usage Sequencing reads were analyzed using the IMGT HighV-Quest tool (Alamyar et al., 2012). V-gene segment usage was characterized as either productive or unknown functionality, where a read was considered productive if it was in frame and did not contain a premature stop codon as defined by IMGT. Sequences that did not fit the C-xx-W motif in non-class switched H-CDR3 or C-xx-F in κ-CDR3 were assigned an unknown functionality. D- and J-gene segment, and constant region usage was assessed in productive reads only. All gene segments considered functional by IMGT (includes open reading frames and gene segments without full  mapping) were included in this analysis. Reads assigned to multiple C57BL/6 V-gene segments were tabulated using a weighted distribution Reads containing only one possible V-gene segment were assigned a count of one. Reads containing two possible V-gene segments were assigned a count of 0.5 for each potential V-gene segment. Reads containing more than two potential V-gene segments were excluded from V-gene analysis. Multiple V-gene segment assignments likely resulted from reads containing less than a full V-gene segment as a result of random hexamer priming. Reads assigned to a single non-C57BL/6 D/J-gene segments or multiple C57BL/6 D/J-gene segments were reclassified as undetermined and kept for analysis. J-gene segments in which less than six nucleotides were identified were also classified as undetermined. Percent of repertoire was determined for each individual animal by dividing the number of sequencing reads for each gene segment by the total number of sequencing reads mapped to all gene segments. 2.5 Gene Segment Combination & CDR3 Analysis Reads assigned to non-C57BL/6 V-gene segments or multiple C57BL/6 V-gene segments were removed from our V(D)J combination analyses. V(D)J combination analyses were performed on productive sequencing reads and visualized through the use of bubble charts (Microsoft Excel) and/or circos graphs from Circos Online (Krzywinski et al., 2009). Percent repertoire was used to detail individual bubble charts and the average of percent repertoire was used when combining mice from each treatment group for V(D)J bubble chart analysis. CDR3 amino acid sequence was presented as percent of repertoire as described above and by a highest to lowest ranking of abundance. CDR3 nucleotide alignments were created using the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program (Katoh et al., 2002). A V-D-J-gene segment combination was selected from the top ten percent most-represented gene segments across all individuals for both heavy and light chain. From each individual group, unique nucleotide sequences were isolated and aligned to their respective germline sequences provided by IMGT. Individual alignments were then stacked within their treatment groups and germline gaps were adjusted for consistency across treatment groups. 2.6 Complementarity Determining and Framework Region Mutation Analysis Nucleotide substitution mutation data for complementarity determining and framework regions for IgH and Igκ were obtained from the IMGT HighV-Quest tool. Any mutations involving degenerate bases were removed. Nucleotide range (in base pairs), number of reads containing at least one mutation, total number of substitution mutations, and number of mutations per base pair position were determined for each region. Comparative values for each combination of region, Ig location, and treatment group were determined by calculating the average of values contained in each combination’s respective replicates (n=3). 2.7 Statistical Analysis and Representation of Data All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad (version 6.0). Dot plots and bar graphs were generated in GraphPad using mean values and standard deviation. Heat maps of gene segment usage were generated in Microsoft Excel.",
    "results": "3 Results 3.1 V-Gene Segment Usage B cells originate in the bone marrow from hematopoietic precursors, traffic through the periphery and enter the spleen where they are further selected and mature (Loder et al., 1999). To view a snapshot of the impact that spaceflight has on the splenic Ig repertoire of unimmunized mice, we sequenced total splenic RNA isolated from three ground control animals and three animals flown aboard the ISS. We assessed the composition of individual IgH and Igκ sequences. In spleen, between 104,135 and 149,675 IgH, and between 103,841 and 175,406 Igκ sequencing reads of productive or unknown functionality were detected in ground animals, while between 66,909 and 181,703 IgH, and between 81,889 and 107,928 Igκ were detected in flight animals (Table 1).

The V-gene segment contributes to the combinatorial diversity of the Ig repertoire in part due to the large number of possible V-gene segments that could be selected within an individual B cell. Among the six study animals 133 VH- and 108 Vκ-gene segments were detected. Overall, the frequency of highly abundant V-gene segments and less frequently identified V-gene segments were similar between treatment groups (Supplementary Figure 1). Despite a general similarity, a pairwise comparison of animals within treatment groups showed low-to-moderate levels of VH-gene segment correlation (Ground R2: 0.356–0.695, p-values:<0.001; Flight R2: 0.101–0.360, p-values:0.0001-<0.0001) that demonstrates that there is animal-to-animal variation (Table 2). A stronger correlation was seen in Vκ-gene segments (Ground R2: 0.660–0.738, p-values <0.0001; Flight R2: 0.465–0.606, p-values <0.0001) (Table 2). When comparing the average abundance of V-gene segments from ground and flight animals an R2 of 0.592 was observed in VH (p=<0.0001) and 0.810 was observed in Vκ (p=<0.0001) (Table 2). Table 2. Comparison of Flight and Ground V-Gene Segment Usage Comparison VH R2 Vκ R2 G1 v G2 0.620 0.660 G2 v G3 0.356 0.738 G1 v G3 0.695 0.678 F1 v F2 0.101 0.465 F2 v F3 0.225 0.516 F1 v F3 0.360 0.606 Mean G v F 0.592 0.810 Open in a new tab Pairwise linear regressions of VH- and Vκ-gene segment usage were performed among ground control (G) and flight (F) animals. A linear regression was performed on the mean-average V gene segment of ground and flight treatment groups. aAll comparison groups were correlated (p≤0.0001) When comparing VH-gene usage among all animals, nine gene segments represented over five percent of the repertoire in at least one animal (Figure 1A). No one gene segment was found at over the five percent level in all six animals. V1-53 was found in over five percent in five animals, V9-3 was over five percent in four animals, V1-26 and V3–6 in two animals, and the remaining (V1-78, V6-3, V5-4, V1-15, V1-19) were found at high levels in only one animal. Figure 1. Expression of Top V-Gene Segments. Open in a new tab (A) VH- and (B) Vκ-gene segment usage for gene segments representing over five-percent of the repertoire in at least one animal within ground and flight treatment groups. No significant difference in individual gene segment usage was detected between ground control and flight treatment groups (Student’s t-test, 0.1534<p-value<0.9609). Significant differences between gene segment usage of combined ground and flight animals were found. In IgH, V1-53 was more abundant than many of the top V-gene segments (V1-78, V5-4, V1-15, V1-19); (Student’s t-test, all p<0.05). In Igκ, V5-39 was more abundant than many of the top V-gene segments (V3-4, V2-137, V1-110, V4-6, V6-2); (Student’s t-test, all p<0.05).Within Vκ, six gene segments represented over five percent of the repertoire in at least one animal (Figure 1B). The most abundant gene segment, V5–39 comprised over 16 percent of Vκ usage in all six animals. No other Vκ represented over five percent of the repertoire in all six animals. One gene segment, V3–4, was found at over five percent of the repertoire in four animals (G1, G2, G3, F3). The remaining four gene segments (V2–137, V1-110, V4–61, and V6–25) were found at greater than five percent in only one animal. There was no statistical difference in top VH- or Vκ-gene segment usage between ground and flight animals (student’s t-test, p=0.6478–0.9609). We also attempted to assess the antibody repertoire in the liver because of its role in fetal B-cell development. Only 592 to 1,429 Igκ sequencing reads were detected in ground control animals and 425 to 543 Igκ sequencing reads were detected in flight animals (Table 3). We did not characterize the heavy chain in the liver due to the low number of IgH sequencing reads that we detected. We assessed Vκ-gene segments that represented over five percent of the repertoire in the spleen or liver and found 11 gene segments. Only one gene segment, V5–39, was found in the top five across both tissues (Figure 2). V3–4 was found in the top five for all animals and tissues except flight mouse two’s liver sample, where it was ranked tenth. Overall, the average usage of these top Vκ-gene segments showed low to modest correlation between liver and spleen in ground animals (R2= 0.4081, p<0.0001) and flight animals (R2= 0.2727, p<0.0001). Analysis of statistical differences between individual Vκ-gene segments representing over five percent of the repertoire was not undertaken due to low read counts in the liver datasets. Table 3.

Figure 2. Expression of Top-Vκ Gene Segments from Spleen and Liver. Open in a new tab Vκ-gene segment usage for gene segments representing over five-percent of the repertoire in at least one animal from the liver or spleen of ground or flight animals are presented by rank. Liver ground (LG) and liver flight (LF) rankings are shown to the left and spleen ground (SG) and spleen flight (SF) rankings are shown to the right. V-gene segments are listed most frequent to least frequent. Dark red indicates higher rank moving to blue, lower percent rank. 3.2 D- and J-Gene Segment & Constant Region Usage Heavy chain Ig diversity is also achieved by using, modifying and splicing of D-and J-gene segments. To determine if space flight affected these processes we also assessed D- and J-gene usage. The most commonly detected D-gene segment in both ground control and flight animals was D1-1, comprising between 30.6% to 46.8% of the repertoire (Figure 3A, Supplemental Figure 2A). D2-4, D2-3, D4-1, and D2-5 were detected at similar levels among ground control and flight animals between 3.56% and 11.39% of the repertoire. D3-1, D3-2, D6-3, D5-5, and D5-2, and D6-4 were detected the least often with levels between 3.6% and >0.003% of the repertoire. Because of extensive modification of D-gene segments during IgH rearrangement, D-gene segments were unable to be determined for between 24.4% and 36.6% of the repertoire for all animals. There was no statistical difference in D-gene segment usage between ground and flight animals (student’s t-test, p=0.1542–0.9840). D-gene segment usage was highly correlated between ground and flight animals (linear regression, R2- 0.9935, p<0.0001). Figure 3. Expression of D and J-Gene segments and IgH Constant Region Usage. Open in a new tab (A) D-gene segment, (B) JH-gene segment, (C) Jκ-gene segment, and (D) IgH constant region usage in animals within ground and flight treatment groups are presented as percent of repertoire. No significant difference in individual gene segment usage was detected between ground control and flight treatment groups (Student’s t-test, D: 0.1542<p-value<0.9840, JH: 0.2060<p-value<0.8662, IgH Constant Region: 0.1075<p-value<0.8277, Jκ: 0.0977<p-value<0.9262). D1-1 was used at a significantly higher rate that all other D-gene segments (Students t-test, all significant p<0.05). No significant differences between JH-gene segment usage was found (Student’s t-test, all p<0.05). In Igκ, significant differences in expression were found between all gene segments except between J1 and J2 (Student’s t-test, all significant p<0.05).Additional Ig variability is gained from the inclusion of different J-gene segments. Within IgH, the distribution of J-gene segment usage was less uniform than D-gene segment usage in both ground and flight animals. There was no consensus on the most abundantly expressed gene segment as each of the four JH-gene segments was the most abundant segment in at least one ground or flight animal (Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure 2B). While there was no consensus use of a particular J-gene segment, usage of any J-gene segment was between 13% and 40%, showing that usage is relatively uniform. Student’s t-tests were performed to determine whether differences in individual gene segment usage were significant. No significant differences were found between ground and flight animals (student’s t-test, p=0.2060–0.8662). As the most abundant Jκ -gene segment, J5, comprises between 32.6% and 47.9% of the repertoire, and is the most abundant gene segment all study animals (Figure 3C, Supplemental Figure 2C). Interesting J1 ranked second most abundant in all ground animals while it ranked third in all flight animals. There were no statistical differences in individual JH- or Jκ-gene segment usage between ground control and flight animals (Student’s t-test, p=0.0977–0.9262). Linear regression revealed correlation between JH usage of ground and flight animals for Igκ (R2= 0.9928, p=0.0076) and IgH (R2=0.8147, p=0.0360). Ig isotype composition can provide insight into the developmental stage of B cells. Because animals in this experiment were specific-pathogen free, it is unsurprising that IgM predominated with between 62.38% and 82.81% of the repertoire (Figure 3D, Supplemental Figure 2D). IgG was the second most prominent isotype which trended towards a higher percentage of the repertoire in flight animals although the difference was not statistically significant (Student’s t-test, p=0.2150). Except for a relatively high expression of IgA in flight mouse two, IgA was detected in between 1.43% and 4.58% of the repertoire, IgD and IgE were detected less than one percent in all animals. There were no statistical differences in Ig isotype frequency between ground and flight animals (Student’s t-test, p=0.1075–0.8277). There was a high correlation between ground and flight constant region usage (linear regression, R2= 0.9734, p=0.0019). 3.3 V(D)J Combinations V(D)J family combinations were examined as another way to determine if recombination of Ig gene segments was affected by spaceflight. We visualized V(D)J-gene segment combinations using both bubble charts and circos plots for both IgH and Igκ. IgH showed more variation between ground control and flight animals compared to Igκ when looking at the most common gene family combinations. Circos plots allowed us to examine top V-gene families, J-gene segments, and V/J pairing frequency in both IgH and Igκ. For ease of display, we first grouped together all V-gene segments into their respective family. D- and J-gene segments remained as individuals. V1 was the most common IgH gene family used in all mice comprising, on average 51% of the V-gene family use in ground animals and, on average, 57% of the repertoire in flight animals (Figure 4A–B, Supplemental Figure 3A–F). In ground-treatment animals, V9 was the second most common gene family in ground mouse one and ground mouse two, while V2 was the second most common gene family in ground mouse three (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3A–C). In flight animals, the second most common V-gene family used was unique among the three animals (flight one: V3, flight two: V2, and flight three: V9) (Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure 4D–F). The third most common V-gene family was also unique among the ground treatment animals being V2, V3, and V9 for ground mouse one, ground mouse two, and ground mouse three respectively (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3A–C). V5 was the third most common family in flight mouse one, V9 in flight mouse two, and V2 in flight mouse three (Figure 4B, Supplemental 3D–F). Figure 4. Gene Segment Combinations in Ground Control and Flight Animals. Open in a new tab (A, B) Average IgH V/D/J combinations (bubble chart) and the V/J combinations (Circos plot) for ground treatment (A) animals and (B) flight animals. For bubble charts, V-gene family is represented along the x-axis, the D-gene segment is represented along the y-axis, and the J-gene segment is represented by a specific color. The size of the bubble corresponds to the average percent repertoire of the specific gene combination. Circos plots are read clockwise starting at the 12 o’clock position with J1 (red), J2, J3, J4, U, V1 (lime green), V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8 (light blue), V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, and V15 (sliver, no color). (C,D) Average Igκ V/J combinations for ground treatment (C) animals and (D) flight animals. For bubble charts, V-gene family is represented along the x-axis and J-gene segment is represented along the x axis. The size of the bubble corresponds to the average percent repertoire of the specific gene combination. Circos plots are read clockwise starting at the 12 o’clock position with J1 (red), J2, J4, J5, U, V1 (yellow), V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7 (sliver, no color), V8, V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, V15, V16, V17, V18, V19 (light purple).We found that the most common V/D/J combinations were correlated with the most frequently used gene families or segments within the repertoire. When averaging among repertoires, the most common IgH combination in ground-treatment animals was V9/D1/J1 (8.66%), though this combination was only in the top five most frequent combinations in ground mouse one and ground mouse two. The most common average combination in flight-treatment animals was V1/D1/J4 (8.35%), though this combination was only detected in the five most common combinations for one animal (Figure 4A–B, Supplemental Figure 4A–B). The V1/D1/J2 combination was shared among the top five gene family combinations in all mice; representing 5.94% of the repertoire in ground-treatment animals and 7.73% in the flight-treatment animals (Supplemental Figure 4A–B). A notable difference between ground and flight treatment groups was the usage of the V9-gene family. This family represented the top average VH-gene family used in the ground-treatment animals as well as the top combination in ground mouse one and ground mouse two (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 4A), but only appeared once as the top gene family combination used for flight-treatment animals (Figure 4B, Supplemental Figure 4B). We also examined the top five V/J pairing frequencies for IgH (Figure 4A–B, Supplemental Figure 3A–F, Supplemental Figure 4C–D). For ground animals, there were six unique pairings represented. The V1 family was used for four of the six unique V/J pairings compiled. V9 and V2 were also used. Of the six unique pairings, four were shared among all three mice (V1/J1, V1/J2, V1/J3, and V1/J4). One was shared among two mice (V9/J1), and one (V2/J4) was found only in ground mouse three’s five most common combinations (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3A–C, Supplemental Figure 4C). For flight animals, seven unique pairings where found in the five most common pairs. V1 was again the overwhelmingly most common V family with four of the seven unique pairings including it. V3, V2, and V9 were all used by a single animal. Of the seven unique pairs, four were shared among all three mice (V1/J1, V1/J2, V1/J3, and V1/J4). These pairings were also among the most common in the ground-treatment group. Three (V3/J3, V2/J4, V9/J1) were found in a single mouse’s five most common pairings (Figure 4B, Supplemental Figure 3D–F, Supplemental Figure 4D). We undertook similar analysis for Igκ sequences (Figure 4C–D, Supplemental Figure 3G–L, Supplemental Figure 4E–F). The most common Vκ-gene family expressed in all mice was V5, representing over one-fifth of the repertoire. The second most common Vκ-gene family in ground animals was V3 while in flight animals it was V6 or V4 (Figure 4C–D, Supplemental Figure 3G–L, Supplemental Figure 4E–F). The third most represented Vκ-gene families was V6 for ground mouse one, and V4 for ground mouse two, and V2 for mouse three (Figure 4C, Supplemental Figure 4G–I). In flight animals, the third most common Vκ-gene family was V4 for flight mouse one, and V3 for flight mouse two and three (Figure 4D, Supplemental Figure 4J–L). Unlike IgH, Igκ expressed more variety in V/J pairing variety. In Igκ there were five pairings in ground animals (V2/J4, V3/J2, V3/J5, V5/J1, V6/J2) that were not shared with the top five flight-animal pairings (Figure 4C–D, Supplemental Figure 3G–L, Supplemental Figure 4E–F). There were also four pairings (V1/J2, V4/J2, V6/J1, V6/J4) found in flight animals not found in the top five ground-animal pairings (Figure 4C–D, Supplemental Figure 3G–L, Supplemental Figure 4E–F). The correlation of the average percent of repertoire for V/J combinations between ground and flight animals was higher in Igκ, with a R2 of 0.8795 (p<0.0001), whereas IgH had a R2 of 0.3296 (p<0.0001) (linear regression). V/J combination usage among animals within each treatment group also showed stronger correlation within Igκ than IgH in both ground and flight treatment groups (Table 4). Table 4.

Therefore, we assessed whether spaceflight had an impact on several properties of CDR3 because changes in CDR3 could affect host ability to respond to antigen. We found that CDR3 length in IgH was highly varied. The length ranged from one amino acid to 35 (Figure 5A). The average CDR3 lengths for all the ground control animals was 12±0. The average CDR3 lengths for flight animals was also 12±1. The CDR3 lengths were not normally distributed in the flight or ground animals (flight p=<0.0001, ground p=0.0128) with the majority of CDR3 lengths falling between 11 and 14 AAs. We also examined the heavy-chain CDR3 length by isotype (Table 5) and by treatment group. We found no significant difference by treatment group or by isotype (two-way ANOVA, interaction p=0.8141, isotype p=0.4589, treatment p=0.6225). Figure 5. CDR3 Length in IgH and Igκ sequences.

Assessment by two-way ANOVA revealed no significant differences in CDR3 length by treatment group (p=0.6225), isotype (p=0.4589), or the interaction of the two variablesKappa-chain CDR3 length was conserved at nine amino acids with 90.3 to 94.2 percent of all light chains having CDR3 rearrangements that were nine amino acids in length (Figure 5B). Only a small percentage of light chains had eight amino acids (2.8 to 6.9%), or ten amino acid long (0.9–3.9%) CDR3s. Ground mouse one (0.9%), was an exception and was enriched for 11 amino acid CDR3s (2.3%) compared to other animals (0.2–0.7%). CDR3 lengths over 18 amino acids were not displayed (20, 25, 27, 29, 32, 35, 36, 37, 39). CDR3 rearrangements of these lengths were often only detected in one animal and expression of these lengths did not exceed 0.01% of the repertoire. Additionally, these rearrangements may have been identified in error as many of these rearrangements contain intervening phenylalanine residues within the There was little overlap among IgH CDR3s regardless of treatment (Figure 6A, C). Of the top five CDR3s found in each animal, we identified 26 unique CDR3 AA rearrangements. Of those 26 CDR3s, four were found in all six animals. Two additional rearrangements were identified in three animals. One of those rearrangements, CASHGSSYLAWFAYW, was found in only flight animals and not found in any ground animals. Six CDR3s were found in two animals, and the remainder were found in a single animal. The vast majority of CDR3 rearrangements detected were unique to each animal (6,661–9,270 rearrangements), though there was a small amount of overlap among animals (103–163 CDR3 rearrangements). For flight animals, 78 CDR3 rearrangements were found in all three animals and 70 were found in all three ground animals. Of the rearrangements found in all three animals per treatment group, only 20 rearrangements were detected in all six animals. Figure 6. Top CDR3 Usage and Overlap of CDR3 Between Treatment Animals. Open in a new tab Venn diagrams show the overlap of unique CDR3 sequences among and between ground control (G1-G3) and flight treatment (F1-F3) groups in (A) IgH and (B) Igκ. CDR3 sequences were ranked within the top 5 most abundant rearrangements of any ground control or flight animals in (C) IgH and (D) Igκ. Dark red indicates higher percent of repertoire moving to blue, which represents lower percent of repertoire.There was considerable overlap in the top five Igκ CDR3 rearrangements of each animal (Figure 6B, D). Seventeen total top CDR3 rearrangements were identified and all CDR3 rearrangements were identified in every animal. One CDR3 was the most abundant rearrangements in five animals (CQNGHSFPLTF), still ranking third in the remaining animal (F1). Ground control and flight animals shared three rearrangements that ranked within the top 20 CDR3 in all animals. Overall, between 1,590–2,933 unique CDR3 were detected in ground control animals, and between 1,461–1,818 unique CDR3 were detected in all flight animals (Figure 6). Of the 725 and 579 CDR3 shared in all three ground control and flight animals, respectively, 446 were shared between all six ground and flight animals. A CDR3 rearrangement nucleotide sequence alignment of one of the top V-D-J-gene segment combinations demonstrates significant variability among mice such that any variability between ground and flight treatment groups cannot be determined with confidence (Figure 7). Additional data sets are needed in order to assess the effect of spaceflight on CDR3 formation. Figure 7. Nucleotide Alignment of CDR3 from top V-D-J Combination. Open in a new tab Nucleotide alignment of heavy-chain gene segment V1-26*01/D1-1*01/J1*03 across individuals in ground (G1 - A, G2 - C, G3 - E) and flight (F1 - B, F2 - D, F3 - F) treatment groups. Brackets in the germline region of the first individual in each treatment group delineate V- and J-gene regions. These bracketed regions remain the same across all individuals in the treatment group. 3.5 Mutations in Complementarity Determining and Framework Regions We also examined mutation frequencies in CDR and framework (FW) regions for each animal because mutations can affect Ig specificity. Mutation frequencies were normalized by animal and Ig region (FW1-3, CDR1-3) by dividing the percent of total substitution mutations (total mutations/total productive reads) by respective region length (Figure 8). There were no significant differences between the mutation frequencies of ground control and flight animals for any of the Ig regions in both IgH (Student’s t-test, 0.1916<p<0.9978) and Igk (Student’s t-test, 0.3175<p<0.9865). When comparing the substitution mutation frequency across Ig regions, more substitution mutations occurred in CDR3 compared to other regions in IgH and Igκ (ANOVA; all p<0.05). Figure 8. Substitution Mutations by Ig Region. Open in a new tab Total number of substitution mutations in FRs 1–3 and CDRs 1–3 were observed for both IgH and Igκ chains. Abundance was first normalized by region length and then by total number of cleaned, productive reads in each respective data set and multiplied by 100 to attain percent abundance.",
    "discussion": "4 Discussion Spaceflight and ground-based analog models induce phenotypic and functional changes in T- and B- lymphocyte populations. Spaceflight also affects bone marrow, the site of B-cell differentiation and development. Therefore, we wanted to know whether the stress and physiological changes associated with spaceflight would affect the normal development of the highly-diversified and highly-specific antigen receptors on B-lymphocytes. If so, the ability to respond to pathogens might be affected. We characterized the antibody repertoire of C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS and ground control animals using HTS and RNA-Seq. HTS studies of antibody repertoires typically employ polymerase chain reaction amplification of Ig specific sequences from sorted B-cell populations. We assessed the B cell repertoire in whole spleen tissue because of the limitations of the primary science, a verification flight of mouse housing hardware. This precluded the sorting of cell populations. We previously showed that similar data could be generated using whole spleen tissue compared to whole spleen cell suspensions (Rettig et al., 2017). Although we do not account for B-cell subpopulations (Yang et al., 2015, Kaplinsky et al., 2014), we do measure the total splenic Ig repertoire. Additionally, since we did not use specific amplification of Ig sequences the depth of sequencing was not as high as some have accomplished looking at Ig gene usage (Yang et al., 2015, Kaplinsky et al., 2014, Menzel et al., 2014). We have compared of amplified and unamplified data sets by our lab show reasonable correlations of the data, with more V-gene segments being detected in the unamplified data sets (Rettig 2017, In Revision). Amplification with multiplex Ig specific primers may introduce amplification bias as primers may bind with varying efficiency to V-gene segments, although there have been recent advances in experimental approach to address amplification bias (Wardemann, 2017). We also found that the type of RNA-Seq analysis we are using in the assessment of younger C57Bl/6J mouse Ig gene usage, correlated well with that of studies using amplification (Rettig et al., 2017). Therefore, we feel we have a reasonable snapshot of B-cell receptors present in the spleens of 35-week-old female mice. In addition, the sample preparation allows additional data mining of valuable mouse samples. In both humans and mice, early B-cell development occurs in the fetal liver prior to postnatal development in the bone marrow. We attempted to determine the Ig repertoire within the adult liver of the ground and flight animals in comparison to the splenic Ig repertoire. Unfortunately, few Ig sequences were recovered in liver samples suggesting few B cells are actually resident or circulating in the liver under normal, steady-state conditions. The liver kappa chain V-gene repertoire did correlate some with the usage in the spleen and probably reflects circulating B-cell Ig expression, but we did not confirm that. We focused our efforts on the spleen data. While previous analyses by our lab used splenic mRNA pooled from four animals (Rettig et al., Submitted for Publication in PLOS ONE, (Rettig et al., 2017)), the current study assessed individual mice and exhibited significantly more mouse-to-mouse variation than one might expect in inbred mice; even within treatment groups and compared to pooled mouse samples. Overall, V-gene segment usage correlated when analyzed using pairwise linear regression of animals within ground and flight treatment groups and there did not appear to be an impact of spaceflight on B-gene segment use. It is possible that differences in gene segment usage in ground and flight animals would be observed upon immunization. Studies on the effects of spaceflight in an immunized amphibian model showed altered VH-gene family and Ig class usage (Boxio et al., 2005, Bascove et al., 2009). We performed a number of analyses to determine if the Ig gene rearrangement process was affected by spaceflight. Averaged V-gene segment usage between the ground control and flight animals was moderately to highly correlated (VH: R2=0.5922, p <0.0001; Vκ: R2=0.831, p <0.0001). Many of the most abundant V-gene sequences were shared in flight and ground animals and there was no statistically significant difference in usage of individual top V-gene segments between ground control and flight animals (Student’s t-test, p=0.06478–0.9609). Similarly, no differences in D-, JH- or Jκ-gene segment usage and IgH constant region usage was seen between ground and flight animals. We also examined whether spaceflight would affect the V/J-gene segment combinations that normally occur in specific pathogen-free mice. These too, were not different between ground control and flight animals for IgH and Igκ. V/J-gene segment combinations were moderately to highly correlated (IgH: R2=0.3296, Igκ: R2=0.8795, both p<0.0001). An assessment of the impact of hypergravity on the similarly assembled T cell receptor repertoire of neonatal mice showed low correlation of individual Beta chain V- and J-gene segment recombination frequencies between control animals and animals subjected to centrifugation. 85% of gene V/J-gene segment combinations were not shared among the two treatment groups (Ghislin et al., 2015) and the differences could be attributed to changes in somatic recombination machinery under altered gravity conditions (Schenten et al., 2013, Ghislin et al., 2015). The combinatorial diversity of Ig was shown through the assessment of overall CDR3 sequence overlap among animals, as a large number of sequences were unique to only one animal. Little overlap was observed in the top 5 H-CDR3 rearrangements within all six ground and flight animals which totaled to 26 CDR3 rearrangements. Thirteen of these CDR3 rearrangements were only identified in one animal. More overlap was observed in the top 5 κ-CDR3 rearrangements within all six ground and flight animals which totaled 17 CDR3 rearrangements, which were identified in all animals. The mice studied in this investigation were not challenged and were housed under specific-pathogen free conditions. Mutational frequency in Ig is normally associated with antigen stimulation (Garcia et al., 1996). Therefore, we did not expect that these mice were undergoing high amounts of somatic mutations. The majority of the mutations detected occurred in CDR3 in both ground and flight mice. It is possible that we will see differences in mutation frequency between ground control and flight animals after experimental immune challenge. The frequency of somatic hypermutations in P. waltl immunized in space was slightly lower than animals immunized on earth (Bascove et al., 2011). An experiment with antigen challenge of the Ig repertoire will be necessary to test this hypothesis. The animals used in this experiment were older (35 weeks). The expression of genes necessary for Ig recombination do go down as mice age (Cancro, 2009). Therefore, it may be possible that we do not see differences between the treatment groups because the perturbations of spaceflight are not enough to disrupt the reduced B cell differentiations occurring in 35-week-old mice under normal steady-state conditions. Additionally, the half-life of B cells in secondary lymphoid organs is between four and seven weeks (Fulcher and Basten, 1997). Given the brief time that the mice were subjected to space flight (three weeks) it is likely that the exposure was not long enough to affect V/D/J recombination in the repertoire. Additional experiments, especially with young mice, will be needed to test this hypothesis. Animals in this experiment were older and supplied from a different vendor (Taconic) than the 9–11-week-old C57BL/6J mice from Jackson Laboratories used in our previous experiments ((Rettig et al., 2017), (Rettig et al., In Revision). To assess whether differences existed in the Ig repertoire, between the older C57BL/6Tac mice and the younger C57BL/6J mice, we compared gene segment usage between the two mouse cohorts. Because no differences in top V-gene segments, (D)J-gene segments, and constant region usage were detected between RR1 ground control and flight animals, all six animals were pooled and compared to the C57BL/6J cohort. We selected the 25 most abundant V-gene segments from both RR1 and C57BL/6J cohorts, resulting in 33 top IgHV and 34 top IgκV. We found that seven of 35 IgHV and eight of 32 IGκV were expressed at significantly different levels within the repertoire between the two cohorts (Student’s t-test). These differences are largely driven by gene segments that are highly expressed in the RR1 cohort such as IGHV1-80, which represented 2.04 ± 0.26% of the repertoire in RR1 animals and 6.6 ± 2.40% of the repertoire in the C57BL/6J cohort (Student’s t-test, p=0.0032). This is even more pronounced in IGκV5–39, which represented 21.41 ± 7.50% of the repertoire in RR1 animals and only 4.73 ± 4.93% of the repertoire in the C57BL/6J cohort (Student’s t-test, p=0.0109). We also performed a linear regression of top V-gene segment usage, which showed poor correlation between cohorts in both IgH (R2 = 0.1568, p=0.0226) and Igκ (R2 = 0.1681, p=0.0160). D-gene segment usage was only significantly different IGHD1-1, which represented 39.7 ± 5.23% of the repertoire in RR1 animals and 26.49 ± 0.94% of the repertoire in the C57BL/6J cohort (Student’s t-test, p=0.0040). We found that J-gene segment usage varied between the two cohorts in three out of five IGκJ and no differences in IGHV were detected (student’s t-test). IgH constant region usage was significantly different for IgD (RR1: 0.63 ± 0.22%, C57BL6/J: 4.60 ± 0.69%; Student’s t-test, p=0.0074) and IgG (RR1: 23.83 ± 6.19%, C57BL6/J: 9.65 ± 6.19%; Student’s t-test, p=0.0074). Although we cannot determine whether these differences are attributed to differences in vendor or differences in age, it is likely that repertoire differences are driven by a more mature Ig repertoire within the RR1 animals, as a higher percentage of IgH sequences demonstrate class switching. Both cohorts were unimmunized and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. In conclusion, we have been able to successfully characterize immunoglobulin gene segment usage and junctional diversity within the antibody repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS. Individual gene segment usage remained similar among animals within and among treatment groups, with the most abundant gene segments being conserved across all animals. Gene segment combinations and CDR3 sequences were highly varied, demonstrating the combinatorial diversity of the antibody repertoire, but that variation reflects the dynamics of individualized selection of Ig molecules and not any impact of spaceflight. A larger sample size would help solidify this conclusion, but these data provide preliminary suggestions that the recombinatorial processes that lead to the diverse Ig repertoires in mice are not affected by a short trip to and stay on the ISS. These data do not preclude that differences in the Ig repertoires of ground and flight animals will not be seen during active immunization or in younger, possibly more recombinatorily active mice. Current studies in our lab aim to characterize antibody repertoire dynamics upon antigen challenge using a murine anti-orthostatic suspension model and during a future space flight.",

Copyright notice ID: 5826609 MSID: MS928411 PMID: 29475521 The publisher's version of this article is available at Life Sci Space Res (Amst) Abstract Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Igκ gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time. Keywords: Immunoglobulin Gene Use, Next Generation Sequencing, Bioinformatics1. Introduction Spaceflight presents a unique set of challenges to the immune system. For example, spaceflight alters T- and B-lymphocyte functions, including recall responses in astronauts aboard the space shuttle and cytokine responses after missions to the international space station (ISS) (Berry, 1970, Crucian et al., 2013, Crucian et al., 2014b, Grigoriev et al., 1993, Stein and Schluter, 1994, Taylor and Dardano, 1983, Taylor et al., 1986, Rykova et al., 2008). In addition to functional changes, lymphocyte subpopulations are altered. CD8+ T-cell numbers were increased during flight while other T-cell subsets were decreased (Crucian et al., 2013). Similar changes in phenotype also occur in animal and tissue culture systems during spaceflight or ground-based spaceflight analogs such as anti-orthostatic suspension (AOS) (Chapes et al., 1993, Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016, Crucian et al., 2014a, Nickerson et al., 2003, Sonnenfeld, 2005). Lymphocyte subpopulations change in response to spaceflight (Allebban et al., 1994, Chapes et al., 1999a, Gridley et al., 2009, Gridley et al., 2013, Ichiki et al., 1996, Pecaut et al., 2003, Sonnenfeld et al., 1990, Sonnenfeld et al., 1992) and AOS (Gaignier et al., 2014, Wei et al., 2003). Splenic T- and B-lymphocyte counts were decreased in mice flown on the 13-day mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavor (STS-118) compared to ground controls (Gridley et al., 2009). In the AOS model, Wei et al. found a reduced number of both T and B lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen of hindlimb unloaded Balb/c mice compared to normal controls (Wei et al., 2003). Reductions in the mass of lymphoid organs has also been observed (Armstrong et al., 1993, Baqai et al., 2009, Chapes et al., 1999b, Chapes et al., 1999a, Congdon et al., 1996, Durnova et al., 1976, Gaignier et al., 2014, Grove et al., 1995, Pecaut et al., 2000). Spaceflight altered the phenotype of immune cells in the bone marrow, the lymphoid organ in which hematopoiesis occurs (Ortega et al., 2009), and AOS reduced the number of bone marrow B-cell progenitors (Lescale et al., 2015). While many studies have characterized T-cell response to spaceflight (Chapes et al., 1999a, Cooper et al., 2001, Grove et al., 1995, Lesnyak et al., 1993, Lesnyak et al., 1996, Nash et al., 1992, Nash and Mastro, 1992, Sanzari et al., 2013, Sonnenfeld et al., 1998, Cogoli et al., 1984, Cogoli-Greuter, 2004, Chang et al., 2012, Gridley et al., 2009, Hwang et al., 2015, Martinez et al., 2015, Tauber et al., 2015), fewer studies have characterized the impact of spaceflight on B-cell populations. The characterization of B-cell receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Igs), is of particular interest due to the (IgH) and light chains, which are encoded on separate loci (Tonegawa, 1983). The heavy chain locus encodes multiple Variable- (V), Diversity- (D) and Joining- (J) gene segments, while the functionally equivalent κ (Igκ) and (Ig) light chain loci contain only V- and J-gene segments (Early et al., 1980, Sakano et al., 1979). During early B-cell development in the bone marrow, B cells undergo recombination of heavy and light chain Ig loci, in which only one of each V(D)J-gene segment is selected for Ig use (Hozumi and Tonegawa, 1976, Tonegawa, 1983). Random and palindromic nucleotide insertion at splice sites adds to Ig diversity (Alt et al., 1984, Gilfillan et al., 1993, Komori et al., 1993). In the Ig molecule, complementarity determining regions (CDR) confer binding specificity. CDR1 and CDR2 are encoded entirely within the V-gene segment, while CDR3 contains a portion of the 3’ end of the V-gene segment, the entire D-gene segment, and a portion of the 5’ end of the J gene segment (Kabat et al., 1979, Tonegawa, 1983, Xu and Davis, 2000). As a result of somatic recombination, B cells collectively express individual Igs that theoretically can bind virtually any pathogen. An individual’s Ig repertoire can be characterized using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using either genomic DNA or messenger RNA sequences isolated from B-cell populations (Georgiou et al., 2014, Rettig et al., 2017, Wardemann, 2017). B cells will clonally expand after antigen-Ig receptor engagement, resulting in a higher portion of target-specific Ig receptors within the B-cell population. There have been a number of HTS-based Ig repertoire studies in human disease, ranging from infectious disease (Ademokun et al., 2011, Khurana et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2016, Parameswaran et al., 2013), autoimmunity (Tan et al., 2014, Tan et al., 2016, Zuckerman et al., 2010), and cancer (Bashford-Rogers et al., 2016, Jiang et al., 2015, Logan et al., 2011, Montesinos-Rongen et al., 2014, Tschumper et al., 2012). Greiff, et al. developed a profiling framework using the Ig repertoire as an indicator of an individual's immunological status (Greiff et al., 2015). Some have explored the impact of spaceflight on Ig repertoires. In vitro challenge of human B cells during spaceflight resulted in lower concentrations of secreted Ig (Fitzgerald et al., 2009). There was no significant difference in pre- and post-flight Ig levels in peripheral blood of astronauts who flew aboard the ISS (Stowe et al., 1999, Rykova et al., 2008, Voss, 1984). These samples, however, were not taken after challenge with a specific antigen. Rats immunized intraperitoneally with sheep red blood cells prior to spaceflight produced significantly less serum IgG compared to immunized ground control animals (Lesnyak et al., 1993). Although some have explored Ig gene segment changes in the context of spaceflight or model analogs (Boxio et al., 2005, Bascove et al., 2009, Bascove et al., 2011, Huin-Schohn et al., 2013), little has been done to characterize the impact of spaceflight on the Ig repertoire in mice. Given that changes in B cells and Ig concentrations occur during spaceflight conditions, we tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the Ig repertoire of mice flown on the ISS. We examined individual Ig gene segment usage, gene segment combinations, CDR3 composition, and frame work and CDR mutations in 35-week-old, unimmunized, female C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS using high throughput sequencing.2. Materials and Methods 2.1 Tissue Samples RNA samples were provided by the NASA Ames Research Center. RNA was extracted from the spleen and liver of 35-week-old female C57BL/6Tac mice that were either housed in the ISS environmental simulator (ground control, n=5), or flown aboard the ISS via SpaceX-4 (n=5). Tissues from flight animals were collected on board the ISS 21–22 days post-launch in flight animals while tissues from ground control animals were processed similarly on a four-day delay. Upon collection, spleens and livers were stored at 4°C in RNAlater (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) for at least 24 hours and then stored at −80°C. RNA extraction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions with the RNeasy mini column (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and stored at −80°C. This was a secondary science experiment and the dissection and timing of the experiment were dictated by the primary validation experiment. Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NASA Ames Research Center.2.2 Illumina MiSeq Sequencing RNA samples were subjected to Illumina MiSeq sequencing at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility as previously outlined in Rettig et al (Rettig et al., 2017). Briefly, sequencing was performed using the standard MiSeq protocol which includes oligo-dT-bead selection and reverse transcription of mRNA to cDNA. Ig-specific primer amplification was not utilized. Additionally, fragmentation was limited to one minute to reduce fragmentation and maintain longer reads. Illumina MiSeq with paired reads of 300 base pairs was performed on size selected (275–800 nt) total RNA isolated from the liver and spleen of three ground control and three flight animals based on highest RIN values (Spleen RIN:5.9–8.9, Liver RIN: 6.2–7.8) (Ground animals: G1, G2, G3; Flight animals: F1, F2, F3). Illumina MiSeq data from both spleen and liver are available by NASA GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov, GLDS-ID Pending).2.3 Bioinformatic Workflow Illumina MiSeq sequencing reads were processed as described previously (Rettig et al., 2017). Briefly, FASTQ files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v9.5.1 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) and were quality trimmed and filtered to remove sequences less than 40 nt in length to prevent false V-gene segment assignment. Paired-end sequences and overlapping-paired (merged) sequences were mapped to both V-gene segment references obtained from the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database (251 IgH segments, 135 Igκ segments), and to entire IgH and Igκ loci obtained from  (NC_000078.6, 113258768 to 116009954, and NC_000072.6, 67555636 to 70726754, respectively). Mapped sequencing reads were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for characterization of functionality and junctional analysis. Only one sequence per sequencing cluster was retained for further analysis as outlined in Rettig et al (Rettig et al., 2017). Briefly, per sequencing organization ID, the read with the most information is saved for further analysis. Antibody sequences can differ by as little as a single nucleotide and without a unique barcoding step during amplification, removing similar, but not identical sequences, could limit the breadth of the repertoire sampled. Due to this, no further filtering was performed on sequences. A motif search was performed in CLC on IgH sequences that were identified by IMGT as productive to determine their respective constant regions.2.4 Gene Segment Usage Sequencing reads were analyzed using the IMGT HighV-Quest tool (Alamyar et al., 2012). V-gene segment usage was characterized as either productive or unknown functionality, where a read was considered productive if it was in frame and did not contain a premature stop codon as defined by IMGT. Sequences that did not fit the C-xx-W motif in non-class switched H-CDR3 or C-xx-F in κ-CDR3 were assigned an unknown functionality. D- and J-gene segment, and constant region usage was assessed in productive reads only. All gene segments considered functional by IMGT (includes open reading frames and gene segments without full  mapping) were included in this analysis. Reads assigned to multiple C57BL/6 V-gene segments were tabulated using a weighted distribution Reads containing only one possible V-gene segment were assigned a count of one. Reads containing two possible V-gene segments were assigned a count of 0.5 for each potential V-gene segment. Reads containing more than two potential V-gene segments were excluded from V-gene analysis. Multiple V-gene segment assignments likely resulted from reads containing less than a full V-gene segment as a result of random hexamer priming. Reads assigned to a single non-C57BL/6 D/J-gene segments or multiple C57BL/6 D/J-gene segments were reclassified as undetermined and kept for analysis. J-gene segments in which less than six nucleotides were identified were also classified as undetermined. Percent of repertoire was determined for each individual animal by dividing the number of sequencing reads for each gene segment by the total number of sequencing reads mapped to all gene segments.2.5 Gene Segment Combination & CDR3 Analysis Reads assigned to non-C57BL/6 V-gene segments or multiple C57BL/6 V-gene segments were removed from our V(D)J combination analyses. V(D)J combination analyses were performed on productive sequencing reads and visualized through the use of bubble charts (Microsoft Excel) and/or circos graphs from Circos Online (Krzywinski et al., 2009). Percent repertoire was used to detail individual bubble charts and the average of percent repertoire was used when combining mice from each treatment group for V(D)J bubble chart analysis. CDR3 amino acid sequence was presented as percent of repertoire as described above and by a highest to lowest ranking of abundance. CDR3 nucleotide alignments were created using the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program (Katoh et al., 2002). A V-D-J-gene segment combination was selected from the top ten percent most-represented gene segments across all individuals for both heavy and light chain. From each individual group, unique nucleotide sequences were isolated and aligned to their respective germline sequences provided by IMGT. Individual alignments were then stacked within their treatment groups and germline gaps were adjusted for consistency across treatment groups.2.6 Complementarity Determining and Framework Region Mutation Analysis Nucleotide substitution mutation data for complementarity determining and framework regions for IgH and Igκ were obtained from the IMGT HighV-Quest tool. Any mutations involving degenerate bases were removed. Nucleotide range (in base pairs), number of reads containing at least one mutation, total number of substitution mutations, and number of mutations per base pair position were determined for each region. Comparative values for each combination of region, Ig location, and treatment group were determined by calculating the average of values contained in each combination’s respective replicates (n=3).2.7 Statistical Analysis and Representation of Data All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad (version 6.0). Dot plots and bar graphs were generated in GraphPad using mean values and standard deviation. Heat maps of gene segment usage were generated in Microsoft Excel.3 Results 3.1 V-Gene Segment Usage B cells originate in the bone marrow from hematopoietic precursors, traffic through the periphery and enter the spleen where they are further selected and mature (Loder et al., 1999). To view a snapshot of the impact that spaceflight has on the splenic Ig repertoire of unimmunized mice, we sequenced total splenic RNA isolated from three ground control animals and three animals flown aboard the ISS. We assessed the composition of individual IgH and Igκ sequences. In spleen, between 104,135 and 149,675 IgH, and between 103,841 and 175,406 Igκ sequencing reads of productive or unknown functionality were detected in ground animals, while between 66,909 and 181,703 IgH, and between 81,889 and 107,928 Igκ were detected in flight animals (Table 1).

The V-gene segment contributes to the combinatorial diversity of the Ig repertoire in part due to the large number of possible V-gene segments that could be selected within an individual B cell. Among the six study animals 133 VH- and 108 Vκ-gene segments were detected. Overall, the frequency of highly abundant V-gene segments and less frequently identified V-gene segments were similar between treatment groups (Supplementary Figure 1). Despite a general similarity, a pairwise comparison of animals within treatment groups showed low-to-moderate levels of VH-gene segment correlation (Ground R2: 0.356–0.695, p-values:<0.001; Flight R2: 0.101–0.360, p-values:0.0001-<0.0001) that demonstrates that there is animal-to-animal variation (Table 2). A stronger correlation was seen in Vκ-gene segments (Ground R2: 0.660–0.738, p-values <0.0001; Flight R2: 0.465–0.606, p-values <0.0001) (Table 2). When comparing the average abundance of V-gene segments from ground and flight animals an R2 of 0.592 was observed in VH (p=<0.0001) and 0.810 was observed in Vκ (p=<0.0001) (Table 2). Table 2. Comparison of Flight and Ground V-Gene Segment Usage Comparison VH R2 Vκ R2 G1 v G2 0.620 0.660 G2 v G3 0.356 0.738 G1 v G3 0.695 0.678 F1 v F2 0.101 0.465 F2 v F3 0.225 0.516 F1 v F3 0.360 0.606 Mean G v F 0.592 0.810 Open in a new tab Pairwise linear regressions of VH- and Vκ-gene segment usage were performed among ground control (G) and flight (F) animals. A linear regression was performed on the mean-average V gene segment of ground and flight treatment groups. aAll comparison groups were correlated (p≤0.0001) When comparing VH-gene usage among all animals, nine gene segments represented over five percent of the repertoire in at least one animal (Figure 1A). No one gene segment was found at over the five percent level in all six animals. V1-53 was found in over five percent in five animals, V9-3 was over five percent in four animals, V1-26 and V3–6 in two animals, and the remaining (V1-78, V6-3, V5-4, V1-15, V1-19) were found at high levels in only one animal. Figure 1. Expression of Top V-Gene Segments. Open in a new tab (A) VH- and (B) Vκ-gene segment usage for gene segments representing over five-percent of the repertoire in at least one animal within ground and flight treatment groups. No significant difference in individual gene segment usage was detected between ground control and flight treatment groups (Student’s t-test, 0.1534<p-value<0.9609). Significant differences between gene segment usage of combined ground and flight animals were found. In IgH, V1-53 was more abundant than many of the top V-gene segments (V1-78, V5-4, V1-15, V1-19); (Student’s t-test, all p<0.05). In Igκ, V5-39 was more abundant than many of the top V-gene segments (V3-4, V2-137, V1-110, V4-6, V6-2); (Student’s t-test, all p<0.05).Within Vκ, six gene segments represented over five percent of the repertoire in at least one animal (Figure 1B). The most abundant gene segment, V5–39 comprised over 16 percent of Vκ usage in all six animals. No other Vκ represented over five percent of the repertoire in all six animals. One gene segment, V3–4, was found at over five percent of the repertoire in four animals (G1, G2, G3, F3). The remaining four gene segments (V2–137, V1-110, V4–61, and V6–25) were found at greater than five percent in only one animal. There was no statistical difference in top VH- or Vκ-gene segment usage between ground and flight animals (student’s t-test, p=0.6478–0.9609). We also attempted to assess the antibody repertoire in the liver because of its role in fetal B-cell development. Only 592 to 1,429 Igκ sequencing reads were detected in ground control animals and 425 to 543 Igκ sequencing reads were detected in flight animals (Table 3). We did not characterize the heavy chain in the liver due to the low number of IgH sequencing reads that we detected. We assessed Vκ-gene segments that represented over five percent of the repertoire in the spleen or liver and found 11 gene segments. Only one gene segment, V5–39, was found in the top five across both tissues (Figure 2). V3–4 was found in the top five for all animals and tissues except flight mouse two’s liver sample, where it was ranked tenth. Overall, the average usage of these top Vκ-gene segments showed low to modest correlation between liver and spleen in ground animals (R2= 0.4081, p<0.0001) and flight animals (R2= 0.2727, p<0.0001). Analysis of statistical differences between individual Vκ-gene segments representing over five percent of the repertoire was not undertaken due to low read counts in the liver datasets. Table 3.

Figure 2. Expression of Top-Vκ Gene Segments from Spleen and Liver. Open in a new tab Vκ-gene segment usage for gene segments representing over five-percent of the repertoire in at least one animal from the liver or spleen of ground or flight animals are presented by rank. Liver ground (LG) and liver flight (LF) rankings are shown to the left and spleen ground (SG) and spleen flight (SF) rankings are shown to the right. V-gene segments are listed most frequent to least frequent. Dark red indicates higher rank moving to blue, lower percent rank.3.2 D- and J-Gene Segment & Constant Region Usage Heavy chain Ig diversity is also achieved by using, modifying and splicing of D-and J-gene segments. To determine if space flight affected these processes we also assessed D- and J-gene usage. The most commonly detected D-gene segment in both ground control and flight animals was D1-1, comprising between 30.6% to 46.8% of the repertoire (Figure 3A, Supplemental Figure 2A). D2-4, D2-3, D4-1, and D2-5 were detected at similar levels among ground control and flight animals between 3.56% and 11.39% of the repertoire. D3-1, D3-2, D6-3, D5-5, and D5-2, and D6-4 were detected the least often with levels between 3.6% and >0.003% of the repertoire. Because of extensive modification of D-gene segments during IgH rearrangement, D-gene segments were unable to be determined for between 24.4% and 36.6% of the repertoire for all animals. There was no statistical difference in D-gene segment usage between ground and flight animals (student’s t-test, p=0.1542–0.9840). D-gene segment usage was highly correlated between ground and flight animals (linear regression, R2- 0.9935, p<0.0001). Figure 3. Expression of D and J-Gene segments and IgH Constant Region Usage. Open in a new tab (A) D-gene segment, (B) JH-gene segment, (C) Jκ-gene segment, and (D) IgH constant region usage in animals within ground and flight treatment groups are presented as percent of repertoire. No significant difference in individual gene segment usage was detected between ground control and flight treatment groups (Student’s t-test, D: 0.1542<p-value<0.9840, JH: 0.2060<p-value<0.8662, IgH Constant Region: 0.1075<p-value<0.8277, Jκ: 0.0977<p-value<0.9262). D1-1 was used at a significantly higher rate that all other D-gene segments (Students t-test, all significant p<0.05). No significant differences between JH-gene segment usage was found (Student’s t-test, all p<0.05). In Igκ, significant differences in expression were found between all gene segments except between J1 and J2 (Student’s t-test, all significant p<0.05).Additional Ig variability is gained from the inclusion of different J-gene segments. Within IgH, the distribution of J-gene segment usage was less uniform than D-gene segment usage in both ground and flight animals. There was no consensus on the most abundantly expressed gene segment as each of the four JH-gene segments was the most abundant segment in at least one ground or flight animal (Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure 2B). While there was no consensus use of a particular J-gene segment, usage of any J-gene segment was between 13% and 40%, showing that usage is relatively uniform. Student’s t-tests were performed to determine whether differences in individual gene segment usage were significant. No significant differences were found between ground and flight animals (student’s t-test, p=0.2060–0.8662). As the most abundant Jκ -gene segment, J5, comprises between 32.6% and 47.9% of the repertoire, and is the most abundant gene segment all study animals (Figure 3C, Supplemental Figure 2C). Interesting J1 ranked second most abundant in all ground animals while it ranked third in all flight animals. There were no statistical differences in individual JH- or Jκ-gene segment usage between ground control and flight animals (Student’s t-test, p=0.0977–0.9262). Linear regression revealed correlation between JH usage of ground and flight animals for Igκ (R2= 0.9928, p=0.0076) and IgH (R2=0.8147, p=0.0360). Ig isotype composition can provide insight into the developmental stage of B cells. Because animals in this experiment were specific-pathogen free, it is unsurprising that IgM predominated with between 62.38% and 82.81% of the repertoire (Figure 3D, Supplemental Figure 2D). IgG was the second most prominent isotype which trended towards a higher percentage of the repertoire in flight animals although the difference was not statistically significant (Student’s t-test, p=0.2150). Except for a relatively high expression of IgA in flight mouse two, IgA was detected in between 1.43% and 4.58% of the repertoire, IgD and IgE were detected less than one percent in all animals. There were no statistical differences in Ig isotype frequency between ground and flight animals (Student’s t-test, p=0.1075–0.8277). There was a high correlation between ground and flight constant region usage (linear regression, R2= 0.9734, p=0.0019).3.3 V(D)J Combinations V(D)J family combinations were examined as another way to determine if recombination of Ig gene segments was affected by spaceflight. We visualized V(D)J-gene segment combinations using both bubble charts and circos plots for both IgH and Igκ. IgH showed more variation between ground control and flight animals compared to Igκ when looking at the most common gene family combinations. Circos plots allowed us to examine top V-gene families, J-gene segments, and V/J pairing frequency in both IgH and Igκ. For ease of display, we first grouped together all V-gene segments into their respective family. D- and J-gene segments remained as individuals. V1 was the most common IgH gene family used in all mice comprising, on average 51% of the V-gene family use in ground animals and, on average, 57% of the repertoire in flight animals (Figure 4A–B, Supplemental Figure 3A–F). In ground-treatment animals, V9 was the second most common gene family in ground mouse one and ground mouse two, while V2 was the second most common gene family in ground mouse three (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3A–C). In flight animals, the second most common V-gene family used was unique among the three animals (flight one: V3, flight two: V2, and flight three: V9) (Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure 4D–F). The third most common V-gene family was also unique among the ground treatment animals being V2, V3, and V9 for ground mouse one, ground mouse two, and ground mouse three respectively (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3A–C). V5 was the third most common family in flight mouse one, V9 in flight mouse two, and V2 in flight mouse three (Figure 4B, Supplemental 3D–F). Figure 4. Gene Segment Combinations in Ground Control and Flight Animals. Open in a new tab (A, B) Average IgH V/D/J combinations (bubble chart) and the V/J combinations (Circos plot) for ground treatment (A) animals and (B) flight animals. For bubble charts, V-gene family is represented along the x-axis, the D-gene segment is represented along the y-axis, and the J-gene segment is represented by a specific color. The size of the bubble corresponds to the average percent repertoire of the specific gene combination. Circos plots are read clockwise starting at the 12 o’clock position with J1 (red), J2, J3, J4, U, V1 (lime green), V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8 (light blue), V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, and V15 (sliver, no color). (C,D) Average Igκ V/J combinations for ground treatment (C) animals and (D) flight animals. For bubble charts, V-gene family is represented along the x-axis and J-gene segment is represented along the x axis. The size of the bubble corresponds to the average percent repertoire of the specific gene combination. Circos plots are read clockwise starting at the 12 o’clock position with J1 (red), J2, J4, J5, U, V1 (yellow), V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7 (sliver, no color), V8, V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, V15, V16, V17, V18, V19 (light purple).We found that the most common V/D/J combinations were correlated with the most frequently used gene families or segments within the repertoire. When averaging among repertoires, the most common IgH combination in ground-treatment animals was V9/D1/J1 (8.66%), though this combination was only in the top five most frequent combinations in ground mouse one and ground mouse two. The most common average combination in flight-treatment animals was V1/D1/J4 (8.35%), though this combination was only detected in the five most common combinations for one animal (Figure 4A–B, Supplemental Figure 4A–B). The V1/D1/J2 combination was shared among the top five gene family combinations in all mice; representing 5.94% of the repertoire in ground-treatment animals and 7.73% in the flight-treatment animals (Supplemental Figure 4A–B). A notable difference between ground and flight treatment groups was the usage of the V9-gene family. This family represented the top average VH-gene family used in the ground-treatment animals as well as the top combination in ground mouse one and ground mouse two (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 4A), but only appeared once as the top gene family combination used for flight-treatment animals (Figure 4B, Supplemental Figure 4B). We also examined the top five V/J pairing frequencies for IgH (Figure 4A–B, Supplemental Figure 3A–F, Supplemental Figure 4C–D). For ground animals, there were six unique pairings represented. The V1 family was used for four of the six unique V/J pairings compiled. V9 and V2 were also used. Of the six unique pairings, four were shared among all three mice (V1/J1, V1/J2, V1/J3, and V1/J4). One was shared among two mice (V9/J1), and one (V2/J4) was found only in ground mouse three’s five most common combinations (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3A–C, Supplemental Figure 4C). For flight animals, seven unique pairings where found in the five most common pairs. V1 was again the overwhelmingly most common V family with four of the seven unique pairings including it. V3, V2, and V9 were all used by a single animal. Of the seven unique pairs, four were shared among all three mice (V1/J1, V1/J2, V1/J3, and V1/J4). These pairings were also among the most common in the ground-treatment group. Three (V3/J3, V2/J4, V9/J1) were found in a single mouse’s five most common pairings (Figure 4B, Supplemental Figure 3D–F, Supplemental Figure 4D). We undertook similar analysis for Igκ sequences (Figure 4C–D, Supplemental Figure 3G–L, Supplemental Figure 4E–F). The most common Vκ-gene family expressed in all mice was V5, representing over one-fifth of the repertoire. The second most common Vκ-gene family in ground animals was V3 while in flight animals it was V6 or V4 (Figure 4C–D, Supplemental Figure 3G–L, Supplemental Figure 4E–F). The third most represented Vκ-gene families was V6 for ground mouse one, and V4 for ground mouse two, and V2 for mouse three (Figure 4C, Supplemental Figure 4G–I). In flight animals, the third most common Vκ-gene family was V4 for flight mouse one, and V3 for flight mouse two and three (Figure 4D, Supplemental Figure 4J–L). Unlike IgH, Igκ expressed more variety in V/J pairing variety. In Igκ there were five pairings in ground animals (V2/J4, V3/J2, V3/J5, V5/J1, V6/J2) that were not shared with the top five flight-animal pairings (Figure 4C–D, Supplemental Figure 3G–L, Supplemental Figure 4E–F). There were also four pairings (V1/J2, V4/J2, V6/J1, V6/J4) found in flight animals not found in the top five ground-animal pairings (Figure 4C–D, Supplemental Figure 3G–L, Supplemental Figure 4E–F). The correlation of the average percent of repertoire for V/J combinations between ground and flight animals was higher in Igκ, with a R2 of 0.8795 (p<0.0001), whereas IgH had a R2 of 0.3296 (p<0.0001) (linear regression). V/J combination usage among animals within each treatment group also showed stronger correlation within Igκ than IgH in both ground and flight treatment groups (Table 4). Table 4.

Therefore, we assessed whether spaceflight had an impact on several properties of CDR3 because changes in CDR3 could affect host ability to respond to antigen. We found that CDR3 length in IgH was highly varied. The length ranged from one amino acid to 35 (Figure 5A). The average CDR3 lengths for all the ground control animals was 12±0. The average CDR3 lengths for flight animals was also 12±1. The CDR3 lengths were not normally distributed in the flight or ground animals (flight p=<0.0001, ground p=0.0128) with the majority of CDR3 lengths falling between 11 and 14 AAs. We also examined the heavy-chain CDR3 length by isotype (Table 5) and by treatment group. We found no significant difference by treatment group or by isotype (two-way ANOVA, interaction p=0.8141, isotype p=0.4589, treatment p=0.6225). Figure 5. CDR3 Length in IgH and Igκ sequences.

Assessment by two-way ANOVA revealed no significant differences in CDR3 length by treatment group (p=0.6225), isotype (p=0.4589), or the interaction of the two variablesKappa-chain CDR3 length was conserved at nine amino acids with 90.3 to 94.2 percent of all light chains having CDR3 rearrangements that were nine amino acids in length (Figure 5B). Only a small percentage of light chains had eight amino acids (2.8 to 6.9%), or ten amino acid long (0.9–3.9%) CDR3s. Ground mouse one (0.9%), was an exception and was enriched for 11 amino acid CDR3s (2.3%) compared to other animals (0.2–0.7%). CDR3 lengths over 18 amino acids were not displayed (20, 25, 27, 29, 32, 35, 36, 37, 39). CDR3 rearrangements of these lengths were often only detected in one animal and expression of these lengths did not exceed 0.01% of the repertoire. Additionally, these rearrangements may have been identified in error as many of these rearrangements contain intervening phenylalanine residues within the There was little overlap among IgH CDR3s regardless of treatment (Figure 6A, C). Of the top five CDR3s found in each animal, we identified 26 unique CDR3 AA rearrangements. Of those 26 CDR3s, four were found in all six animals. Two additional rearrangements were identified in three animals. One of those rearrangements, CASHGSSYLAWFAYW, was found in only flight animals and not found in any ground animals. Six CDR3s were found in two animals, and the remainder were found in a single animal. The vast majority of CDR3 rearrangements detected were unique to each animal (6,661–9,270 rearrangements), though there was a small amount of overlap among animals (103–163 CDR3 rearrangements). For flight animals, 78 CDR3 rearrangements were found in all three animals and 70 were found in all three ground animals. Of the rearrangements found in all three animals per treatment group, only 20 rearrangements were detected in all six animals. Figure 6. Top CDR3 Usage and Overlap of CDR3 Between Treatment Animals. Open in a new tab Venn diagrams show the overlap of unique CDR3 sequences among and between ground control (G1-G3) and flight treatment (F1-F3) groups in (A) IgH and (B) Igκ. CDR3 sequences were ranked within the top 5 most abundant rearrangements of any ground control or flight animals in (C) IgH and (D) Igκ. Dark red indicates higher percent of repertoire moving to blue, which represents lower percent of repertoire.There was considerable overlap in the top five Igκ CDR3 rearrangements of each animal (Figure 6B, D). Seventeen total top CDR3 rearrangements were identified and all CDR3 rearrangements were identified in every animal. One CDR3 was the most abundant rearrangements in five animals (CQNGHSFPLTF), still ranking third in the remaining animal (F1). Ground control and flight animals shared three rearrangements that ranked within the top 20 CDR3 in all animals. Overall, between 1,590–2,933 unique CDR3 were detected in ground control animals, and between 1,461–1,818 unique CDR3 were detected in all flight animals (Figure 6). Of the 725 and 579 CDR3 shared in all three ground control and flight animals, respectively, 446 were shared between all six ground and flight animals. A CDR3 rearrangement nucleotide sequence alignment of one of the top V-D-J-gene segment combinations demonstrates significant variability among mice such that any variability between ground and flight treatment groups cannot be determined with confidence (Figure 7). Additional data sets are needed in order to assess the effect of spaceflight on CDR3 formation. Figure 7. Nucleotide Alignment of CDR3 from top V-D-J Combination. Open in a new tab Nucleotide alignment of heavy-chain gene segment V1-26*01/D1-1*01/J1*03 across individuals in ground (G1 - A, G2 - C, G3 - E) and flight (F1 - B, F2 - D, F3 - F) treatment groups. Brackets in the germline region of the first individual in each treatment group delineate V- and J-gene regions. These bracketed regions remain the same across all individuals in the treatment group.3.5 Mutations in Complementarity Determining and Framework Regions We also examined mutation frequencies in CDR and framework (FW) regions for each animal because mutations can affect Ig specificity. Mutation frequencies were normalized by animal and Ig region (FW1-3, CDR1-3) by dividing the percent of total substitution mutations (total mutations/total productive reads) by respective region length (Figure 8). There were no significant differences between the mutation frequencies of ground control and flight animals for any of the Ig regions in both IgH (Student’s t-test, 0.1916<p<0.9978) and Igk (Student’s t-test, 0.3175<p<0.9865). When comparing the substitution mutation frequency across Ig regions, more substitution mutations occurred in CDR3 compared to other regions in IgH and Igκ (ANOVA; all p<0.05). Figure 8. Substitution Mutations by Ig Region. Open in a new tab Total number of substitution mutations in FRs 1–3 and CDRs 1–3 were observed for both IgH and Igκ chains. Abundance was first normalized by region length and then by total number of cleaned, productive reads in each respective data set and multiplied by 100 to attain percent abundance.4 Discussion Spaceflight and ground-based analog models induce phenotypic and functional changes in T- and B- lymphocyte populations. Spaceflight also affects bone marrow, the site of B-cell differentiation and development. Therefore, we wanted to know whether the stress and physiological changes associated with spaceflight would affect the normal development of the highly-diversified and highly-specific antigen receptors on B-lymphocytes. If so, the ability to respond to pathogens might be affected. We characterized the antibody repertoire of C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS and ground control animals using HTS and RNA-Seq. HTS studies of antibody repertoires typically employ polymerase chain reaction amplification of Ig specific sequences from sorted B-cell populations. We assessed the B cell repertoire in whole spleen tissue because of the limitations of the primary science, a verification flight of mouse housing hardware. This precluded the sorting of cell populations. We previously showed that similar data could be generated using whole spleen tissue compared to whole spleen cell suspensions (Rettig et al., 2017). Although we do not account for B-cell subpopulations (Yang et al., 2015, Kaplinsky et al., 2014), we do measure the total splenic Ig repertoire. Additionally, since we did not use specific amplification of Ig sequences the depth of sequencing was not as high as some have accomplished looking at Ig gene usage (Yang et al., 2015, Kaplinsky et al., 2014, Menzel et al., 2014). We have compared of amplified and unamplified data sets by our lab show reasonable correlations of the data, with more V-gene segments being detected in the unamplified data sets (Rettig 2017, In Revision). Amplification with multiplex Ig specific primers may introduce amplification bias as primers may bind with varying efficiency to V-gene segments, although there have been recent advances in experimental approach to address amplification bias (Wardemann, 2017). We also found that the type of RNA-Seq analysis we are using in the assessment of younger C57Bl/6J mouse Ig gene usage, correlated well with that of studies using amplification (Rettig et al., 2017). Therefore, we feel we have a reasonable snapshot of B-cell receptors present in the spleens of 35-week-old female mice. In addition, the sample preparation allows additional data mining of valuable mouse samples. In both humans and mice, early B-cell development occurs in the fetal liver prior to postnatal development in the bone marrow. We attempted to determine the Ig repertoire within the adult liver of the ground and flight animals in comparison to the splenic Ig repertoire. Unfortunately, few Ig sequences were recovered in liver samples suggesting few B cells are actually resident or circulating in the liver under normal, steady-state conditions. The liver kappa chain V-gene repertoire did correlate some with the usage in the spleen and probably reflects circulating B-cell Ig expression, but we did not confirm that. We focused our efforts on the spleen data. While previous analyses by our lab used splenic mRNA pooled from four animals (Rettig et al., Submitted for Publication in PLOS ONE, (Rettig et al., 2017)), the current study assessed individual mice and exhibited significantly more mouse-to-mouse variation than one might expect in inbred mice; even within treatment groups and compared to pooled mouse samples. Overall, V-gene segment usage correlated when analyzed using pairwise linear regression of animals within ground and flight treatment groups and there did not appear to be an impact of spaceflight on B-gene segment use. It is possible that differences in gene segment usage in ground and flight animals would be observed upon immunization. Studies on the effects of spaceflight in an immunized amphibian model showed altered VH-gene family and Ig class usage (Boxio et al., 2005, Bascove et al., 2009). We performed a number of analyses to determine if the Ig gene rearrangement process was affected by spaceflight. Averaged V-gene segment usage between the ground control and flight animals was moderately to highly correlated (VH: R2=0.5922, p <0.0001; Vκ: R2=0.831, p <0.0001). Many of the most abundant V-gene sequences were shared in flight and ground animals and there was no statistically significant difference in usage of individual top V-gene segments between ground control and flight animals (Student’s t-test, p=0.06478–0.9609). Similarly, no differences in D-, JH- or Jκ-gene segment usage and IgH constant region usage was seen between ground and flight animals. We also examined whether spaceflight would affect the V/J-gene segment combinations that normally occur in specific pathogen-free mice. These too, were not different between ground control and flight animals for IgH and Igκ. V/J-gene segment combinations were moderately to highly correlated (IgH: R2=0.3296, Igκ: R2=0.8795, both p<0.0001). An assessment of the impact of hypergravity on the similarly assembled T cell receptor repertoire of neonatal mice showed low correlation of individual Beta chain V- and J-gene segment recombination frequencies between control animals and animals subjected to centrifugation. 85% of gene V/J-gene segment combinations were not shared among the two treatment groups (Ghislin et al., 2015) and the differences could be attributed to changes in somatic recombination machinery under altered gravity conditions (Schenten et al., 2013, Ghislin et al., 2015). The combinatorial diversity of Ig was shown through the assessment of overall CDR3 sequence overlap among animals, as a large number of sequences were unique to only one animal. Little overlap was observed in the top 5 H-CDR3 rearrangements within all six ground and flight animals which totaled to 26 CDR3 rearrangements. Thirteen of these CDR3 rearrangements were only identified in one animal. More overlap was observed in the top 5 κ-CDR3 rearrangements within all six ground and flight animals which totaled 17 CDR3 rearrangements, which were identified in all animals. The mice studied in this investigation were not challenged and were housed under specific-pathogen free conditions. Mutational frequency in Ig is normally associated with antigen stimulation (Garcia et al., 1996). Therefore, we did not expect that these mice were undergoing high amounts of somatic mutations. The majority of the mutations detected occurred in CDR3 in both ground and flight mice. It is possible that we will see differences in mutation frequency between ground control and flight animals after experimental immune challenge. The frequency of somatic hypermutations in P. waltl immunized in space was slightly lower than animals immunized on earth (Bascove et al., 2011). An experiment with antigen challenge of the Ig repertoire will be necessary to test this hypothesis. The animals used in this experiment were older (35 weeks). The expression of genes necessary for Ig recombination do go down as mice age (Cancro, 2009). Therefore, it may be possible that we do not see differences between the treatment groups because the perturbations of spaceflight are not enough to disrupt the reduced B cell differentiations occurring in 35-week-old mice under normal steady-state conditions. Additionally, the half-life of B cells in secondary lymphoid organs is between four and seven weeks (Fulcher and Basten, 1997). Given the brief time that the mice were subjected to space flight (three weeks) it is likely that the exposure was not long enough to affect V/D/J recombination in the repertoire. Additional experiments, especially with young mice, will be needed to test this hypothesis. Animals in this experiment were older and supplied from a different vendor (Taconic) than the 9–11-week-old C57BL/6J mice from Jackson Laboratories used in our previous experiments ((Rettig et al., 2017), (Rettig et al., In Revision). To assess whether differences existed in the Ig repertoire, between the older C57BL/6Tac mice and the younger C57BL/6J mice, we compared gene segment usage between the two mouse cohorts. Because no differences in top V-gene segments, (D)J-gene segments, and constant region usage were detected between RR1 ground control and flight animals, all six animals were pooled and compared to the C57BL/6J cohort. We selected the 25 most abundant V-gene segments from both RR1 and C57BL/6J cohorts, resulting in 33 top IgHV and 34 top IgκV. We found that seven of 35 IgHV and eight of 32 IGκV were expressed at significantly different levels within the repertoire between the two cohorts (Student’s t-test). These differences are largely driven by gene segments that are highly expressed in the RR1 cohort such as IGHV1-80, which represented 2.04 ± 0.26% of the repertoire in RR1 animals and 6.6 ± 2.40% of the repertoire in the C57BL/6J cohort (Student’s t-test, p=0.0032). This is even more pronounced in IGκV5–39, which represented 21.41 ± 7.50% of the repertoire in RR1 animals and only 4.73 ± 4.93% of the repertoire in the C57BL/6J cohort (Student’s t-test, p=0.0109). We also performed a linear regression of top V-gene segment usage, which showed poor correlation between cohorts in both IgH (R2 = 0.1568, p=0.0226) and Igκ (R2 = 0.1681, p=0.0160). D-gene segment usage was only significantly different IGHD1-1, which represented 39.7 ± 5.23% of the repertoire in RR1 animals and 26.49 ± 0.94% of the repertoire in the C57BL/6J cohort (Student’s t-test, p=0.0040). We found that J-gene segment usage varied between the two cohorts in three out of five IGκJ and no differences in IGHV were detected (student’s t-test). IgH constant region usage was significantly different for IgD (RR1: 0.63 ± 0.22%, C57BL6/J: 4.60 ± 0.69%; Student’s t-test, p=0.0074) and IgG (RR1: 23.83 ± 6.19%, C57BL6/J: 9.65 ± 6.19%; Student’s t-test, p=0.0074). Although we cannot determine whether these differences are attributed to differences in vendor or differences in age, it is likely that repertoire differences are driven by a more mature Ig repertoire within the RR1 animals, as a higher percentage of IgH sequences demonstrate class switching. Both cohorts were unimmunized and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. In conclusion, we have been able to successfully characterize immunoglobulin gene segment usage and junctional diversity within the antibody repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS. Individual gene segment usage remained similar among animals within and among treatment groups, with the most abundant gene segments being conserved across all animals. Gene segment combinations and CDR3 sequences were highly varied, demonstrating the combinatorial diversity of the antibody repertoire, but that variation reflects the dynamics of individualized selection of Ig molecules and not any impact of spaceflight. A larger sample size would help solidify this conclusion, but these data provide preliminary suggestions that the recombinatorial processes that lead to the diverse Ig repertoires in mice are not affected by a short trip to and stay on the ISS. These data do not preclude that differences in the Ig repertoires of ground and flight animals will not be seen during active immunization or in younger, possibly more recombinatorily active mice. Current studies in our lab aim to characterize antibody repertoire dynamics upon antigen challenge using a murine anti-orthostatic suspension model and during a future space flight.Supplementary Material 1 MS928411-supplement-1.xml (410B, xml) 2 MS928411-supplement-2.pdf (954.1KB, pdf) 3 MS928411-supplement-3.pdf (229KB, pdf) 4 MS928411-supplement-4.tif (3.4MB, tif) 5 MS928411-supplement-5.pdf (82.9KB, pdf) Footnotes Publisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

    "abstract": "Abstract Sequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count. Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire. Keywords: High throughput sequencing, Immunoglobulin genes, Mouse, Heavy Chain, RepSEQ",
    "introduction": "Introduction Antibodies are B cell proteins that play a vital role in adaptive immunity. These complex molecules, and their diverse specificities are defined at several levels. At the protein level, these molecules are heterodimers joined with disulfide bonds between heavy and light chains. At the genetic level, the antibody specificity is influenced by semi-randomly recombining a variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments that are encoded in the genome. This V-D-J, or in the case of the light chain, V-J rearrangement, also influences antibody specificity by random and semi-random base insertions or deletions during the recombination process. In the end, the collection of antibodies produced, the antibody repertoire, is a fingerprint of what antigens an organism has been exposed to and a measure of immunocompetence. Sequencing has become easier, cheaper, and faster in recent years. Antibody repertoires have been sequenced in numerous species, in response to vaccinations (1–3) and infections (4–6), and have been employed in cancer detection; providing valuable feedback regarding the immune system’s response to challenges and for early cancer detection in patients (7, 8). In an effort to supplement unamplified MiSeq data sets used in our laboratory (9), we explored the use of commercial processes that use technologies to amplify sequences to increase the depth of coverage of specifically targeted immunoglobulin gene transcripts. These data sets are created using massively multiplexed PCR reactions that are subsequently sequenced on the Illumina platform. Multiplex amplification strategies have been used to explore the T cell (10, 11) and B cell repertoires (12–15) and biases, omissions (10, 11, 16–18).and PCR artifacts have been detected in the data sets (10). We started this project with the hypothesis that our unamplified data set would provide comparable results to those seen in the commercially amplified data sets. However, we are unaware of any immunoglobulin repertoire studies that have been done to compare data obtained using amplification techniques compared to the repertoire in a total RNASeq library. Concurrent with performing these analyses, we discovered that the required sample preparation for commercial sequencing also varied. Therefore, we found it necessary to examine the impact of sample preparation as part of our effort. This manuscript describes our results comparing a data set generated using unamplified total RNA (TRNA) to commercially amplified data sets. We examined the role of commercial amplification and cDNA generation methods as well as the impact of the starting material on sequence output.",
    "methods": "Materials and Methods KSU RNA Preparation RNA was prepared as outlined in Rettig et al 2017 (9). Briefly, RNA was extracted from the spleens of four nine-week old female C57Bl/6J mice. TRNA was submitted to the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility for sequencing and cDNA was prepared using standard Illumina protocols. cDNA made from the TRNA using random hexamer primers and oligo-dT selection, was size selected to 275-800bp length and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq at 2×300bp using Illumina’s protocol. No additional amplification beyond that required by Illumina preparation was used and consider these samples non-specifically amplified, or “unamplified”. Commercial Sample preparations mRNA was extracted from the TRNA isolated from the sample used for the KSU data set using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) following manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR for samples amplified with Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase based sample preparation was performed using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR for Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase based sample preparation was performed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbrad, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Starting material for RT-PCR was either TRNA from the KSU data set or the purified mRNA. RT-PCR products were submitted to Adaptive Biotechnologies (Seattle, WA) (Com1) on dry ice following company protocols. TRNA and mRNA (unamplified) were submitted to iRepertoire, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) (Com2) on dry ice following company protocols. Bioinformatic Analysis KSU sequencing results were analyzed as described previously (9). Briefly, sequencing results were quality controlled. Antibody-specific sequences were isolated and submitted to ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) (19) for analysis. Individual sequences were assigned a unique ID by the sequencing machinery during Illumina sequencing and were used to identify unique sequences. The sequence containing the most high quality information was retained for further analysis as outlined in Rettig et al (9). No further filtering of reads was performed. Both commercial sequencers provided their own bioinformatic analyses of the sequencing results. The raw sequencing results from Com1 and Com2 were also submitted to IMGT for analysis and subjected to the standard KSU bioinformatics pipeline. IMGT’s nomenclature and classifications were used throughout this paper. We assessed all functional V-gene segments as identified by IMGT. We also include three putative functional genes (V5S21, V1S100, and V3S7) which were detected in rearranged transcripts (containing a CDR3 C-xx-W motif or class switched) in our previous analysis of the normal C57BL/6 repertoire (20). IMGT’s High-V Quest occasionally assigned multiple potential V-gene segments to a single sequence, likely due to incomplete capture of the entire V-gene sequence or high homology between gene segments. In all IMGT processed data, sequences that contained two possible V-gene segment possibilities were assigned a weighted value of 0.5 per sequence, as opposed to one for full matches. Sequences with V-gene segments that were assigned more than two potential matches were excluded from analysis. Initial results were tabulated using the companys’ proprietary bioinformatic results. However, to determine the role of bioinformatic handling of the data, some of Com1 and Com2 data were subjected to the standard KSU bioinformatic workflow analysis and CDR3 analyses (9). Statistical Tests All statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism (Version 6.0). Paired T-tests were performed using the raw read counts. Coefficient of determinations (R2) were performed by comparing the percent of repertoire between animals. Percent of repertoire is determined by dividing the read count for a specific V-gene segment by the total number of reads detected and multiplying by 100.",
    "results": "Results Most studies examining immunoglobulin repertoires use amplification to increase the depth of sequencing, but amplification comes with some drawbacks. We wanted to assess the comparability of amplified and non-amplified data from identical samples. In preparation to do this comparison, we found that different commercial amplification methodologies required different types of sample preparation. For example, sample submission for the Com1 data sets required a cDNA sample. The Com1 process amplified the resulting cDNA using proprietary primers and sequencing on the Illumina platform. After an initial submission showed a low correlation between the Com1 sequencing and the KSU data set (data not shown), we hypothesized that cDNA preparation plays a role in determining the amplified repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the role of starting material (mRNA or TRNA), reverse transcriptase (AMV vs MMLV), and primer templates (oligo-dT or random hexamer) on the sequenced B cell immunoglobulin repertoire. Com2 submissions required the submission of TRNA, rather than cDNA. Assessment of Transcriptional Read Counts Com1amplified data sets returned between 7,084 and 1,263,003 sequences, dependent on the preparation method. mRNA starting material yielded more total transcriptional reads than TRNA (P=0.013, 2 tailed matched T test; Table 1). Generally, the AMV reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers tended to yield higher numbers of transcripts. The use of AMV and random hexamer primers resulted in more total productive reads in three out of four of the comparisons directly comparing primers, however, the overall differences were not statistically different (P>0.05, 2 tailed matched T test; Table 1). In the Com2 data set, we found a moderate number of reads, about one-half of those detected in the highest Com1 numbers. These compare to 11,200 sequence reads containing a CDR3 generated in the KSU data set using a total MiSeq approach. Table 1: Total number of productive reads per data set KSUa Com 1a Com 2a mRNAb TRNAb mRNAb TRNAb AMVc MMLVc AMVc MMLVc dTd Hexd dTd Hexd dTd Hexd dTd Hexd Total Productive Reads 11,200e 553,521 1,263,003 883,532 1,035,461 7,975 6,867 208,979 220,772 637,214 766,075 Open in a new tab a – Sequencing technique (Com1 and Com2 are amplified data sets) b – starting material (mRNA – Messenger RNA, TRNA – Total RNA) c – reverse transcriptase (AMV - Avian Myeloblastosis Virus, MMLV - Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus) d – primer (dt – Oligo dT, Hex – Random hexamer) e – an additional 27,896 reads were used for V-gene segment usage assessment. These sequences were not long enough for CDR3 detection. Determination of Sequencing Reproducibility To assess the repeatability of the amplified Com1 and Com2 data sets, we examined the correlation of V-gene segment usage. In the C57BL/6 mouse, the V-gene segment is the most varied in the heavy chain (IgH locus) comprising a total of 109 functional V-gene segments, three putative function V-gene segments, and alleles compared to 19 for the D-gene segment and four for the J-gene (21, 22). The nucleotide sequences in the V-gene segments are also highly varied and require a complex multiplex PCR to amplify. Correlations were assessed using the data provided by the commercial vendor’s proprietary bioinformatics. Non-strain specific V-gene segment assignments accounted for between 0.84% and 1.46% of the sequencing results from Com 1 and 1.74% and 1.41% for Com2 (Table 2). Although there were differences in the immunoglobulin gene transcripts detected, there was a high correlation in the V-gene sequences detected among the different technical replicates in the Com1 data (R2 range from 0.6986 to 0.9933, all p<0.0001) (Figure 1). The R2 between technical replicates in Com2 was 0.9621 (p<0.0001). We also examined the reproducibility of two technical replicates of KSU sequencing used for a different analysis and obtained an R2 of 0.9996 for Mouse 32, and 0.9995 for Mouse 39 (p<0.001) showing high levels of reproducibility between KSU sequencing runs. Therefore, although total transcripts generated varied with sample preparation, the V-gene segments that were detected were consistently detected using two different commercial approaches.

Impact of Amplification on V-gene Segment Detection The unamplified KSU approach produced a data set where a total of 112 V-gene segments were detected while the Com1 data sets contained between 85 and 100 V-gene segments. The Com2 mRNA data set contained 99 detectable V-gene segments and the TRNA contained 100. Comparisons of V-gene segments in the Com1 data set to the KSU data set showed moderate R2 values; 0.4457 to 0.5841 (all p<0.0001) (Table 3). The Com2 data sets also showed moderate R2 of 0.6695 for mRNA and 0.6607 for TRNA (all p<0.0001). To determine why there were differences in V-gene detection, we compared the results from the most commonly detected V-gene segments in the KSU data sets to their frequencies in the Com1 and Com2 data sets. The protocol for Illumina sequencing uses mRNA selection, SuperScriptIII reverse transcriptase, and random hexamer primers. To best compare results, we used the Com1 mRNA-MMLV-Hex data set and the Com2 mRNA data set using the top 34 V-gene segments in the KSU data set. These V-gene segments comprise over one percent of the detected repertoire and are considered highly expressed. In the Com1 data set, of these 36 highly expressed V-gene segments, five (V1-26, V1-18, V1-50, V4-1, and V2-6) were detected at two-fold lower frequency than in the KSU data set (Figure 2). These five V-gene segments were either absent or were near zero percent of the repertoire (Figure 2). Of these same top 34 V-gene segments in the Com1 data set, two (V6-3 and V2-6-8) were detected at two-fold greater than the KSU data set (Figure 2). The R2 for these top 36 V-gene segments to the KSU data set was 0.1783 (P=0.0128).

The highest value percent of repertoire is dark read while the lowest are white. Black boxes represent no detected reads (true zero). Rounded zeros are represented as 0.0.We also compared the Com2 mRNA data set to the same 34 V-gene segments from the unamplified KSU data. Nine of the 34 V-gene sequences (V9-3, V4-1, V2-6, V1-81, V5-17, V2-2, V8-8, V11-2, V14-2) were detected at a twofold or lower level than in the KSU data set (Figure 2). Five other V-gene segments (V1-53, V3-6, V1-64, V10-1, and V1-69) were detected at twofold higher levels than those found in the KSU data set (Figure 2). The correlation of these top 34 V-gene segments was better than the Com1 R2 at 0.4098 (P=<0.0001). Our normal workflow methods include the use of functionally productive and unknown transcripts for analysis (9). This inclusion helps balance the lower read numbers obtained with unamplified sequences. We performed the same analysis as above between our productive + unknown dataset used above, with our productive only dataset. We detected a tota1 of 104 V-gene segments. Those not detected in the productive only list (V3S7, V6-7, V6-4, V1-62-1, V5-12-4, V1-17-1, and V6-5) comprised less than 0.7% of the repertoire. The correlation coefficient was high at 0.9596(P<0.0001), and there were no changes at great than 2-fold of the productive + unknown data set (Figure 2). These analyses reveal that the addition of unknown functionality V-gene segments does not significantly alter the repertoire. Direct Comparisons of Amplified and Unamplified Data Sets The comparisons in V-gene use were made using the bioinformatics provided by the commercial ventures. To standardize the data handling to remove bioinformatic reasons for the differences in data, we processed the sequencing results from the Com1 mRNA-MMLV-Hex and Com2 mRNA data sets using the KSU bioinformatics work flow (9). The KSU bioinformatic treatment of the Com1 data set correlated moderately with the commercially provided bioinformatics (R2=0.4795, p<0.0001). After processing the Com1 data with the KSU bioinformatics pipeline, the R2 to the KSU data set increased slightly from 0.5517 (Table 3) with the original bioinformatics to 0.5649 (p<0.0001) with the adjusted bioinformatics. However, nine V-gene segments were detected in the Com1 data set using the KSU bioinformatics workflow that were not originally detected using the commercially provided bioinformatics (Sup Fig 1). When we processed the Com2 data using the KSU bioinformatic pipeline, the Com2 data set was highly correlated with the original commercially provided bioinformatics treatment (R2=0.9860, p<0.0001). When we compared Com2 data set processed with the KSU bioinformatics pipeline to the KSU RNASeq data set, the data still only had an R2=0.6791 (p<0.0001). The KSU bioinformatics workflow detected an additional four V-gene segments that were not detected by the commercial bioinformatics (Sup Fig 1). When we reanalyzed the bioinformatics data from Com1 and Com2 using the KSU pipeline, we detected gene segments that were not detected in the original commercially provided bioinformatics. However, the inclusion of these gene segments, did not greatly improve the R2 between the amplified data sets and the KSU RNASeq data. In the Com1 data set, some gene segments (V1-26, V1-18, V1-50, V2-9-1) were not detected or only detected at low levels in the original bioinformatics but were detected at high levels (>1%) in the KSU/IMGT processed data (Sup Fig 1). The three additional V-gene segments detected in the Com2 data set (V2-5, V1-62-2, and V1-62-3 were found in less than <0.3% of the repertoire (Sup Fig 1). These changes were not sufficient to significantly improve R2 values. Impact of Amplification on the Reproducibility of CDR3 Detection The absence of some V-gene segments in the Com1 and Com2 data compared to the KSU data was a concern. It precludes a complete picture of the V-gene repertoire. Nevertheless, amplified sequencing of the antibody repertoire is thought to provide an advantage in that the depth of coverage is increased over unamplified data sets due to the number of reads generated. To determine how extensive the discrepancy is between amplified and unamplified data, we assessed the read depth (number of reads generated) and resampling efficiency of CDR3 (number of unique CDR3s resampled between replicates) using technical replicates of samples sequenced with the various sequencing techniques. As anticipated, amplified data sets had both higher total read numbers and unique CDR3 numbers (Table 4). Table 4: KSU mRNA-MMLV-Hex (Com1) mRNA (Com2) Read Count 11,200 1,035,461 637,214 Unique CDR3 Sequences 6668 180,266 146,231 Open in a new tabResampling/reproducibility has been assumed to improve with the depth of coverage. We had the unique opportunity to compare sequencing data from the same biological material subjected to multiple sequencing methodologies. We have also had the opportunity to do technical replicates on multiple samples subjected to RNASeq or amplification procedures. This allowed us the ability to look at CDR3 sampling reproducibility and to determine if amplification provided any advantage in CDR3 reproducibility. For the KSU unamplified data set, two C57BL/6J mouse spleen RNA samples (#32 and #39) were sequenced independently two times each and the CDR3s sampled were compared. In the KSU data set, 32-1 shared 28% of its total unique reads with 32-2. (Figure 3). 32-2 shared 24% of its reads with 32-1 (Figure 3). KSU data set, 39, showed 25% overlap of their total unique reads between each sampling (Figure 3). For the Com2 data, since there was such a strong correlation between the sequence output between mRNA and TRNA samples of C57BL/6J spleen samples (R2 = 0.9644), we considered these technical replicates. The mRNA data set shared 24% of its sequences with the TRNA data set while the TRNA data set shared 30% of its sequences with the mRNA data set. We also examined the resampling efficiency in the Com1 data set using the spleen mRNA-MMLV data sets that were reversed transcribed with two different primers, random hexamer and oligo-dT. Although this was not a perfect technical replicate, there was an R2 of almost 0.94 in V-gene segments detected (Figure 1). Therefore, we felt these served as “incipient” technical replicates. The random hexamer data set shared 20% of the detected CDR3s and the oligo dT data set shared 32% of its CDR3 sequences. Therefore, regardless of data set, there was an average of 26-27% sampling overlap regardless of whether amplification was performed or not. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Overlap of CDR3 sequence detection between technical replicates. CDR3 amino acid sequences were compared between technical replicates. Sequences unique to one data set are displayed in the outer circles. Sequences shared between data sets are in the overlap. Percent of shared CDR3 sequences is displayed in parentheses in the outer circles. (A) KSU data sets 32-1 and 32-2. (B) KSU data sets 39-1 and 39-2. (C) Com1 data sets mRNA-MMLV-Hex and mRNA-MMLV-dT. (D) Com2 data sets mRNA and TRNA.We also assessed the overlap in the detected CDR3s between the Com1 data set (mRNA-MMLV-Hex), Com2 data set (mRNA), and the KSU original data set to determine the extent of the overlap of CD3 detection using the different methods. From the 295,116 CDR3 unique sequences that were detected, 2662 of those sequences were shared among all three data sets (Figure 4). The amplified data sets from Com1 and Com2 shared the most CDR3 sequences between them with 34,141 sequences found in both data sets (Figure 4). The KSU data set shared 59% of its detected CDR3 sequences with the Com1 and Com2 data sets (Figure 4). These data are consistent with the lower depth of sequencing of the unamplified data set compared to the Com1 and Com2 data sets where 19-32% overlap occurred in detected CDR3 sequences. Figure 4. Open in a new tab CDR3 sequence capture among Com1, Com2, and KSU data sets. CDR3 amino acid sequences were compared among the Com1 mRNA-MMLV-Hex, Com2 mRNA, and the KSU data sets. Percent of the repertoire shared with at least one other data set is listed in parentheses. Detection of High Frequency CDR3s To gauge whether the highest frequency CDR3s can be detected by the different techniques, we assessed the 25 highest frequency CDR3s from each sequencing method. This resulted in a total of 48 unique CDR3s from the three different methods (Figure 5). The KSU data set detected all but one (CARGYFDVW) of these 48 sequences, the Com1 data set failed to detect four sequences (CARGTYW, CTWDEGNYW, CARGIYW, CARGSYW) and the Com2 data set detected all 48 sequences (Figure 5). The CDR3s that were not detected in the Com1 data set, did use V-gene segments that were detected in the data set. These data show that although the depth of sequencing of the KSU data set was about 10% of the amplified data sets, the data set still captured 98% of the highest frequency CDR3’s. Figure 5. Open in a new tab High frequency CDR3s detected among the Com1, Com2, and KSU data sets. The top 25 CDR3s from each data set (48 total) were compiled and percent of repertoire compared. Black boxes represent no detected reads (true zero). Rounded zeros are represented as 0.0. CDR3 Frequency Assessment While the high frequency CDR3s were shared among at least two sequencing runs, most of the CDR3 sequences detected were unique to each sequencing run (Figure 4). To determine the frequency of unique CDR3 sequences, we compared the most frequent, least frequent, and average percent of the measured CD3 repertoire (Table 5). The highest frequency CDR3 was detected at 4.16%, 0.22%, 2.26%, and of the repertoire for the KSU, Com1, and Com2 data sets, respectively (Table 5). The lowest frequency CDR3s, representing only a single detected read, were 0.0088%, 0.0004%, and 0.0002%, of the repertoire for the KSU, Com1, and Com2 data sets, respectively (Table 5). The average detection level for the KSU data set was 0.015%, 0.0006% for the Com1 data set, and 0.0007% for the Com 2data set (Table 5). Table 5: Whole Repertoire Unique Repertoire KSU Com1 Com2 KSU Com1 Com2 Minimum 0.008758 0.000446 0.000221 0.008758 0.000446 0.000221 Maximum 4.1655 0.216969 2.259680 0.035032 0.005804 0.026044 Average 0.014997 0.000555 0.00684 0.008929 0.000478 0.00290 Open in a new tabWe also examined the frequency of CDR3s that were unique to each data set. Overall, the maximum and the average frequencies of the data sets were reduced compared to the whole repertoire (Table 5). This demonstrates that the unique reads in each data set were most likely transcripts from low frequency B cells. Moreover, these data suggest that even without amplification, the KSU data set was detecting the most prevalent CDR3s and many low-frequency sequences.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Illumina sequencing of total RNA from mouse spleen is able to capture a representative sample of the splenic B cell repertoire. This snapshot of the repertoire, while producing less reads than amplified data sets, detected more V-gene segments than data sets that used two different amplification strategies and captures 98% of the high frequency CDR3s found in the amplified data sets. While amplified data sets provide more CDR3 depth of coverage, the unamplified data sets produced from an RNASeq allow for further data mining, eliminate as much primer bias as possible and provides an accurate representation of the repertoire. Sequencing requirements of the B cell receptor are more challenging than those of the T cell receptor. There are no consensus sequences to reference (10). Additionally, transcripts from the germline which are not successfully rearranged can be detected (23). Therefore, avoiding bias is one of the main priorities for antibody repertoire sequencing (16). PCR errors are accumulated through the amplification process which can falsely inflate the repertoire or they can add suspected mutations that do not exist (10, 17, 24, 25) and they may not be distinguishable from low level mutations that actually do exist in the repertoire (24, 26). PCR biases can be introduced because of primer binding properties, CG content, mispriming, non-specific binding, and errors during replication (16, 27–29). A specific issue in targeting antibody gene segments is primer annealing efficiencies since the gene segments that make up the murine IgH locus are similar, though not identical (28). The biases inherent in the multiplex PCR can lead to false repertoire skewing, gene frequency inaccuracies, and a less comprehensive view of the repertoire (25, 30, 31). The development of these multiplex primers, is highly challenging (32). Work by Bashford-Rogers (33) shows that there is little difference between RNA-capture, 5’RACE or PCR amplification in humans but others (27) have shown that PCR does create biases and 5’ RACE helps reduce these. Our results demonstrate some of the issues of assessing B-cell repertoires using massively multiplexed PCR reactions. While reproducibility for technical replicates was moderate to high, there was a large range of total read numbers across methodologies. Given the increase in read results with mRNA samples compared to TRNA samples, the authors hypothesize that mRNA increases the availability of antibody specific transcripts, increasing the overall read counts. Additionally, the reverse transcriptase plays a role in sequence generation. AMV reverse transcriptase has an RNase H activity, where MMLV reverse transcriptase does not (34). This activity may cleave RNA transcripts prior to completion of amplification, resulting in shorter reads with inadequate length for amplification. The use of oligo-dT primers will begin reverse transcription from the most 3’ end of the transcript. The target of amplification is around 1.5 kilobases upstream of the poly-A tail (35), likely leading to shorter reads and failure to amplify the region of interest. Random hexamer primers maybe able to overcome this bias due to their random priming nature. In addition to variations in read depth, the correlations of these data sets to the unamplified KSU data sets were low to moderate, even when the same bioinformatics processing was employed. Of significant concern is the Com1 and Com2 sets failed to detect 13 V-gene segments that were detected by the unamplified KSU RNASeq data set. The absence of these genes draws into question how one compares the various data sets with correlation coefficients that are below 0.7 when technical replicates of the same sequencing are greater than 0.99. Although Carlson et al. argues that amplification methodologies can capture the entire repertoire, there are concerns (11). Even when we only looked at the V-gene families detected at the highest frequency there were omissions. Of the 34 V-genes that we categorized as “high frequency” (>1% of the repertoire), Com1 found lower detection levels (defined as less than two-fold that found in the KSU data set) for five gene segments (V1-26, V1-18, V1-50, V4-1, and V2-6) and nine (V9-3, V4-1, V2-6, V1-, V5-17, V2-2, V8-8, V11-2, V14-2) for the Com2 data set. These results suggest that those methods are skewing the reported repertoire by missing or underreporting those high frequency V-gene segments. Interestingly, two V-gene segments (V4-1 and V2-6) were underrepresented in both data sets, but the other V-gene segments were unique. The failure of primers to capture specific V-genes is not a new discovery, as primers failed to adequately sequence hybridomas previously (18, 36). “Universal” primers for the human antibody repertoire do exist, but some questions remain if they cover the entire repertoire (37). The difficulty in developing a “universal” or even highly comprehensive primer set for the mouse is likely due to their highly varied leader sequences, V-gene segments, and framework regions. Primer design would have to rely on massively multiplexed reactions and/or degenerate primers. Additionally, the most commercially viable amplification methods would need to amplify across multiple common strains adding additional levels of complexity. Indeed, in our attempts to design “universal” primers, we found a minimum of 11 primer sets would be needed to detect V-genes associated for each isotype. Even then, there were still issues with matching PCR conditions and efficiency. Methods to overcome the biases detected in amplification have been developed, such as the use of 5’ RACE (26, 38, 39) and using molecular barcodes or identifiers (40, 41). However, these methods are expensive and have their own draw backs. Replication of the entire repertoire using 5’RACE would still require the use of multiple constant region primers, leading to the same multiplexing issues. Barcoding can have errors and chimeric reads making repertoires difficult to reconstruct (42). This latter issue is not a problem with our RNASeq data. While bias exists in the massively multiplexed amplification process, there may be some sequencing errors in the unamplified KSU data set as well. While not specifically amplified for antibody sequences, random hexamers and oligo-dT capture beads are used prior to sequencing to generate the library (43) and some biases have been observed in random hexamer binding (44). The use of oligo-dTs can result in enhancement of the 3’ end of transcripts (45). We do not think this is particularly problematic since Illumina sequence methodology aims to reduce bias in their library preparations by combining the random hexamer and oligo-dT capture. Additionally, while all libraries were sequenced on the Illumina platform, 3.19% of high-quality Illumina reads contain false base calls, which are impossible to differentiate using normal bioinformatics methods (10). Over representation of specific dineuclotides can also be detected in sequencing which are not related to primer usage (46). Therefore, although we hope to reduce bias and omission by doing RNASeq, we still have some technical issues that keep the data set from being a perfect reflection of the repertoire. Multiple technical replications help reduce the impact of this problem. One analysis that was not pursued in this current investigation was the identification of clonally related sequences. We were specifically interested in the functional antibody repertoire present in the spleen and focused our analysis at the transcript level. We acknowledge that the overrepresentation of some sequences may be likely within our data sets since we don’t use barcoding or clonality analysis to collapse similar mRNA sequences. Nevertheless, the overrepresentation of a specific sequence by an overly productive cell is also representative of cellular activation of transcription, and likely, functional antibody protein in the body (47, 48). The lack of amplification also results in varying sequence lengths in our data set. We selected 40nt as our minimum cutoff to provide us enough information to detect V-, D-, and J- gene segments. While some short sequences were included in the data analysis, our overall average sequence length was 287nt, with productive sequences averaging 331nt and unknown sequences averaging 270 nt (data not shown). Overall, less than 0.5% of the sequences analyzed where less than 100nt long (data not shown). Therefore, we do not think that sequence length is an issue in this study. Although there are issues using massively multiplexed PCR reactions, there are advantages that may overshadow the disadvantages. For example, increased sequencing depth (e.g. 1,260,000 reads vs. 11,200 complete reads), better low frequency CDR3 detection (20-fold more unique CDR3 sequence than the unamplified KSU data set), and sequencing costs can be lower than an Illumina MiSeq run (by integrating multiplexing/barcoding). Although amplification provides more detail in the CDR3 repertoire, if one is interested in the B cell clones that are most prevalent, then RNASeq does not appear to be at a disadvantage. CDR3 resampling was similar (20-32%) regardless of method. Additionally, when examining high frequency CDR3s, the unamplified data set only failed to detect a single unique CDR3 sequence, while the Com1 data set failed to detect four. Without using an amplification method with unique barcoding, such as that used in Shugay et al (49) it is impossible to tell which unique CDR3s are, in fact, correctly identified new sequences and which involve miscalls, leading to false diversity. As our current paper does not focus on the actual diversity of the repertoire, and instead focuses on the differences among sample preparations and sequencing methods, we do not attempt to identify false call unique CDR3s as doing so may falsely reduce diversity. Instead, the we used strict read quality cutoffs to prevent low quality base calls from being included in analysis, and we point to our highly overlapping V-gene segment usage (R2 = 0.9995 among multiple sequencing replicates to assure us that we minimized artifacts. Additionally, all sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform, so false base call rates should be similar across methodologies which we were focused on in this study. When preparing for antibody repertoire sequencing, multiple factors must be considered within the framework of the specific biological questions being asked. This includes needed coverage, cost, and starting material (39). Additionally, it is important to consider that all repertoire sequencing is merely a snapshot of a constantly shifting image (25). We will also never be able to fully capture the full diversity of the B cell immunoglobulin repertoire, which is estimated to range from 106-107 possible unique rearrangements and mutations (25, 39) to as much as 1013 (15). The failure of the KSU data set to detect rare clones compared to the amplified data sets is likely due to this; but even the amplified data sets only sampled a fraction of the total repertoire. Therefore, one must decide how “deep” is adequate for the question being addressed. During this investigation, we also had to address the issue that starting material may influence the quality of one’s sequencing. mRNA as a starting template increased reads up to two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, random hexamer primers and MMLV reverse transcriptase generally yielded higher read count results. Interestingly, the use of mRNA, with MMLV reverse transcriptase and hexanucleotide primers is most technically like that used in Illumina sequencing. However, additional data will be needed to confirm our observations since we did not pursue this aspect of the study in detail and the replicate number did not allow for robust statistical comparisons. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that sequencing of unamplified splenic RNA provides a realistic snapshot of the total splenic B cell repertoire. We also have demonstrated that a good understanding of the bioinformatics work flow and reporting of the methodology is critical and cannot be understated. We understand that there are cellular biases and transcript stability differences with in B cell subpopulations (50, 51). However, for the purpose of assessing a whole tissue B cell repertoire, unamplified RNASeq can provide a glimpse of the most prevalent B cell clones. The unamplified approach could just as well be applied to specific cell populations when the application requires it. Moreover, an unamplified data set may detect V-gene segments that amplified data sets miss.",

Copyright notice ID: 6366624 MSID: MS987236 PMID: 30740592 The publisher's version of this article is available at FASEB Bioadv Abstract Sequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count. Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire. Keywords: High throughput sequencing, Immunoglobulin genes, Mouse, Heavy Chain, RepSEQIntroduction Antibodies are B cell proteins that play a vital role in adaptive immunity. These complex molecules, and their diverse specificities are defined at several levels. At the protein level, these molecules are heterodimers joined with disulfide bonds between heavy and light chains. At the genetic level, the antibody specificity is influenced by semi-randomly recombining a variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments that are encoded in the genome. This V-D-J, or in the case of the light chain, V-J rearrangement, also influences antibody specificity by random and semi-random base insertions or deletions during the recombination process. In the end, the collection of antibodies produced, the antibody repertoire, is a fingerprint of what antigens an organism has been exposed to and a measure of immunocompetence. Sequencing has become easier, cheaper, and faster in recent years. Antibody repertoires have been sequenced in numerous species, in response to vaccinations (1–3) and infections (4–6), and have been employed in cancer detection; providing valuable feedback regarding the immune system’s response to challenges and for early cancer detection in patients (7, 8). In an effort to supplement unamplified MiSeq data sets used in our laboratory (9), we explored the use of commercial processes that use technologies to amplify sequences to increase the depth of coverage of specifically targeted immunoglobulin gene transcripts. These data sets are created using massively multiplexed PCR reactions that are subsequently sequenced on the Illumina platform. Multiplex amplification strategies have been used to explore the T cell (10, 11) and B cell repertoires (12–15) and biases, omissions (10, 11, 16–18).and PCR artifacts have been detected in the data sets (10). We started this project with the hypothesis that our unamplified data set would provide comparable results to those seen in the commercially amplified data sets. However, we are unaware of any immunoglobulin repertoire studies that have been done to compare data obtained using amplification techniques compared to the repertoire in a total RNASeq library. Concurrent with performing these analyses, we discovered that the required sample preparation for commercial sequencing also varied. Therefore, we found it necessary to examine the impact of sample preparation as part of our effort. This manuscript describes our results comparing a data set generated using unamplified total RNA (TRNA) to commercially amplified data sets. We examined the role of commercial amplification and cDNA generation methods as well as the impact of the starting material on sequence output.Materials and Methods KSU RNA Preparation RNA was prepared as outlined in Rettig et al 2017 (9). Briefly, RNA was extracted from the spleens of four nine-week old female C57Bl/6J mice. TRNA was submitted to the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility for sequencing and cDNA was prepared using standard Illumina protocols. cDNA made from the TRNA using random hexamer primers and oligo-dT selection, was size selected to 275-800bp length and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq at 2×300bp using Illumina’s protocol. No additional amplification beyond that required by Illumina preparation was used and consider these samples non-specifically amplified, or “unamplified”.Commercial Sample preparations mRNA was extracted from the TRNA isolated from the sample used for the KSU data set using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) following manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR for samples amplified with Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase based sample preparation was performed using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR for Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase based sample preparation was performed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbrad, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Starting material for RT-PCR was either TRNA from the KSU data set or the purified mRNA. RT-PCR products were submitted to Adaptive Biotechnologies (Seattle, WA) (Com1) on dry ice following company protocols. TRNA and mRNA (unamplified) were submitted to iRepertoire, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) (Com2) on dry ice following company protocols.Bioinformatic Analysis KSU sequencing results were analyzed as described previously (9). Briefly, sequencing results were quality controlled. Antibody-specific sequences were isolated and submitted to ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) (19) for analysis. Individual sequences were assigned a unique ID by the sequencing machinery during Illumina sequencing and were used to identify unique sequences. The sequence containing the most high quality information was retained for further analysis as outlined in Rettig et al (9). No further filtering of reads was performed. Both commercial sequencers provided their own bioinformatic analyses of the sequencing results. The raw sequencing results from Com1 and Com2 were also submitted to IMGT for analysis and subjected to the standard KSU bioinformatics pipeline. IMGT’s nomenclature and classifications were used throughout this paper. We assessed all functional V-gene segments as identified by IMGT. We also include three putative functional genes (V5S21, V1S100, and V3S7) which were detected in rearranged transcripts (containing a CDR3 C-xx-W motif or class switched) in our previous analysis of the normal C57BL/6 repertoire (20). IMGT’s High-V Quest occasionally assigned multiple potential V-gene segments to a single sequence, likely due to incomplete capture of the entire V-gene sequence or high homology between gene segments. In all IMGT processed data, sequences that contained two possible V-gene segment possibilities were assigned a weighted value of 0.5 per sequence, as opposed to one for full matches. Sequences with V-gene segments that were assigned more than two potential matches were excluded from analysis. Initial results were tabulated using the companys’ proprietary bioinformatic results. However, to determine the role of bioinformatic handling of the data, some of Com1 and Com2 data were subjected to the standard KSU bioinformatic workflow analysis and CDR3 analyses (9).Statistical Tests All statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism (Version 6.0). Paired T-tests were performed using the raw read counts. Coefficient of determinations (R2) were performed by comparing the percent of repertoire between animals. Percent of repertoire is determined by dividing the read count for a specific V-gene segment by the total number of reads detected and multiplying by 100.Results Most studies examining immunoglobulin repertoires use amplification to increase the depth of sequencing, but amplification comes with some drawbacks. We wanted to assess the comparability of amplified and non-amplified data from identical samples. In preparation to do this comparison, we found that different commercial amplification methodologies required different types of sample preparation. For example, sample submission for the Com1 data sets required a cDNA sample. The Com1 process amplified the resulting cDNA using proprietary primers and sequencing on the Illumina platform. After an initial submission showed a low correlation between the Com1 sequencing and the KSU data set (data not shown), we hypothesized that cDNA preparation plays a role in determining the amplified repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the role of starting material (mRNA or TRNA), reverse transcriptase (AMV vs MMLV), and primer templates (oligo-dT or random hexamer) on the sequenced B cell immunoglobulin repertoire. Com2 submissions required the submission of TRNA, rather than cDNA. Assessment of Transcriptional Read Counts Com1amplified data sets returned between 7,084 and 1,263,003 sequences, dependent on the preparation method. mRNA starting material yielded more total transcriptional reads than TRNA (P=0.013, 2 tailed matched T test; Table 1). Generally, the AMV reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers tended to yield higher numbers of transcripts. The use of AMV and random hexamer primers resulted in more total productive reads in three out of four of the comparisons directly comparing primers, however, the overall differences were not statistically different (P>0.05, 2 tailed matched T test; Table 1). In the Com2 data set, we found a moderate number of reads, about one-half of those detected in the highest Com1 numbers. These compare to 11,200 sequence reads containing a CDR3 generated in the KSU data set using a total MiSeq approach.

These sequences were not long enough for CDR3 detection. Determination of Sequencing Reproducibility To assess the repeatability of the amplified Com1 and Com2 data sets, we examined the correlation of V-gene segment usage. In the C57BL/6 mouse, the V-gene segment is the most varied in the heavy chain (IgH locus) comprising a total of 109 functional V-gene segments, three putative function V-gene segments, and alleles compared to 19 for the D-gene segment and four for the J-gene (21, 22). The nucleotide sequences in the V-gene segments are also highly varied and require a complex multiplex PCR to amplify. Correlations were assessed using the data provided by the commercial vendor’s proprietary bioinformatics. Non-strain specific V-gene segment assignments accounted for between 0.84% and 1.46% of the sequencing results from Com 1 and 1.74% and 1.41% for Com2 (Table 2). Although there were differences in the immunoglobulin gene transcripts detected, there was a high correlation in the V-gene sequences detected among the different technical replicates in the Com1 data (R2 range from 0.6986 to 0.9933, all p<0.0001) (Figure 1). The R2 between technical replicates in Com2 was 0.9621 (p<0.0001). We also examined the reproducibility of two technical replicates of KSU sequencing used for a different analysis and obtained an R2 of 0.9996 for Mouse 32, and 0.9995 for Mouse 39 (p<0.001) showing high levels of reproducibility between KSU sequencing runs. Therefore, although total transcripts generated varied with sample preparation, the V-gene segments that were detected were consistently detected using two different commercial approaches.

The highest R2 are dark read, the lowest R2 are blue.Impact of Amplification on V-gene Segment Detection The unamplified KSU approach produced a data set where a total of 112 V-gene segments were detected while the Com1 data sets contained between 85 and 100 V-gene segments. The Com2 mRNA data set contained 99 detectable V-gene segments and the TRNA contained 100. Comparisons of V-gene segments in the Com1 data set to the KSU data set showed moderate R2 values; 0.4457 to 0.5841 (all p<0.0001) (Table 3). The Com2 data sets also showed moderate R2 of 0.6695 for mRNA and 0.6607 for TRNA (all p<0.0001). To determine why there were differences in V-gene detection, we compared the results from the most commonly detected V-gene segments in the KSU data sets to their frequencies in the Com1 and Com2 data sets. The protocol for Illumina sequencing uses mRNA selection, SuperScriptIII reverse transcriptase, and random hexamer primers. To best compare results, we used the Com1 mRNA-MMLV-Hex data set and the Com2 mRNA data set using the top 34 V-gene segments in the KSU data set. These V-gene segments comprise over one percent of the detected repertoire and are considered highly expressed. In the Com1 data set, of these 36 highly expressed V-gene segments, five (V1-26, V1-18, V1-50, V4-1, and V2-6) were detected at two-fold lower frequency than in the KSU data set (Figure 2). These five V-gene segments were either absent or were near zero percent of the repertoire (Figure 2). Of these same top 34 V-gene segments in the Com1 data set, two (V6-3 and V2-6-8) were detected at two-fold greater than the KSU data set (Figure 2). The R2 for these top 36 V-gene segments to the KSU data set was 0.1783 (P=0.0128).

The highest value percent of repertoire is dark read while the lowest are white. Black boxes represent no detected reads (true zero). Rounded zeros are represented as 0.0.We also compared the Com2 mRNA data set to the same 34 V-gene segments from the unamplified KSU data. Nine of the 34 V-gene sequences (V9-3, V4-1, V2-6, V1-81, V5-17, V2-2, V8-8, V11-2, V14-2) were detected at a twofold or lower level than in the KSU data set (Figure 2). Five other V-gene segments (V1-53, V3-6, V1-64, V10-1, and V1-69) were detected at twofold higher levels than those found in the KSU data set (Figure 2). The correlation of these top 34 V-gene segments was better than the Com1 R2 at 0.4098 (P=<0.0001). Our normal workflow methods include the use of functionally productive and unknown transcripts for analysis (9). This inclusion helps balance the lower read numbers obtained with unamplified sequences. We performed the same analysis as above between our productive + unknown dataset used above, with our productive only dataset. We detected a tota1 of 104 V-gene segments. Those not detected in the productive only list (V3S7, V6-7, V6-4, V1-62-1, V5-12-4, V1-17-1, and V6-5) comprised less than 0.7% of the repertoire. The correlation coefficient was high at 0.9596(P<0.0001), and there were no changes at great than 2-fold of the productive + unknown data set (Figure 2). These analyses reveal that the addition of unknown functionality V-gene segments does not significantly alter the repertoire.Direct Comparisons of Amplified and Unamplified Data Sets The comparisons in V-gene use were made using the bioinformatics provided by the commercial ventures. To standardize the data handling to remove bioinformatic reasons for the differences in data, we processed the sequencing results from the Com1 mRNA-MMLV-Hex and Com2 mRNA data sets using the KSU bioinformatics work flow (9). The KSU bioinformatic treatment of the Com1 data set correlated moderately with the commercially provided bioinformatics (R2=0.4795, p<0.0001). After processing the Com1 data with the KSU bioinformatics pipeline, the R2 to the KSU data set increased slightly from 0.5517 (Table 3) with the original bioinformatics to 0.5649 (p<0.0001) with the adjusted bioinformatics. However, nine V-gene segments were detected in the Com1 data set using the KSU bioinformatics workflow that were not originally detected using the commercially provided bioinformatics (Sup Fig 1). When we processed the Com2 data using the KSU bioinformatic pipeline, the Com2 data set was highly correlated with the original commercially provided bioinformatics treatment (R2=0.9860, p<0.0001). When we compared Com2 data set processed with the KSU bioinformatics pipeline to the KSU RNASeq data set, the data still only had an R2=0.6791 (p<0.0001). The KSU bioinformatics workflow detected an additional four V-gene segments that were not detected by the commercial bioinformatics (Sup Fig 1). When we reanalyzed the bioinformatics data from Com1 and Com2 using the KSU pipeline, we detected gene segments that were not detected in the original commercially provided bioinformatics. However, the inclusion of these gene segments, did not greatly improve the R2 between the amplified data sets and the KSU RNASeq data. In the Com1 data set, some gene segments (V1-26, V1-18, V1-50, V2-9-1) were not detected or only detected at low levels in the original bioinformatics but were detected at high levels (>1%) in the KSU/IMGT processed data (Sup Fig 1). The three additional V-gene segments detected in the Com2 data set (V2-5, V1-62-2, and V1-62-3 were found in less than <0.3% of the repertoire (Sup Fig 1). These changes were not sufficient to significantly improve R2 values.Impact of Amplification on the Reproducibility of CDR3 Detection The absence of some V-gene segments in the Com1 and Com2 data compared to the KSU data was a concern. It precludes a complete picture of the V-gene repertoire. Nevertheless, amplified sequencing of the antibody repertoire is thought to provide an advantage in that the depth of coverage is increased over unamplified data sets due to the number of reads generated. To determine how extensive the discrepancy is between amplified and unamplified data, we assessed the read depth (number of reads generated) and resampling efficiency of CDR3 (number of unique CDR3s resampled between replicates) using technical replicates of samples sequenced with the various sequencing techniques. As anticipated, amplified data sets had both higher total read numbers and unique CDR3 numbers (Table 4). Table 4: KSU mRNA-MMLV-Hex (Com1) mRNA (Com2) Read Count 11,200 1,035,461 637,214 Unique CDR3 Sequences 6668 180,266 146,231 Open in a new tabResampling/reproducibility has been assumed to improve with the depth of coverage. We had the unique opportunity to compare sequencing data from the same biological material subjected to multiple sequencing methodologies. We have also had the opportunity to do technical replicates on multiple samples subjected to RNASeq or amplification procedures. This allowed us the ability to look at CDR3 sampling reproducibility and to determine if amplification provided any advantage in CDR3 reproducibility. For the KSU unamplified data set, two C57BL/6J mouse spleen RNA samples (#32 and #39) were sequenced independently two times each and the CDR3s sampled were compared. In the KSU data set, 32-1 shared 28% of its total unique reads with 32-2. (Figure 3). 32-2 shared 24% of its reads with 32-1 (Figure 3). KSU data set, 39, showed 25% overlap of their total unique reads between each sampling (Figure 3). For the Com2 data, since there was such a strong correlation between the sequence output between mRNA and TRNA samples of C57BL/6J spleen samples (R2 = 0.9644), we considered these technical replicates. The mRNA data set shared 24% of its sequences with the TRNA data set while the TRNA data set shared 30% of its sequences with the mRNA data set. We also examined the resampling efficiency in the Com1 data set using the spleen mRNA-MMLV data sets that were reversed transcribed with two different primers, random hexamer and oligo-dT. Although this was not a perfect technical replicate, there was an R2 of almost 0.94 in V-gene segments detected (Figure 1). Therefore, we felt these served as “incipient” technical replicates. The random hexamer data set shared 20% of the detected CDR3s and the oligo dT data set shared 32% of its CDR3 sequences. Therefore, regardless of data set, there was an average of 26-27% sampling overlap regardless of whether amplification was performed or not. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Overlap of CDR3 sequence detection between technical replicates. CDR3 amino acid sequences were compared between technical replicates. Sequences unique to one data set are displayed in the outer circles. Sequences shared between data sets are in the overlap. Percent of shared CDR3 sequences is displayed in parentheses in the outer circles. (A) KSU data sets 32-1 and 32-2. (B) KSU data sets 39-1 and 39-2. (C) Com1 data sets mRNA-MMLV-Hex and mRNA-MMLV-dT. (D) Com2 data sets mRNA and TRNA.We also assessed the overlap in the detected CDR3s between the Com1 data set (mRNA-MMLV-Hex), Com2 data set (mRNA), and the KSU original data set to determine the extent of the overlap of CD3 detection using the different methods. From the 295,116 CDR3 unique sequences that were detected, 2662 of those sequences were shared among all three data sets (Figure 4). The amplified data sets from Com1 and Com2 shared the most CDR3 sequences between them with 34,141 sequences found in both data sets (Figure 4). The KSU data set shared 59% of its detected CDR3 sequences with the Com1 and Com2 data sets (Figure 4). These data are consistent with the lower depth of sequencing of the unamplified data set compared to the Com1 and Com2 data sets where 19-32% overlap occurred in detected CDR3 sequences. Figure 4. Open in a new tab CDR3 sequence capture among Com1, Com2, and KSU data sets. CDR3 amino acid sequences were compared among the Com1 mRNA-MMLV-Hex, Com2 mRNA, and the KSU data sets. Percent of the repertoire shared with at least one other data set is listed in parentheses.Detection of High Frequency CDR3s To gauge whether the highest frequency CDR3s can be detected by the different techniques, we assessed the 25 highest frequency CDR3s from each sequencing method. This resulted in a total of 48 unique CDR3s from the three different methods (Figure 5). The KSU data set detected all but one (CARGYFDVW) of these 48 sequences, the Com1 data set failed to detect four sequences (CARGTYW, CTWDEGNYW, CARGIYW, CARGSYW) and the Com2 data set detected all 48 sequences (Figure 5). The CDR3s that were not detected in the Com1 data set, did use V-gene segments that were detected in the data set. These data show that although the depth of sequencing of the KSU data set was about 10% of the amplified data sets, the data set still captured 98% of the highest frequency CDR3’s. Figure 5. Open in a new tab High frequency CDR3s detected among the Com1, Com2, and KSU data sets. The top 25 CDR3s from each data set (48 total) were compiled and percent of repertoire compared. Black boxes represent no detected reads (true zero). Rounded zeros are represented as 0.0.CDR3 Frequency Assessment While the high frequency CDR3s were shared among at least two sequencing runs, most of the CDR3 sequences detected were unique to each sequencing run (Figure 4). To determine the frequency of unique CDR3 sequences, we compared the most frequent, least frequent, and average percent of the measured CD3 repertoire (Table 5). The highest frequency CDR3 was detected at 4.16%, 0.22%, 2.26%, and of the repertoire for the KSU, Com1, and Com2 data sets, respectively (Table 5). The lowest frequency CDR3s, representing only a single detected read, were 0.0088%, 0.0004%, and 0.0002%, of the repertoire for the KSU, Com1, and Com2 data sets, respectively (Table 5). The average detection level for the KSU data set was 0.015%, 0.0006% for the Com1 data set, and 0.0007% for the Com 2data set (Table 5). Table 5: Whole Repertoire Unique Repertoire KSU Com1 Com2 KSU Com1 Com2 Minimum 0.008758 0.000446 0.000221 0.008758 0.000446 0.000221 Maximum 4.1655 0.216969 2.259680 0.035032 0.005804 0.026044 Average 0.014997 0.000555 0.00684 0.008929 0.000478 0.00290 Open in a new tabWe also examined the frequency of CDR3s that were unique to each data set. Overall, the maximum and the average frequencies of the data sets were reduced compared to the whole repertoire (Table 5). This demonstrates that the unique reads in each data set were most likely transcripts from low frequency B cells. Moreover, these data suggest that even without amplification, the KSU data set was detecting the most prevalent CDR3s and many low-frequency sequences.Discussion Illumina sequencing of total RNA from mouse spleen is able to capture a representative sample of the splenic B cell repertoire. This snapshot of the repertoire, while producing less reads than amplified data sets, detected more V-gene segments than data sets that used two different amplification strategies and captures 98% of the high frequency CDR3s found in the amplified data sets. While amplified data sets provide more CDR3 depth of coverage, the unamplified data sets produced from an RNASeq allow for further data mining, eliminate as much primer bias as possible and provides an accurate representation of the repertoire. Sequencing requirements of the B cell receptor are more challenging than those of the T cell receptor. There are no consensus sequences to reference (10). Additionally, transcripts from the germline which are not successfully rearranged can be detected (23). Therefore, avoiding bias is one of the main priorities for antibody repertoire sequencing (16). PCR errors are accumulated through the amplification process which can falsely inflate the repertoire or they can add suspected mutations that do not exist (10, 17, 24, 25) and they may not be distinguishable from low level mutations that actually do exist in the repertoire (24, 26). PCR biases can be introduced because of primer binding properties, CG content, mispriming, non-specific binding, and errors during replication (16, 27–29). A specific issue in targeting antibody gene segments is primer annealing efficiencies since the gene segments that make up the murine IgH locus are similar, though not identical (28). The biases inherent in the multiplex PCR can lead to false repertoire skewing, gene frequency inaccuracies, and a less comprehensive view of the repertoire (25, 30, 31). The development of these multiplex primers, is highly challenging (32). Work by Bashford-Rogers (33) shows that there is little difference between RNA-capture, 5’RACE or PCR amplification in humans but others (27) have shown that PCR does create biases and 5’ RACE helps reduce these. Our results demonstrate some of the issues of assessing B-cell repertoires using massively multiplexed PCR reactions. While reproducibility for technical replicates was moderate to high, there was a large range of total read numbers across methodologies. Given the increase in read results with mRNA samples compared to TRNA samples, the authors hypothesize that mRNA increases the availability of antibody specific transcripts, increasing the overall read counts. Additionally, the reverse transcriptase plays a role in sequence generation. AMV reverse transcriptase has an RNase H activity, where MMLV reverse transcriptase does not (34). This activity may cleave RNA transcripts prior to completion of amplification, resulting in shorter reads with inadequate length for amplification. The use of oligo-dT primers will begin reverse transcription from the most 3’ end of the transcript. The target of amplification is around 1.5 kilobases upstream of the poly-A tail (35), likely leading to shorter reads and failure to amplify the region of interest. Random hexamer primers maybe able to overcome this bias due to their random priming nature. In addition to variations in read depth, the correlations of these data sets to the unamplified KSU data sets were low to moderate, even when the same bioinformatics processing was employed. Of significant concern is the Com1 and Com2 sets failed to detect 13 V-gene segments that were detected by the unamplified KSU RNASeq data set. The absence of these genes draws into question how one compares the various data sets with correlation coefficients that are below 0.7 when technical replicates of the same sequencing are greater than 0.99. Although Carlson et al. argues that amplification methodologies can capture the entire repertoire, there are concerns (11). Even when we only looked at the V-gene families detected at the highest frequency there were omissions. Of the 34 V-genes that we categorized as “high frequency” (>1% of the repertoire), Com1 found lower detection levels (defined as less than two-fold that found in the KSU data set) for five gene segments (V1-26, V1-18, V1-50, V4-1, and V2-6) and nine (V9-3, V4-1, V2-6, V1-, V5-17, V2-2, V8-8, V11-2, V14-2) for the Com2 data set. These results suggest that those methods are skewing the reported repertoire by missing or underreporting those high frequency V-gene segments. Interestingly, two V-gene segments (V4-1 and V2-6) were underrepresented in both data sets, but the other V-gene segments were unique. The failure of primers to capture specific V-genes is not a new discovery, as primers failed to adequately sequence hybridomas previously (18, 36). “Universal” primers for the human antibody repertoire do exist, but some questions remain if they cover the entire repertoire (37). The difficulty in developing a “universal” or even highly comprehensive primer set for the mouse is likely due to their highly varied leader sequences, V-gene segments, and framework regions. Primer design would have to rely on massively multiplexed reactions and/or degenerate primers. Additionally, the most commercially viable amplification methods would need to amplify across multiple common strains adding additional levels of complexity. Indeed, in our attempts to design “universal” primers, we found a minimum of 11 primer sets would be needed to detect V-genes associated for each isotype. Even then, there were still issues with matching PCR conditions and efficiency. Methods to overcome the biases detected in amplification have been developed, such as the use of 5’ RACE (26, 38, 39) and using molecular barcodes or identifiers (40, 41). However, these methods are expensive and have their own draw backs. Replication of the entire repertoire using 5’RACE would still require the use of multiple constant region primers, leading to the same multiplexing issues. Barcoding can have errors and chimeric reads making repertoires difficult to reconstruct (42). This latter issue is not a problem with our RNASeq data. While bias exists in the massively multiplexed amplification process, there may be some sequencing errors in the unamplified KSU data set as well. While not specifically amplified for antibody sequences, random hexamers and oligo-dT capture beads are used prior to sequencing to generate the library (43) and some biases have been observed in random hexamer binding (44). The use of oligo-dTs can result in enhancement of the 3’ end of transcripts (45). We do not think this is particularly problematic since Illumina sequence methodology aims to reduce bias in their library preparations by combining the random hexamer and oligo-dT capture. Additionally, while all libraries were sequenced on the Illumina platform, 3.19% of high-quality Illumina reads contain false base calls, which are impossible to differentiate using normal bioinformatics methods (10). Over representation of specific dineuclotides can also be detected in sequencing which are not related to primer usage (46). Therefore, although we hope to reduce bias and omission by doing RNASeq, we still have some technical issues that keep the data set from being a perfect reflection of the repertoire. Multiple technical replications help reduce the impact of this problem. One analysis that was not pursued in this current investigation was the identification of clonally related sequences. We were specifically interested in the functional antibody repertoire present in the spleen and focused our analysis at the transcript level. We acknowledge that the overrepresentation of some sequences may be likely within our data sets since we don’t use barcoding or clonality analysis to collapse similar mRNA sequences. Nevertheless, the overrepresentation of a specific sequence by an overly productive cell is also representative of cellular activation of transcription, and likely, functional antibody protein in the body (47, 48). The lack of amplification also results in varying sequence lengths in our data set. We selected 40nt as our minimum cutoff to provide us enough information to detect V-, D-, and J- gene segments. While some short sequences were included in the data analysis, our overall average sequence length was 287nt, with productive sequences averaging 331nt and unknown sequences averaging 270 nt (data not shown). Overall, less than 0.5% of the sequences analyzed where less than 100nt long (data not shown). Therefore, we do not think that sequence length is an issue in this study. Although there are issues using massively multiplexed PCR reactions, there are advantages that may overshadow the disadvantages. For example, increased sequencing depth (e.g. 1,260,000 reads vs. 11,200 complete reads), better low frequency CDR3 detection (20-fold more unique CDR3 sequence than the unamplified KSU data set), and sequencing costs can be lower than an Illumina MiSeq run (by integrating multiplexing/barcoding). Although amplification provides more detail in the CDR3 repertoire, if one is interested in the B cell clones that are most prevalent, then RNASeq does not appear to be at a disadvantage. CDR3 resampling was similar (20-32%) regardless of method. Additionally, when examining high frequency CDR3s, the unamplified data set only failed to detect a single unique CDR3 sequence, while the Com1 data set failed to detect four. Without using an amplification method with unique barcoding, such as that used in Shugay et al (49) it is impossible to tell which unique CDR3s are, in fact, correctly identified new sequences and which involve miscalls, leading to false diversity. As our current paper does not focus on the actual diversity of the repertoire, and instead focuses on the differences among sample preparations and sequencing methods, we do not attempt to identify false call unique CDR3s as doing so may falsely reduce diversity. Instead, the we used strict read quality cutoffs to prevent low quality base calls from being included in analysis, and we point to our highly overlapping V-gene segment usage (R2 = 0.9995 among multiple sequencing replicates to assure us that we minimized artifacts. Additionally, all sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform, so false base call rates should be similar across methodologies which we were focused on in this study. When preparing for antibody repertoire sequencing, multiple factors must be considered within the framework of the specific biological questions being asked. This includes needed coverage, cost, and starting material (39). Additionally, it is important to consider that all repertoire sequencing is merely a snapshot of a constantly shifting image (25). We will also never be able to fully capture the full diversity of the B cell immunoglobulin repertoire, which is estimated to range from 106-107 possible unique rearrangements and mutations (25, 39) to as much as 1013 (15). The failure of the KSU data set to detect rare clones compared to the amplified data sets is likely due to this; but even the amplified data sets only sampled a fraction of the total repertoire. Therefore, one must decide how “deep” is adequate for the question being addressed. During this investigation, we also had to address the issue that starting material may influence the quality of one’s sequencing. mRNA as a starting template increased reads up to two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, random hexamer primers and MMLV reverse transcriptase generally yielded higher read count results. Interestingly, the use of mRNA, with MMLV reverse transcriptase and hexanucleotide primers is most technically like that used in Illumina sequencing. However, additional data will be needed to confirm our observations since we did not pursue this aspect of the study in detail and the replicate number did not allow for robust statistical comparisons. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that sequencing of unamplified splenic RNA provides a realistic snapshot of the total splenic B cell repertoire. We also have demonstrated that a good understanding of the bioinformatics work flow and reporting of the methodology is critical and cannot be understated. We understand that there are cellular biases and transcript stability differences with in B cell subpopulations (50, 51). However, for the purpose of assessing a whole tissue B cell repertoire, unamplified RNASeq can provide a glimpse of the most prevalent B cell clones. The unamplified approach could just as well be applied to specific cell populations when the application requires it. Moreover, an unamplified data set may detect V-gene segments that amplified data sets miss.Supplementary Material Supp FigS1 MS987236-supplement-Supp_FigS1.pdf (365.2KB, pdf) Acknowledgements Our work is supported by NASA grants NNX13AN34G and NNX15AB45G,  grant GM103418, the Molecular Biology Core supported by the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University, and the Kansas State University Johnson Cancer Research Center.

    "abstract": "Abstract This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK-754, an AAV8-based human factor VIII (FVIII) vector designed to deliver a codon-optimized and CpG-depleted B domain-deleted F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific promoter for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A. A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 × 1012 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK-754 (3.1 × 1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 × 1012 and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK-754.

    "introduction": "Introduction Hemophilia A is a monogenic X chromosome-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene encoding blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), leading to the loss of functional FVIII protein.1,2,3 This lifelong disorder requires treatment with replacement factor concentrates to maintain FVIII levels to control and prevent bleeding episodes.1,4 Patients with severe disease can experience recurrent joint and muscle bleeding and may receive regular FVIII infusions to prevent the debilitating effects of arthropathy and to reduce their risk of life-threatening bleeds.4,5 Another more recent treatment option is the bispecific antibody emicizumab, which mimics FVIII function by binding FIXa and FX to promote hemostasis.6 Monogenic diseases are promising indications for potentially curative gene therapeutic approaches,7 and in particular, hemophilia A has become a showcase indication for exploring and refining in vivo gene therapy principles.8 This is due to the fact that the expression of FVIII from the introduced functional copy of the F8 transgene into a patient’s liver cells can be readily measured in plasma, and relatively low levels of FVIII are already sufficient to alleviate a severe disease phenotype. For adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, this needs to be accomplished by a truncated, B domain-deleted (BDD) variant of FVIII (BDD-FVIII) because of the restricted packaging capacity of AAV, which is 5 kb at the most, excluding the flanking inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions. Nonetheless, ample preclinical experience has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, which also leads to improvements in vector design.9,10,11,12 Several investigational hemophilia A gene therapy products built on this concept are being tested clinically,13 and the most advanced program has already received marketing authorization (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec), employing an AAV5 vector designed to express a human BDD-FVIII variant called FVIII-SQ.14,15 Three years of follow-up data demonstrated a sustained, clinically relevant benefit at doses of 4 × 1013 and 6 × 1013 vg (vector genomes)/kg, but also identified a decline in FVIII expression levels over time, suggesting that this therapy will not be lifelong.15 Other observations difficult to explain to date are the variability in expression between individuals at a given dose and between participants in phase 1/2 and phase 3.15 These observations have not been made in conceptually similar clinical hemophilia B gene therapy trials and appear to be associated with the nature of the transgene product, as synthesis of FVIII at high levels in hepatocytes is constrained and prone to trigger an unfolded protein response that could lead to cellular stress.16 Past and present hemophilia trials further revealed that vector immunogenicity can negatively affect the durability of transgene expression,17,18,19 reflected in a drop or even loss of activity within the first couple of months after treatment that is often accompanied by a transient rise in liver enzymes. While ultimately a cytotoxic T cell response against the capsid protein contributes to this phenomenon, other host immune responses elicited by the inherent immunogenic features of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are likely to be involved.20,21 The presence of (an excess of) unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) motifs in the vg is particularly important in that respect as CpG clusters, which are typically present only in microbials, act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in humans and can trigger an innate immune response. The removal of such CpG clusters from vg is therefore thought to be a key measure for dampening innate immune signals that eventually lead to deleterious adaptive immune responses.22 Here, we describe preclinical development of the recombinant single-stranded (ss) gene therapy vector TAK-754 (formerly BAX 888 and SHP654; Baxalta US, Lexington, MA) designed for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A. The vector was built on the AAV8 capsid with a preferential liver tropism and engineered to deliver a human codon-optimized and CpG-depleted BDD-F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific transthyretin (TTR) promoter. This paper details the identification of the lead candidate vector ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII and reports on preclinical studies aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of the TAK-754 human gene therapy vector in mice.",

    "results": "Results Lead candidate screening of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt Expression levels of endogenous wild-type (WT) FVIII levels are relatively low,23 and the corresponding coding region exceeds the natural packaging limit for AAV. We addressed this by cloning codon-optimized BDD-F8 open reading frames in an AAV expression cassette designed for high expression levels in human hepatocytes (Figure 1A). A total of 41 codon-optimized ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (sequences 01–41) were produced and screened for potency in FVIII knockout (KO) mice. FVIII KO mice closely reflect the severe hemophilia A phenotype in patients and therefore represent a suitable animal model. Expression was compared to animals receiving the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIwt control vector (sequence wt) harboring the WT F8 nucleotide sequence. The best candidate of this in vivo biopotency screen was sequence (seq) 04, with 79.8% nucleotide sequence identity to the corresponding coding sequences in WT F8 (GenBank: M14113) and 74-fold improved efficacy (Figure 1B). The guanine-cytosine (GC) content of seq04 was 56%, which is substantially higher than that of the WT sequence (44%) and matches the native AAV8 capsid protein coding sequence (Figure S1; Table S1). Moreover, CpG motifs in seq04 were low in number and dispersed over the length of the transgene (Figure S2). This feature should help minimize the immunogenicity risk, as high densities of these DNA motifs can increase immunogenicity by stimulating the innate immune system via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 in the liver.24 Despite a vector size of approximately 5.2 kb, the recombinant genome appears as a single homogeneous band following DNA gel analysis (Figure 1C), confirming correct packaging of the slightly oversized genome of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 (relative to an AAV WT genome of 4.7 kb). The same held true for the other AAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (data not shown). Overall capsid integrity and purity of the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 preparation was confirmed following SDS PAGE-based size separation and detection of VP1, VP2, and VP3 by silver staining (Figure 1D). Initial yields for the seq04 vector per liter cell culture were about 6-fold higher than for the otherwise identical F8 WT nucleotide sequence vector,25 indicating that vector production using the F8 lead candidate sequence was actually more efficient, probably due to its GC content matching the GC content of the AAV8 virus (Figure S1).

(D) SDS-PAGE of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq4. The capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 appear as main proteins in the silver-stained gel.These favorable features provided the rationale to select ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 as the lead candidate for the development of a hemophilia A gene therapy vector. Biopotency and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 In anticipation of clinical trials of TAK-754 gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, we optimized our vector titration approach, which was previously based on a qualified qPCR of vg with a coefficient of variation (CV) higher than 25% (data not shown). We therefore considered changing the genomic titering regime toward assaying AAV capsid particle (CP) numbers by ELISA, as the latter assay reproducibly showed a CV of <10%. The robust performance of the CP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), together with a consistent full to empty capsid ratio of the vector batches produced,26 provided the rationale to assign the vector strength for subsequent preclinical development of TAK-754, as well as for clinical dosing in a phase 1/2 study. The FVIII activity dose response and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 was examined in FVIII KO mice following vector delivery at doses of 3.0 × 1011, 1.2 × 1012, or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg. A preliminary safety assessment was included as a secondary endpoint. Animals that tested positive for anti-FVIII antibodies were excluded from statistical analysis of biopotency and efficacy. No treatment-related findings were observed microscopically in the heart, kidney, liver, or spleen, including micro- or macrovascular thrombosis or inflammatory infiltrate. Animals that received 1.2 × 1012 or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg showed a dose-dependent increase in mean plasma FVIII activity from 0.6 to 1.9 IU/mL over the investigation period (Figure 2A). FVIII activity was undetectable in animals treated with buffer or the lowest dose of 3.0 × 1011 CP/kg. Dose-dependent activity of TAK-754 was confirmed in the human hepatic HepG2 cell line (Figure S3). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Potency and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 (A) In vivo biopotency determination. FVIII KO mice (n = 12) were injected with 3.0 × 1011, 1.2 × 1012, and 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector and analyzed for plasma FVIII activity at four time points, including 14, 28, 42, and 56 days. FVIII activity levels were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in controls and the low-dose group but showed a dose-dependent increase in the mid- and high-dose groups. Data are shown in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line. (B) Hemostatic efficacy testing. The same animals as under (A) were subjected to a tail tip bleeding assay on day 63. A dose-dependent reduction of blood loss was observed for the higher doses. Note that only animals testing negative for anti-FVIII antibodies on day 56 were tested. The median is indicated by a horizontal line. (C) Transduction efficiency. F8 transgene copy numbers in gDNA (dark bars) and in cDNA (light bars) were quantified in TAK-754-treated animals and controls (n = 2) on day 63, confirming dose-dependent liver transduction. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).A tail-tip bleeding assay was used to assess the bleeding phenotype. Animals treated with buffer and TAK-754 at the lowest dose showed similar median blood loss normalized for body weights of 6.1 and 7.5 mg/g, respectively, corresponding to the undetectable FVIII activity in these animals (Figure 2B). The higher doses (1.2 × 1012 or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg) of TAK-754 significantly reduced median blood loss to 0.6 and 0.4 mg/g, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001 compared to buffer). Statistical assessment of dose proportionality was precluded by the lack of FVIII activity at the low dose. At the end of the experiment, livers of animals with activities around the mean FVIII activity were selected from each group for quantification of vg and F8 RNA expression. The vg levels in the control group or the low-dose TAK-754 group were under the detection limit of the applied method. Mid- and high-dose animals showed robust and dose-dependent transduction as a function of vg in the liver (Figure 2C). F8 RNA levels were consistent with F8 DNA levels, except for two low-dose animals showing a measurable F8 transcript signal (i.e., within the limit of detection). The 2.5-fold dose increase from 1.2 × 1012 to 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in F8 gDNA levels and a 3.1-fold increase in F8 RNA levels (Figure 2C), which broadly mirrored the 3.2-fold increase in FVIII activity levels (Figure 2A). TAK-754-mediated long-term expression of FVIII The development of an antibody response directed against the human FVIII xenoprotein capable of neutralizing FVIII activity is a well-known phenomenon in mice.27 To enable a long-term expression study following the delivery of TAK-754, we employed a transgenic mouse model (huFVIII tg mice) that lacks detectable FVIII protein but usually shows immunological tolerance toward the human coagulation factor.28 huFVIII tg mice were injected with a TAK-754 dose of 3.1 × 1012 CP/kg and were monitored for FVIII activity and anti-drug antibodies from 2 to 24 weeks. The mean FVIII plasma activity ranged between 2.9 and 3.8 IU/mL throughout the observation period (Figure 3A). Three of 30 animals tested positive for anti-BDD-FVIII immunoglobulin-binding antibodies. In one of these three animals, the antibody response appeared to be transient, as it tested negative in week 24. One of the two persistent binding antibodies-positive animals also tested positive for FVIII inhibitory antibodies (data not shown). No treatment-related clinical symptoms or deaths were recorded. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Sustained FVIII expression following a single injection of TAK-754 (A) Long-term FVIII expression in a transgenic human FVIII mouse model. Following delivery of 3.1 × 1012 CP/kg of TAK-754 to huFVIII tg mice (n = 30), activity levels were stable between 2 and 24 weeks. Data are presented in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line and the mean represented by a cross. (B) Vector biodistribution. Wild-type C57Bl/6J mice were treated with a TAK-754 dose of 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg, and vector biodistribution was determined at three time points, including 3 days, 3 weeks, and 18 weeks (n = 20). Data are given in mean ± SEM; values <LLOQ were included as zero. Nonclinical safety evaluation and biodistribution study in hemostatically normal mice The toxicity of gene therapy candidate TAK-754 was examined in cohorts of male C57BL/6J mice receiving a single dose of TAK-754 at 2.0 × 1012, 3.8 × 1012, and 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg, and also at higher dose levels up to 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg (1.0 × 1013, 3.0 × 1013, and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg). The dose levels were selected based on the TAK-754 activity data shown in Figure 2A. The design of the toxicity study entailed subjecting cohorts of animals to a panel of analyses that included complete necropsies, pathological evaluation, biodistribution of vg, FVIII activity, FVIII antigen, binding anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, neutralizing anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, and binding anti-AAV8 antibodies at day 3, week 3, and week 18. During the study, there were no deaths and no adverse effects attributed to TAK-754 during the in-life phase, pathology, post-dosing observations, or any adverse TAK-754-related changes in clinical chemistry parameters, hematology, and coagulation parameters or urinalysis. The distribution of TAK-754 DNA was highest in the liver at all dose levels tested. TAK-754 distribution in liver and other tissues was dose related and was generally highest at the earliest time point, decreasing by day 21 (Figure 3B). However, TAK-754 DNA levels were still highest in liver tissues at this time point. Further decrease by day 126 is already diminished in the liver and skeletal muscle and not observed in lymph node and heart any longer. TAK-754 DNA levels in brain and testes samples harvested from TAK-754-treated animals were evaluated as negative or below the lower limit of assay quantification by week 18 in all animals. Representative data are shown from the 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg dose group (Figure 3B). Animals treated with TAK-754 had measurable amounts of human FVIII antigen in plasma from week 3, with levels in some mice already present from day 3. The observed decrease in FVIII antigen concentrations in individual animals was most likely a result of the formation of circulating anti-human BDD-FVIII binding antibodies, which can compete with the species-specific assay, resulting in nondetectable FVIII antigen. Such binding antibodies indeed formed over time and increased with dose, which is in line with a pharmacokinetic analysis where FVIII immunogenicity increased with initial high-level AAV-FVIII protein expression.29 TAK-754-treated animals also showed higher FVIII activity levels compared with the pre-treatment period, indicating that BDD-FVIII was expressed in these mice. However, some animals had even lower-than-normal FVIII levels most likely caused by the generation of neutralizing anti-human-BDD-FVIII antibodies that inhibited both human BDD-FVIII activity and endogenous mouse FVIII activity by virtue of the antibodies’ partial cross-reactivity against mouse FVIII. Neutralizing antibodies against BDD-FVIII became measurable by week 18 in all dose groups. As expected, all treated animals tested strongly positive for anti-AAV8 binding antibodies from week 3. In summary, toxicology experiments in mice receiving single intravenous (i.v.) TAK-754 injections at doses up to 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg found no evidence of TAK-754-related adverse effects during the in-life phase and no toxicologically relevant observations. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was 5.0 × 1013 cp/kg, the highest dose tested. Integration site analysis While host cell maintenance of rAAV vectors is largely accomplished through episomal DNA, residual chromosomal integration does occur. We therefore performed an integration site (IS) analysis of the TAK-754 vector in FVIII KO mice. Mice were treated with either 2.0 × 1012 or 1.0 × 1013 CP/kg TAK-754 and observed for 1 or 4 months (Figure 4). Liver transduction levels, determined by F8 qPCR, were dose dependent and comparable at both time points (Figure S4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Vector integration site analysis Cumulative retrieval frequencies of top 10 cell clones in the livers of mice following injection of TAK-754 at (A) 2.0 × 1012 or (B) 1.0 × 1013 CP/kg. Samples with ID 1–4 and 10–13 were analyzed 1 month after treatment, those with ID 5–9 and 14–18 four months after treatment.Illumina sequencing of nonrestrictive (nr)linear amplification-mediated (LAM)-PCR products showed comparable numbers of average sequencing reads for both time points after vector administration (Table S2). A total of 227 unique exactly mappable ISs were detected in animals in both groups at 1 month after gene therapy treatment (5–54 unique ISs/mouse). Four months after treatment, 187 unique exactly mappable ISs were retrieved from both groups (5–42 unique ISs/mice), confirming an integration frequency of ≤0.01% (Table S2). The detection of identical top 10 ranking ISs in repetitive (nr)LAM-PCR amplicons was very low: one IS 1 month after treatment and 3 ISs detected in 2/6 (nr)LAM-PCRs after 4 months (Figure 4). This indicates that the unequal IS frequency profiles are due to the low number of events retrieved and that there are no signs for clonal skewing or clonal dominance in the treated animals. Only low-order (≤4) common ISs could be identified at both time points, which is in line with the low number of ISs detected after administration of TAK-754, correlating with an untargeted integration profile. None of the ISs were found in or next to genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation.30 In summary, the integration profile of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mouse liver showed a low but measurable level of integration, with no signs of potential side effects, and, at least within the 4-month observation period, no evidence for clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in oncogenes (i.e., HCC) was noted.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Here, we describe preclinical development of TAK-754, an efficient human AAV vector for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, designed to express a human BDD-FVIII protein with an identical amino acid sequence to that of recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa.31 While the vector was designed and developed at a time before first clinical readouts from hemophilia A gene therapy trials became available, it does bear a couple of features that should allow efficient expression of the human F8 transgene in humans. TAK-754 vector design Choice of the AAV8 capsid was based on its preferential tropism for the liver as it demonstrates excellent transduction efficiency of hepatocytes in preclinical models32 and a number of liver-directed clinical gene therapy trials such as those for the treatment of hemophilia A and B or glycogen storage disease type 1A build on this capsid serotype.33 Numerous comparative studies over the last couple of years consolidated our comprehension of a species-dependent performance of vector capsids.34 It is now clear that AAV8 is particularly efficient in rodents; in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans, the capsid also preferentially targets hepatocytes but with an approximately 20-fold lower efficiency.35 This correlation factor needs to be considered when it comes to the deduction of a clinical starting dose from the nonclinical data package. Accordingly, a starting dose of 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector was selected for the first cohort, taking into account that a dose of 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg in FVIII KO mice resulted in a mean plasma FVIII activity of 1.9 IU/mL, translating into a projected clinical FVIII activity of ∼6% of normal. It is worth noting that the packaging capacity of recombinant AAV8 vectors can be pushed beyond the size of the WT genome of 4.7 kb.36 Consistently, we found that TAK-754’s vg was the correct size and intact, as judged by the absence of degradation bands. Packaging of similarly oversized BDD-FVIII expression cassettes using AAV537 and AAVrh838 led to aberrant, truncated genomes that first had to be re-assembled in transduced cells through recombination before functional FVIII could have been produced. The use of the strong yet compact mouse TTR promoter/enhancer combination enabled robust liver-specific gene expression. This promoter was selected from a variety of liver-specific promoters during preclinical development of the hemophilia B vector BAX33539 and came off well in a head-to-head comparison with other commonly used liver-specific promoters.40 The risk of relying on nonconserved murine transcription factor binding sites for a human gene therapy was mitigated by our demonstration of robust BDD-FVIII expression in the human liver HepG2 cell line upon transduction with TAK-754. Activity of the mouse TTR promoter/enhancer was also confirmed in the clinical trials for BAX33518 and SPK-8011,41 although in the latter case, a point-mutated promoter variant was used that has converted a weak hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) binding site into a moderately stronger one. Codon optimization of the BDD-F8 transgene initially relied on available codon-optimization algorithms. This approach resulted in sequences with improved expression but also greater GC content, in line with the understanding that this leads to higher mRNA levels and greater protein translation than gene sequences having greater AT content.42 However, this inadvertently introduced CpG clusters into the vector sequence, which function as PAMPs. These sequences can stimulate innate immune responses through signaling via TLRs, leading to an exaggerated adaptive immune response.22,43,44 TAK-754 candidate screening thus included a further filtering step that removed codon-optimized F8 sequences harboring potentially detrimental predicted CpG clusters.45 The lead candidate F8 nucleotide sequence (seq04) gave rise to a 74-fold increased expression in FVIII-KO mice compared to the corresponding WT sequence yet contains only 17 dispersed CpG motifs (Figures S2A and S2B). A further depletion of CpG motifs within the entire expression cassette, which may likewise be important for durable transgene expression,13 has not been carried out (Figure S2B). Preclinical evaluation of TAK-754 Overall, the vector showed a good efficacy and safety profile. Dose-dependent increases in mean plasma FVIII activity were obtained after single i.v. injections of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mice. The observed variability of FVIII expression (Figure 2A) appears to be a transgene-specific phenomenon. While FIX expression is associated with a low inter-species variability,46 that of BDD-FVIII is consistently higher and observed in mice and humans. Reports investigating the underlying mechanisms of inter-individual variability of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec) expression concluded that multiple host-mediated factors could contribute.47,48 Future endeavors to identify predictive biomarkers of response might lead to the development of approaches with optimized outcomes of AAV-based F8 gene therapies. A TAK-754-mediated dose response of FVIII activity was confirmed in a HepG2 cellular biopotency assay. Such an in vitro assay could allow replacement of the cumbersome in vivo lot release testing procedure, in line with the expectations and requirements of the authorities, which support the reduction and circumvention of animal experiments in the release of clinical batches, if applicable.49 Dose-dependent efficacy was observed in the tail tip bleeding assay in FVIII KO mice, and long-term expression could be demonstrated in a separate animal study using human FVIII transgenic mice, in which a single dose of 4 × 1012 CP/kg resulted in FVIII expression from week 2 until the end of the experiment (6 months), with no trend for a decline in FVIII activity. This mouse model, which was developed to mitigate the issue of anti-human FVIII antibody formation,28 served its purpose to monitor TAK-754-dependent long-term expression of human BDD-FVIII. While this model also allows comparative prediction of human immune responses elicited by human FVIII variants via repeated dosing of the respective recombinant proteins according to identical protein mass, this study setup could not be mirrored with a gene therapy vector. Due to the further absence of a gold standard vector regarding FVIII immunogenicity, we did not aim for conducting a comparative FVIII immunogenicity study with the TAK-754 vector. It is important to note that the model falls short in predicting the FVIII expression decline based on AAV vector immunogenicity, which is a phenomenon known to be largely absent from typical preclinical animal models. No toxicologically relevant effects related to TAK-754 were observed. Single bolus injections of TAK-754 administered to mice at doses of up to 5 × 1013 CP/kg occurred without deaths, adverse clinical signs, or post-dosing observations related to TAK-754. A limitation of the mouse safety study was its duration of 18 weeks, which precluded the detection of a potential relationship between FVIII expression and liver cancer/hyperplasia, which can occur at time points later than 1 year.50 The observed biodistribution of TAK-754 in treated FVIII KO mice confirmed the predominant detection of vector DNA in liver tissue, with minimal off-target gene expression in other tissues, consistent with the hepatic tropism of AAV8. Despite the known technical limitations of (nr)LAM-PCR, IS analyses further showed that vector integration was minimal (<0.01%). Within the 4-month observation period, there were also no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in or near genes previously implicated in HCC formation. While these data suggest that in humans TAK-754 will be maintained episomally and pose a low genotoxicity risk to patients, caution is needed since HCC-relevant loci are not well conserved between mice and humans,30 and the duration of the study was too short to observe any HCC concerns. Perspective The preclinical development program showed a good efficacy and safety profile for TAK-754 and formed the basis for defining the starting dose of 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg, factoring in the above-mentioned mouse-to-human correlation factor for AAV8. Despite these promising data, based on the gathered clinical experience with liver-directed AAV gene therapies over the last couple of years, it has turned out that vector immunogenicity in humans appears more critical than in rodents or NHPs.51 A successful translation of preclinical gene therapy programs into the clinic critically depends on the type and strength of the immune responses elicited against the very gene therapy vector in humans. In the case of TAK-754, while the safety profile was consistent with an AAV8-based gene therapy and all four enrolled patients in the clinical trial (this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03370172) showed dose-dependent peak FVIII activity 4 to 9 weeks after infusion (cohort 1: 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 3.8% and 11%, respectively; cohort 2: 6.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 54.7% and 69.4%, respectively), the initial vector-derived FVIII expression steadily declined despite the use of corticosteroids.52 The comprehensive analysis of immune components in the peripheral blood of the patients did not reveal the presence of inhibitory anti-FVIII antibodies or any obvious signs of an exaggerated immune response.53 It is worth mentioning in this context that NHPs as a nonrodent species were excluded from preclinical safety testing mainly because of technical challenges such as the naturally high AAV8 infection rate in monkey populations.54,55 Since an AAV vector-induced immune response leading to an abrupt or gradual loss in FVIII expression has not been observed in NHPs,56 such a study would also likely have failed to reveal an issue with the TAK-754 vector already in preclinical stage. A comparison with Valoctocogene roxaparvovec and other clinical-stage hemophilia AAV vectors (Table 1) suggests that rather subtle yet not fully understood differences in the vector design determine the success or failure of a therapy.13 Several AAV-based hemophilia A gene therapy clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov also counted on AAV8, whereas other programs use different capsids, including AAV5, AAV6, LK03, and AAVhu37, with potential differences in their tropism or transduction efficiency. Ranking these capsids in terms of performance in humans is, however, difficult since all these vectors differ also in expression cassette design and manufacturing process employed. Clinical head-to-head comparisons of vectors differing only in the capsid serotype are lacking and would be difficult to conduct for various reasons such as cross-reactivity of anti-AAV antibodies against a broad range of serotypes.

With regard to the expression cassettes, all vector products rely on liver-specific promoter/enhancer combinations, with SPK8011 even using the same mouse TTR promoter, albeit with a point mutation in the HNF3 binding site reported to moderately increase transcription.41 The SPK8011 cassette is unique in harboring a short synthetic intron, which is likely to further improve transgene expression. All but two (GO-8 and ASC618) transgenes were designed to express recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa,31 although different algorithms for codon optimization were likely used, which may substantially affect expression efficiency. No relevant differences in expression levels are expected from the poly(A) elements, all of which are short and synthetic in nature. From the publicly available data, it appears that not all codon-optimized BDD-F8 transgene cDNAs have been depleted for CpG motifs (Table 1). Whether the remaining 17 CpG motifs in TAK-754 caused a more pronounced vector-mediated immune response compared to that of SPK8011 (0 CpG) or Valoctocogene roxaparvovec (3 CpGs) is difficult to evaluate, but it seems unlikely as they are dispersed and do not form a CpG cluster.45 Both the design of the expression cassette as well as the clinical data available so far suggest that SPK8011 is the most efficient vector, enabling expression of BDD-FVIII at a dose that falls within the tolerated capsid immune response window. At the same time, however, it transpired over the last several years that FVIII expression should be kept at a moderate level so as to avoid an unfolded protein response in the transduced cells, leading to a decline in FVIII activity.13,57 Efforts to optimize AAV-based F8 gene therapy should therefore focus on bioengineered FVIII constructs with a lower propensity to misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum,58,59 accompanied by target tissue-specific analysis and development of improved preclinical immunogenicity models, which in turn will increase the field’s understanding of the key features that make up an effective gene therapy product for hemophilia A.",

Copyright notice ID: 11929063 PMID: 40123744 Abstract This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK-754, an AAV8-based human factor VIII (FVIII) vector designed to deliver a codon-optimized and CpG-depleted B domain-deleted F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific promoter for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A. A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 × 1012 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK-754 (3.1 × 1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 × 1012 and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK-754.

Its vector design is compared with other clinical-stage AAV vectors to identify features that contribute to durable FVIII expression, thereby enabling the success of hemophilia A gene therapy.Introduction Hemophilia A is a monogenic X chromosome-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene encoding blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), leading to the loss of functional FVIII protein.1,2,3 This lifelong disorder requires treatment with replacement factor concentrates to maintain FVIII levels to control and prevent bleeding episodes.1,4 Patients with severe disease can experience recurrent joint and muscle bleeding and may receive regular FVIII infusions to prevent the debilitating effects of arthropathy and to reduce their risk of life-threatening bleeds.4,5 Another more recent treatment option is the bispecific antibody emicizumab, which mimics FVIII function by binding FIXa and FX to promote hemostasis.6 Monogenic diseases are promising indications for potentially curative gene therapeutic approaches,7 and in particular, hemophilia A has become a showcase indication for exploring and refining in vivo gene therapy principles.8 This is due to the fact that the expression of FVIII from the introduced functional copy of the F8 transgene into a patient’s liver cells can be readily measured in plasma, and relatively low levels of FVIII are already sufficient to alleviate a severe disease phenotype. For adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, this needs to be accomplished by a truncated, B domain-deleted (BDD) variant of FVIII (BDD-FVIII) because of the restricted packaging capacity of AAV, which is 5 kb at the most, excluding the flanking inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions. Nonetheless, ample preclinical experience has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, which also leads to improvements in vector design.9,10,11,12 Several investigational hemophilia A gene therapy products built on this concept are being tested clinically,13 and the most advanced program has already received marketing authorization (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec), employing an AAV5 vector designed to express a human BDD-FVIII variant called FVIII-SQ.14,15 Three years of follow-up data demonstrated a sustained, clinically relevant benefit at doses of 4 × 1013 and 6 × 1013 vg (vector genomes)/kg, but also identified a decline in FVIII expression levels over time, suggesting that this therapy will not be lifelong.15 Other observations difficult to explain to date are the variability in expression between individuals at a given dose and between participants in phase 1/2 and phase 3.15 These observations have not been made in conceptually similar clinical hemophilia B gene therapy trials and appear to be associated with the nature of the transgene product, as synthesis of FVIII at high levels in hepatocytes is constrained and prone to trigger an unfolded protein response that could lead to cellular stress.16 Past and present hemophilia trials further revealed that vector immunogenicity can negatively affect the durability of transgene expression,17,18,19 reflected in a drop or even loss of activity within the first couple of months after treatment that is often accompanied by a transient rise in liver enzymes. While ultimately a cytotoxic T cell response against the capsid protein contributes to this phenomenon, other host immune responses elicited by the inherent immunogenic features of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are likely to be involved.20,21 The presence of (an excess of) unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) motifs in the vg is particularly important in that respect as CpG clusters, which are typically present only in microbials, act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in humans and can trigger an innate immune response. The removal of such CpG clusters from vg is therefore thought to be a key measure for dampening innate immune signals that eventually lead to deleterious adaptive immune responses.22 Here, we describe preclinical development of the recombinant single-stranded (ss) gene therapy vector TAK-754 (formerly BAX 888 and SHP654; Baxalta US, Lexington, MA) designed for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A. The vector was built on the AAV8 capsid with a preferential liver tropism and engineered to deliver a human codon-optimized and CpG-depleted BDD-F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific transthyretin (TTR) promoter. This paper details the identification of the lead candidate vector ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII and reports on preclinical studies aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of the TAK-754 human gene therapy vector in mice.Results Lead candidate screening of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt Expression levels of endogenous wild-type (WT) FVIII levels are relatively low,23 and the corresponding coding region exceeds the natural packaging limit for AAV. We addressed this by cloning codon-optimized BDD-F8 open reading frames in an AAV expression cassette designed for high expression levels in human hepatocytes (Figure 1A). A total of 41 codon-optimized ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (sequences 01–41) were produced and screened for potency in FVIII knockout (KO) mice. FVIII KO mice closely reflect the severe hemophilia A phenotype in patients and therefore represent a suitable animal model. Expression was compared to animals receiving the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIwt control vector (sequence wt) harboring the WT F8 nucleotide sequence. The best candidate of this in vivo biopotency screen was sequence (seq) 04, with 79.8% nucleotide sequence identity to the corresponding coding sequences in WT F8 (GenBank: M14113) and 74-fold improved efficacy (Figure 1B). The guanine-cytosine (GC) content of seq04 was 56%, which is substantially higher than that of the WT sequence (44%) and matches the native AAV8 capsid protein coding sequence (Figure S1; Table S1). Moreover, CpG motifs in seq04 were low in number and dispersed over the length of the transgene (Figure S2). This feature should help minimize the immunogenicity risk, as high densities of these DNA motifs can increase immunogenicity by stimulating the innate immune system via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 in the liver.24 Despite a vector size of approximately 5.2 kb, the recombinant genome appears as a single homogeneous band following DNA gel analysis (Figure 1C), confirming correct packaging of the slightly oversized genome of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 (relative to an AAV WT genome of 4.7 kb). The same held true for the other AAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (data not shown). Overall capsid integrity and purity of the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 preparation was confirmed following SDS PAGE-based size separation and detection of VP1, VP2, and VP3 by silver staining (Figure 1D). Initial yields for the seq04 vector per liter cell culture were about 6-fold higher than for the otherwise identical F8 WT nucleotide sequence vector,25 indicating that vector production using the F8 lead candidate sequence was actually more efficient, probably due to its GC content matching the GC content of the AAV8 virus (Figure S1).

(D) SDS-PAGE of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq4. The capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 appear as main proteins in the silver-stained gel.These favorable features provided the rationale to select ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 as the lead candidate for the development of a hemophilia A gene therapy vector.Biopotency and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 In anticipation of clinical trials of TAK-754 gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, we optimized our vector titration approach, which was previously based on a qualified qPCR of vg with a coefficient of variation (CV) higher than 25% (data not shown). We therefore considered changing the genomic titering regime toward assaying AAV capsid particle (CP) numbers by ELISA, as the latter assay reproducibly showed a CV of <10%. The robust performance of the CP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), together with a consistent full to empty capsid ratio of the vector batches produced,26 provided the rationale to assign the vector strength for subsequent preclinical development of TAK-754, as well as for clinical dosing in a phase 1/2 study. The FVIII activity dose response and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 was examined in FVIII KO mice following vector delivery at doses of 3.0 × 1011, 1.2 × 1012, or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg. A preliminary safety assessment was included as a secondary endpoint. Animals that tested positive for anti-FVIII antibodies were excluded from statistical analysis of biopotency and efficacy. No treatment-related findings were observed microscopically in the heart, kidney, liver, or spleen, including micro- or macrovascular thrombosis or inflammatory infiltrate. Animals that received 1.2 × 1012 or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg showed a dose-dependent increase in mean plasma FVIII activity from 0.6 to 1.9 IU/mL over the investigation period (Figure 2A). FVIII activity was undetectable in animals treated with buffer or the lowest dose of 3.0 × 1011 CP/kg. Dose-dependent activity of TAK-754 was confirmed in the human hepatic HepG2 cell line (Figure S3). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Potency and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 (A) In vivo biopotency determination. FVIII KO mice (n = 12) were injected with 3.0 × 1011, 1.2 × 1012, and 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector and analyzed for plasma FVIII activity at four time points, including 14, 28, 42, and 56 days. FVIII activity levels were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in controls and the low-dose group but showed a dose-dependent increase in the mid- and high-dose groups. Data are shown in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line. (B) Hemostatic efficacy testing. The same animals as under (A) were subjected to a tail tip bleeding assay on day 63. A dose-dependent reduction of blood loss was observed for the higher doses. Note that only animals testing negative for anti-FVIII antibodies on day 56 were tested. The median is indicated by a horizontal line. (C) Transduction efficiency. F8 transgene copy numbers in gDNA (dark bars) and in cDNA (light bars) were quantified in TAK-754-treated animals and controls (n = 2) on day 63, confirming dose-dependent liver transduction. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).A tail-tip bleeding assay was used to assess the bleeding phenotype. Animals treated with buffer and TAK-754 at the lowest dose showed similar median blood loss normalized for body weights of 6.1 and 7.5 mg/g, respectively, corresponding to the undetectable FVIII activity in these animals (Figure 2B). The higher doses (1.2 × 1012 or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg) of TAK-754 significantly reduced median blood loss to 0.6 and 0.4 mg/g, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001 compared to buffer). Statistical assessment of dose proportionality was precluded by the lack of FVIII activity at the low dose. At the end of the experiment, livers of animals with activities around the mean FVIII activity were selected from each group for quantification of vg and F8 RNA expression. The vg levels in the control group or the low-dose TAK-754 group were under the detection limit of the applied method. Mid- and high-dose animals showed robust and dose-dependent transduction as a function of vg in the liver (Figure 2C). F8 RNA levels were consistent with F8 DNA levels, except for two low-dose animals showing a measurable F8 transcript signal (i.e., within the limit of detection). The 2.5-fold dose increase from 1.2 × 1012 to 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in F8 gDNA levels and a 3.1-fold increase in F8 RNA levels (Figure 2C), which broadly mirrored the 3.2-fold increase in FVIII activity levels (Figure 2A).TAK-754-mediated long-term expression of FVIII The development of an antibody response directed against the human FVIII xenoprotein capable of neutralizing FVIII activity is a well-known phenomenon in mice.27 To enable a long-term expression study following the delivery of TAK-754, we employed a transgenic mouse model (huFVIII tg mice) that lacks detectable FVIII protein but usually shows immunological tolerance toward the human coagulation factor.28 huFVIII tg mice were injected with a TAK-754 dose of 3.1 × 1012 CP/kg and were monitored for FVIII activity and anti-drug antibodies from 2 to 24 weeks. The mean FVIII plasma activity ranged between 2.9 and 3.8 IU/mL throughout the observation period (Figure 3A). Three of 30 animals tested positive for anti-BDD-FVIII immunoglobulin-binding antibodies. In one of these three animals, the antibody response appeared to be transient, as it tested negative in week 24. One of the two persistent binding antibodies-positive animals also tested positive for FVIII inhibitory antibodies (data not shown). No treatment-related clinical symptoms or deaths were recorded. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Sustained FVIII expression following a single injection of TAK-754 (A) Long-term FVIII expression in a transgenic human FVIII mouse model. Following delivery of 3.1 × 1012 CP/kg of TAK-754 to huFVIII tg mice (n = 30), activity levels were stable between 2 and 24 weeks. Data are presented in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line and the mean represented by a cross. (B) Vector biodistribution. Wild-type C57Bl/6J mice were treated with a TAK-754 dose of 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg, and vector biodistribution was determined at three time points, including 3 days, 3 weeks, and 18 weeks (n = 20). Data are given in mean ± SEM; values <LLOQ were included as zero.Nonclinical safety evaluation and biodistribution study in hemostatically normal mice The toxicity of gene therapy candidate TAK-754 was examined in cohorts of male C57BL/6J mice receiving a single dose of TAK-754 at 2.0 × 1012, 3.8 × 1012, and 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg, and also at higher dose levels up to 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg (1.0 × 1013, 3.0 × 1013, and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg). The dose levels were selected based on the TAK-754 activity data shown in Figure 2A. The design of the toxicity study entailed subjecting cohorts of animals to a panel of analyses that included complete necropsies, pathological evaluation, biodistribution of vg, FVIII activity, FVIII antigen, binding anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, neutralizing anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, and binding anti-AAV8 antibodies at day 3, week 3, and week 18. During the study, there were no deaths and no adverse effects attributed to TAK-754 during the in-life phase, pathology, post-dosing observations, or any adverse TAK-754-related changes in clinical chemistry parameters, hematology, and coagulation parameters or urinalysis. The distribution of TAK-754 DNA was highest in the liver at all dose levels tested. TAK-754 distribution in liver and other tissues was dose related and was generally highest at the earliest time point, decreasing by day 21 (Figure 3B). However, TAK-754 DNA levels were still highest in liver tissues at this time point. Further decrease by day 126 is already diminished in the liver and skeletal muscle and not observed in lymph node and heart any longer. TAK-754 DNA levels in brain and testes samples harvested from TAK-754-treated animals were evaluated as negative or below the lower limit of assay quantification by week 18 in all animals. Representative data are shown from the 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg dose group (Figure 3B). Animals treated with TAK-754 had measurable amounts of human FVIII antigen in plasma from week 3, with levels in some mice already present from day 3. The observed decrease in FVIII antigen concentrations in individual animals was most likely a result of the formation of circulating anti-human BDD-FVIII binding antibodies, which can compete with the species-specific assay, resulting in nondetectable FVIII antigen. Such binding antibodies indeed formed over time and increased with dose, which is in line with a pharmacokinetic analysis where FVIII immunogenicity increased with initial high-level AAV-FVIII protein expression.29 TAK-754-treated animals also showed higher FVIII activity levels compared with the pre-treatment period, indicating that BDD-FVIII was expressed in these mice. However, some animals had even lower-than-normal FVIII levels most likely caused by the generation of neutralizing anti-human-BDD-FVIII antibodies that inhibited both human BDD-FVIII activity and endogenous mouse FVIII activity by virtue of the antibodies’ partial cross-reactivity against mouse FVIII. Neutralizing antibodies against BDD-FVIII became measurable by week 18 in all dose groups. As expected, all treated animals tested strongly positive for anti-AAV8 binding antibodies from week 3. In summary, toxicology experiments in mice receiving single intravenous (i.v.) TAK-754 injections at doses up to 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg found no evidence of TAK-754-related adverse effects during the in-life phase and no toxicologically relevant observations. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was 5.0 × 1013 cp/kg, the highest dose tested.Integration site analysis While host cell maintenance of rAAV vectors is largely accomplished through episomal DNA, residual chromosomal integration does occur. We therefore performed an integration site (IS) analysis of the TAK-754 vector in FVIII KO mice. Mice were treated with either 2.0 × 1012 or 1.0 × 1013 CP/kg TAK-754 and observed for 1 or 4 months (Figure 4). Liver transduction levels, determined by F8 qPCR, were dose dependent and comparable at both time points (Figure S4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Vector integration site analysis Cumulative retrieval frequencies of top 10 cell clones in the livers of mice following injection of TAK-754 at (A) 2.0 × 1012 or (B) 1.0 × 1013 CP/kg. Samples with ID 1–4 and 10–13 were analyzed 1 month after treatment, those with ID 5–9 and 14–18 four months after treatment.Illumina sequencing of nonrestrictive (nr)linear amplification-mediated (LAM)-PCR products showed comparable numbers of average sequencing reads for both time points after vector administration (Table S2). A total of 227 unique exactly mappable ISs were detected in animals in both groups at 1 month after gene therapy treatment (5–54 unique ISs/mouse). Four months after treatment, 187 unique exactly mappable ISs were retrieved from both groups (5–42 unique ISs/mice), confirming an integration frequency of ≤0.01% (Table S2). The detection of identical top 10 ranking ISs in repetitive (nr)LAM-PCR amplicons was very low: one IS 1 month after treatment and 3 ISs detected in 2/6 (nr)LAM-PCRs after 4 months (Figure 4). This indicates that the unequal IS frequency profiles are due to the low number of events retrieved and that there are no signs for clonal skewing or clonal dominance in the treated animals. Only low-order (≤4) common ISs could be identified at both time points, which is in line with the low number of ISs detected after administration of TAK-754, correlating with an untargeted integration profile. None of the ISs were found in or next to genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation.30 In summary, the integration profile of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mouse liver showed a low but measurable level of integration, with no signs of potential side effects, and, at least within the 4-month observation period, no evidence for clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in oncogenes (i.e., HCC) was noted.Discussion Here, we describe preclinical development of TAK-754, an efficient human AAV vector for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, designed to express a human BDD-FVIII protein with an identical amino acid sequence to that of recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa.31 While the vector was designed and developed at a time before first clinical readouts from hemophilia A gene therapy trials became available, it does bear a couple of features that should allow efficient expression of the human F8 transgene in humans. TAK-754 vector design Choice of the AAV8 capsid was based on its preferential tropism for the liver as it demonstrates excellent transduction efficiency of hepatocytes in preclinical models32 and a number of liver-directed clinical gene therapy trials such as those for the treatment of hemophilia A and B or glycogen storage disease type 1A build on this capsid serotype.33 Numerous comparative studies over the last couple of years consolidated our comprehension of a species-dependent performance of vector capsids.34 It is now clear that AAV8 is particularly efficient in rodents; in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans, the capsid also preferentially targets hepatocytes but with an approximately 20-fold lower efficiency.35 This correlation factor needs to be considered when it comes to the deduction of a clinical starting dose from the nonclinical data package. Accordingly, a starting dose of 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector was selected for the first cohort, taking into account that a dose of 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg in FVIII KO mice resulted in a mean plasma FVIII activity of 1.9 IU/mL, translating into a projected clinical FVIII activity of ∼6% of normal. It is worth noting that the packaging capacity of recombinant AAV8 vectors can be pushed beyond the size of the WT genome of 4.7 kb.36 Consistently, we found that TAK-754’s vg was the correct size and intact, as judged by the absence of degradation bands. Packaging of similarly oversized BDD-FVIII expression cassettes using AAV537 and AAVrh838 led to aberrant, truncated genomes that first had to be re-assembled in transduced cells through recombination before functional FVIII could have been produced. The use of the strong yet compact mouse TTR promoter/enhancer combination enabled robust liver-specific gene expression. This promoter was selected from a variety of liver-specific promoters during preclinical development of the hemophilia B vector BAX33539 and came off well in a head-to-head comparison with other commonly used liver-specific promoters.40 The risk of relying on nonconserved murine transcription factor binding sites for a human gene therapy was mitigated by our demonstration of robust BDD-FVIII expression in the human liver HepG2 cell line upon transduction with TAK-754. Activity of the mouse TTR promoter/enhancer was also confirmed in the clinical trials for BAX33518 and SPK-8011,41 although in the latter case, a point-mutated promoter variant was used that has converted a weak hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) binding site into a moderately stronger one. Codon optimization of the BDD-F8 transgene initially relied on available codon-optimization algorithms. This approach resulted in sequences with improved expression but also greater GC content, in line with the understanding that this leads to higher mRNA levels and greater protein translation than gene sequences having greater AT content.42 However, this inadvertently introduced CpG clusters into the vector sequence, which function as PAMPs. These sequences can stimulate innate immune responses through signaling via TLRs, leading to an exaggerated adaptive immune response.22,43,44 TAK-754 candidate screening thus included a further filtering step that removed codon-optimized F8 sequences harboring potentially detrimental predicted CpG clusters.45 The lead candidate F8 nucleotide sequence (seq04) gave rise to a 74-fold increased expression in FVIII-KO mice compared to the corresponding WT sequence yet contains only 17 dispersed CpG motifs (Figures S2A and S2B). A further depletion of CpG motifs within the entire expression cassette, which may likewise be important for durable transgene expression,13 has not been carried out (Figure S2B).Preclinical evaluation of TAK-754 Overall, the vector showed a good efficacy and safety profile. Dose-dependent increases in mean plasma FVIII activity were obtained after single i.v. injections of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mice. The observed variability of FVIII expression (Figure 2A) appears to be a transgene-specific phenomenon. While FIX expression is associated with a low inter-species variability,46 that of BDD-FVIII is consistently higher and observed in mice and humans. Reports investigating the underlying mechanisms of inter-individual variability of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec) expression concluded that multiple host-mediated factors could contribute.47,48 Future endeavors to identify predictive biomarkers of response might lead to the development of approaches with optimized outcomes of AAV-based F8 gene therapies. A TAK-754-mediated dose response of FVIII activity was confirmed in a HepG2 cellular biopotency assay. Such an in vitro assay could allow replacement of the cumbersome in vivo lot release testing procedure, in line with the expectations and requirements of the authorities, which support the reduction and circumvention of animal experiments in the release of clinical batches, if applicable.49 Dose-dependent efficacy was observed in the tail tip bleeding assay in FVIII KO mice, and long-term expression could be demonstrated in a separate animal study using human FVIII transgenic mice, in which a single dose of 4 × 1012 CP/kg resulted in FVIII expression from week 2 until the end of the experiment (6 months), with no trend for a decline in FVIII activity. This mouse model, which was developed to mitigate the issue of anti-human FVIII antibody formation,28 served its purpose to monitor TAK-754-dependent long-term expression of human BDD-FVIII. While this model also allows comparative prediction of human immune responses elicited by human FVIII variants via repeated dosing of the respective recombinant proteins according to identical protein mass, this study setup could not be mirrored with a gene therapy vector. Due to the further absence of a gold standard vector regarding FVIII immunogenicity, we did not aim for conducting a comparative FVIII immunogenicity study with the TAK-754 vector. It is important to note that the model falls short in predicting the FVIII expression decline based on AAV vector immunogenicity, which is a phenomenon known to be largely absent from typical preclinical animal models. No toxicologically relevant effects related to TAK-754 were observed. Single bolus injections of TAK-754 administered to mice at doses of up to 5 × 1013 CP/kg occurred without deaths, adverse clinical signs, or post-dosing observations related to TAK-754. A limitation of the mouse safety study was its duration of 18 weeks, which precluded the detection of a potential relationship between FVIII expression and liver cancer/hyperplasia, which can occur at time points later than 1 year.50 The observed biodistribution of TAK-754 in treated FVIII KO mice confirmed the predominant detection of vector DNA in liver tissue, with minimal off-target gene expression in other tissues, consistent with the hepatic tropism of AAV8. Despite the known technical limitations of (nr)LAM-PCR, IS analyses further showed that vector integration was minimal (<0.01%). Within the 4-month observation period, there were also no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in or near genes previously implicated in HCC formation. While these data suggest that in humans TAK-754 will be maintained episomally and pose a low genotoxicity risk to patients, caution is needed since HCC-relevant loci are not well conserved between mice and humans,30 and the duration of the study was too short to observe any HCC concerns.Perspective The preclinical development program showed a good efficacy and safety profile for TAK-754 and formed the basis for defining the starting dose of 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg, factoring in the above-mentioned mouse-to-human correlation factor for AAV8. Despite these promising data, based on the gathered clinical experience with liver-directed AAV gene therapies over the last couple of years, it has turned out that vector immunogenicity in humans appears more critical than in rodents or NHPs.51 A successful translation of preclinical gene therapy programs into the clinic critically depends on the type and strength of the immune responses elicited against the very gene therapy vector in humans. In the case of TAK-754, while the safety profile was consistent with an AAV8-based gene therapy and all four enrolled patients in the clinical trial (this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03370172) showed dose-dependent peak FVIII activity 4 to 9 weeks after infusion (cohort 1: 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 3.8% and 11%, respectively; cohort 2: 6.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 54.7% and 69.4%, respectively), the initial vector-derived FVIII expression steadily declined despite the use of corticosteroids.52 The comprehensive analysis of immune components in the peripheral blood of the patients did not reveal the presence of inhibitory anti-FVIII antibodies or any obvious signs of an exaggerated immune response.53 It is worth mentioning in this context that NHPs as a nonrodent species were excluded from preclinical safety testing mainly because of technical challenges such as the naturally high AAV8 infection rate in monkey populations.54,55 Since an AAV vector-induced immune response leading to an abrupt or gradual loss in FVIII expression has not been observed in NHPs,56 such a study would also likely have failed to reveal an issue with the TAK-754 vector already in preclinical stage. A comparison with Valoctocogene roxaparvovec and other clinical-stage hemophilia AAV vectors (Table 1) suggests that rather subtle yet not fully understood differences in the vector design determine the success or failure of a therapy.13 Several AAV-based hemophilia A gene therapy clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov also counted on AAV8, whereas other programs use different capsids, including AAV5, AAV6, LK03, and AAVhu37, with potential differences in their tropism or transduction efficiency. Ranking these capsids in terms of performance in humans is, however, difficult since all these vectors differ also in expression cassette design and manufacturing process employed. Clinical head-to-head comparisons of vectors differing only in the capsid serotype are lacking and would be difficult to conduct for various reasons such as cross-reactivity of anti-AAV antibodies against a broad range of serotypes.

With regard to the expression cassettes, all vector products rely on liver-specific promoter/enhancer combinations, with SPK8011 even using the same mouse TTR promoter, albeit with a point mutation in the HNF3 binding site reported to moderately increase transcription.41 The SPK8011 cassette is unique in harboring a short synthetic intron, which is likely to further improve transgene expression. All but two (GO-8 and ASC618) transgenes were designed to express recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa,31 although different algorithms for codon optimization were likely used, which may substantially affect expression efficiency. No relevant differences in expression levels are expected from the poly(A) elements, all of which are short and synthetic in nature. From the publicly available data, it appears that not all codon-optimized BDD-F8 transgene cDNAs have been depleted for CpG motifs (Table 1). Whether the remaining 17 CpG motifs in TAK-754 caused a more pronounced vector-mediated immune response compared to that of SPK8011 (0 CpG) or Valoctocogene roxaparvovec (3 CpGs) is difficult to evaluate, but it seems unlikely as they are dispersed and do not form a CpG cluster.45 Both the design of the expression cassette as well as the clinical data available so far suggest that SPK8011 is the most efficient vector, enabling expression of BDD-FVIII at a dose that falls within the tolerated capsid immune response window. At the same time, however, it transpired over the last several years that FVIII expression should be kept at a moderate level so as to avoid an unfolded protein response in the transduced cells, leading to a decline in FVIII activity.13,57 Efforts to optimize AAV-based F8 gene therapy should therefore focus on bioengineered FVIII constructs with a lower propensity to misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum,58,59 accompanied by target tissue-specific analysis and development of improved preclinical immunogenicity models, which in turn will increase the field’s understanding of the key features that make up an effective gene therapy product for hemophilia A.Materials and methods AAV expression cassettes and vector production For candidate screening, codon-optimized cDNAs encoding the amino acid sequence identical to recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa-type BDD-FVIII31 were used to generate AAV expression cassettes that were composed of flanking AAV2-derived ITRs, a liver-specific TTR promoter/enhancer,60 the respective BDD-F8 transgene, and a synthetic polyadenylation site.61 Recombinant ssAAV8 vectors were produced in suspension HEK293 cells using a triple plasmid transfection protocol as described.62 Titers of AAV vectors were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or ELISA, reported in vg/mL or CP/mL, respectively.vg titer determination Vector genomes were quantified by qPCR targeting the AAV2 ITR sequence as described.63 Sample preparation prior to PCR included treatment of vector solutions with DNAseI, followed by a Proteinase K step to release the AAV genome from the capsid. A final restriction enzyme digest with SmaI was performed to resolve AAV ITR T-shape structures.AAV titer determination by ELISA The commercially available ELISA (Progen AAV8 titration ELISA kit) contains a monoclonal antibody (ADK8) specific for a conformational epitope on assembled AAV8 capsids. The AAV8 capsid concentration was determined photometrically using plate-immobilized biotinylated anti-AAV8 antibodies.Vector DNA integrity assay The integrity of the vg was analyzed by AAV agarose gel electrophoresis performed as described.64 Briefly, 1.5 × 1010 vg/lane were electrophoresed in agarose gels, which were then stained in 2× GelRed solution (Biotium) and imaged.SDS-PAGE and silver staining SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining was performed according to standard procedures. Each lane contained 1.0 × 1010 vg of the respective viral construct and was separated on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE Novex, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Silver staining was performed with a SilverQuest kit (Novex, Thermo Fisher Scientific).Animals All animal experiments were approved by the relevant authorities on animal experiments and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The experiments were performed with male mice only. Three different strains were used: hemostatically normal C57BL/6J mice (Charles River Laboratories) for the Good Laboratory Practice toxicity study according to International Conference on Harmonization S6, FVIII KO mice (B6; 129S4-F8tm2Kaz; E17 KO)65 for short-term biopotency and efficacy studies, where animals with an immune response against the human FVIII xenoprotein were excluded from further evaluation, and hFVIII transgenic mice28 for the long-term expression study. In the latter strain, the murine F8 gene is knocked out, but it also expresses human FVIII mRNA transcripts in multiple tissues from transgenic human F8 cDNA while lacking detectable circulating FVIII protein.Vector administration TAK-754 was administered with 0.01% human serum albumin to mice aged 8–11 weeks via manual injection into the lateral caudal vein (tail). A dose volume of 10 mL/kg was used, and individual dose volumes were based on the individual body weight. An infusion rate of approximately 2 mL/min was used.Blood sampling Immediately prior to blood collection, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane. We collected 250-μL blood samples via puncture of the retro-orbital plexus. At the end of the in-life phase, an additional and terminal cardiac blood sample (0.8 mL) was collected from anesthetized animals. All blood samples were collected directly in citrate anticoagulants and processed by centrifugation within 15 min.Detection of hF8 DNA or RNA in mouse organs Genomic DNA (gDNA) or total RNA was extracted from mouse livers using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) or the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), respectively, following the manufacturer’s protocol for animal tissues. gDNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA Broad-Range Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase (TURBO DNA-free Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). F8-transgene copy numbers in both gDNA and cDNA samples were determined by qPCR. The nucleotide sequences of the primers and probe used are the following: forward primer 5′-TCATGGACACCCTGCCT-3′; reverse primer 5′-GAGAAGTGGATGGAGTGAATGT-3′; probe 5′-6-FAM-ACCTGCTTTCTATGGGCTCCAATGAG-MGB-3′. PCR reactions were carried out on the QuantStudio 7 Flex PCR platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR data analysis was performed using the specific device’s software that automatically calculates the F8 copies per reaction based on the linear regression parameters of the standard curve. In vivo FVIII biopotency assay FVIII activity in plasma was determined using a commercial FVIII chromogenic assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (COATEST SP4 FVIII; catalog no. 82409463, Chromagenix). Results are given in IU FVIII/mL, derived from a reference curve generated with an in-house FVIII reference, calibrated against the World Health Organization standard.FVIII antigen assay Human FVIII antigen levels in mouse plasma were analyzed by commercial ELISA (Asserachrom VIII:Ag Kit; Diagnostica Stago) per the manufacturer’s manual.Tail tip bleeding assay The efficacy of TAK-754 was determined by measuring the total blood loss in mice,66 whereby animals were anesthetized (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, intraperitoneally) and 2 mm of the tail tip was cut off. Blood was collected over an observation period of 60 min; blood loss was measured gravimetrically. In vitro biopotency assay TAK-754 biopotency was assessed in vitro using the human hepatic cell line HepG2.46 After treatment of cells with 2 mM hydroxyurea for 22 h, the cells were infected with AAV8-FVIII vectors in F17 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10 μg/mL von Willebrand factor (Baxalta) and 5 μM 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-Amiloride (Sigma). During incubation (96 h), FVIII was expressed and released into the cell supernatant. FVIII activity was determined by chromogenic endpoint measurement, as described for the in vivo FVIII biopotency assay. A reference curve of AAV8-FVIII vector material was based on AAV8-ELISA titer.Neutralizing BDD-FVIII antibody assay The analysis was based on the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.67 Briefly, the test sample was mixed with a test base (containing BDD-rFVIII), and the loss in FVIII activity upon incubation was measured. The relative loss in activity is correlated to the inhibitor concentration in the sample; results are reported in Bethesda units per milliliter.Safety evaluation and biodistribution study in hemostatically normal mice Assessment of toxicity was based on clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, and clinical and anatomic pathology evaluations. Complete necropsies were performed on five animals from each cohort, with macroscopic abnormalities for all tissues, organ weights, and microscopic examinations recorded. Tissues were collected for biodistribution assessment from a further five animals from each cohort. Blood was collected pre-dose and at necropsy (n = 5) for FVIII activity, FVIII Ag, binding anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, neutralizing anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, and binding anti-AAV8 antibodies.Vector IS analysis We used 25 mg of AAV-treated liver tissues for fully automated DNA isolation using Qiagen spin columns on the QIAcube robotic system. Vector copy numbers were determined by vector-specific qPCR. ISs were analyzed using (nr) and standard LAM-PCR,68 which identifies genomic sequences flanking the integrated AAV vector DNA. (nr)LAM-PCR amplicons were sequenced after sample preparation on a MiSeq instrument. Data were processed by (semi-) automated bioinformatics data mining.Statistical methods Graphs and statistical analyses were created with GraphPad Prism 6 software. Student’s t test, one-way or two-way ANOVA, followed by Holm-Sidak post hoc test was used for the statistical analysis as appropriate. Values are presented as the mean ± SEM, and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.Data availability All data are included in the paper or the supplemental information.

    "abstract": "Abstract This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK-754, an AAV8-based human factor VIII (FVIII) vector designed to deliver a codon-optimized and CpG-depleted B domain-deleted F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific promoter for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A. A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 × 1012 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK-754 (3.1 × 1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 × 1012 and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK-754.

    "introduction": "Introduction Hemophilia A is a monogenic X chromosome-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene encoding blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), leading to the loss of functional FVIII protein.1,2,3 This lifelong disorder requires treatment with replacement factor concentrates to maintain FVIII levels to control and prevent bleeding episodes.1,4 Patients with severe disease can experience recurrent joint and muscle bleeding and may receive regular FVIII infusions to prevent the debilitating effects of arthropathy and to reduce their risk of life-threatening bleeds.4,5 Another more recent treatment option is the bispecific antibody emicizumab, which mimics FVIII function by binding FIXa and FX to promote hemostasis.6 Monogenic diseases are promising indications for potentially curative gene therapeutic approaches,7 and in particular, hemophilia A has become a showcase indication for exploring and refining in vivo gene therapy principles.8 This is due to the fact that the expression of FVIII from the introduced functional copy of the F8 transgene into a patient’s liver cells can be readily measured in plasma, and relatively low levels of FVIII are already sufficient to alleviate a severe disease phenotype. For adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, this needs to be accomplished by a truncated, B domain-deleted (BDD) variant of FVIII (BDD-FVIII) because of the restricted packaging capacity of AAV, which is 5 kb at the most, excluding the flanking inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions. Nonetheless, ample preclinical experience has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, which also leads to improvements in vector design.9,10,11,12 Several investigational hemophilia A gene therapy products built on this concept are being tested clinically,13 and the most advanced program has already received marketing authorization (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec), employing an AAV5 vector designed to express a human BDD-FVIII variant called FVIII-SQ.14,15 Three years of follow-up data demonstrated a sustained, clinically relevant benefit at doses of 4 × 1013 and 6 × 1013 vg (vector genomes)/kg, but also identified a decline in FVIII expression levels over time, suggesting that this therapy will not be lifelong.15 Other observations difficult to explain to date are the variability in expression between individuals at a given dose and between participants in phase 1/2 and phase 3.15 These observations have not been made in conceptually similar clinical hemophilia B gene therapy trials and appear to be associated with the nature of the transgene product, as synthesis of FVIII at high levels in hepatocytes is constrained and prone to trigger an unfolded protein response that could lead to cellular stress.16 Past and present hemophilia trials further revealed that vector immunogenicity can negatively affect the durability of transgene expression,17,18,19 reflected in a drop or even loss of activity within the first couple of months after treatment that is often accompanied by a transient rise in liver enzymes. While ultimately a cytotoxic T cell response against the capsid protein contributes to this phenomenon, other host immune responses elicited by the inherent immunogenic features of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are likely to be involved.20,21 The presence of (an excess of) unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) motifs in the vg is particularly important in that respect as CpG clusters, which are typically present only in microbials, act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in humans and can trigger an innate immune response. The removal of such CpG clusters from vg is therefore thought to be a key measure for dampening innate immune signals that eventually lead to deleterious adaptive immune responses.22 Here, we describe preclinical development of the recombinant single-stranded (ss) gene therapy vector TAK-754 (formerly BAX 888 and SHP654; Baxalta US, Lexington, MA) designed for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A. The vector was built on the AAV8 capsid with a preferential liver tropism and engineered to deliver a human codon-optimized and CpG-depleted BDD-F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific transthyretin (TTR) promoter. This paper details the identification of the lead candidate vector ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII and reports on preclinical studies aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of the TAK-754 human gene therapy vector in mice.",

    "results": "Results Lead candidate screening of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt Expression levels of endogenous wild-type (WT) FVIII levels are relatively low,23 and the corresponding coding region exceeds the natural packaging limit for AAV. We addressed this by cloning codon-optimized BDD-F8 open reading frames in an AAV expression cassette designed for high expression levels in human hepatocytes (Figure 1A). A total of 41 codon-optimized ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (sequences 01–41) were produced and screened for potency in FVIII knockout (KO) mice. FVIII KO mice closely reflect the severe hemophilia A phenotype in patients and therefore represent a suitable animal model. Expression was compared to animals receiving the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIwt control vector (sequence wt) harboring the WT F8 nucleotide sequence. The best candidate of this in vivo biopotency screen was sequence (seq) 04, with 79.8% nucleotide sequence identity to the corresponding coding sequences in WT F8 (GenBank: M14113) and 74-fold improved efficacy (Figure 1B). The guanine-cytosine (GC) content of seq04 was 56%, which is substantially higher than that of the WT sequence (44%) and matches the native AAV8 capsid protein coding sequence (Figure S1; Table S1). Moreover, CpG motifs in seq04 were low in number and dispersed over the length of the transgene (Figure S2). This feature should help minimize the immunogenicity risk, as high densities of these DNA motifs can increase immunogenicity by stimulating the innate immune system via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 in the liver.24 Despite a vector size of approximately 5.2 kb, the recombinant genome appears as a single homogeneous band following DNA gel analysis (Figure 1C), confirming correct packaging of the slightly oversized genome of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 (relative to an AAV WT genome of 4.7 kb). The same held true for the other AAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (data not shown). Overall capsid integrity and purity of the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 preparation was confirmed following SDS PAGE-based size separation and detection of VP1, VP2, and VP3 by silver staining (Figure 1D). Initial yields for the seq04 vector per liter cell culture were about 6-fold higher than for the otherwise identical F8 WT nucleotide sequence vector,25 indicating that vector production using the F8 lead candidate sequence was actually more efficient, probably due to its GC content matching the GC content of the AAV8 virus (Figure S1).

(B) FVIII activity in plasma of FVIII KO mice (n = 8) at 2 weeks following i.v. delivery of 8.0 × 1012 vg/kg AAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors harboring different codon-optimized BDD-F8 open reading frames. The nucleotide sequence with the best performance (seq04) is indicated by a black arrowhead and that of the WT control by a gray arrowhead. Data shown represent the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). (C) Agarose gel analysis of the DNA payload of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq4. Note the single band with the expected size of 5.2 kb. (D) SDS-PAGE of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq4. The capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 appear as main proteins in the silver-stained gel.These favorable features provided the rationale to select ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 as the lead candidate for the development of a hemophilia A gene therapy vector. Biopotency and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 In anticipation of clinical trials of TAK-754 gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, we optimized our vector titration approach, which was previously based on a qualified qPCR of vg with a coefficient of variation (CV) higher than 25% (data not shown). We therefore considered changing the genomic titering regime toward assaying AAV capsid particle (CP) numbers by ELISA, as the latter assay reproducibly showed a CV of <10%. The robust performance of the CP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), together with a consistent full to empty capsid ratio of the vector batches produced,26 provided the rationale to assign the vector strength for subsequent preclinical development of TAK-754, as well as for clinical dosing in a phase 1/2 study. The FVIII activity dose response and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 was examined in FVIII KO mice following vector delivery at doses of 3.0 × 1011, 1.2 × 1012, or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg. A preliminary safety assessment was included as a secondary endpoint. Animals that tested positive for anti-FVIII antibodies were excluded from statistical analysis of biopotency and efficacy. No treatment-related findings were observed microscopically in the heart, kidney, liver, or spleen, including micro- or macrovascular thrombosis or inflammatory infiltrate. Animals that received 1.2 × 1012 or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg showed a dose-dependent increase in mean plasma FVIII activity from 0.6 to 1.9 IU/mL over the investigation period (Figure 2A). FVIII activity was undetectable in animals treated with buffer or the lowest dose of 3.0 × 1011 CP/kg. Dose-dependent activity of TAK-754 was confirmed in the human hepatic HepG2 cell line (Figure S3). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Potency and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 (A) In vivo biopotency determination. FVIII KO mice (n = 12) were injected with 3.0 × 1011, 1.2 × 1012, and 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector and analyzed for plasma FVIII activity at four time points, including 14, 28, 42, and 56 days. FVIII activity levels were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in controls and the low-dose group but showed a dose-dependent increase in the mid- and high-dose groups. Data are shown in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line. (B) Hemostatic efficacy testing. The same animals as under (A) were subjected to a tail tip bleeding assay on day 63. A dose-dependent reduction of blood loss was observed for the higher doses. Note that only animals testing negative for anti-FVIII antibodies on day 56 were tested. The median is indicated by a horizontal line. (C) Transduction efficiency. F8 transgene copy numbers in gDNA (dark bars) and in cDNA (light bars) were quantified in TAK-754-treated animals and controls (n = 2) on day 63, confirming dose-dependent liver transduction. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).A tail-tip bleeding assay was used to assess the bleeding phenotype. Animals treated with buffer and TAK-754 at the lowest dose showed similar median blood loss normalized for body weights of 6.1 and 7.5 mg/g, respectively, corresponding to the undetectable FVIII activity in these animals (Figure 2B). The higher doses (1.2 × 1012 or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg) of TAK-754 significantly reduced median blood loss to 0.6 and 0.4 mg/g, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001 compared to buffer). Statistical assessment of dose proportionality was precluded by the lack of FVIII activity at the low dose. At the end of the experiment, livers of animals with activities around the mean FVIII activity were selected from each group for quantification of vg and F8 RNA expression. The vg levels in the control group or the low-dose TAK-754 group were under the detection limit of the applied method. Mid- and high-dose animals showed robust and dose-dependent transduction as a function of vg in the liver (Figure 2C). F8 RNA levels were consistent with F8 DNA levels, except for two low-dose animals showing a measurable F8 transcript signal (i.e., within the limit of detection). The 2.5-fold dose increase from 1.2 × 1012 to 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in F8 gDNA levels and a 3.1-fold increase in F8 RNA levels (Figure 2C), which broadly mirrored the 3.2-fold increase in FVIII activity levels (Figure 2A). TAK-754-mediated long-term expression of FVIII The development of an antibody response directed against the human FVIII xenoprotein capable of neutralizing FVIII activity is a well-known phenomenon in mice.27 To enable a long-term expression study following the delivery of TAK-754, we employed a transgenic mouse model (huFVIII tg mice) that lacks detectable FVIII protein but usually shows immunological tolerance toward the human coagulation factor.28 huFVIII tg mice were injected with a TAK-754 dose of 3.1 × 1012 CP/kg and were monitored for FVIII activity and anti-drug antibodies from 2 to 24 weeks. The mean FVIII plasma activity ranged between 2.9 and 3.8 IU/mL throughout the observation period (Figure 3A). Three of 30 animals tested positive for anti-BDD-FVIII immunoglobulin-binding antibodies. In one of these three animals, the antibody response appeared to be transient, as it tested negative in week 24. One of the two persistent binding antibodies-positive animals also tested positive for FVIII inhibitory antibodies (data not shown). No treatment-related clinical symptoms or deaths were recorded. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Sustained FVIII expression following a single injection of TAK-754 (A) Long-term FVIII expression in a transgenic human FVIII mouse model. Following delivery of 3.1 × 1012 CP/kg of TAK-754 to huFVIII tg mice (n = 30), activity levels were stable between 2 and 24 weeks. Data are presented in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line and the mean represented by a cross. (B) Vector biodistribution. Wild-type C57Bl/6J mice were treated with a TAK-754 dose of 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg, and vector biodistribution was determined at three time points, including 3 days, 3 weeks, and 18 weeks (n = 20). Data are given in mean ± SEM; values <LLOQ were included as zero. Nonclinical safety evaluation and biodistribution study in hemostatically normal mice The toxicity of gene therapy candidate TAK-754 was examined in cohorts of male C57BL/6J mice receiving a single dose of TAK-754 at 2.0 × 1012, 3.8 × 1012, and 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg, and also at higher dose levels up to 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg (1.0 × 1013, 3.0 × 1013, and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg). The dose levels were selected based on the TAK-754 activity data shown in Figure 2A. The design of the toxicity study entailed subjecting cohorts of animals to a panel of analyses that included complete necropsies, pathological evaluation, biodistribution of vg, FVIII activity, FVIII antigen, binding anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, neutralizing anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, and binding anti-AAV8 antibodies at day 3, week 3, and week 18. During the study, there were no deaths and no adverse effects attributed to TAK-754 during the in-life phase, pathology, post-dosing observations, or any adverse TAK-754-related changes in clinical chemistry parameters, hematology, and coagulation parameters or urinalysis. The distribution of TAK-754 DNA was highest in the liver at all dose levels tested. TAK-754 distribution in liver and other tissues was dose related and was generally highest at the earliest time point, decreasing by day 21 (Figure 3B). However, TAK-754 DNA levels were still highest in liver tissues at this time point. Further decrease by day 126 is already diminished in the liver and skeletal muscle and not observed in lymph node and heart any longer. TAK-754 DNA levels in brain and testes samples harvested from TAK-754-treated animals were evaluated as negative or below the lower limit of assay quantification by week 18 in all animals. Representative data are shown from the 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg dose group (Figure 3B). Animals treated with TAK-754 had measurable amounts of human FVIII antigen in plasma from week 3, with levels in some mice already present from day 3. The observed decrease in FVIII antigen concentrations in individual animals was most likely a result of the formation of circulating anti-human BDD-FVIII binding antibodies, which can compete with the species-specific assay, resulting in nondetectable FVIII antigen. Such binding antibodies indeed formed over time and increased with dose, which is in line with a pharmacokinetic analysis where FVIII immunogenicity increased with initial high-level AAV-FVIII protein expression.29 TAK-754-treated animals also showed higher FVIII activity levels compared with the pre-treatment period, indicating that BDD-FVIII was expressed in these mice. However, some animals had even lower-than-normal FVIII levels most likely caused by the generation of neutralizing anti-human-BDD-FVIII antibodies that inhibited both human BDD-FVIII activity and endogenous mouse FVIII activity by virtue of the antibodies’ partial cross-reactivity against mouse FVIII. Neutralizing antibodies against BDD-FVIII became measurable by week 18 in all dose groups. As expected, all treated animals tested strongly positive for anti-AAV8 binding antibodies from week 3. In summary, toxicology experiments in mice receiving single intravenous (i.v.) TAK-754 injections at doses up to 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg found no evidence of TAK-754-related adverse effects during the in-life phase and no toxicologically relevant observations. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was 5.0 × 1013 cp/kg, the highest dose tested. Integration site analysis While host cell maintenance of rAAV vectors is largely accomplished through episomal DNA, residual chromosomal integration does occur. We therefore performed an integration site (IS) analysis of the TAK-754 vector in FVIII KO mice. Mice were treated with either 2.0 × 1012 or 1.0 × 1013 CP/kg TAK-754 and observed for 1 or 4 months (Figure 4). Liver transduction levels, determined by F8 qPCR, were dose dependent and comparable at both time points (Figure S4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Vector integration site analysis Cumulative retrieval frequencies of top 10 cell clones in the livers of mice following injection of TAK-754 at (A) 2.0 × 1012 or (B) 1.0 × 1013 CP/kg. Samples with ID 1–4 and 10–13 were analyzed 1 month after treatment, those with ID 5–9 and 14–18 four months after treatment.Illumina sequencing of nonrestrictive (nr)linear amplification-mediated (LAM)-PCR products showed comparable numbers of average sequencing reads for both time points after vector administration (Table S2). A total of 227 unique exactly mappable ISs were detected in animals in both groups at 1 month after gene therapy treatment (5–54 unique ISs/mouse). Four months after treatment, 187 unique exactly mappable ISs were retrieved from both groups (5–42 unique ISs/mice), confirming an integration frequency of ≤0.01% (Table S2). The detection of identical top 10 ranking ISs in repetitive (nr)LAM-PCR amplicons was very low: one IS 1 month after treatment and 3 ISs detected in 2/6 (nr)LAM-PCRs after 4 months (Figure 4). This indicates that the unequal IS frequency profiles are due to the low number of events retrieved and that there are no signs for clonal skewing or clonal dominance in the treated animals. Only low-order (≤4) common ISs could be identified at both time points, which is in line with the low number of ISs detected after administration of TAK-754, correlating with an untargeted integration profile. None of the ISs were found in or next to genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation.30 In summary, the integration profile of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mouse liver showed a low but measurable level of integration, with no signs of potential side effects, and, at least within the 4-month observation period, no evidence for clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in oncogenes (i.e., HCC) was noted.",
    "discussion": "Discussion Here, we describe preclinical development of TAK-754, an efficient human AAV vector for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, designed to express a human BDD-FVIII protein with an identical amino acid sequence to that of recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa.31 While the vector was designed and developed at a time before first clinical readouts from hemophilia A gene therapy trials became available, it does bear a couple of features that should allow efficient expression of the human F8 transgene in humans. TAK-754 vector design Choice of the AAV8 capsid was based on its preferential tropism for the liver as it demonstrates excellent transduction efficiency of hepatocytes in preclinical models32 and a number of liver-directed clinical gene therapy trials such as those for the treatment of hemophilia A and B or glycogen storage disease type 1A build on this capsid serotype.33 Numerous comparative studies over the last couple of years consolidated our comprehension of a species-dependent performance of vector capsids.34 It is now clear that AAV8 is particularly efficient in rodents; in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans, the capsid also preferentially targets hepatocytes but with an approximately 20-fold lower efficiency.35 This correlation factor needs to be considered when it comes to the deduction of a clinical starting dose from the nonclinical data package. Accordingly, a starting dose of 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector was selected for the first cohort, taking into account that a dose of 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg in FVIII KO mice resulted in a mean plasma FVIII activity of 1.9 IU/mL, translating into a projected clinical FVIII activity of ∼6% of normal. It is worth noting that the packaging capacity of recombinant AAV8 vectors can be pushed beyond the size of the WT genome of 4.7 kb.36 Consistently, we found that TAK-754’s vg was the correct size and intact, as judged by the absence of degradation bands. Packaging of similarly oversized BDD-FVIII expression cassettes using AAV537 and AAVrh838 led to aberrant, truncated genomes that first had to be re-assembled in transduced cells through recombination before functional FVIII could have been produced. The use of the strong yet compact mouse TTR promoter/enhancer combination enabled robust liver-specific gene expression. This promoter was selected from a variety of liver-specific promoters during preclinical development of the hemophilia B vector BAX33539 and came off well in a head-to-head comparison with other commonly used liver-specific promoters.40 The risk of relying on nonconserved murine transcription factor binding sites for a human gene therapy was mitigated by our demonstration of robust BDD-FVIII expression in the human liver HepG2 cell line upon transduction with TAK-754. Activity of the mouse TTR promoter/enhancer was also confirmed in the clinical trials for BAX33518 and SPK-8011,41 although in the latter case, a point-mutated promoter variant was used that has converted a weak hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) binding site into a moderately stronger one. Codon optimization of the BDD-F8 transgene initially relied on available codon-optimization algorithms. This approach resulted in sequences with improved expression but also greater GC content, in line with the understanding that this leads to higher mRNA levels and greater protein translation than gene sequences having greater AT content.42 However, this inadvertently introduced CpG clusters into the vector sequence, which function as PAMPs. These sequences can stimulate innate immune responses through signaling via TLRs, leading to an exaggerated adaptive immune response.22,43,44 TAK-754 candidate screening thus included a further filtering step that removed codon-optimized F8 sequences harboring potentially detrimental predicted CpG clusters.45 The lead candidate F8 nucleotide sequence (seq04) gave rise to a 74-fold increased expression in FVIII-KO mice compared to the corresponding WT sequence yet contains only 17 dispersed CpG motifs (Figures S2A and S2B). A further depletion of CpG motifs within the entire expression cassette, which may likewise be important for durable transgene expression,13 has not been carried out (Figure S2B). Preclinical evaluation of TAK-754 Overall, the vector showed a good efficacy and safety profile. Dose-dependent increases in mean plasma FVIII activity were obtained after single i.v. injections of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mice. The observed variability of FVIII expression (Figure 2A) appears to be a transgene-specific phenomenon. While FIX expression is associated with a low inter-species variability,46 that of BDD-FVIII is consistently higher and observed in mice and humans. Reports investigating the underlying mechanisms of inter-individual variability of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec) expression concluded that multiple host-mediated factors could contribute.47,48 Future endeavors to identify predictive biomarkers of response might lead to the development of approaches with optimized outcomes of AAV-based F8 gene therapies. A TAK-754-mediated dose response of FVIII activity was confirmed in a HepG2 cellular biopotency assay. Such an in vitro assay could allow replacement of the cumbersome in vivo lot release testing procedure, in line with the expectations and requirements of the authorities, which support the reduction and circumvention of animal experiments in the release of clinical batches, if applicable.49 Dose-dependent efficacy was observed in the tail tip bleeding assay in FVIII KO mice, and long-term expression could be demonstrated in a separate animal study using human FVIII transgenic mice, in which a single dose of 4 × 1012 CP/kg resulted in FVIII expression from week 2 until the end of the experiment (6 months), with no trend for a decline in FVIII activity. This mouse model, which was developed to mitigate the issue of anti-human FVIII antibody formation,28 served its purpose to monitor TAK-754-dependent long-term expression of human BDD-FVIII. While this model also allows comparative prediction of human immune responses elicited by human FVIII variants via repeated dosing of the respective recombinant proteins according to identical protein mass, this study setup could not be mirrored with a gene therapy vector. Due to the further absence of a gold standard vector regarding FVIII immunogenicity, we did not aim for conducting a comparative FVIII immunogenicity study with the TAK-754 vector. It is important to note that the model falls short in predicting the FVIII expression decline based on AAV vector immunogenicity, which is a phenomenon known to be largely absent from typical preclinical animal models. No toxicologically relevant effects related to TAK-754 were observed. Single bolus injections of TAK-754 administered to mice at doses of up to 5 × 1013 CP/kg occurred without deaths, adverse clinical signs, or post-dosing observations related to TAK-754. A limitation of the mouse safety study was its duration of 18 weeks, which precluded the detection of a potential relationship between FVIII expression and liver cancer/hyperplasia, which can occur at time points later than 1 year.50 The observed biodistribution of TAK-754 in treated FVIII KO mice confirmed the predominant detection of vector DNA in liver tissue, with minimal off-target gene expression in other tissues, consistent with the hepatic tropism of AAV8. Despite the known technical limitations of (nr)LAM-PCR, IS analyses further showed that vector integration was minimal (<0.01%). Within the 4-month observation period, there were also no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in or near genes previously implicated in HCC formation. While these data suggest that in humans TAK-754 will be maintained episomally and pose a low genotoxicity risk to patients, caution is needed since HCC-relevant loci are not well conserved between mice and humans,30 and the duration of the study was too short to observe any HCC concerns. Perspective The preclinical development program showed a good efficacy and safety profile for TAK-754 and formed the basis for defining the starting dose of 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg, factoring in the above-mentioned mouse-to-human correlation factor for AAV8. Despite these promising data, based on the gathered clinical experience with liver-directed AAV gene therapies over the last couple of years, it has turned out that vector immunogenicity in humans appears more critical than in rodents or NHPs.51 A successful translation of preclinical gene therapy programs into the clinic critically depends on the type and strength of the immune responses elicited against the very gene therapy vector in humans. In the case of TAK-754, while the safety profile was consistent with an AAV8-based gene therapy and all four enrolled patients in the clinical trial (this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03370172) showed dose-dependent peak FVIII activity 4 to 9 weeks after infusion (cohort 1: 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 3.8% and 11%, respectively; cohort 2: 6.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 54.7% and 69.4%, respectively), the initial vector-derived FVIII expression steadily declined despite the use of corticosteroids.52 The comprehensive analysis of immune components in the peripheral blood of the patients did not reveal the presence of inhibitory anti-FVIII antibodies or any obvious signs of an exaggerated immune response.53 It is worth mentioning in this context that NHPs as a nonrodent species were excluded from preclinical safety testing mainly because of technical challenges such as the naturally high AAV8 infection rate in monkey populations.54,55 Since an AAV vector-induced immune response leading to an abrupt or gradual loss in FVIII expression has not been observed in NHPs,56 such a study would also likely have failed to reveal an issue with the TAK-754 vector already in preclinical stage. A comparison with Valoctocogene roxaparvovec and other clinical-stage hemophilia AAV vectors (Table 1) suggests that rather subtle yet not fully understood differences in the vector design determine the success or failure of a therapy.13 Several AAV-based hemophilia A gene therapy clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov also counted on AAV8, whereas other programs use different capsids, including AAV5, AAV6, LK03, and AAVhu37, with potential differences in their tropism or transduction efficiency. Ranking these capsids in terms of performance in humans is, however, difficult since all these vectors differ also in expression cassette design and manufacturing process employed. Clinical head-to-head comparisons of vectors differing only in the capsid serotype are lacking and would be difficult to conduct for various reasons such as cross-reactivity of anti-AAV antibodies against a broad range of serotypes.

With regard to the expression cassettes, all vector products rely on liver-specific promoter/enhancer combinations, with SPK8011 even using the same mouse TTR promoter, albeit with a point mutation in the HNF3 binding site reported to moderately increase transcription.41 The SPK8011 cassette is unique in harboring a short synthetic intron, which is likely to further improve transgene expression. All but two (GO-8 and ASC618) transgenes were designed to express recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa,31 although different algorithms for codon optimization were likely used, which may substantially affect expression efficiency. No relevant differences in expression levels are expected from the poly(A) elements, all of which are short and synthetic in nature. From the publicly available data, it appears that not all codon-optimized BDD-F8 transgene cDNAs have been depleted for CpG motifs (Table 1). Whether the remaining 17 CpG motifs in TAK-754 caused a more pronounced vector-mediated immune response compared to that of SPK8011 (0 CpG) or Valoctocogene roxaparvovec (3 CpGs) is difficult to evaluate, but it seems unlikely as they are dispersed and do not form a CpG cluster.45 Both the design of the expression cassette as well as the clinical data available so far suggest that SPK8011 is the most efficient vector, enabling expression of BDD-FVIII at a dose that falls within the tolerated capsid immune response window. At the same time, however, it transpired over the last several years that FVIII expression should be kept at a moderate level so as to avoid an unfolded protein response in the transduced cells, leading to a decline in FVIII activity.13,57 Efforts to optimize AAV-based F8 gene therapy should therefore focus on bioengineered FVIII constructs with a lower propensity to misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum,58,59 accompanied by target tissue-specific analysis and development of improved preclinical immunogenicity models, which in turn will increase the field’s understanding of the key features that make up an effective gene therapy product for hemophilia A.",

Copyright notice ID: 11929063 PMID: 40123744 Abstract This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK-754, an AAV8-based human factor VIII (FVIII) vector designed to deliver a codon-optimized and CpG-depleted B domain-deleted F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific promoter for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A. A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 × 1012 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK-754 (3.1 × 1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 × 1012 and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK-754. Keywords: hemophilia A, gene therapy, adeno-associated virus, AAV, FVIII, biodistribution, safety, vector integration, vector immunogenicityGraphical abstract Open in a new tab Lengler and colleagues report promising preclinical efficacy and safety of the TAK-754 hemophilia A gene therapy vector. Its vector design is compared with other clinical-stage AAV vectors to identify features that contribute to durable FVIII expression, thereby enabling the success of hemophilia A gene therapy.Introduction Hemophilia A is a monogenic X chromosome-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene encoding blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), leading to the loss of functional FVIII protein.1,2,3 This lifelong disorder requires treatment with replacement factor concentrates to maintain FVIII levels to control and prevent bleeding episodes.1,4 Patients with severe disease can experience recurrent joint and muscle bleeding and may receive regular FVIII infusions to prevent the debilitating effects of arthropathy and to reduce their risk of life-threatening bleeds.4,5 Another more recent treatment option is the bispecific antibody emicizumab, which mimics FVIII function by binding FIXa and FX to promote hemostasis.6 Monogenic diseases are promising indications for potentially curative gene therapeutic approaches,7 and in particular, hemophilia A has become a showcase indication for exploring and refining in vivo gene therapy principles.8 This is due to the fact that the expression of FVIII from the introduced functional copy of the F8 transgene into a patient’s liver cells can be readily measured in plasma, and relatively low levels of FVIII are already sufficient to alleviate a severe disease phenotype. For adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, this needs to be accomplished by a truncated, B domain-deleted (BDD) variant of FVIII (BDD-FVIII) because of the restricted packaging capacity of AAV, which is 5 kb at the most, excluding the flanking inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions. Nonetheless, ample preclinical experience has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, which also leads to improvements in vector design.9,10,11,12 Several investigational hemophilia A gene therapy products built on this concept are being tested clinically,13 and the most advanced program has already received marketing authorization (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec), employing an AAV5 vector designed to express a human BDD-FVIII variant called FVIII-SQ.14,15 Three years of follow-up data demonstrated a sustained, clinically relevant benefit at doses of 4 × 1013 and 6 × 1013 vg (vector genomes)/kg, but also identified a decline in FVIII expression levels over time, suggesting that this therapy will not be lifelong.15 Other observations difficult to explain to date are the variability in expression between individuals at a given dose and between participants in phase 1/2 and phase 3.15 These observations have not been made in conceptually similar clinical hemophilia B gene therapy trials and appear to be associated with the nature of the transgene product, as synthesis of FVIII at high levels in hepatocytes is constrained and prone to trigger an unfolded protein response that could lead to cellular stress.16 Past and present hemophilia trials further revealed that vector immunogenicity can negatively affect the durability of transgene expression,17,18,19 reflected in a drop or even loss of activity within the first couple of months after treatment that is often accompanied by a transient rise in liver enzymes. While ultimately a cytotoxic T cell response against the capsid protein contributes to this phenomenon, other host immune responses elicited by the inherent immunogenic features of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are likely to be involved.20,21 The presence of (an excess of) unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) motifs in the vg is particularly important in that respect as CpG clusters, which are typically present only in microbials, act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in humans and can trigger an innate immune response. The removal of such CpG clusters from vg is therefore thought to be a key measure for dampening innate immune signals that eventually lead to deleterious adaptive immune responses.22 Here, we describe preclinical development of the recombinant single-stranded (ss) gene therapy vector TAK-754 (formerly BAX 888 and SHP654; Baxalta US, Lexington, MA) designed for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A. The vector was built on the AAV8 capsid with a preferential liver tropism and engineered to deliver a human codon-optimized and CpG-depleted BDD-F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific transthyretin (TTR) promoter. This paper details the identification of the lead candidate vector ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII and reports on preclinical studies aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of the TAK-754 human gene therapy vector in mice.Results Lead candidate screening of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt Expression levels of endogenous wild-type (WT) FVIII levels are relatively low,23 and the corresponding coding region exceeds the natural packaging limit for AAV. We addressed this by cloning codon-optimized BDD-F8 open reading frames in an AAV expression cassette designed for high expression levels in human hepatocytes (Figure 1A). A total of 41 codon-optimized ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (sequences 01–41) were produced and screened for potency in FVIII knockout (KO) mice. FVIII KO mice closely reflect the severe hemophilia A phenotype in patients and therefore represent a suitable animal model. Expression was compared to animals receiving the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIwt control vector (sequence wt) harboring the WT F8 nucleotide sequence. The best candidate of this in vivo biopotency screen was sequence (seq) 04, with 79.8% nucleotide sequence identity to the corresponding coding sequences in WT F8 (GenBank: M14113) and 74-fold improved efficacy (Figure 1B). The guanine-cytosine (GC) content of seq04 was 56%, which is substantially higher than that of the WT sequence (44%) and matches the native AAV8 capsid protein coding sequence (Figure S1; Table S1). Moreover, CpG motifs in seq04 were low in number and dispersed over the length of the transgene (Figure S2). This feature should help minimize the immunogenicity risk, as high densities of these DNA motifs can increase immunogenicity by stimulating the innate immune system via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 in the liver.24 Despite a vector size of approximately 5.2 kb, the recombinant genome appears as a single homogeneous band following DNA gel analysis (Figure 1C), confirming correct packaging of the slightly oversized genome of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 (relative to an AAV WT genome of 4.7 kb). The same held true for the other AAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (data not shown). Overall capsid integrity and purity of the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 preparation was confirmed following SDS PAGE-based size separation and detection of VP1, VP2, and VP3 by silver staining (Figure 1D). Initial yields for the seq04 vector per liter cell culture were about 6-fold higher than for the otherwise identical F8 WT nucleotide sequence vector,25 indicating that vector production using the F8 lead candidate sequence was actually more efficient, probably due to its GC content matching the GC content of the AAV8 virus (Figure S1).

The capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 appear as main proteins in the silver-stained gel.These favorable features provided the rationale to select ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 as the lead candidate for the development of a hemophilia A gene therapy vector.Biopotency and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 In anticipation of clinical trials of TAK-754 gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, we optimized our vector titration approach, which was previously based on a qualified qPCR of vg with a coefficient of variation (CV) higher than 25% (data not shown). We therefore considered changing the genomic titering regime toward assaying AAV capsid particle (CP) numbers by ELISA, as the latter assay reproducibly showed a CV of <10%. The robust performance of the CP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), together with a consistent full to empty capsid ratio of the vector batches produced,26 provided the rationale to assign the vector strength for subsequent preclinical development of TAK-754, as well as for clinical dosing in a phase 1/2 study. The FVIII activity dose response and hemostatic efficacy of TAK-754 was examined in FVIII KO mice following vector delivery at doses of 3.0 × 1011, 1.2 × 1012, or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg. A preliminary safety assessment was included as a secondary endpoint. Animals that tested positive for anti-FVIII antibodies were excluded from statistical analysis of biopotency and efficacy. No treatment-related findings were observed microscopically in the heart, kidney, liver, or spleen, including micro- or macrovascular thrombosis or inflammatory infiltrate. Animals that received 1.2 × 1012 or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg showed a dose-dependent increase in mean plasma FVIII activity from 0.6 to 1.9 IU/mL over the investigation period (Figure 2A). FVIII activity was undetectable in animals treated with buffer or the lowest dose of 3.0 × 1011 CP/kg. Dose-dependent activity of TAK-754 was confirmed in the human hepatic HepG2 cell line (Figure S3). Figure 2.

FVIII KO mice (n = 12) were injected with 3.0 × 1011, 1.2 × 1012, and 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector and analyzed for plasma FVIII activity at four time points, including 14, 28, 42, and 56 days. FVIII activity levels were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) in controls and the low-dose group but showed a dose-dependent increase in the mid- and high-dose groups. Data are shown in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line. (B) Hemostatic efficacy testing. The same animals as under (A) were subjected to a tail tip bleeding assay on day 63. A dose-dependent reduction of blood loss was observed for the higher doses. Note that only animals testing negative for anti-FVIII antibodies on day 56 were tested. The median is indicated by a horizontal line. (C) Transduction efficiency. F8 transgene copy numbers in gDNA (dark bars) and in cDNA (light bars) were quantified in TAK-754-treated animals and controls (n = 2) on day 63, confirming dose-dependent liver transduction. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).A tail-tip bleeding assay was used to assess the bleeding phenotype. Animals treated with buffer and TAK-754 at the lowest dose showed similar median blood loss normalized for body weights of 6.1 and 7.5 mg/g, respectively, corresponding to the undetectable FVIII activity in these animals (Figure 2B). The higher doses (1.2 × 1012 or 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg) of TAK-754 significantly reduced median blood loss to 0.6 and 0.4 mg/g, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001 compared to buffer). Statistical assessment of dose proportionality was precluded by the lack of FVIII activity at the low dose. At the end of the experiment, livers of animals with activities around the mean FVIII activity were selected from each group for quantification of vg and F8 RNA expression. The vg levels in the control group or the low-dose TAK-754 group were under the detection limit of the applied method. Mid- and high-dose animals showed robust and dose-dependent transduction as a function of vg in the liver (Figure 2C). F8 RNA levels were consistent with F8 DNA levels, except for two low-dose animals showing a measurable F8 transcript signal (i.e., within the limit of detection). The 2.5-fold dose increase from 1.2 × 1012 to 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in F8 gDNA levels and a 3.1-fold increase in F8 RNA levels (Figure 2C), which broadly mirrored the 3.2-fold increase in FVIII activity levels (Figure 2A).TAK-754-mediated long-term expression of FVIII The development of an antibody response directed against the human FVIII xenoprotein capable of neutralizing FVIII activity is a well-known phenomenon in mice.27 To enable a long-term expression study following the delivery of TAK-754, we employed a transgenic mouse model (huFVIII tg mice) that lacks detectable FVIII protein but usually shows immunological tolerance toward the human coagulation factor.28 huFVIII tg mice were injected with a TAK-754 dose of 3.1 × 1012 CP/kg and were monitored for FVIII activity and anti-drug antibodies from 2 to 24 weeks. The mean FVIII plasma activity ranged between 2.9 and 3.8 IU/mL throughout the observation period (Figure 3A). Three of 30 animals tested positive for anti-BDD-FVIII immunoglobulin-binding antibodies. In one of these three animals, the antibody response appeared to be transient, as it tested negative in week 24. One of the two persistent binding antibodies-positive animals also tested positive for FVIII inhibitory antibodies (data not shown). No treatment-related clinical symptoms or deaths were recorded. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Sustained FVIII expression following a single injection of TAK-754 (A) Long-term FVIII expression in a transgenic human FVIII mouse model. Following delivery of 3.1 × 1012 CP/kg of TAK-754 to huFVIII tg mice (n = 30), activity levels were stable between 2 and 24 weeks. Data are presented in box and whiskers plots, with the median indicated by a horizontal line and the mean represented by a cross. (B) Vector biodistribution. Wild-type C57Bl/6J mice were treated with a TAK-754 dose of 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg, and vector biodistribution was determined at three time points, including 3 days, 3 weeks, and 18 weeks (n = 20). Data are given in mean ± SEM; values <LLOQ were included as zero.Nonclinical safety evaluation and biodistribution study in hemostatically normal mice The toxicity of gene therapy candidate TAK-754 was examined in cohorts of male C57BL/6J mice receiving a single dose of TAK-754 at 2.0 × 1012, 3.8 × 1012, and 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg, and also at higher dose levels up to 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg (1.0 × 1013, 3.0 × 1013, and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg). The dose levels were selected based on the TAK-754 activity data shown in Figure 2A. The design of the toxicity study entailed subjecting cohorts of animals to a panel of analyses that included complete necropsies, pathological evaluation, biodistribution of vg, FVIII activity, FVIII antigen, binding anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, neutralizing anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, and binding anti-AAV8 antibodies at day 3, week 3, and week 18. During the study, there were no deaths and no adverse effects attributed to TAK-754 during the in-life phase, pathology, post-dosing observations, or any adverse TAK-754-related changes in clinical chemistry parameters, hematology, and coagulation parameters or urinalysis. The distribution of TAK-754 DNA was highest in the liver at all dose levels tested. TAK-754 distribution in liver and other tissues was dose related and was generally highest at the earliest time point, decreasing by day 21 (Figure 3B). However, TAK-754 DNA levels were still highest in liver tissues at this time point. Further decrease by day 126 is already diminished in the liver and skeletal muscle and not observed in lymph node and heart any longer. TAK-754 DNA levels in brain and testes samples harvested from TAK-754-treated animals were evaluated as negative or below the lower limit of assay quantification by week 18 in all animals. Representative data are shown from the 9.5 × 1012 CP/kg dose group (Figure 3B). Animals treated with TAK-754 had measurable amounts of human FVIII antigen in plasma from week 3, with levels in some mice already present from day 3. The observed decrease in FVIII antigen concentrations in individual animals was most likely a result of the formation of circulating anti-human BDD-FVIII binding antibodies, which can compete with the species-specific assay, resulting in nondetectable FVIII antigen. Such binding antibodies indeed formed over time and increased with dose, which is in line with a pharmacokinetic analysis where FVIII immunogenicity increased with initial high-level AAV-FVIII protein expression.29 TAK-754-treated animals also showed higher FVIII activity levels compared with the pre-treatment period, indicating that BDD-FVIII was expressed in these mice. However, some animals had even lower-than-normal FVIII levels most likely caused by the generation of neutralizing anti-human-BDD-FVIII antibodies that inhibited both human BDD-FVIII activity and endogenous mouse FVIII activity by virtue of the antibodies’ partial cross-reactivity against mouse FVIII. Neutralizing antibodies against BDD-FVIII became measurable by week 18 in all dose groups. As expected, all treated animals tested strongly positive for anti-AAV8 binding antibodies from week 3. In summary, toxicology experiments in mice receiving single intravenous (i.v.) TAK-754 injections at doses up to 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg found no evidence of TAK-754-related adverse effects during the in-life phase and no toxicologically relevant observations. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was 5.0 × 1013 cp/kg, the highest dose tested.Integration site analysis While host cell maintenance of rAAV vectors is largely accomplished through episomal DNA, residual chromosomal integration does occur. We therefore performed an integration site (IS) analysis of the TAK-754 vector in FVIII KO mice. Mice were treated with either 2.0 × 1012 or 1.0 × 1013 CP/kg TAK-754 and observed for 1 or 4 months (Figure 4). Liver transduction levels, determined by F8 qPCR, were dose dependent and comparable at both time points (Figure S4). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Vector integration site analysis Cumulative retrieval frequencies of top 10 cell clones in the livers of mice following injection of TAK-754 at (A) 2.0 × 1012 or (B) 1.0 × 1013 CP/kg. Samples with ID 1–4 and 10–13 were analyzed 1 month after treatment, those with ID 5–9 and 14–18 four months after treatment.Illumina sequencing of nonrestrictive (nr)linear amplification-mediated (LAM)-PCR products showed comparable numbers of average sequencing reads for both time points after vector administration (Table S2). A total of 227 unique exactly mappable ISs were detected in animals in both groups at 1 month after gene therapy treatment (5–54 unique ISs/mouse). Four months after treatment, 187 unique exactly mappable ISs were retrieved from both groups (5–42 unique ISs/mice), confirming an integration frequency of ≤0.01% (Table S2). The detection of identical top 10 ranking ISs in repetitive (nr)LAM-PCR amplicons was very low: one IS 1 month after treatment and 3 ISs detected in 2/6 (nr)LAM-PCRs after 4 months (Figure 4). This indicates that the unequal IS frequency profiles are due to the low number of events retrieved and that there are no signs for clonal skewing or clonal dominance in the treated animals. Only low-order (≤4) common ISs could be identified at both time points, which is in line with the low number of ISs detected after administration of TAK-754, correlating with an untargeted integration profile. None of the ISs were found in or next to genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation.30 In summary, the integration profile of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mouse liver showed a low but measurable level of integration, with no signs of potential side effects, and, at least within the 4-month observation period, no evidence for clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in oncogenes (i.e., HCC) was noted.Discussion Here, we describe preclinical development of TAK-754, an efficient human AAV vector for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, designed to express a human BDD-FVIII protein with an identical amino acid sequence to that of recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa.31 While the vector was designed and developed at a time before first clinical readouts from hemophilia A gene therapy trials became available, it does bear a couple of features that should allow efficient expression of the human F8 transgene in humans. TAK-754 vector design Choice of the AAV8 capsid was based on its preferential tropism for the liver as it demonstrates excellent transduction efficiency of hepatocytes in preclinical models32 and a number of liver-directed clinical gene therapy trials such as those for the treatment of hemophilia A and B or glycogen storage disease type 1A build on this capsid serotype.33 Numerous comparative studies over the last couple of years consolidated our comprehension of a species-dependent performance of vector capsids.34 It is now clear that AAV8 is particularly efficient in rodents; in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans, the capsid also preferentially targets hepatocytes but with an approximately 20-fold lower efficiency.35 This correlation factor needs to be considered when it comes to the deduction of a clinical starting dose from the nonclinical data package. Accordingly, a starting dose of 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector was selected for the first cohort, taking into account that a dose of 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg in FVIII KO mice resulted in a mean plasma FVIII activity of 1.9 IU/mL, translating into a projected clinical FVIII activity of ∼6% of normal. It is worth noting that the packaging capacity of recombinant AAV8 vectors can be pushed beyond the size of the WT genome of 4.7 kb.36 Consistently, we found that TAK-754’s vg was the correct size and intact, as judged by the absence of degradation bands. Packaging of similarly oversized BDD-FVIII expression cassettes using AAV537 and AAVrh838 led to aberrant, truncated genomes that first had to be re-assembled in transduced cells through recombination before functional FVIII could have been produced. The use of the strong yet compact mouse TTR promoter/enhancer combination enabled robust liver-specific gene expression. This promoter was selected from a variety of liver-specific promoters during preclinical development of the hemophilia B vector BAX33539 and came off well in a head-to-head comparison with other commonly used liver-specific promoters.40 The risk of relying on nonconserved murine transcription factor binding sites for a human gene therapy was mitigated by our demonstration of robust BDD-FVIII expression in the human liver HepG2 cell line upon transduction with TAK-754. Activity of the mouse TTR promoter/enhancer was also confirmed in the clinical trials for BAX33518 and SPK-8011,41 although in the latter case, a point-mutated promoter variant was used that has converted a weak hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) binding site into a moderately stronger one. Codon optimization of the BDD-F8 transgene initially relied on available codon-optimization algorithms. This approach resulted in sequences with improved expression but also greater GC content, in line with the understanding that this leads to higher mRNA levels and greater protein translation than gene sequences having greater AT content.42 However, this inadvertently introduced CpG clusters into the vector sequence, which function as PAMPs. These sequences can stimulate innate immune responses through signaling via TLRs, leading to an exaggerated adaptive immune response.22,43,44 TAK-754 candidate screening thus included a further filtering step that removed codon-optimized F8 sequences harboring potentially detrimental predicted CpG clusters.45 The lead candidate F8 nucleotide sequence (seq04) gave rise to a 74-fold increased expression in FVIII-KO mice compared to the corresponding WT sequence yet contains only 17 dispersed CpG motifs (Figures S2A and S2B). A further depletion of CpG motifs within the entire expression cassette, which may likewise be important for durable transgene expression,13 has not been carried out (Figure S2B).Preclinical evaluation of TAK-754 Overall, the vector showed a good efficacy and safety profile. Dose-dependent increases in mean plasma FVIII activity were obtained after single i.v. injections of TAK-754 in FVIII KO mice. The observed variability of FVIII expression (Figure 2A) appears to be a transgene-specific phenomenon. While FIX expression is associated with a low inter-species variability,46 that of BDD-FVIII is consistently higher and observed in mice and humans. Reports investigating the underlying mechanisms of inter-individual variability of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec) expression concluded that multiple host-mediated factors could contribute.47,48 Future endeavors to identify predictive biomarkers of response might lead to the development of approaches with optimized outcomes of AAV-based F8 gene therapies. A TAK-754-mediated dose response of FVIII activity was confirmed in a HepG2 cellular biopotency assay. Such an in vitro assay could allow replacement of the cumbersome in vivo lot release testing procedure, in line with the expectations and requirements of the authorities, which support the reduction and circumvention of animal experiments in the release of clinical batches, if applicable.49 Dose-dependent efficacy was observed in the tail tip bleeding assay in FVIII KO mice, and long-term expression could be demonstrated in a separate animal study using human FVIII transgenic mice, in which a single dose of 4 × 1012 CP/kg resulted in FVIII expression from week 2 until the end of the experiment (6 months), with no trend for a decline in FVIII activity. This mouse model, which was developed to mitigate the issue of anti-human FVIII antibody formation,28 served its purpose to monitor TAK-754-dependent long-term expression of human BDD-FVIII. While this model also allows comparative prediction of human immune responses elicited by human FVIII variants via repeated dosing of the respective recombinant proteins according to identical protein mass, this study setup could not be mirrored with a gene therapy vector. Due to the further absence of a gold standard vector regarding FVIII immunogenicity, we did not aim for conducting a comparative FVIII immunogenicity study with the TAK-754 vector. It is important to note that the model falls short in predicting the FVIII expression decline based on AAV vector immunogenicity, which is a phenomenon known to be largely absent from typical preclinical animal models. No toxicologically relevant effects related to TAK-754 were observed. Single bolus injections of TAK-754 administered to mice at doses of up to 5 × 1013 CP/kg occurred without deaths, adverse clinical signs, or post-dosing observations related to TAK-754. A limitation of the mouse safety study was its duration of 18 weeks, which precluded the detection of a potential relationship between FVIII expression and liver cancer/hyperplasia, which can occur at time points later than 1 year.50 The observed biodistribution of TAK-754 in treated FVIII KO mice confirmed the predominant detection of vector DNA in liver tissue, with minimal off-target gene expression in other tissues, consistent with the hepatic tropism of AAV8. Despite the known technical limitations of (nr)LAM-PCR, IS analyses further showed that vector integration was minimal (<0.01%). Within the 4-month observation period, there were also no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in or near genes previously implicated in HCC formation. While these data suggest that in humans TAK-754 will be maintained episomally and pose a low genotoxicity risk to patients, caution is needed since HCC-relevant loci are not well conserved between mice and humans,30 and the duration of the study was too short to observe any HCC concerns.Perspective The preclinical development program showed a good efficacy and safety profile for TAK-754 and formed the basis for defining the starting dose of 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg, factoring in the above-mentioned mouse-to-human correlation factor for AAV8. Despite these promising data, based on the gathered clinical experience with liver-directed AAV gene therapies over the last couple of years, it has turned out that vector immunogenicity in humans appears more critical than in rodents or NHPs.51 A successful translation of preclinical gene therapy programs into the clinic critically depends on the type and strength of the immune responses elicited against the very gene therapy vector in humans. In the case of TAK-754, while the safety profile was consistent with an AAV8-based gene therapy and all four enrolled patients in the clinical trial (this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03370172) showed dose-dependent peak FVIII activity 4 to 9 weeks after infusion (cohort 1: 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 3.8% and 11%, respectively; cohort 2: 6.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 54.7% and 69.4%, respectively), the initial vector-derived FVIII expression steadily declined despite the use of corticosteroids.52 The comprehensive analysis of immune components in the peripheral blood of the patients did not reveal the presence of inhibitory anti-FVIII antibodies or any obvious signs of an exaggerated immune response.53 It is worth mentioning in this context that NHPs as a nonrodent species were excluded from preclinical safety testing mainly because of technical challenges such as the naturally high AAV8 infection rate in monkey populations.54,55 Since an AAV vector-induced immune response leading to an abrupt or gradual loss in FVIII expression has not been observed in NHPs,56 such a study would also likely have failed to reveal an issue with the TAK-754 vector already in preclinical stage. A comparison with Valoctocogene roxaparvovec and other clinical-stage hemophilia AAV vectors (Table 1) suggests that rather subtle yet not fully understood differences in the vector design determine the success or failure of a therapy.13 Several AAV-based hemophilia A gene therapy clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov also counted on AAV8, whereas other programs use different capsids, including AAV5, AAV6, LK03, and AAVhu37, with potential differences in their tropism or transduction efficiency. Ranking these capsids in terms of performance in humans is, however, difficult since all these vectors differ also in expression cassette design and manufacturing process employed. Clinical head-to-head comparisons of vectors differing only in the capsid serotype are lacking and would be difficult to conduct for various reasons such as cross-reactivity of anti-AAV antibodies against a broad range of serotypes.

With regard to the expression cassettes, all vector products rely on liver-specific promoter/enhancer combinations, with SPK8011 even using the same mouse TTR promoter, albeit with a point mutation in the HNF3 binding site reported to moderately increase transcription.41 The SPK8011 cassette is unique in harboring a short synthetic intron, which is likely to further improve transgene expression. All but two (GO-8 and ASC618) transgenes were designed to express recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa,31 although different algorithms for codon optimization were likely used, which may substantially affect expression efficiency. No relevant differences in expression levels are expected from the poly(A) elements, all of which are short and synthetic in nature. From the publicly available data, it appears that not all codon-optimized BDD-F8 transgene cDNAs have been depleted for CpG motifs (Table 1). Whether the remaining 17 CpG motifs in TAK-754 caused a more pronounced vector-mediated immune response compared to that of SPK8011 (0 CpG) or Valoctocogene roxaparvovec (3 CpGs) is difficult to evaluate, but it seems unlikely as they are dispersed and do not form a CpG cluster.45 Both the design of the expression cassette as well as the clinical data available so far suggest that SPK8011 is the most efficient vector, enabling expression of BDD-FVIII at a dose that falls within the tolerated capsid immune response window. At the same time, however, it transpired over the last several years that FVIII expression should be kept at a moderate level so as to avoid an unfolded protein response in the transduced cells, leading to a decline in FVIII activity.13,57 Efforts to optimize AAV-based F8 gene therapy should therefore focus on bioengineered FVIII constructs with a lower propensity to misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum,58,59 accompanied by target tissue-specific analysis and development of improved preclinical immunogenicity models, which in turn will increase the field’s understanding of the key features that make up an effective gene therapy product for hemophilia A.Materials and methods AAV expression cassettes and vector production For candidate screening, codon-optimized cDNAs encoding the amino acid sequence identical to recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa-type BDD-FVIII31 were used to generate AAV expression cassettes that were composed of flanking AAV2-derived ITRs, a liver-specific TTR promoter/enhancer,60 the respective BDD-F8 transgene, and a synthetic polyadenylation site.61 Recombinant ssAAV8 vectors were produced in suspension HEK293 cells using a triple plasmid transfection protocol as described.62 Titers of AAV vectors were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or ELISA, reported in vg/mL or CP/mL, respectively.vg titer determination Vector genomes were quantified by qPCR targeting the AAV2 ITR sequence as described.63 Sample preparation prior to PCR included treatment of vector solutions with DNAseI, followed by a Proteinase K step to release the AAV genome from the capsid. A final restriction enzyme digest with SmaI was performed to resolve AAV ITR T-shape structures.AAV titer determination by ELISA The commercially available ELISA (Progen AAV8 titration ELISA kit) contains a monoclonal antibody (ADK8) specific for a conformational epitope on assembled AAV8 capsids. The AAV8 capsid concentration was determined photometrically using plate-immobilized biotinylated anti-AAV8 antibodies.Vector DNA integrity assay The integrity of the vg was analyzed by AAV agarose gel electrophoresis performed as described.64 Briefly, 1.5 × 1010 vg/lane were electrophoresed in agarose gels, which were then stained in 2× GelRed solution (Biotium) and imaged.SDS-PAGE and silver staining SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining was performed according to standard procedures. Each lane contained 1.0 × 1010 vg of the respective viral construct and was separated on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE Novex, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Silver staining was performed with a SilverQuest kit (Novex, Thermo Fisher Scientific).Animals All animal experiments were approved by the relevant authorities on animal experiments and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The experiments were performed with male mice only. Three different strains were used: hemostatically normal C57BL/6J mice (Charles River Laboratories) for the Good Laboratory Practice toxicity study according to International Conference on Harmonization S6, FVIII KO mice (B6; 129S4-F8tm2Kaz; E17 KO)65 for short-term biopotency and efficacy studies, where animals with an immune response against the human FVIII xenoprotein were excluded from further evaluation, and hFVIII transgenic mice28 for the long-term expression study. In the latter strain, the murine F8 gene is knocked out, but it also expresses human FVIII mRNA transcripts in multiple tissues from transgenic human F8 cDNA while lacking detectable circulating FVIII protein.Vector administration TAK-754 was administered with 0.01% human serum albumin to mice aged 8–11 weeks via manual injection into the lateral caudal vein (tail). A dose volume of 10 mL/kg was used, and individual dose volumes were based on the individual body weight. An infusion rate of approximately 2 mL/min was used.Blood sampling Immediately prior to blood collection, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane. We collected 250-μL blood samples via puncture of the retro-orbital plexus. At the end of the in-life phase, an additional and terminal cardiac blood sample (0.8 mL) was collected from anesthetized animals. All blood samples were collected directly in citrate anticoagulants and processed by centrifugation within 15 min.Detection of hF8 DNA or RNA in mouse organs Genomic DNA (gDNA) or total RNA was extracted from mouse livers using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) or the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), respectively, following the manufacturer’s protocol for animal tissues. gDNA was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA Broad-Range Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase (TURBO DNA-free Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). F8-transgene copy numbers in both gDNA and cDNA samples were determined by qPCR. The nucleotide sequences of the primers and probe used are the following: forward primer 5′-TCATGGACACCCTGCCT-3′; reverse primer 5′-GAGAAGTGGATGGAGTGAATGT-3′; probe 5′-6-FAM-ACCTGCTTTCTATGGGCTCCAATGAG-MGB-3′. PCR reactions were carried out on the QuantStudio 7 Flex PCR platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR data analysis was performed using the specific device’s software that automatically calculates the F8 copies per reaction based on the linear regression parameters of the standard curve. In vivo FVIII biopotency assay FVIII activity in plasma was determined using a commercial FVIII chromogenic assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (COATEST SP4 FVIII; catalog no. 82409463, Chromagenix). Results are given in IU FVIII/mL, derived from a reference curve generated with an in-house FVIII reference, calibrated against the World Health Organization standard.FVIII antigen assay Human FVIII antigen levels in mouse plasma were analyzed by commercial ELISA (Asserachrom VIII:Ag Kit; Diagnostica Stago) per the manufacturer’s manual.Tail tip bleeding assay The efficacy of TAK-754 was determined by measuring the total blood loss in mice,66 whereby animals were anesthetized (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, intraperitoneally) and 2 mm of the tail tip was cut off. Blood was collected over an observation period of 60 min; blood loss was measured gravimetrically. In vitro biopotency assay TAK-754 biopotency was assessed in vitro using the human hepatic cell line HepG2.46 After treatment of cells with 2 mM hydroxyurea for 22 h, the cells were infected with AAV8-FVIII vectors in F17 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10 μg/mL von Willebrand factor (Baxalta) and 5 μM 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-Amiloride (Sigma). During incubation (96 h), FVIII was expressed and released into the cell supernatant. FVIII activity was determined by chromogenic endpoint measurement, as described for the in vivo FVIII biopotency assay. A reference curve of AAV8-FVIII vector material was based on AAV8-ELISA titer.Neutralizing BDD-FVIII antibody assay The analysis was based on the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay.67 Briefly, the test sample was mixed with a test base (containing BDD-rFVIII), and the loss in FVIII activity upon incubation was measured. The relative loss in activity is correlated to the inhibitor concentration in the sample; results are reported in Bethesda units per milliliter.Safety evaluation and biodistribution study in hemostatically normal mice Assessment of toxicity was based on clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, and clinical and anatomic pathology evaluations. Complete necropsies were performed on five animals from each cohort, with macroscopic abnormalities for all tissues, organ weights, and microscopic examinations recorded. Tissues were collected for biodistribution assessment from a further five animals from each cohort. Blood was collected pre-dose and at necropsy (n = 5) for FVIII activity, FVIII Ag, binding anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, neutralizing anti-BDD-FVIII antibodies, and binding anti-AAV8 antibodies.Vector IS analysis We used 25 mg of AAV-treated liver tissues for fully automated DNA isolation using Qiagen spin columns on the QIAcube robotic system. Vector copy numbers were determined by vector-specific qPCR. ISs were analyzed using (nr) and standard LAM-PCR,68 which identifies genomic sequences flanking the integrated AAV vector DNA. (nr)LAM-PCR amplicons were sequenced after sample preparation on a MiSeq instrument. Data were processed by (semi-) automated bioinformatics data mining.Statistical methods Graphs and statistical analyses were created with GraphPad Prism 6 software. Student’s t test, one-way or two-way ANOVA, followed by Holm-Sidak post hoc test was used for the statistical analysis as appropriate.

CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab–Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.INTRODUCTION Abs are heterodimers composed of H and L chains (1). The rearrangements of three different gene segments, the variable (V) gene segment, the diversity (D) gene segment (H chain only), and the joining (J) gene segment forms the variable regions of the Ab (1, 2). Abs play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response, protecting the host from a variety of challenges. The collection of Abs within a host, known as the Ab repertoire, must be highly diverse to bind a wide variety of Ags (3). CDR3 contributes the most to both the Ab repertoire diversity and binding specificity in the Ab repertoire (4). CDR3 is composed of the 3’ region of the V-gene segment, the D-gene segment (H chain only), and the J-gene segment. The process of organizing these gene segments into a functional unit is called VDJ rearrangement. Our group studies the effects of space on the host response, with a focus on the Ab repertoire. We have shown that spaceflight alone (5) does not affect the overall Ab repertoire and that a physiological model of microgravity, antiorthostatic suspension (AOS), affects the Ab repertoire after vaccination in both the spleen and bone marrow (6, 7). Other works have shown that changes to V-gene segment usage in Pleurodeles waltl after five months aboard the International Space Station (8–11). Diversity, or the lack thereof, in the Ab repertoire can be generated through multiple steps in VDJ rearrangement. Research shows that there is genetic control over the high-level usage of specific gene segments, but individual CDR3 repertoires are highly variable (11–14). Previous work shows that variations in recombination signal sequences, which are the sequences beside the gene segment that regulate recombination, may lead to differential usage of a specific gene segment in the repertoire (15). Additionally, locations of gene segments on the genome also play a role in gene segment selection in humans with more 3’ D-gene segments pairing more commonly with more 5’ J-gene segments and more 5’ D-gene segments pairing with more 3’ J-gene segments (15). After the gene segments are spliced, additional nucleotides, called N or P nucleotides, are added at the junction between gene segments. P nucleotides are palindromic and complete the overhangs made during exonuclease cuts in the genome (16). N nucleotides are random nucleotides added by TdT (16). In the mouse repertoire, P nucleotides are more common than N nucleotides and help drive diversity (15). An immune response to an Ag (pathogen) is an adaptation. Likewise, responding to changes in gravitational forces also requires adaptation. Our group has had the opportunity to examine the Ab repertories in C57BL/6 mice after a number of different situations. These data allowed us a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that Ab diversity can be altered by physiological adaptation. That is, spaceflight, simulated spaceflight, and/or immune responses are disruptions in stable environment and affect Ab diversity. To test this hypothesis, we will present an analysis of Ab diversity, as expressed by CDR3 amino acids, in four experiments and five datasets we have generated using analyses frequently used to assess communities in ecological contexts, specifically the Shannon index (SI), an established measure of diversity (17). The higher the SI, the more diversity the community. Immunologically, repertoire diversity is essential to maintain a healthy adaptive immune system. Theoretically, if an individual has a diverse Ab repertoire, there are more possibilities of productive responses to more Ags. Therefore, diversity measurements of the Ab repertoire are relevant to understanding host fitness (as defined immunologically and ecologically). For example, work by Greiff et al. (12, 18) has shown that diversity measures can determine if an animal was vaccinated or unvaccinated.MATERIALS AND METHODS Five different datasets from four experiments were used in the analyses presented in this article (Tables I, II). We acknowledge that these data have been presented previously (Tables I, II), but, to our knowledge, the analyses and comparisons presented in this paper are novel and not duplication. TABLE I.

BM and spleens were both sequenced in 18 total animals. BM, bone marrow; RIN, RNA integrity number. Normal mouse—spleen RNA extraction Tissue extraction was performed as previously described (19). Briefly, to create three independent sample pools, RNA was extracted from the spleens of four 9–11-wk-old, female, specific pathogen–free, C57BL/6J mice. A total of 12 animals were used to create three pools, each containing four animals. Animals were euthanized by exposure to 400 μl of isoflurane on a gauze pad in a histopathology cassette, as described by Huerkamp et al. (20). Mice had ad libitum access to LabDiet 5001 and water in standard group caging. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kansas State University. Spleen tissues were harvested after euthanasia and processed immediately for RNA extraction with TRIzol LS per the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal concentrations of RNA from each mouse were pooled and submitted for sequencing. These data are publicly available at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-141/.Center for the Advancement of Science in Space—spleen RNA extraction RNA was extracted as previously described (5, 21). Briefly, RNA was extracted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center using the RNeasy mini-column from the spleens of 35-wk-old, female C57BL/6Tac mice. Mice were housed either aboard the International Space Station via the SpaceX Crew-4 launch or in the International Space Station simulator on Earth. After collection, spleens were stored at 4°C in RNAlater for at least 24 h and then transferred to −80°C. Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center. These data are publicly available at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-164/.Tetanus Ab response developed in space—spleen and bone marrow RNA extraction Suspensions, immunizations, and RNA extractions were performed as described previously (6, 7). Briefly, 10-wk-old, C57BL/6J, female mice were placed in AOS, resulting in hindlimb unloading. Hindlimb unloading is a physiological model of microgravity (22, 23). Half of the animals were unloaded, and half were control animals that were also placed in AOS restraints but were fully weight bearing on their hind limbs. All animals were singly housed because of AOS requirements. Eight treatment groups were established, each containing 10 animals, with half of the animals being loading and half unloaded. The i.p. injections were performed after 2 wk in AOS housing with saline only, tetanus toxoid (TT; Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) only, CpG oligonucleotide 1826 only (CpG1826) (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), and TT + CpG1826. TT injections contained 5 limes flocculation dose per milliliter of TT, and 0.1 ml was injected. CpG1826 injections contained 0.4 mg/ml CpG1826, and 0.1 ml was injected. TT + CpG1826 animals were injected with 0.2 ml total volume. Mice were returned to AOS housing for 2 wk, after which the mice were euthanized with 100% CO2. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Loma Linda University, and the euthanasia met requirements put forth by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Whole spleens were removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Bone marrow was flushed from the femur and tibia from each animal with a 1:3 ratio of RNAlater/RNAse-free PBS. Samples were centrifuged at ~250 × g for 5 min at room temperature, the supernatant discarded, and the pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA extraction was performed for both tissues using TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and total RNA was submitted for sequencing. These data are publicly available for spleen (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-201/) and bone marrow (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-214/)Hypervaccination—pooled spleen and bone marrow RNA extraction Eight-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were received from The Jackson Laboratory and allowed to acclimate at the Laboratory Animal Care Services facility at Kansas State University. Mice were fed food (LabDiet 5001) and water ad libitum. After 2 wk, mice were injected via the i.p. route with 0.1 ml of 0.4 mg/ml CpG1826 and 0.1 ml of 5 limes flocculation dose per milliliter of TT. The CpG1826 and TT sources and lots used in this study are the same as those used in the tetanus Ab response developed in space (TARDIS) experiment. Mice were returned to standard housing, and injections were repeated twice more every 2–3 wk for a total of three injections. Animals were euthanized as described for the normal mouse spleens. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kansas State University. Whole spleens were removed and homogenized using a 70-μM sieve to create a single-cell suspension. Bone marrow from the same animal was flushed with cold RNAse-free PBS and also homogenized using a 70-μM sieve, resulting in a single suspension containing the spleen and bone marrow cells from a single animal. Cells were pelleted at 350 × g and resuspended using 5 ml of ice-cold ammonium–chloride–potassium lysing buffer (155 nM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 0.1 mM EDTA) to lyse the RBCs. After 5 min, 10 ml of ice-cold isotonic medium was added to the cells. They were centrifuged at 350 × g and the supernatant discarded. Cells were incubated with TT-coated magnetic beads per manufacturer’s instructions. The magnetic Dynabeads were coated with 26 μl of 5 FL/ml TT per manufacturer’s instructions. After incubation, the beads were added to 0.8 ml TRIzol and 10 μl of 20 mg/ml glycogen for RNA extraction. Extraction was performed per manufacturer’s instructions. No cellular phenotyping was performed because of low recovery rates and prioritization of RNA extraction. This experiment is included as a positive control in anticipation that the hyperimmunization would skew the repertoire.Sequencing For all datasets, Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility performed sequencing as previously described (5–7, 19). Briefly, total RNA was size selected (275–800 nt) and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq at 2 × 300. Libraries were prepared using the standard Illumina library preparation except that of a 1-min fragmentation time to result in longer reads.Bioinformatics Bioinformatics processes were performed as previously described (5–7, 19). Briefly, sequences were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench and cleaned for quality. Sequences were mapped to C57BL/6 V-gene segments and the IgH loci, and the resultant reads were submitted to ImMunoGenTic’s High-V Quest for identification. CDR3 amino acid sequences are defined as the amino acid junction column in the ImMunoGenTic results. V-J combinations were determined by identifying reads in which only one C57BL/6 specific V-gene and J-gene segment were detected for a specific CDR3. CDR3s with multiple V-gene segments were not included in the analysis.Statistics and figures Rank-abundance curves were generated for CDR3s comprising an abundance of over 0.01 in the repertoire. Abundance was calculated as the count of the unique CDR3 divided by the total count of CDR3s detected. Rank was assigned as the most common CDR3 being equal to one. The SI was calculated using the vegan package (version 2.5–6) in RStudio (version 1.1463). Graphs and charts were created in GraphPad (version 8.4.3). Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated in Python 3.7.4 using sklearn 0.21.3 and visualized with seaborn 0.9.0. Paired t tests, t tests, and three-way ANOVAs were performed in RStudio (version 1.1463).RESULTS The baseline splenic repertoire To characterize the baseline Ab repertoire of C57BL6/J mice, we sequenced three pools, each containing equal amounts of RNA from the spleens of four different female mice (Tables I, II) (19). The relative abundance of detected CDR3s was characterized. A rank-abundance curve (Fig. 1A) was generated and showed similar initial abundances for all three normal mouse spleen pools. The SIs were 7.28, 7.39, and 7.68 for normal mouse pools 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Fig. 1B). FIGURE 1. Rank abundance and SI in the baseline Ab repertoire. Open in a new tab (A) Rank-abundance curve for pooled spleen samples. Each normal mouse pool is one replicate comprised of four pooled spleens. (B) SI for pooled spleen samples. Each normal mouse pool (NM) is one replicate comprised of four pooled spleens.Effect of spaceflight on Ab repertoire diversity To determine how spaceflight affected the CDR3 distribution, we determined the rank abundance of normal C57BL6/Tac mice (referred to as Center for the Advancement of Science in Space [CASIS] mice) that were flown in space for a period of 21–22 d (5). Three individual CASIS animals were subjected to spaceflight and compared with normal controls (Fig. 2A) for the rank abundance of individual CDR3s. When the ground and flight animals were averaged by treatment, the resulting rank-abundance curves were nearly identical (Fig. 2B), with one CDR3 being the most abundant. A comparison of the SIs revealed no significant difference between ground and flight animals. However, there was a trend toward a lower SI, and thus, less diversity was evident in flight animals (t test, p = 0.1138; Fig. 2C). FIGURE 2. Rank abundance and SI in spaceflight animals. Open in a new tab (A) Rank abundances for individual animals flown aboard the International Space Station (n = 1). (B) Rank abundances for averaged ground and flight animals (n = 3 per group). (C) Average + SEM SIs for ground and flight animals (n = 3 per group).Comparison of Ab repertoire diversity in a physiological model of microgravity and spaceflight The third comparison that we made included mice that were subjected to AOS (TARDIS experiment), their restraint, loaded controls (6, 7), and the CASIS mice. When we compared the SIs of the CASIS ground control mice (n = 3) and the TARDIS loaded controls that were treated only with saline (n = 4) (Fig. 3); there was no significant difference (t test, p = 0.1201), but there was a trend toward lower diversity in the CASIS animals. This trend was also evident in the CASIS flight (n = 3) versus AOS unloaded saline control (n = 4) animals (t test, p = 0.0859; Fig. 3). However, an assessment of the overall SI combining experimental (flight or AOS) and ground (or unloaded controls) in both experiments revealed that the CASIS animals (n = 6) had an overall lower SI (t test, p = 0.0004) than the AOS animals (n = 32) (Fig. 3). FIGURE 3. Comparison of SI in animals in the CASIS (spaceflight) and TARDIS (modeled microgravity) experiments. Open in a new tab Average + SEM SIs for animals housed on Earth (CASIS ground, n = 3) or loaded control animals (TARDIS ground, n = 4) and animals aboard the International Space Station (CASIS flight, n = 3) or suspended control animals (TARDIS flight, n = 4). The overall comparisons comprise all animals in the CASIS (n = 6) and TARDIS (n = 32) experiments. ***p < 0.001.Effect of AOS, TT immunization, and a CpG1826 adjuvant on Ab repertoire diversity in the spleen To understand the effects of AOS, TT, and CpG1826 on the Ab repertoire, we generated rank-abundance curves for CDR3s from the TARDIS (6) mice from the treatment groups by collapsing the data by main effect (n = 16 per treatment group, AOS, TT, or CpG1826) (Fig. 4A). No significant differences were found between treated and untreated animals (t test, p > 0.05) in any of the comparisons, although trends for higher abundance in rank one CDR3s were detected for TT-treated mice (p = 0.0571). A comparison of SIs also showed no significant differences between treated and untreated animals (three-way ANOVA, p > 0.05; Fig. 4B). Unloading did not affect the diversity of the TT− or TT + CpG1826–treated animals (three-way ANOVA, p > 0.05; Fig. 4C). FIGURE 4. Rank abundance and SI in the spleen of TARDIS animals.

(C) Average + SEM SI of the effect of AOS on TT and TT + CpG1826 animals (n = 4 per group)Effect of AOS, TT immunization, and a CpG1826 adjuvant on Ab repertoire diversity in the bone marrow Rank-abundance curves were generated for CDR3s identified in the bone marrow (7) of the same mice used for spleen cell determinations in the TARDIS experiment described above (Fig. 5A). Collapsing data by main effect (AOS, TT, and CpG1826 treatment) (n = 12 per treatment group) yielded no significant differences between treated and untreated animals for any of the groups (t test, p > 0.05). Animals treated with TT had significantly lower (three-way ANOVA, p = 0.0137; Fig. 5B) SIs and thus lower diversity, but AOS and CpG1826 treatments did not affect the SI (three-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). A three-way interaction for AOS × TT × ANOVA, CpG1826 was also detected (three-way p = 0.0442; data not shown), but unloading did not affect the diversity of the TT− or TT + CpG1826–treated animals (three-way ANOVA, p > 0.05; Fig. 5C).

A rank-abundance curve of representative animals in each of the treatment groups is presented (Fig. 6A). The bone marrow was significantly less diverse (Fig. 6B) than the spleens of the same animals (paired t test, p < 0.0001). FIGURE 6.

Open in a new tab (A) Rank abundance of a representative sample from each treatment group receiving TT in both tissues (n = 1 per group). (B) SI of spleen and bone marrow repertoires in the same animals. Bone marrow SI was significantly lower than spleen, p < 0.001.Comparison of hypervaccinated animals to primary only animals To isolate the anti-TT–specific response, magnetic beads coated in TT were used to isolate TT-binding cells from the spleen and bone marrow from two animals (Fig. 7A). The abundance of the rank one CDR3 in pool 2 was over 11 times higher than pool 1 and over 6.5 times higher than pool 3. No differences in SIs were found between the hypervaccinated data and the unloaded TARDIS spleen (t test, p = 0.4346) and the TARDIS bone marrow (t test, p = 0.2000) (Fig. 7B). FIGURE 7. Rank abundance and SI in hypervaccinated animals. Open in a new tab (A) Rank-abundance curve for pooled spleen samples.

Each pool is one replicate comprised of two pooled spleens and bone marrow extracts from the same animal.PCA of CDR3 counts across studies We were fortunate to be able to examine the CDR3 repertoire in large numbers of animals subjected to various treatment protocols. We probed our data to identify principal components driving the impact on CDR3 present in the TARDIS mouse spleen (Fig. 8A), TARDIS bone marrow (Fig. 8B), and CASIS (Fig. 8C) animals. We also assessed all experiments used in this article (Fig. 8D). However, no clustering or significant principal components emerged from the PCA analyses. FIGURE 8. PCA of CDR3 counts across studies.

PCA of all experiments (n = 68).Similarity of V/J pairing for a single CDR3 amino acid sequence When we assessed CDR3s present in the repertoires of all animals included in our experiments, we noted that a single CDR3 (CARGAYW) was found in every animal spleen dataset (CASIS and TARDIS). It was selected for V/J combinations analysis. The CARGAYW CDR3 sequence was also identified in 15 of the 24 bone marrow samples. One V/J combination, V1–80/J3, was involved in an overwhelming percentage, 77.4%, of V/J combinations detected (Fig. 9A). V1–80/J2 was responsible for 14.6% of the combinations detected, and V1–80/J4 resulted in 6.1% of the combinations found. All other detected V/J combinations (38 unique combinations) were found in <0.5% of the Ab sequences that we detected. FIGURE 9. V/J pairing in a single CDR amino acid sequence. Open in a new tab Each bar represents a single mouse. Each color represents a unique V/J combination. (A) V/J combinations for the CARGAYW CDR3. Black represents V1–80/J3, and light gray represents V1–80/J2. (B) V/J combinations for the CARDSN-WYFDVW CDR3. Black represents V9–3/J1.We also looked at a longer CDR3, CARDSNWYFDVW, which was the second most common CDR3 that was detected in every spleen animal. It was also detected in 4 of the 24 bone marrow samples. This CDR3 was highly predominated by the V9–3/J1 combination comprising 99.9% of the combinations detected (Fig. 9B). V3–5/J1, V1–22/J1, and V9–1/J1 were each detected once for 0.04% of combinations.DISCUSSION Our results demonstrated that subtle alterations in Ab repertoire diversity occur in response to experimental and environmental challenges. Statistical methods commonly used in the ecology field have been used by other groups to assess Ab repertoires, although often with a larger scale view (24, 25). Some have been able to determine immunological status by examining diversity (26). Estimated hypothetical total diversity is estimated to be ~1 × 10140 total unique CDR3 sequences (18). However, the functional diversity is much more highly restricted to around 1 × 1013 to ~1 × 1018 because of the V-, D-, and J-gene segments that create the CDR3 backbone (12, 27) and because mice only have ~1 × 108 B cells, many of the potential CDR3s are never seen in the repertoire (15). Saada et al. (28) estimated that whereas 35 × 106 large pre–B cells enter mitosis each day, only around 3 × 106 B cells survive selection. Our study examines a total of 1,173,166 unique Ab sequences arising from 44 individual and 18 pooled animals across four experiments. In our unamplified individual mouse spleen samplings, there is an average of ~3000 unique CDR3s that are not found in any other mouse. This might translate to ~30,000 unique CDR3s if we assume we are assessing 10% of the repertoire or 300,000 unique CDR3s if that amplification is only 1% of the repertoire compared with what we might see if we amplified the sequencing. Given that mice have 1 × 108 total B cells, unique B cells account for ~0.3–0.03% of the repertoire, based on CDR3 capture. Our results contrast other estimations (12) of shared naive B cells at 11–13%. Therefore, our data suggest that there is more sharing of repertoires than previously estimated. We have established a baseline SI for the spleen between 7.28 and 7.68. However, it is essential to remember that these numbers were generated from pooled samples in an effort to normalize the reading. Our previous work showed that the pooled normal mouse V-gene segment usage was similar between pools (R2 = 0.5842–0.8427), but CDR3 sequences showed an overlap of only 75 CDR3s found in all three groups (19). We also detected a pattern in the rank-abundance curves for each pool. One predominant CDR3 comprised the highest rank, and abundance quickly dropped as rank increased, demonstrating that the population was highly skewed. The highest CDR3 in each pool was unique with CARGAYW, CASVYDG-YAFAYW, and CASYDFDYW for pools 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We also explored the effects of spaceflight alone on diversity in the Ab repertoire. Although T cell repertoires have been examined during spaceflight (29), little research exists examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire. We found no statistical difference between SIs for ground and flight animals, but a trend (p = 0.1138) toward lower diversity in the flight animals was detected. The animals used in this experiment were older (35 wk at flight), and a different strain (C57BL/6Tac) than used in the other experiments that were analyzed in this paper. Additionally, the flight was relatively short, with only 3 wk in microgravity. Age is known to affect the Ab repertoire by reducing diversity (30, 31) and other works have shown that aged humans respond poorly to vaccinations (32). Aging decreases B and T cell regeneration rates (33). Because the half-life of a B cell in the spleen is between 4 and 7 wk (34), a longer flight time may strengthen the lower diversity trend we noticed. The sample size was also small because these data were obtained as a secondary science objective from an initial validation flight (21) and a larger sample size may provide more information regarding this trend. The CASIS and TARDIS spleen datasets provided us a unique situation to directly compare spaceflight data to the AOS model of microgravity using the same bioinformatics methodology. Although the sequencing and bioinformatics methodology was the same, the mouse strain (C57BL/6Tac, CASIS flight; C57BL/6J, TARDIS model), age (35 wk, flight; 9 wk, model), tissue preservation (RNAlater, flight; snap frozen, model), and RNA extraction (RNeasy, flight; TRIzol, model) were all different. These differences mean that a direct comparison is less than ideal, but given the relative scarcity of data from flight animals, the comparison is nonetheless valuable. We found that the control animals (CASIS ground and TARDIS loaded) and experimental animals (CASIS flight and TARDIS unloaded) were not statistically different. However, when the complete CASIS dataset was compared with the complete TARDIS dataset, we found that the CASIS animals had significantly lower SIs. Although our total read counts were similar between the two experiments (CASIS, 66,909–181,703; TARDIS average, 82,655–109,107) (5, 6), the low number of samples in the CASIS dataset (n = 6) compared with the TARDIS dataset (n = 32) is more likely to be skewed by a single low diversity mouse. Additionally, the increased age of the CASIS mice and may also contribute to their overall lower SIs, as mentioned above. In our TARDIS dataset, we explored the effects of AOS, TT, and CpG1826 treatment on the spleen and bone marrow. In the spleen we found no differences in SIs among treatment groups. This included no impact on diversity in TT− or TT + CpG1826-treated mice. However, there was a trend for a higher abundance of the rank one splenic CDR3 in TT-treated animals (p = 0.0571). In the bone marrow, only TT-treated animals showed a reduced diversity SIs. Unloading again did not affect TT− or TT + CpG1826–treated animals. Both the higher abundance rank one CDR3s and the lower diversity are indicative of the TT-specific response. As the repertoire narrows to focus on responding to the Ag, the total number of unique CDR3s is likely to decrease, decreasing overall diversity. Greiff et al. (12) have also demonstrated that the Ag-specific response is higher in plasma cells in the bone marrow than the spleen. We were also able to compare CDR3 usage in the spleen directly to the bone marrow of the same animals in our TARDIS dataset. We found that the bone marrow had lower diversity than the spleen for all animals. This could be because the populations of cells in the bone marrow are less diverse because they are memory populations waiting to respond to agonists (35, 36). Splenic and circulating B cells may be more diverse because they are less experienced. Alternatively, previous studies have shown that V-gene segment usage by naive B cells in the spleen and pre–B cells in the bone marrow are strongly influenced by the genetic background of the animal, whereas the plasma cells are a mostly individual variation (12). Our workflow does not allow us to identify the cells that make up our population. However, this individual variation may not explain the consistent lower SIs in the bone marrow samples of all 18 of the mice examined. To assess the anti-TT–specific response, we used TT-coated magnetic beads to isolate TT-binding cells from the spleen and bone marrow of hypervaccinated mice. One pool of mice, pool 2, showed an extreme response with the result that almost 17% of the repertoire is composed of one CDR3, CASYSNFDYW. Interestingly, this CDR3 is predominately composed of an IgM response, rather than the anticipated IgG response (data not shown). Although these data are from the pooling of two animals, the high repertoire percentage likely arose in a single animal. However, we found no difference in the TT-specific repertoire SIs as compared with the TARDIS TT + CpG1826 spleen or bone marrow. It has been previously established by multiple works (37–41) that the anti-TT response is very broad and highly specific, which may contribute to our overall detected diversity even when focusing on the Ag-specific response. It is also not unprecedented for memory IgM responses to occur (42). Given our large number of datasets and experiments, we attempted to isolate patterns in CDR3 usage by treatment, experiment, tissue, or other variables. The PCA revealed no patterns either within or across experiments. This lack of pattern is likely due to the highly individualized nature of CDR3 generation (11–14). We have previously reported that when comparing CDR3s across the eight treatment groups in the TARDIS spleen data, over 90% of CDR3s were found in only one treatment group (n = 4). Even very-high-frequency CDR3 are at low frequency in other animals or treatment groups and, in some cases, not detected at all (6, 7). We also explored diversity in V-gene segment and J-gene segment usage in two high-frequency public clones. The first public clone explored was CARGAYW. This CDR3 was found in CASIS and TARDIS spleen animals and 15 of the 24 TARDIS bone marrow samples. Although CARGAYW occurred at very high counts (3598) in some animals, it occurred at much lower counts (6) in others. This is consistent with previous data published by Greif et al. (18) showing that public clones have variable frequencies. One specific V/J combination, V1–80/J2, was the predominant combination, with over 77% of the CDR3s formed from these two gene segments. V1–80/J2 (14.6%) and V1–80/J4 (6.1%) also contributed to the pairings. All other combinations (38) were found in <0.5% of the sequences. Interestingly, our previous work has shown that V1–80 is one of the most commonly used V-gene segments in the mouse repertoire (19). In comparison, when we examined a longer CDR3, CARDSNWYFDVW, one combination (V9–3/J1) comprised 99.9% of combinations detected. The identification of the three other combinations (V3–5/J1, V1–22/J1, and V9–1/J1) may be the result of sequencing errors. Given the longer CDR3, it is less likely that multiple combinations could result in the same amino acid sequence. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that changes in Ab repertoire diversity are detectable using next-generation sequencing data exploring CDR3 usage. We have demonstrated that trends or significant reduction in diversity occur in response to hindlimb suspension and TT vaccination in the bone marrow. A reduced diversity is also found in the bone marrow as compared with the spleen. However, comparisons of the anti-TT repertoire to the overall repertoire of the spleen and bone marrow revealed no differences in SIs. We also were not able to detect CDR3 signatures by experiment, treatment, or tissue. We examined the V/J combinations for two common public CDR3s and found more variation in V/J pairing in the shorter CDR3 when compared with the longer CDR3. Finally, from this large multidata, we observe that there is significant individual-to-individual CDR3 uniqueness. These data suggest that an animal’s Ab repertoire is quite unique, even in a highly inbred animal. Evolutionarily, this makes sense and maximizes the possibility that the unique repertoire will allow survival against the widest array of pathogens. This is not a new concept, but these data help to support that hypothesis. Additional sequences will be needed to solidify the hypotheses generated from our analyses.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr. Alina Akhunova, Director of the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility, for sharing knowledge and dedication to our project.
